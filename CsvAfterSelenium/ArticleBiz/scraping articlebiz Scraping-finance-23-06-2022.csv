2,How Tax-Free life Insurance Can Supplement Retirement,finance," IRA’s and 401k’s are important investment strategies for saving and accumulating wealth, but they can cause a lot of headaches after retirement. For starters, there is only an eleven-year window for which people can withdraw from their retirement accounts without penalty. If someone withdraws too early (before the age of 59 1/2), they will face a 10% penalty. If they withdraw too late (after age 70 1/2), they will face a 50%  penalty. Even when people begin to take distributions from their IRA or 401K within the penalty-free window, they will still lose almost one-third of it to taxes. Additionally, many people may find themselves in a higher tax bracket after retirement because they are no longer receiving the same tax deductions they received while working. Their children are grown, so there are no more dependent deductions. Their business write-offs are also gone, and they are no longer contributing to their IRA or 401k to get a pre-tax reduction in income. This not only leads to a sizable chunk of their income going to taxes, it also puts them at risk of running out of retirement money. For example, if someone in a 25-30% tax bracket wants to earn a net annual income of $50,000 after retirement, they would need to withdraw $65,000 to offset the 30% they'd have to pay in taxes. If this person starts off with $500,000 in their retirement account and a 10% interest rate, they will run out of money in less than 10 years. However, It is not recommended that people put more money into these retirement vehicles beyond what their employer matches. Instead, they should invest their extra money into a permanent life insurance policy. A permanent life insurance policy gives people access to various tax-free benefits such as tax-free growth, tax-free access via loans, and tax-free wealth transfer, all of which are compliant with Internal Revenue Codes and tax laws. This level of liquidity would give people control over their own money and allow them to use it in any way they see fit. It is safe and protected from market losses, and it provides a rate of return that can outpace inflation. Unlike IRA's and 401k's, there is no contribution limit. So, people can contribute as much as they’d like to their policy, and the money will continue to grow uninterrupted, earning compound interest even if they borrow against the policy using tax-free loans. More importantly, it provides the supplemental retired income people need and deserve. In order to achieve the best results from a permanent life insurance policy, working with an appropriately trained agent is imperative. That's why working with Rancho Cucamonga Life Insurance is the right choice for anyone who qualifies for life insurance. Every insurance agent at Rancho Cucamonga Life Insurance has received extensive training in maximally funded and properly structured policies, to ensure that optimal results are achieved with every client."
3,What is a Structured Settlement Annuity?,finance," What is a Structured Settlement Annuity? A structured settlement annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company to fund the payment of damages for personal injury over a period of time. It is sometimes referred to as an insurance settlement. It guarantees you or, in the event of your death, your beneficiary a tax-free payment or a series of payments over a fixed period of time. In some cases, the payments are life contingent meaning they are only paid during your lifetime. Most structured settlements are the result of a lawsuit. Structured Settlement Annuity Can You Sell Just Some of Your Structured Settlement Payments or Do You Have to Sell Them All? You can sell some or all or just a portion of your payments. You decide what is best for your financial needs. If you only sell only a portion of your payments your insurance company will continue to pay the unsold portion to you as and when they are due.

4,Are you in Rat Race?,finance," Are you in the Rat Race? Have you ever asked yourself this question? I believe maybe not. Here I am providing you with the ins and outs of it. What is the Rat Race? A usual scene in our society is that Highly or average educated parents give some thought to  his/her children visiting school, getting good marks, and getting an honest job. These are the items taught to children to achieve success. But the importance of cash and the way  to be financially intelligent get neglected in both school and society. Getting good marks, Getting good job are the core thoughts of the best a part of the population. Employment holder does his/her job during a specific day to day, and a selected period of time, He or She gets only a selected weekend to require rest. Not having enough knowledge, They fall into a financial crisis in terms of fulfilling needs. Mainly this part only works hard for money for their whole life. They just run here to there to solve their financial issues. This happens from generation to generation. What is known as the “Rat Race”. How to get out of this “Rat Race”? The solution may be rounding in your mind. Try to guess  what can be the solution to it! Knowing about “Accounting and Investing” is the solution to it. What we were not taught in school and college. How to get good marks, then how to get  a high paying job was learned.  What makes one poor are Fear and Ignorance, nor the Government, the Rich. People struggle between fear and ignorance. Investment is such a thing which occurs as a part of Income earned. Most of the average people  just spend what they earn without thinking about investment. Hearing the word Investment, we just go to think about a large sum of money. But it doesn’t make sense, you can create a great one by investing a little every month. To get one out of this circle, one should know about the rules of generating money. There are three types of Income source: Active Income( Work hard for money) Passive Income( Have money work for you) Portfolio Income( Investment) We just work hard for money, but don’t know how to have money work for us. We can create such wonderful sources of Income without doing work actively such as making courses, writing books, making content, doing investment. To be financially strong, one should create more assets than liability. Creating assets means to pay yourself first it means to set aside a portion of income first to buy assets and invest in securities. To create assets, Expense should be lessened. Then, Investment, Assets have money work for you."
5,Think Due Diligence Before Acknowledging That Loan Offer,finance," Are you an entrepreneur intending to apply for a business loan to boost your capital? If yes, do you intend to carry out your due diligence before executing the acceptance column on the offer letter?....., Of course, you should. I know that the news of your loan approval is exciting. However, it is my humble advice that you familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions of the loan as contained in the offer letter before endorsing your acceptance on the acceptance column. From my research and work experience on this subject matter, it is now obvious that why borrowers default on loans, sometimes, even after a restructuring/rebooking of the loan facility, is due to failure to carry out due diligence and lack of appreciation of the terms of the loan and their implications. Like every other contract, loan agreements become binding upon execution by parties. This means that the terms and conditions of the loan crystalizes, which in effect, occasions rights and obligations on the party entitled and/or obligated, respectively. Here are some of the key things to note when assessing a loan: the lending rate of your preferred lending institution; the applicable interest rate and lending fees; the applicable penal rate, in the event the loan or any interest due and payable therefrom remain unliquidated at the end of the tenor; charges that are chargeable on a one-off basis and those that are recurrent; and ascertain that the business venture you intend to plough the loan into will yield profit and in time too, to service the loan. Also, note that interest rates and lending fees are generally negotiable. So, endeavour to have a bite on negotiation. Although, it is duly noted that lending institutions dominate loan arrangements, and may not want to shift ground on the applicable interest rate and lending fees. It is also true that lending institutions are constantly looking for viable business ventures to invest in for profit. So, your job as a borrower is to convince your lender that you are a creditworthy businessman with a viable business venture capable of generating revenue short term. If you can establish this fact, then, the likelihood of reduced lending fees and charges is high. After disbursement of the loan facility, keep up with deductions made on the loan account as repayment of the principal sum and interest due and payable to ensure that the proper interest rate is applied on the loan. If you observe at any time that a different interest rate or charge is applied on the loan. Please, swiftly lodge a complaint with the lending institution to ratify the same. Where the lending institution persists in this unfair practice, the door of the Consumer Protection Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is open to receiving such complaints as the regulator of banks and other associated financial institutions. The application of excessive interest rates and arbitrary charges by lending institutions has been identified as the major cause of the non-performance of loan facilities by unsuspecting borrowers. This unfair practice implies that the financial obligations of the borrower are fraudulently reviewed upward without his/her consent. The heart-breaking aspect of this antic is that a borrower who is not properly advised will be unduly coerced by the lending institution to perform the contract. On this note, the next time you intend to assess that loan, endeavour to carry out your due diligence. And if you think the legal jargons and figures contained in the offer letter are way beyond your appreciation, kindly engage a lawyer to advise you on the legal implications of the terms and conditions of the loan, and an accountant or auditor to advise you on the figures with its attendant monetary implications. I humbly think it will be in your best interest to employ the necessary professional services for a humble fee than to liquidate your indebtedness through your nose and/or forfeit the collateral used in securitizing the loan. Do you also consider the mental and psychological trauma that is associated with being tagged a debtor?"
6,Three great cTrader features,finance," Are you sick of looking at an outdated MT4 platform? Do you feel limited by what online social trading platforms like TradingView have to offer?

Traders commonly overlook the need to understand their performance statistics. Yet performance tracking is critical to fine tuning your trading performance."
7,Is Now the Time to Consider a Buy-to-Let Property Investment?,finance," Sky-high fuel bills and record inflation have hit UK households hard. For many, now simply is not the time to be considering major purchases and investments. As making ends meet becomes a real struggle across the UK, would-be investors are putting their plans on hold for the time being at least. Meanwhile, the UK’s buy-to-let property market is performing on a level not seen for several years. Even in the face of fewer tax incentives and higher costs for landlords, the private rental sector remains a comparatively safe haven for property investments. But does this mean that now is the right time for first-time investors to buy into the booming BTL property market? Is taking the plunge today advisable, or would it be better to wait out the current uncertainty and see what the coming years bring? A Fast-Paced, Highly Competitive Sector You need only look at the growth the UK’s private renting sector has achieved over recent years to understand its appeal. Since 2017, the sector’s total combined value has increased by a huge £239 billion. Research suggests that as of 2022, the BTL sector is now worth in excess of £1.7 trillion. Despite these recent hurdles, UK property investors appear undaunted. Since 2017 the value of the buy-to-let sector has risen by around £239 billion to reach £1.7 trillion, according to new research. “There have been many challenges that have subdued investment into the private rented sector over the past few years,” commented Stephen Clark of bridging finance company Finbri “But the sector has proved resilient, and we have seen continued demand for finance in this vibrant part of the economy.” If anything, economic uncertainty has only served as a catalyst for the BTL market’s performance. Even during the height of the pandemic, average house prices in the UK continued to skyrocket. From March 2020 to December 2021, the average market value of a home in the UK increased by 16%. Figures which suggest that come what may, buying into the UK’s property market almost always translates to significant capital gains long-term. Lenders Welcome BTL Investors Qualifying for a conventional mortgage from a mainstream lender has become increasingly difficult. By contrast, many lenders are throwing their doors open to new and established BTL landlords in a way not seen in some time. Last year alone, the number of specialist mortgage products available for buy-to-let investments rose from 1,311 up to 2,235. Meanwhile, average five-year fixed interest rates have been hovering around the same 3.5%, falling slightly to 3.47% in February this year. “The BTL sector has faced its share of upheaval and changes to regulations and requirements, so it is highly encouraging to see that providers are still keen to attract first-time landlords,” said Eleanor Williams on behalf of Moneyfacts. All of which paints a picture of a BTL sector that is not just profitable, but also surprisingly accessible. With house prices and monthly rents set to continue rising across the UK indefinitely, now could indeed be the time to consider buying into the country’s booming BTL property market."
8,How To Apply For Bankruptcy Online In The UK,finance," Anyone declaring bankruptcy in the UK must now apply online instead of directly to the court. In this article, we explain how the online application process works and offer some useful tips to help you complete it. Getting started You start your bankruptcy application at the Government’s official website. You’ll need to set up an online account using your name, email address and three security questions. You’ll then be sent a 12-digit application number which you can use to log into your application at any time, so you don’t need to complete everything in one go. What to expect The first thing you’ll see when you set up your account is the Application Overview page. This is divided into 8 sections: Personal details Employment Bank accounts and savings Assets Money you owe Income and expenses Legal proceedings Debt history Providing the information You can’t look at the next section until you’ve completed the previous one, so you can’t see what details you need to provide in advance. We suggest gathering the following information before you start, to help you complete your application as quickly as possible: •	National Insurance number. •	Employment information including wage and salary details, and/or details of any self-employed activities within the last 3 years. •	Bank and building society account details and balances for all accounts held within the last 2 years. •	Information on your current assets and any you’ve disposed of within the last 5 years. This can get quite complicated, but you’ll generally need to provide information on anything you own that’s worth over £500. E.g. property, cars, antiques, furniture etc. You’ll also need to list any pending compensation and legal claims; interests in any wills and trusts; stocks, shares and investments; business assets; and any money you’re owed. •	Letters and statements from creditors and debt collection agencies, including information about any legal action being taken against you. •	Information about your monthly income and outgoings. For income, this includes benefits, tax credits, wage or salary payments, pension income and so on. Outgoings can be more difficult as everyone’s expenses vary from month to month. Have all your monthly and quarterly bills to hand, and use your bank and card statements to work out other costs, such as food, fuel and clothes. •	Details of any ongoing legal claims, or proceedings such as divorce that have occurred within the last 5 years. •	Information about any debt solutions you’ve used in the last 5 years, such as Debt Management or an IVA. This includes any previous bankruptcies. What happens next? Once you’ve completed all the required information and paid your bankruptcy fees (which can now be paid in instalments), you can submit your application. It will be reviewed by the Adjudicator’s Office, who’ll contact you if they need any more information. You should get a response within a few days. You’ll be told about the Adjudicator’s decision by email. If your Bankruptcy Order has gone ahead, you can view it by logging into your online account. Hints and tips •	If you don’t have a computer, there’s normally one you can use at your local library for a small fee. •	If you can’t afford bankruptcy fees, you may be able to apply for a grant at the Turn2us website. •	Do your best to provide full, honest and accurate information. It’s a criminal offence to withhold or knowingly provide false information on a bankruptcy application, which includes concealing assets. •	However, there may be some details you can’t provide, such as the exact date you opened a bank account. Just be as accurate as you can. •	Don’t worry if you genuinely forget to include some of your debts. These will all be covered by your Bankruptcy Order once it’s made. We suggest you get a copy of your credit record which should list most of your debts and will also show any that have been sold to debt collection agencies. •	When listing personal possessions, don’t include items you can use that are owned by someone else. For example, a car you’re insured on that’s owned by your partner. •	Make a note of any grey areas you’re not sure about, or any information you realise you should have provided after your application has been submitted. You can discuss these details with the Official Receiver in your interview after your Bankruptcy Order has been made."
9,How to convert fiat to crypto,finance," To enter the cryptoworld you first need to exchange fiat to crypto. How and why to do this, we will consider in our article. Why to buy crypto with fiat money? There are two main reasons: Many companies are implementing crypto payment gateways to be able to accept payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular assets. Why? Because no bank will provide such fast and cheap transactions as in the case of cryptocurrency. In addition, bank payments are often a target for hacker attacks, and in the case of cryptocurrency, the risk is minimal. If a few years ago users were wondering where they could pay with their crypto assets, today there is no such question in one’s mind. For example, the same Bitcoin can be spent on products, electronics, furniture, clothing, and even on 18+ entertainment. Cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile asset, on the growth of which you can make good money. The stock results of this financial instrument are amazing. Those who invested in Bitcoin at the beginning of its existence are probably millionaires now. Of course, it is difficult to repeat such success, but it is quite possible to earn a tidy sum. Just open the price chart of the same Bitcoin and you will see that every year it breaks new price records. For example, in 2021, the all-time high was updated and the price of one Bitcoin reached an incredible $68,789. After such a takeoff, the price naturally adjusts and falls (in this case to $35,000). History, as they say, is cyclical and Bitcoin has to repeat its journey more than once, each time breaking new records. In this case, we gave an example of the main cryptocurrency, but you can invest not only in Bitcoin. In the next section, we will consider which coins are worth buying. How to choose the best coin? The previous section described two main reasons why it is worth buying cryptocurrency. By considering these two reasons we can highlight the best coins. To choose the best cryptocurrency one should pay attention to those 3 metrics: Speed of transactions. Generally cryptocurrencies are transferred within seconds, however some of them might require more time. Fees or gas. Nobody loves paying fees, but paying more fees than others is even worse. To save your assets and keep transactions fast enough – always pay attention to the fees. Volatility of the asset. We all know that cryptocurrencies are volatile, but each coin has its own volatility index. If you are looking for a beneficial investment opportunity – high volatility index is what you are need. However if you require a stable payment solution, stark price fluctuations are not going to suit you. In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the kings of the crypto market, the following coins can be distinguished: Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin is a popular and proven means of payment. More than 3,100 companies around the world are ready to accept Litecoin as a payment method. No wonder, because the coin was created to become a “Light” version of Bitcoin. Transactions in the Litecoin network are carried out extremely quickly and with minimal fees. In addition, LTC is one of the most liquid assets on the market. It is also one of the most popular means of payment. Litecoin is accepted for payment by companies such as 1xBit, Travala, Snel, RE/MAX, and others. Solana (SOL) The Solana cryptocurrency was originally created with a mission to solve the problem of scalability, which is inherent in most blockchains. The project operates on an innovative Proof of History consensus algorithm, thanks to which the current throughput of the blockchain is more than 60,000 transactions per second. More than 400 companies (data taken from Cryptwerk) accept Solana as a payment method. All this is thanks to lightning-fast transactions and micro fees. In addition, thanks to the combination of PoS and PoH consensus algorithms, Solana is not only one of the fastest, but also the most secure blockchains. Tether (USDT) The high volatility of crypto assets often scares users away, but with the advent of stablecoins, this issue disappears. USDT stablecoin is the most popular and widespread in the crypto market. And one USDT coin is equal to one US Dollar, so you can easily and conveniently pay for goods and services of more than 1,700 merchants around the world. This payment method is much superior to fiat. You don’t have to pay huge bank fees, it’s faster and much safer. Tether is accepted for payment by companies such as Time magazine, Alternative Airlines, STAX, Paxful, and many others. Nano (XNO) Nano (XNO) is an innovative cryptocurrency that allows you to make instant payments with zero fees. It is for this reason that Nano is so popular. The developers have tried to ensure that Nano has become the most convenient and affordable means of payment. If with other cryptocurrencies you still have to pay a small fee, then with Nano transactions are carried out instantly and absolutely free of charge. Nano provides the best payment experience and embodies the whole idea of digital currency — no fuss, no fees, no waiting. In addition, this cryptocurrency is ideal for micropayments. Dogecoin (DOGE) Besides the fact that Dogecoin is a fast and cheap payment tool, it also has a multimillion army of fans. Its dedicated community actively promotes DOGE as a means of payment. And Dogecoin is widely accepted by both online and brick-and-mortar merchants. Having started a long time ago as just a joke, today DOGE is one of the most stable and successful cryptocurrencies. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk supports the coin. And DOGE is actively used in the payment, investment, and charity spheres. This is only a part of the many cryptocurrencies that are ideal for making payments or international transfers. When choosing your perfect payment cryptocurrency, you should focus on such indicators as fees, speed, and prevalence as a means of payment. As mentioned earlier, cryptocurrency can serve not only as a means of payment, but also as a profitable investment tool. The main rule of a successful investor is buy on the bottom, sell on the high. The list of crypto assets worth investing in is quite extensive. We will give only a few examples of those coins that can bring a good profit in the near future. Ethereum (ETH) This cryptocurrency has long been included in the top of the best crypto assets for investing. In 2021, Ethereum proved its importance twice and updated it’s all-time high. Why is it worth investing in Ethereum right now? Because in the near future, Ethereum blockchain will switch to a new consensus algorithm that will allow Ethereum to work faster, cheaper, and smoother. These factors will undoubtedly affect the price of the cryptocurrency. Binance Coin (BNB) This cryptocurrency is the brainchild of the most popular and successful crypto exchange Binance. It is in unprecedented demand among traders and investors. In addition, with the launch of the VISA card, the quotes of the BNB cryptocurrency will definitely increase. Over the past year, the coin has updated its price maximum several times. And quickly broke into the top five leaders of the crypto market. And this, judging by the bullish mood of experts, is far from the end. Cardano (ADA) This is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, which consistently ranks in the top 10 according to CoinMarketCap. Compared to other leaders, the coin is not expensive, but it shows itself very well in the market. To date, Cardano is the main competitor of Ethereum, which is only planning to switch to the PoS algorithm. In addition, with the launch of the Alonzo update, the Cardano blockchain is now able to support work with smart contracts and decentralized applications.

10,2022 Energy crisis and failure to connect Reality.,finance," Gasoline is not that expensive. One would argue that right now with prices in the United States as the highest ever. According to AAA the average regular gas price nationally is currently $4.31. Now, surprisingly this is lower than the $4.32 posted yesterday. This is the grade of fuel that cars made 2001 and older must use. Personally, I drive a car from 2000, I get 27 MPG, and usually am happy with that. Just so we have a reference that is $.15 a mile. The gas prices one year ago would have brought that down to $.10 That is a 50% increase in one year. That means when a low to medium income household budgets for gas, they now must increase that by 50%. Now we get to the meat of this issue. Taxes, the same issue our forefathers threw tea into a harbor. The issue that started the American Revolution. These taxes were levied on luxuries like molasses and tea. The molasses tax was $2 a gallon, and the tea tax was $8 a pound. Now that is a lot for back then, that is an equivalent to a 47% increase to green tea today, and a 18% increase on our basic bottle of molasses. Something similar to the gas price increase in the modern era. The current Federal gas tax is $.18/gallon and the average state tax on gas is $.30/gallon. Let that sink in. That’s not even counting the diesel tax which is higher in both. I have not studied the economic repercussions, but as an emergency act, one we have seen all too much recently, we could relieve the gas tax, to ease economic downturn. We have seen markets correct recently amid upheaval; this could help the American economy recover during the immediate emergency. Relieving the tax would leave us at $3.836 per gallon to bring us down to pre-2016 levels. This would relieve about $162 million dollars unneeded taxes on the American people. Now I ask you. Does $162 million sound like a lot anymore? When trillions and billions of tax money are given away, we must realize what is necessary, and what is socialist spending that is no longer viable with China chasing on our heels of GDP growth. As of November 15, 2021, we have $4.6 Billion tied up for “Energy community revitalization program”. This program buried under a mountain bureaucracy, is for the repurposing oil wells on federal land. So, if we have $4.6 billion set up to pump oil from Federal land, why are we short on oil? Why are we setting aside 28 times the yearly tax income from gas to revitalize oil wells that are not running? Right now, the Biden administration has no answers to high gas prices. Americans are paying 1.5 times what they were last year at the pump. Putin is making deals with China, and Europe is running out of petroleum. The world is in an energy crisis and Biden makes sure that his people are getting 11% pay raises. This must stop if our economy will ever recover."
11,Monthly Financial Meetings: Here’s Why They Matter,finance," Would you zoom through a roadtrip without stopping to take a breather and make sure you aren't straying off course? Of course not! Chances are, your pit stops include glancing at your GPS, analyzing your progress, and maybe even checking your vehicle to make sure everything is still functioning. You might notice your tank is almost empty and add some more fuel, or maybe reevaluate your route to see if there is a more strategic way to get to your destination. So when it comes to your business - and more specifically, your financials - why do you continue speeding through, without taking the necessary time to ensure that your team is still effective and on track? Here at Blueprint CFO, we believe that monthly financial meetings are a key element to the success of a company's Profitability Roadmap process. Here's why. Just as you wouldn't want to embark on a major trip without checking your GPS to make sure you didn't enter in the wrong location, establishing regular checkpoints to ensure accounting accuracy is critical to your company's profitability. Monthly financial meetings are a useful time to sit down with your financial team and address any outlying data points that need to be checked for accuracy. In addition to checking the legitimacy of everything that is on the table, monthly financial meetings are also a great time to make sure there isn't any financial information being left off the table altogether. By establishing a regular touchpoint to review and refine your accounting team's work, you can have peace of mind as a leader, knowing that your strategy is based on comprehensive, accurate, timely data that truly reflects where your business stands. Not only do monthly financial meetings encourage you as a leader to sit down and touch base on the data that drives your business, it also encourages your accounting team to return to their core responsibility: maintaining accountability throughout your business. After all, as we've shared in the past, there is no accountability without great accounting. Beyond establishing accountability in the form of accuracy, monthly financial meetings also drive your accounting team to start thinking strategically. As your accounting team collects and reviews your company's data, they can bring a new perspective to the table by going beyond the reporting stage, analyzing trends, and identifying areas of improvement that might be overseen at the executive level. By calling on your accounting team to bring any relevant notes, insights and observations to the table at your monthly financial meetings, you will develop an organizational culture that truly prioritizes great accounting - not just great financial reporting. By bringing accounting & finance stakeholders together across all levels of your organization through your monthly financial meetings, you have an opportunity as a leader to help your team members feel more connected to your company's strategic vision. By developing touchpoints for two-way communication and collaboration, your accounting team will understand that they are so much more than the ""number crunchers."" Rather, they will understand how their work helps move the needle forward, and how their role connects to the business's strategic Profitability Roadmap, and overall growth."
12,Weimar America?,finance," You've no doubt seen the picture of a man in Germany, during the Weimar Republic, pushing a whole cart of money, just to make a purchase. The caption read: wheelbarrows replaced wallets. That's the effect of hyperinflation. Something that we are skating dangerously close to right now. In any well-functioning economy, the supply of goods and services roughly equals the demand for those goods and services. So, prices are stable. And everything that we want to purchase, is readily available to us. That's the story of Modern America. Generally, we can run to the store to buy anything we need. And for years now, prices have held stable. Remember that 2% inflation that held for so long? But yesterday, we saw that's changing. Reported yesterday was a horrific 7.9% inflation rate, the worst in 40 years. So what's happening here? Let's take an in-depth look. So, as I say if supply and demand in an economy are roughly equal, then prices will remain stable. But inflation starts when one side or the other of that equation gets out of whack. In modern America, it is almost always the case that demand rises, while supply takes a while to catch up. Causing inflation. In a sense, we can call this a kind of “good” inflation. In that, it's saying that people's incomes are rising, and they want more of those goods and services. Not something that we like to see. But something that is at least reasonably manageable. We turn to the Fed to raise interest rates. Making the cost of borrowing for those credit cards more expensive. And that's usually enough to tamp down those “animal spirits” as an old Fed Chairman liked to say. But that's not at all what's happening today. Today people are not feeling rich. They don't feel like going down to the store and purchasing the latest electronic gadget. Not at all. Today we're just coming off the biggest economic lock-down of all time. People are just emerging from the full effects of the Pandemic. So, if it's not excessive demand that's creating this inflation. Then we need to look at the supply side of the equation. And here, there is a nearly perfect historic model, for what we're now going through. The place is Germany, and the time is: just after the end of World War One. During the decade of the 1920s, Germany will experience first inflation and latter hyperinflation. Inflation is totally out of control. This period is known as the period of the Weimar Republic, the government that was in power at the time. Now many will look at the cause of inflation during this time as the excessive amount of War Reparations that Germany had to pay to the victorious Allies after the War. And that's true. But there was another factor at work here. One which I believe had at least equal influence in causing Wiemar Inflation. And that was something called the Passive Resistance. German Industry Workers went on strike. Protesting the Allied Reparations and their control of local factories. Industrial goods declined to near zero. No matter how much you were willing to pay, you couldn't get those products. The Weimar Economy went completely out of balance. Prices rocketed higher. Inflation that had seldom been seen. But this inflation was not from excessive demand. But inflation from lack of supply, shortages. To make a long story short. The Allies relaxed their reparations payments gave control of those factories back to the Germans. German workers went back to work. Factories went online. And within just a couple of years, the inflation in Germany was gone. Ok, so that's Germany a hundred years ago. Let's look at the driving force behind American inflation today. From my perspective, it is the same as in the Weimar Republic: shortages. But today's shortages are driven by Government Policy. Let's go back to President Obama. During his administration, shortage, generally in the name of environmental protection, became the US Policy. You may remember Obama declaring that he would necessarily bankrupt the coal mines. And thereby drive the price of electricity higher. A sentiment that was endorsed by then-candidate Joe Biden in the last election. More recently this policy of shortage has been writ large, by now President Biden's oil policies. First canceling federal leases for additional drilling. Then canceling pipelines. And now cutting off 10% of American oil supply, with the boycott of Russian oil. It's all a policy of shortage. And as we saw yesterday, it is having a very predictable effect on higher inflation. Will we get to the stage of hyperinflation that happened in the Weimar Republic? I really don't know. It depends, I suppose, just how long these policies are in place. But I do know that hyperinflation is a very real possibility. Currently, there are two countries in the G20, the largest economies in the world who are experiencing hyperinflation. Both Turkey and Argentina have inflation rates above 50%. The good news is that as soon as Germany began their production lines, inflation almost immediately began to subside. Will Joe Biden learn this lesson of history? We can only pray. PS Yesterday we saw the highest inflation reading since 1982, at 7.9%. As we noted this is inflation driven by a lack of supply. This country is both literally and figuratively out of gas. Now the President argues that the hike in gas prices is due to the conflict in Ukraine. As a technical matter, I disagree because that conflict didn't start until almost the end of February. And those numbers won't show up until next month. But that's not the critical factor here. The critical point is that we are out of gas. If the gas station down the street goes out of business, you don't quibble over the owners' politics. You find another gas station. Your car has to run, after all. You need supply. But not a word of that from this President. Creating additional gas supplies appears not to be part of his overall thinking. Now rumor has it that the President has gone to his “friends' the Saudis, Venezuela, and perhaps even Iran. And all have turned a cold shoulder to our President. It's a hard lesson that we're all going to suffer through. But perhaps now, we can tell Mr. Biden and his green friends just why we need to produce our own. These high prices tell me that shortages and gas rationing are coming soon."

14,Tie Up Your Financial Loose Ends! The Importance of Managing High-Interest Loans,finance," Are high-interest loans leaving you on a never-ending spiral? Strategic business growth begins with well-managed financials, and managing your loans is no exception. While paying off loans can be a source of great stress for many business owners, tying up your financial loose ends can mean the difference between endlessly owing money to your lenders, and elevating your company to the next level. The question is this: are your accounting systems and processes up to standard? If not, chances are you are paying much more on loans than you should be. Our team at Blueprint CFO can help! Here is one example. When the Blueprint CFO began working with a local building supplies contractor client, the firm had three outstanding loans: Loan #1 (40% APR), Loan #2 (55% APR), and Loan #3 (25% APR). Because the firm had to make weekly payments on these loans, they had continued cash flow issues. The company also found themselves in a Catch-22, stuck in a never-ending cycle of acquiring loans — with even higher rates — to pay off the previous loans. There seemed to be no end in sight. In auditing our client’s financials, the Blueprint CFO team found that the company’s books weren’t properly prepared, which led them to experience a number of issues, including their loan-related predicament. While the company utilized Quickbooks Desktop to issue invoices and bills, the firm did not have a cohesive record of its expenses, assets, equipment rentals, etc. Moreover, their bank accounts had not been reconciled for three years. The Blueprint CFO team responded to this in a number of ways. First, we improved automation and created an up-to-date view of relevant data by transferring the company’s numbers from Quickbooks Desktop to Quickbooks Online. This allowed our client to have a clearer view of their records so we could work towards a new financial strategy — one that would truly lead to growth and profitability. We then built high-integrity financial statements and records, which increased bank confidence in the company. This led to acquiring a loan from a Regional Bank with a LIBOR rate of + 2%, interest-free for the first year. As a result, the company could pay off all outstanding loans, saving them $150,000 in 2021 interest expenses. With their new financials, our client also now qualifies to apply for their PPP loan payoff as well as the new California Grant. All in all, our rockstar accounting team at Blueprint CFO was able to rebuild the client’s books and reconcile their bank and credit card accounts, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of savings. We can help you do the same! With our signature Profitability Roadmap formula, our all-star team of accountants at Blueprint CFO can help you make sure you have the systems and processes in place to set your business up for success."
15,Highly Profitable Import Export Business Ideas,finance," It doesn’t matter what product you are trading with, you will always look for better ideas to make your import-export business profitable. Here we are going to share a few simple tips to take your business to the next level with less effort and less investment. Choose the Right Import-Export Sourcing Agent If you are importing goods, then you need to find direct suppliers or producers, so you can get the product in bulk with discounts. Also, if possible, you can visit the supplier’s warehouses to check their products to make sure whether it will meet your customers’ demands or not. Or else, you can ask them to send the POP (Proof of Products) by providing Bank Comfort Letter (BCL MT799). Decide Your Payment Term Before you start dealing with your supplier, you both need to discuss and decide the Payment Term for the supplied goods. As you are dealing with an overseas supplier, you need to find out the payment term which will secure your trade transactions from all trading risks involved including – shipping, currency fluctuations, and supplier’s default in shipping the goods, after receiving the payment. In today’s trade market, importers are using Letter of Credit, as their payment term, as it gives assurance to both buyers and suppliers. Letter of Credit not only secures your import-export transaction from trading risks but also it helps importers to import goods from suppliers at zero upfront. By using Documentary Credit as the payment term, the buyer’s bank assures the supplier that the buyer will make the payment once the goods are shipped to the destination port. Keep the Required Documents Handy Needless to say, keep all the required documents like Quality Certificate, Health Inspection Certificate, Bill of Lading &, etc. Also, while importing goods, insurance of the goods is a must. Accidents may occur, as nothing is predictable in shipping, (either Ocean or Road or by Air), so, if something mishaps, then it can be easily covered by insuring each shipment. Is an Import-Export Business Profitable? Absolutely, Yes! Import Export can be profitable, but make sure not to invest all your eggs in a single basket. To run your import-export business, you can get assistance from your bank to get Trade Finance Support in terms of Import LC or SBLC issuance. So, there will be no need for you to invest your working capital in a single deal. In case, if you don’t have enough bank facilities to get Trade Finance support from your bank, then you can get help from Trade Finance Providers from private institutions, who will lend their bank facilities on behalf of your company to support your import-export deal. If you’re new to the import-export market but serious to learn Global Trade & Trade Finance, stay tuned with us to get up-to-date market trends!"

17,How should a young person invest money?,finance," As a new graduate, the first thing you should do is to lock down as much money as possible in savings. When I graduated and got my first job, I immediately bought my dream car - a new Mustang GT convertible. Not the best of my financial decision ;-). Although I fixed the rest of my financial budget, this one was too tempting for me to resist. This is the thing you have to guard against: avoid the temptation to splurge. Everybody fantasies about having a monetarily safe life. I for one don't know about any individual who really needs or anticipates being poor, isn't that right? It's simply unfortunate cash propensities, an absence of fundamental cash abilities and having no defined objectives that makes and keeps individuals in a poor monetary state. You'll enjoy a tremendous benefit of building a significant retirement fund assuming you become monetarily shrewd. You should simply learn and rehearse a couple of establishing long term financial stability methods. Make a point to give these to your kids. It will mean the universe of contrast to your kids' future on the off chance that you show them the accompanying standards as soon as could really be expected: The appropriate way to invest money will vary depending on each individual's unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. However, some general tips for young investors include: Start saving as early as possible. The earlier you start saving, the more time your money will have to grow. Invest in a variety of assets. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) can help reduce your overall risk exposure. Keep expenses low. It's important to be mindful of the fees associated with your investment products. What you should instead do, live like a student a little longer. The first 2 years after graduation is when you should try to secure your financial future. Unless you manage your savings, it is hard to manage your investments. If you are a single person just out of graduation, your goal should be to save half of your 12 lakhs in the bank. You should have enough bank savings to last 6 months of your monthly expenditure. Keep this in a fixed deposit. Once you are tight enough to manage this, proceed to the next step. Start with balanced mutual funds that are fairly less risky. Get your toes in the water through these. Here is a list of balanced funds in India: Best Balanced Mutual Funds in India. Also use: Value Research Online By now, you should have figured out what mutual funds are, what SIP is and other basics in investing. In the next step, start playing with equity funds. In the early stages of your career you goal should be hold more than 50% of your investment in equity funds. As you grow older, move a part of the investments to bonds/bank savings. In summary, the first rule of investing is to save. Unless you have sizable money to invest, your above-market returns would not matter. Once you have built your safety net, go after mutual funds and then to equity funds/stocks. Considering the monetary climate we're in, you may be imagining that it very well may be more secure to conceal your cash under the sleeping cushion like grandmother used to do!"

19,The Future of Global Economy and Celsius Investments,finance," The world is on the verge of a digital revolution, with innovation transforming everything from the way we use appliances and gadgets to the way we conduct financial transactions. Classes of Newly Invented Assets All around the world, the digital economy is accelerating its growth. During the Covid-19 situation, the present digital economy is defined by the emergence of new asset classes and the digitization of established asset classes. Cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing are all driving this rise. The emerging technologies include assets that have the potential to eventually dominate the global economy. For example, the blockchain is home to virtual money and tokens whose popularity has increased tremendously in a relatively short period of time. Entering the Game with Major Players The blockchain enables users to transact safely and much more quickly than they could using old methods. Numerous significant technological and financial companies, including IBM, Oracle, JP Morgan Chase, and Boeing, have been drawn to the blockchain's features. Celsius Network CEO Alex Mashinsky, for example, stated that the company's oversubscribed $750-million funding round was a ""really excellent indication"" of the company's lending and yielding brand's strength. Celsius Network has increased its $400 million Series B investment round from October to $750 million due to oversubscription in the firm's capital raise. Additionally, there are instances where businesses are integrating two novel technologies to create future-proof solutions. Following the financing, the company is now valued at $3.5 billion, and CEO Alex Mashinsky told Cointelegraph that he anticipates that amount to ""double or triple"" next year, putting it between $7 billion and $10.5 billion US dollar. The Turning Point People don't have to use traditional assets, like money, to make their assets into tokens. They can also make other types of assets into tokens, like stocks and bonds. The new market can issue security tokens based on the inherent value of a wide variety of assets. The blockchain technology has the potential to serve as a differentiator between security tokens and traditional securities. By utilizing smart contracts on the blockchain, the necessity for an intermediary is eliminated, hence lowering transaction costs. The blockchain's usefulness has the potential to have a big impact on the traditional banking system. It may also not be necessary to use money as a medium of exchange, because all assets are easily available and can be split up at any time. Automation and artificial intelligence have already made their mark in a lot of different industries. Algorithms have surpassed human traders in trading. Machines have taken over a large number of occupations previously handled by humans in the manufacturing industry. A New Framework Is Necessary There is no longer a good way to make decisions in this rapidly changing world. You can't just use old models and methods. To stay pace with emerging technologies such as DAO, AI, VR, P2P, and M2M, it is critical that we create a new framework. In other words, we must go beyond Munger's Mental Models and instead concentrate on digital models such as network theories and exponential growth models. Our economy is undergoing a rapid digital transformation. We will have a better understanding of which advances will dominate this new web 3.0 economy as time passes, but it is evident that this economic transformation is occurring on a global scale. Inclusion in the digital future These trends show that new technologies have a lot of power to help us make the world a better place. Emerging economies are not merely utilizing technology to keep pace with more developed economies or to gain access to existing products and services. Rather than that, they are utilizing the digital world as a source of inspiration and innovation, as well as the raw material for their own distinct contributions to global advancement. Whether it is through the creation of practical, cheap solutions like as delivery drones or by the adoption of creative regulatory regimes that enhance privacy and data protection, emerging economies are adapting new technology to meet their unique requirements and objectives. Frequently, these concepts then spread internationally, inspiring companies and customers in other countries. This abundance of intellect and ideas demonstrates why global cooperation is critical. Technological advancement is frequently portrayed as a race or competition in which the world's most powerful countries and corporations compete for total dominance. However, in order to fully exploit the Fourth Industrial Revolution's potential, all countries must collaborate. This became even more apparent during the COVID-19 epidemic, which demonstrated our worldwide society's interconnectedness. Every country has something to offer, and every country deserves to be represented at the table. Not only that, but wealthier countries can benefit from the experiences of those they perceive to be less developed. By pooling our combined intelligence, creativity, resources, and desires, we can create a truly affluent world for everybody."
20,What Is Indexed Universal Life Insurance?,finance," What Is Indexed Universal Life Insurance? Indexed Universal Life Insurance is a type of permanent life insurance, which means it has a cash value component in addition to a death benefit, similar to Whole Life, but with added benefits. The cash value account can earn interest based on a stock market index chosen by the insurer, such as the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite or the Credit Suisse Index. There is typically no fixed rate of return, but rather a guaranteed interest rate. For the rest of this article, Indexed Universal Life will be referred to as IUL. Key Features of IUL Insurance No fixed interest rate: When you purchase an IUL, the money in your cash value indexed account don't earn a fixed rate of interest, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) explains. Instead, your rate of interest is based on a market index chosen by your insurer. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, an index tracks the performance of the specific type of investments, such as stocks or bonds. Your insurer selects the index, and then calculates an interest rate based on the performance of the index, says the NAIC. The life insurance company then credits that interest to your cash value account. Interest rate guarantee: The NAIC also says that policies typically include an interest rate guarantee, so a minimum interest rate is paid even if the index produces lower returns. However, interest rates are usually also subject to a ""cap"" or max interest. Adjustable premium payments (within limits):1 Your policy will likely specify a planned premium for you. However, if there is enough money in the cash value account, those funds me be able to be used to help pay the premiums. Adjustable death benefit: Death benefits are typically flexible with an IUL policy, and can usually be lowered at any time. However, increasing the death benefit may require a medical examination and passed. Access to cash value: Borrowing from an IUL in an emergency is allowed, but will most likely Incur interest charges for doing so. Making withdrawals from the cash value account is also allowed, however, doing so may permanently reduce the death benefit. Withdrawals may also risk causing your policy to lapse. Lifetime Income: The cash value can accumulate enough over time to give the policy holder a lifetime, tax-free income, through yearly or monthly withdrawals. Tax-free status is possible, because it is life insurance, and the withdrawal is less than total value, and the investment is post tax. Advantages of IUL Insurance Low price: The policyholder bears the risk, so the premiums are low. Cash value accumulation: Amounts credited to the cash value grow tax-free. The cash value can pay the insurance premiums, allowing the policyholder to reduce or stop making out-of-pocket premium payments. Flexibility: The policyholder controls the amount risked in indexed accounts, and the death benefit amounts can be adjusted as needed.﻿ Most IUL insurance policies offer a host of optional riders, from death benefit guarantees to no-lapse guarantees. Death benefit: This benefit is permanent, not subject to income or death taxes, and not required to go through probate. Less risk: The policy is not directly invested in the stock market, thus reducing risk. Easier distribution: The cash value in IUL insurance policies can be accessed at any time without penalty, regardless of a person’s age. Unlimited contribution: IUL insurance policies have no limitations on annual contributions. Disadvantages of IUL Insurance Caps on accumulation percentages: Insurance companies sometimes set a maximum participation rate that is less than 100%. Better for larger face amounts: smaller face values don’t offer much advantage over regular UL insurance policies. Based on an equity index: If the index goes down, no interest is credited to the cash value. (Some policies offer a low guaranteed rate over a longer period.) Investment vehicles use market indexes as a benchmark for performance. Their goal is normally to outperform the index. With IUL, the goal is to profit from upward movements in the index. Takes time to build: unless you win the lottery, opening an IUL after a certain age is fruitless for any lifetime income. It takes time over a number of years to grow. From birth to around 50 is a good window to open an IUL. Who Might Choose IUL Insurance? An IUL may be a good option for anyone looking for permanent life insurance If lifelong life insurance and the ability to build your cash account over the long term. The NAIC points to the fact that IUL insurance offers both potential for growth based on the market, as well as protection from losing value if the market falls. If these features appeal to you, you might consider IUL insurance."

1,"Stock Loans: A great, safe alternative for listed companies and stockholders alike.",finance," The choice to invest in stock markets is one that can greatly improve investors’ financial situations, in the long term. However, stocks tie up much of investors’ assets with the prospect of more money down the line, but no funds are available for any sudden money needs that may arise here and now. This is where Stock Loans come in, and they are something savvy investors use to keep their long-term financial plans on track, while still being able to take care of their day-to-day money needs. Simply put, Stock Loans allow investors to have liquid, spendable money without needing to sell any of their stocks. The very few reputable Stock Loans lending companies out there will first review the investors’ financial situation, and then will determine, based on the current value of their stocks, how much money can be lent to them. Loans will be paid back over time, and investors will keep on making money, as stocks remain in their possession throughout loan terms of 10 years, or more. Pretty often many stocks appreciate much more than the cost of loans, making this type of loans a petty attractive option. Without Stock Loans a sudden financial need means selling stocks in a hurry, to free up liquid assets. This wrong approach has several downsides. In addition to removing any chance for stocks to further appreciate, there is also a serious risk of temporary market fluctuations to consider. For example, when investors, or companies are forced to sell their stocks that are in a temporary downswing, they usually lose much money, all for the sake of taking care of pressing financial situations that could have easily been handled with this 100% risk-free type of alternative loans. Many smart investors choose to take up stock loans, rather than risking disrupting their long-term finances."
2,IPCAPITAL:IPCapital's AIA BOT System is Transforming Forex Algorithmic Trading,finance," The foreign exchange, or Forex market, is arguably the biggest market in the world. It is even bigger than the stock market; according to a 2019 survey done by FX and OTC Derivatives Market, the Forex market has a daily trading volume of $6.6 trillion, and the number is predicted to increase every year. As one of the largest financial markets, Forex trading has the potential for extreme gains and quick returns. However, there exists a corresponding amount of risks and volatility associated with the market, especially if traders turn to leveraged trading. Leverage enables a trader to open a larger position in the Forex market, without the full amount of investment usually needed. This means that while it is easier to increase your profits, it is also just as easy to magnify any potential losses. Today, as a modern society, we are continuously exploring options that can essentially improve and make our lives easier. This concept can be similarly applied to the Forex market, as the adoption of advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, in Forex trading can be the crucial difference between a successful trade and one that fails. AI in Forex Trading Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, can take the information or data given and process it in a way that humans can never do. As technology continues to evolve, AI can now process vastly more data at an even greater speed than before. AI technology helps users track a lot of data, analyse real-time performance, and automate certain trading processes. By incorporating AI technology in the Forex market, traders can secure a significant advantage by evaluating thousands of trading patterns to discover lucrative trade opportunities. This can result in better Forex returns, even if the trader does not possess any significant prior experience. Think of the Forex market as one of the fiercest battlefields in the world. It is a zero-sum game; for someone to take a long position, a counterparty must be available to take an opposing position. Traders must use every single advantage that they possess, and AI analytics have become an essential tool for any trader to survive in the Forex market. These AI tools use a vast amount of data, market trends, commodity prices, fluctuations etc., to create better trading strategies that can increase your profits and minimize any losses. While there are a few AI trading tools at the moment, it can be hard for new traders to discover one that truly works for them. At the same time, some trading tools may charge overly high subscription fees that may seem daunting for traders that do not have high capital. To serve users with varying needs, IPCapital has emerged as a stellar choice for traders with its flexible options for traders of all levels. The AIA BOT System – An Effective Tool for Forex Trading IPCapital is an international Fintech company focusing on financial services and technological research and development. With great foresight, the company has been building up its AI capabilities and resources over the years and is well poised to capitalize on the current AI trend within the financial markets. IPCapital offers 3 different AIA BOT systems that uses AI and machine learning to analyse and predict trading patterns for a wide variety of trading pairs based on algorithms and pre-set technical settings. While it helps execute trades based mostly on short-term arbitrage, traders are free to adjust the existing parameters for day-trading or long-term trades too. It uses over 15 systems for trading analysis, and retains strategies that have a high rate of winning. By using the AIA BOT system, traders can employ predictive analytical methods and machine learning to predict and take advantage of any market fluctuations. It can also help eliminate emotional or panic trading, as traders may resort to panic selling or make hasty decisions when they find themselves in a pinch. AI-based algorithms would eliminate such weaknesses commonly found in new traders. Conclusion AI definitely exceeds the accuracy and speed of a human brain while analysing market conditions and data. It is not surprising then that many traders have given up traditional manual trading strategies for AI driven ones. As technology advances each passing day, IPCapital is committed to developing and improving existing technologies, and strives to provide an easier trading and investment experience for all users, to help them build stronger and more profitable trading strategies.

3,Cryptocurrency: A brief 2021 roundup using 10 top assets and thoughts for going into 2022,finance," Cryptocurrency: A brief 2021 roundup using 10 top assets and thoughts for going into 2022. By Glyn Granville Gifford Table for crypto coins that will be discussed and compared in the following article. Coin	Open	Close	Percent gain	Rollback BTC	       28926	 46208	 59.75%	        2nd Feb ETH	       736.30	3675.45	 499.20%	7th May BNB       37.35	511.47	 1,370%	        11th Apr SOL	       1.512	169.97	 11,240%	7th Sept ADA       0.1813	1.3078	 721.3%	        27th Feb XRP	       0.2196	0.8294	 377.7%	        4th Apr DOT       7.232	26.678	368.9%	        12th Feb LUNA    0.655	85.45	13,046%	21st Dec AVAX	3.195	109.39	3,424%	        17th Nov LINK	11.24	19.52	73.67%	        14th Jan *Open close data UTC 00.00am1st Jan to UTC midnight 31st Dec, Gate.io *Rollback: The last date that an asset has returned to price parity as its original 2021all time high. Well, it has been a fantastic year for crypto currency in general. As can be noted, all nine altcoins have outperformed bitcoin and thus in Satoshi values have thus gained too. Included in the list is Link which was a top 10 asset last year but has underperformed in relation to all the other listed altcoins and thus has dropped substantially out of the top 10 to rank 23. However, excluding stablecoins, USDT ranked 3, USDC ranked 7, BUSD ranked 15, UST ranked 21, Link is then ranked 19. The obvious latecomers to the party are exceptionally Luna and Sol with 10,000% plus gains and notably AVAX with a large gain also. Will they keep on going through 2022 and gain more or are they now overheated? Many 2021 investors and those especially who invested in Q1 may be tempted to offload their hodl positions given the enormous gains in such a short space of time. The battle between bitcoin and ethereum has been a fascinating one ending up the year with bitcoin dominance at 40.2% whilst ethereum standing at a market share of 20% of the entire crypto market (agreed it still includes stablecoins which are in the calculation of market cap thus the percentages are actually higher in terms of real market share of unpegged assets) . Thus ethereum has made substantial gains throughout 2021 and is catching up bitcoin rapidly. Can 2022 be the year that many traders have been calling ‘The BTC flippening’ whereby ethereum surpasses bitcoin in terms of market cap and takes the number 1 spot away from bitcoin? It’s too early to tell but at nearly half the market cap now to that of bitcoin there is a genuine possibility it can do so. However, the coin to watch which is an immediate threat ranked number 3 and tough competitor to ethereum is BNB. Binance’s BNB running the Binance smart chain (BSC) network has gained huge traction in 2021 with numerous altcoins being transacted through it. As can be seen ETH has had a great year with a near 500% gain but with BNB at 1370% well one could say the proof is in the pudding. In my opinion, this gain difference is down to one simple and major factor, gas fees. As by example to withdraw any amount of USDT via the ethereum network (ETH/ERC20) right now on Gate.io is a fee of $66, whereas using Binance smart chain on Binance (BSC/BEP20) is a mere 80 cents (As of 1st January 2022. Of note ETH fees are updated hourly thus can go down and up accordingly. AFAIK BSC fees are fixed) Across the board with assets that have a choice of either network to ship coins the contrast in fee price is stark and always 10 fold or more using ethereum network (As from a general search of a few altcoins). They say that this problem will be resolved sometime with the update in ETH with the 2.0 version allegedly occurring now in June 2022 after many setback (Investopedia: ethereum-upgrade-delays-difficulty-bomb , accessed 1/1/2022. For a fuller discussion refer to this article. Not all is clear as to when the gas fee problem is resolved but with ETH 2.0 fully implemented it is argued that the energy consumption will be reduced by some 99.95% thus in turn should impact the price of fees for withdrawal of assets) It could the game changer for ethereum and have the ability to outperform BNB in terms of spot price gains, but there is also no guarantee of this. BNB has certainly gained from a strong starting position at the beginning of 2021 and may have another explosive year for 2022; time will tell. XRP is still hanging in there and amazingly ended up the year 377% up. However, it is plagued with ongoing investigations by the SEC as to which is still hasn’t been fully resolved since it started in December 2020. Its history as a well-established coin has been a rocky road. Back in the original altcoin season in early 2018 it peaked to $4.16 yet in the corona crash of March 2020 a mere 10 cents. It even had a good rally up to $1.96 in April 2021 but has now more than halved from that year peak to end the year at 83 cents (Data points Gate.io. Weeks of 1/1/18 $4.161, 9/3/20 $0.10290, 12/4/21 $1.96582). There is still much debate as to where this coin is heading and if it will be mass adopted by banks for its use case as a transactional coin within banking systems worldwide. XRP has received much hype in the past but it has failed to deliver on its promises. In my opinion it is an asset to be avoided given the numerous other newer altcoins that appear much more promising; why invest in a coin with a chequered history? Of the last 3 coins to mention, ADA, DOT and LINK have all outperformed bitcoin too at 721%, 369%, and 73.7% respectively. ADA is a very promising coin but has failed the given 2021 hype of being a $10 coin by years end. However, the gains are still nonetheless impressive and sitting at a comfortable price now of $1.30 it is poised to maybe fulfill that promise albeit a year later. DOT quite a bit behind ADA in gains terms is also doing great and has gained a lot of traction and interest through various projects one of them in particular being para-chain auctions. This again is a coin that may have a bright future through 2022. Lastly LINK and has been included in the list even though it’s not a top coin anymore because this coin has received so much hype and promises of a $100 coin years end but as can be seen with a close price of $19.52 it is fivefold below the speculated target. What’s gone wrong with link I can only assume that there is so much new competition from the likes of ADA, SOL, LUNA and so on that the investor’s attention has been steered away into these other more potentially rewarding projects. Link had a cracking rally in 2020 and topped out at an all-time high of $20.16 in August of that year (Data point Gate.io. Week 10/8/20 $20.168) thus Link has failed to deliver being some 3% down after nearly 17 months. Again it also appears akin to the hype XRP used to receive and thus again why would you invest in this coin given the many other promising altcoin projects out there? Finally to discuss ‘Rollback’. As can be seen from the table on page one, rollback dates have been given to highlight as to where an asset finished the year compared to when it first discovered its original all-time high for 2021. As can be seen Q1 is where the most profit was gained in general for 4 of the assets being BTC, ADA, DOT, and LINK. The year has seen bitcoin on a bit of a rollercoaster with a new all-time high in April of $64,814  and $69,000 dead in November (Data points Gate.io. Weeks of 12/421 $64,814.81, 8/11/21 $69,000) but in between these highs dips below 30K also followed by a final drag down to $46, 208 year end. By viewing roll back it can be seen that Link only essentially gained in price until 14th January thus has spent 50 weeks without gain for year-end price, quite a long time and arguably underperformed greatly in comparative terms with numerous other altcoins. DOT and ADA’s gained dried up in mid to late February after bitcoin hit first ever hit the 50K mark and thus since then a rough parity in Satoshi value has returned over the next three quarters to year end. At the end of the day bitcoin is king and has the power to drag altcoins up and down with sometimes drastic cuts on the way down with altcoins often suffering two or threefold losses compared to bitcoin in a given single days trade. ETH, BNB, and XRP gained until Q2 and have finally reached a rough Satoshi parity since then to year end. They roughly coincided with BTC’s all-time high at its first peak of $64,814 for the year and thus bitcoin can be seen to have clearly aided in the impressive gains for these altcoins but especially BNB which by then had exploded in spot price ending the year up with a huge gain of 1370%; ETH not too shoddy either at 500% and XRP benefitting nicely from the bitcoin rally too. Lastly the parabolic runs of SOL, LUNA, and AVAX to a good degree have seen their price action mainly in Q4 but with SOL slightly starting before towards the latter end of Q3. Yes certainly parabolic for SOL and LUNA with 10,000% plus gains and maybe more will follow but caution will certainly be needed as to buy in with these two altcoins as surely overheated. In conclusion, yes it has been a great year for crypto with the market cap going from quite a chunk under $1 trillion to a fair bit over $2 trillion now. It is still an immature market given its at best only 12 years old and time will tell if this whole crypto idea takes off and truly becomes the next step in financial evolution with mass adoption by the larger powers in the financial world or does it just become another bubble? I don’t have the answer to this and I feel nobody can conclude one or the other right now as it’s far too early to tell. However, time to ride the gravy train, hop aboard and invest for the year to come; hop off if the warning signs indeed come to fruition. Just like the amazing year of 2021 in crypto 2022 can be equally so and will be interesting to see where we end up in 365 days from now. But a word of caution given many uber-bullish predictions  that often arise at the beginning of each year, for example ‘a 100k Bitcoin’ for 2021 years end and as we know it fell short of that target by a mile at $46,208 being more than twofold from the speculated target. Already as of 31st December the target for this year touted by many including Brock Pierce is 200K. To me, these nice round figures are a bit arbitrary and akin to pulling a happy impressive figure out of thin air. Often they fail, 2021 was supposed to be the year of a 100K bitcoin, a 10K ETH, a 100 dollar LINK, a 10 dollar ADA etc. but as seen none are anywhere near these arbitrary figured targets but one must still be happy with the gains made by all these 4 coins in general. My opinion, for what it’s worth, ignore the hype and huge predictions and be happy to gain a 100% on an asset in a single year because really where else can you make such terrific gains outside of the crypto world? Yes there are some out there but sitting in your armchair with a laptop and a crypto platform running it’s probably the easiest money one can make. Good luck to all in 2022. Glyn Granville Gifford, 1st January 2022."
4,What do investors expect from a startup?,finance," Why do investors invest in startups? What motivates them for startup funding? Certainly, they are not guardian angels descending from heaven to make your startup dreams come true. So what could convince them to part with their money? What signs and omens are they looking for to kickstart the seed investment procedure? What are they expecting from a startup? Let’s have a look from an investor’s point of view. The general public often gets excited about new ideas and investors know that this excitement often translates into a return. Investors expect your idea to stand out from the crowd. It doesn’t need to be innovation; it can simply be a unique feature of your product which is your competitive advantage over your competitor’s product. If your idea fulfils an unmet need and has market potential, you’ve got your investor’s attention. This is your first step in finding startup funding. Investors are actively looking for that glint in your eye when you talk about your business seed which is the telltale sign that you possess the drive to push your business to completion. This stems from the expectation that the founder is confident in their plan and that they have sufficient reason to believe that they will succeed. But most importantly, this tells the investor that you are willing to trudge on despite the hardships, no matter how many times you are turned down. So you’re past that friends and family stage and you’re looking for a serious, full-time investor. Now learn how to think like an investor. You will not expect to hear this, but how much buy-in you have within your own friend and family circles and how many of them belief in your startup enough to put in their finances tells a lot about your credibility. This comes in especially when you start asking around for introductions. Remember, your friends and family know you best, and potential investors know this too. Investors may not always be familiar with your idea, your industry or your field, so how do you convince them? Smart investor will invest their time and effort into lots of research and data, especially in areas that are foreign to them and this is where fundraising for startups usually commence. Extensive research and qualitative data will help your investor to arrive at a decision efficiently. This is smart investing This way, not only do you prove to your investors the profitability of your business, but this also shows your dedication to the startup. Investors need to know how deep they are going to dive in when they invest in your business. Keep your intentions and your plans very clear. What level of involvement is required from their end? What is the timeframe they are looking at? What is the expected rate of return? Is there a clear exit strategy? These are common questions that investors are expecting answers to, so it is highly recommended to have a very clear plan in mind when it comes to investors. Investors expect a lot of paper. A solid business model, a proven business, immaculate bookkeeping, financial data, are all things that an investor expects from a startup. So make sure that you are serious about your record-keeping, keeping your team aligned and your metrics always reflecting nothing but growth. Remember, investors are invested in your startup, knee-deep in your business and they are always going to have questions. And when they have questions, they expect satisfactory answers that put their minds at ease with regards to what is happening with their investment. It sounds incredibly painful to the founder of the business owner to have somebody else’s nose in their business, but always remember, if you always have the right answer every time a question is asked, the investors will be appeased and the questions will get less and less when they start trusting you more. These are the top 7 key points investors look for in the initial assessment."

Whatever the reason, it's important to choose the right money transfer service to ensure that the money is sent quickly and safely. When it comes to choosing a money transfer service, there are a few things to consider. The first is the cost of using the service.

6,Understanding cash flow vs. asset-based business lending,finance," Should you apply for an asset based loan or a cash flow based loan for your business? Both types of loans can provide business owners with the funding they need but which one is better for you depends on the type of company you run. What are cash flow based loans and asset based loans and what are their advantages and disadvantages? What is asset based lending? An asset based loan is a loan based and secured on the value of your: •	accounts receivables (accounts receivables are your company's outstanding invoices on goods or services you have already delivered) or •	the equity in any land or buildings your company owns. A lender may advance you up to 90% of the value of the accounts receivable line (as shown on your balance sheet) in the form of a revolving credit facility. The actual amount you're able to borrow will also depend on how creditworthy your lender assesses your typical clients to be. The amount you can borrow will also likely increase if your turnover increases. Alternatively, you may choose to offer as security: •	company inventory (materials, merchandise, goods, and other items your business could sell to make a profit) or •	balance sheet assets (physical assets like vehicles and fixed assets like equipment and machinery). If you offer your inventory or assets as security, the value placed on them by the lender may just be their value at auction rather than their actual market value. This means that you might not be able to borrow as much as you might need. Asset based lending is generally better for companies with lower profit margins and more substantial balance sheets. This is because companies with lower profit margins often find it harder to generate the cash they need for general trading and for growth. And, as the loans are secured, the interest rates on an asset based loan are generally lower. What is cash flow lending? Cash flow based lending is better for companies with higher profit margins or for those which lack hard assets as collateral which they can offer to lenders as security. Cash flow loans are popular with service companies, marketing firms, manufacturing companies with low margins, and retailers among others. On a cash flow loan application, a lender will examine: •	credit ratings (your personal credit rating and your company's credit rating), •	your company's ""enterprise value"" (the market value of your business), •	your company's anticipated future cash flows (in other words, how much money you're likely to be paid by your clients from the sales you make over a given length of time), and •	frequency of deposits (when you'll actually be paid - sometimes called ""consistency of cash flow"") In order to determine how much they'll actually lend you, a lender first consider your company's EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation - this is a way of measuring your profitability). They'll then apply a credit multiplier to that margin. Credit multipliers are different for each industry and they're designed to measure the risks associated with lending to companies in different sectors. This financing method enables lenders to maximise the amount of funding they can advance to you while factoring in the likelihood of any future downturns companies like yours might face. You do not have to offer any collateral to your lender as security to borrow money with cash flow lending. However, this does mean that the interest rate you pay is higher than on asset based loans. If you're thinking that cash flow lending does sound very similar to invoice finance, you're right but only to a point. With invoice finance, you can only borrow against invoices you've issued on completed orders however, with cash flow based business loans, you're actually borrowing against expected future revenues and invoices."
7,Crypto? NFTs? Meme-Coin? PIKA and TheKraft,finance," The world of crypto is a pretty confusing space. When you dive right in you are hit with various terms that leave you wondering just what you got into. I love that when I first started I referred to buying BTC as buying ""shares"". Clearly, I transitioned from the stock market. I made my first decent profit from trading Ethereum. At that time, I didn't know anything behind the functionality of Ethereum, I only knew it was being ""hyped"" in every fashion on social media, the news, and so on. After my success with Ethereum I began watching YouTube videos about crypto, looking for the next best play. What I found was Pika Crypto, only mentioned in one comment, way down below in a video's comment section. A hopeless shill if you will. At that time though, it was known as pikachu token which had been abandoned by the original devs as basically a rug pull and the new team came in and was reviving the token as well as preparing for a new token swap in order to avoid any issues with the name. Little did I know what all the project would turn into and how much work the team was putting in behind the scenes. So, in short, the token today is Pika , named after its mascot the Pika. ""PIKA technically, is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal found in Asia and North America, with short-limbs, a very round body, even coat of fur and no external tail, it is closest to representing a hybrid between a mouse and a rabbit. "" This is from the website's whitepaper. Which you can find a link to at the end of this article. Cute mascot, catchy name, cheap price - perfect for the next moon-meme coin right? Wrong! (Wrong about Pika being a meme - coin, not about going to the moon.) Pika has since continued to prove me wrong. Owned by GameFi AG, a company incorporated in Switzerland, Pika has a revolutionary three token system which also is evolutionary. When the other two tokens are released, users will be able to evolve up to the next token at a set ratio. Each token up will be more ""rare"" hence more valuable. In addition to evolution, staking will also be available. These features have turned me into a long-term holder as it is, but then, I found out there was more. GameFi is releasing a NFT platform on October 27th. What is the correlation? Well all transactions on this platform, TheKraft, will be auto converted to Pika. Straight from the whitepaper, here is some more info- ""The Kraft will be an NFT marketplace that embodies the meaning of #GameFi. Here at the KRAFT, we have a space where NFT game players and artists can collect and create NFTs. Through a unique collection method and with holding incentives for NFTs and PIKA, we have created a unique way to interact with NFTs. The KRAFT is all about art and games, specifically blockchain based games. Being a product of GameFi means not only that you have perks for holding PIKA but also that it is more than just about blockchain gaming but also tradition gaming and the merging of the two. Other game NFTs will be on the KRAFT platform as well so you can have one place to review and trade all your gaming NFTs. The 3 tiered coin system will be also built into the NFT marketplace, there will be a volume based token ranking system where users will get benefits. Once, users reach a certain amount of volume with THUNDER or RAI, they will be able to list their NFTs with THUNDER and RAI as payment options. Through the actual marketplace we have integrated different ways of keeping users interacting with the site. We have puzzle NFTs where users can collect NFTs to complete a puzzle with the final piece being a gift from the team. A treasure hunt will be integrated into the platform as well where users will use clues to find NFTs and earn special prizes. We have a special collection of exclusive artists that we have contracted with from all over the world to bring some of the most breathtaking and awe inspiring NFT artwork onto The KRAFT."" With all this being said, I am ready to see where this ecosystem goes in the future and I know this token is no longer a meme-coin, but a token with real use case and possibilities - Oh, and did I mention the end game goal of the trading card game? For which, there will be special NFT booster packs available- available where else than TheKraft. Pretty clever tie-ins if you ask me. I am greatly looking forward to what this project has to offer its community. "

9,What to do if the sharemarket crashes,finance," INTRODUCTION The sharemarket has enjoyed a great run since the Global Financial Crisis. Will it continue or will a major fall in the markets put an end to it all? No one knows therefore, it is important to set proper financial goals and use strategies to factor in scenarios which may or may not occur. What to do if the sharemarket crashes The 1987 sharemarket crash known as ""Black Monday"" wiped out fortunes as many investors lost their life savings. Those of a generation who were around back then will be well aware of what can happen when you place all your eggs in one basket as many investors did. I mean there were stories of investors borrowing money to purchase shares using the value of their shares as collateral. When the markets went down, the value of their shares were a fraction of the money owed on the borrowed money. The 1987 crash was the worst crash since the 1929 Wall Street crash. There was almost 60 years between 1929 and 1987 so investors need to reassure themselves thsat another crash may not fall within their lifetime. So what should investors do when the markets are falling? Here are my 5 tips: 1 KEEP CALM Do not fret, markets go up and down like a rollercoaster. Treat the markets as a long term investment. If you are young then you have time on your side. There is time for you to recover from financial setbacks. Even if you are say 50 you still have another 15 or so years before you reach the age of retirement so you do not really need to be too conservative, however, someone who cannot stomach the thought of rapidly falling markets would disagree. It all depends on your temperament. A financial advisor is likely to steer you to more conservative investments if you are approaching what is termed ""The retirement age."" 2 STICK TO YOUR FINANCIAL PLAN It is important to stick with your original plan despite all if the negativity in the newspapers which will no doubt arise after a crash. When planning your financial strategy your plan needs to factor in the possibility of a sharemarket tumble. Shares can take investors on a rollercoaster ride which rewards persistence. 3 DON'T TRY TO TIME THE MARKET It is time not timing which rewards sharemarket investors. Few investors have the knowledge to predict the movement of a share price and those who do and take advantage of it are breaking the law because it is known as insider trading. Investors should do their homework first and trust their own judgement when deciding on which shares to buy. 4 KEEP SAVING AND INVESTING The market rewards consistency. Investing into the markets when there is so much negativity which will follow a crash will pay off. As they say ""Fortune favours the brave."" The advantage of investing when there is not much negativity and uncertainty in the markets is that you will be able to snap shares up at bargain prices and as the market recovers, investors will gradually jump on the bandwagon and in doing so will give it a shot in the arm. 5 LISTEN TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE A sharemarket crash will dominate the news for weeks and all of a sudden there will be financial experts coming out of the woodwork with advice on what you should do with your money. A smart investor will be able to discern between good, bad, or downright stupid advice."

11,7 Money Management Tips For Millenials,finance," You don't need a higher paying or unexpected job from relatives to improve your personal finances. For many people, better money management is enough to lower their costs, increase their ability to invest and save, and achieve financial goals that once seemed impossible. Even if you feel like your finances are stuck in a bad place with no way out, there are things you can do to create a better situation for yourself. Here are seven to get you started. 1. Track your expenses to improve your finances. If you don't know what and where you spend each month, there's a good chance your personal spending habits will improve. Better money management starts with spending awareness. Use a money management app to track expenses by category and see for yourself how much you spend on trivial things like dinner, entertainment and even coffee each day. Once you learn these habits, you can make plans for improvement. Do you subscribe to a service you never use? It's easy to forget about monthly subscriptions to streaming services and mobile apps that drain your bank account, even if you don't use these services on a regular basis. Review the costs of these fees and consider canceling unnecessary subscriptions to save more money each month. Create an emergency fund to use if unforeseen circumstances arise. Even if your contribution is small, these funds can save you from risky situations where you are forced to borrow at high interest rates or are unable to pay your bills on time. You should also make a general savings contribution to increase your financial security if you lose your job. Use automatic contributions such as changing your FSCB pocket to add to this fund and strengthen your spending habits. Paying your bills on time is an easy way to manage your money wisely, and it has a big advantage: It helps you avoid late fees and prioritize basic expenses. A strong history of on-time payments can also improve your credit score and increase your interest rates. 5. Create a realistic monthly budget. Use your monthly spending habits, as well as your monthly home salary, to create a budget that you know you can save. There's no point in setting a tight budget based on drastic changes like: For example, never eat out if you're currently ordering four times a week. Create a budget that fits your lifestyle and spending habits. You should see your budget as a way to encourage better habits, such as: B. Cook more at home, but give yourself a realistic experience to meet this budget. This is the only way this money management method works. Several types of loans and debts can be useful with major purchases, such as: the house or even the car you need right now. But for other big purchases, cash is the safest and cheapest option to buy. When you buy cash, you avoid earning interest and getting into debt that takes months, or even years, to pay off. Meanwhile, this deposited money can remain in the bank account and earn interest that can be pledged as collateral for your purchases. Even if your investment options are limited, you can earn more income with a small contribution to the investment account with the money you have earned. Find out if your employer offers a 401(k) match, which basically works as free cash. Consider opening a retirement or other investment account. The path to better finances begins with changing your own habits. Some of these changes will be easier than others, but if you stick to this transformation, you will acquire great money management skills that will serve you throughout your life - and in the meantime, have more money in your pocket."
12,Debt Consolidation Loan or Debt Counselling in South Africa,finance," If you have multiple debt accounts and are struggling to keep up with your monthly repayments, where do you go from there? Perhaps you’ve considered a debt consolidation loan, but is this the right option for you? A consolidation loan allows you to combine all your smaller loans into one larger loan amount. This means all your smaller debts, like your credit card debt, store debt, personal loans etc. will now be one large loan amount. Instead of paying several creditors each month, now you’ll only have to make one repayment each month. By consolidating your debt you’ll be offered a new loan agreement. Creditors will usually extend the repayment terms and reduce interest rates. Although a consolidation loan simplifies your financial situation, you will end up paying more towards your debt in the long run. A debt consolidation loan doesn’t mean you’ll get rid of all your debt. If you don’t have great money management skills or if you don’t have a financial plan, a debt consolidation loan costs you more in the long run. Most people end up spending their money recklessly when they take out a consolidation loan. This happens because consumers don’t understand how to manage their money and a consolidation loan doesn’t help with that either. This depends on your credit score and financial situation. Consolidation loans may be good for you if: Your total debt does not exceed 40% of your gross income (excluding your mortgage) Your credit score is good enough to apply for a low-interest consolidation loan. You can constantly afford your monthly debt repayments. You have a plan that will prevent you from making too much debt again. A consolidation loan may be bad for you if you have excessive spending habits or if you’re overwhelmed by too much debt. If you struggle to manage your money or if you have poor spending habits, a consolidation loan will cost you more money in the long run. If your total debt amount is more than half of your income, a consolidation loan is not worth pursuing. There are better financial solutions if you’re looking for financial relief. If you’re struggling to make ends meet, rather than consolidating your debt with a debt consolidation loan, consider debt counselling. Debt counselling, or debt review, offers financial relief to South African consumers who are struggling to pay off their debt. The debt review process was introduced by the National Credit Act (NCA) in 2007 to prevent consumers from being blacklisted. Debt review is a perfect solution for consumers who can’t afford all their debt repayments and monthly living expenses. These consumers’ monthly expenses exceed their income, which means they may be over-indebted. You have a steady income You’re struggling to make ends meet as a result of debt You can’t keep up with debt payments and you’re falling further into debt Although debt consolidation loans offer a simpler way of paying off your debt, they may end up costing you more. If you don’t have the financial discipline to manage your money, a consolidation loan will send you further into debt. Debt counselling may be a better option for you. If you are struggling to keep up with all your monthly bills, debt counselling could help you regain control of your financial situation and become debt-free. A debt counsellor, like Debt Rescue, can offer you the financial relief you’re looking for. Legal protection from creditors Taking overall communication with your credit providers Negotiating reduced payments and interest rates with credit providers Restructuring your debts into a single monthly payment A budget tailored to your needs Living with debt can be extremely stressful, especially if you’re being threatened with legal action by your creditors. Once you’re accepted to undergo debt counselling, you don’t have to worry about being harassed by credit providers as you are protected by the NCA. Your debt counsellor will take over this responsibility and communicate with all your creditors on your behalf. Your debt counsellor will renegotiate lower interest rates and extended repayment terms on your behalf. By renegotiating these terms, you’ll be paying a lower monthly debt repayment, freeing up some extra cash for living expenses. Your debt counsellor will restructure your debt so that you only have to make one single reduced monthly debt repayment. With only one monthly debt repayment, you will find it easier to manage all your monthly financial obligations. As part of the debt review process, you will have to submit your monthly expenses so that your debt counsellor can reallocate your spending needs. Your debt counsellor will provide you with a personalised monthly budgeting plan, that you can use to help you manage your money more efficiently. Debt Rescue will assess your situation to determine whether you qualify to undergo the debt counselling process. If it is not the best solution for you, we will advise you on other options going forward. 10 signs you may need debt review to help you: You’ve maxed out your overdraft/credit cards. You’ve fallen behind on one or more payments. You don’t have enough money to cover living expenses. You’re failing to save. You don’t have an emergency fund. You’re selling assets to make ends meet. Creditors are calling you to ask about debt payments. You’re taking out payday loans. You’re borrowing from your retirement savings. You’re losing sleep stressing about your finances. Let’s take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of taking out a debt consolidation loan: Lower monthly instalments You will be offered a lower monthly instalment; however, this comes at a price. A lower monthly instalment means you’ll be extending your loan over a longer period. You’ll end up paying more in interest than you should. This will cost you a lot of money in the long run. Because you only have to pay one monthly instalment towards debt, it’s easier for you to keep track of your debt repayments and make those payments on time. Pay more on your total interest payments Unfortunately, although the consolidation loan may promise lower monthly interest rates, you’re most likely going to pay more towards your debt over the entire course of your repayments. The lower interest rate may relieve you from the stress immediately, but you will be paying a whole lot more over the long term. Debt consolidation companies often charge high upfront fees and interest rates. Consumers find it difficult to pay off their debt amounts due to the high interest rates. If the interest rates on a consolidation loan suddenly increase, you may not be able to afford your monthly debt repayments. A debt consolidation loan does not reduce your debt. Instead, it replaces your smaller debts with one large debt that you pay off over a very long time period. This is not a long-term solution to your financial problem. To get onto a path to financial freedom, you need to spend wisely, save for the future and emergencies and rather seek a long-term solution to your problem such as debt counselling. Speak to one of our experts about debt counselling and find out if it’s the best solution for you. Take the first step towards a debt-free future. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Get help by contacting Debt Rescue. We’ll guide you every step of the way until you’re completely free of the chains of debt."

14,Values-based investing,finance," INTRODUCTION Investing in companies which line up with your values is becoming more popular as investors become aware of where their money is invested. Commonly known as ""Socially Responsible Investing,"" investing according to your values sends a message to companies and if enough investors are socially responsible investors then change is possible. Values based investing What is value- based investing? It is investing in companies which line up with your values. A value-based investment portfolio can be based on environmental factors, moral factors, or your faith. Investments based on a set of values is usually called, ""Ethical Investments,"" but it really all depends on your code of ethics when deciding on what constitutes ethical investing. It is more commonly known as ""Socially Responsible Investing,"" but I prefer to call it ""Values Based Investing,"" because not everyone shares the same values. What may be ethical for one person may not be so for another, therefore, it is up to each one of us to do our homework and read the information provided by the fund's website. It is important to know what is ethical to you when choosing a fund to invest in. A prudent investor after he or she has done their homework will discern between what is fact and fiction and whether a company actually lives up to their claims. Green washing is when a company uses marketing to make claims of being a socially responsible company but in reality they do not practice what they preach. A company may make donations to charities but that does not necessarily make them green, ethical, or socially responsible. One company I know has stopped selling coal yet sells imported clothing from third world companies where the working conditions in the clothing factories are unknown. There are several variations of value-based investments and they come under different names; here are the ones I know of: SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS These are investments which follow socially acceptable guidelines. They invest in companies whose activities are not damaging to the environment. You can be sure that these kinds of investments do not have funds invested in companies which are involved in fossil fuels. ETHICAL BASED INVESTMENTS An investment fund based on ethics may not invest in companies involved in the gambling, alcohol, and cigarette industry. Any investment related to the meat industry may also be off limits if you are a vegetarian. FAITH BASED INVESTMENTS Some churches have their own investments which are used to fund various church activities. For many investors in church funds the return on their money is a secondary consideration to the work carried  out by the church with investor's money. GREEN INVESTMENTS This is basically concerned with climate change and the environment. It is another name for socially responsible investing. IMPACT INVESTMENTS Another name for socially responsible investments. It is important to follow the basic rules of investing and to diversify your investments and invest according to your age and life goals. Investing in mutual funds is an excellent way to reduce your risk as your money is spread  over different companies. Diversification as it is commonly known is a good strategy to have particularly when you are older and have less time to recover from financial setbacks. The young ones are able to take more risks. Balancing risk and reward is an art and to become really good at it requires experience.

15,Currency Pairs and Correlation,finance," Currency pairs and correlation Currencies are mainly based on the three-letter code. There are at least one hundred and seventy different currencies, and the USD (U.S. Dollars) has the most majority in Forex trading. Next will be the European Union, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, and New Zealand Dollar. Forex trading is based on two currencies being exchanged. So, the combination of two different currencies works as a trading part. EUR (European Union)/USD (U.S. Dollar) is one of the major combinations of currencies. If you consider EUR/USD, the EUR is the base currency, and the USD is the quote currency. Therefore, the exchange rate depends on how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. For example, if the exchange rate is 0.57, you need 0.57 USD to buy 1 EUR. Therefore, if the exchange value is high, the quote currency value has fallen, and if the exchange rate is low, the quote currency value has risen. The correlation is the relation between the two currencies. The currency pair has to be associated with Forex trading, and the correlation coefficient defines this relationship. Obviously, the currencies are paired in Forex, so this represents how the exchange rate will perform. The correlation coefficient is between -1 to +1. If the correlation is positive, the currencies are moving together, and if it's negative, they are moving in the opposite direction. If the correlation coefficient is zero, then the currency pair is at an arbitrary point. Calculating correlation To calculate the correlation between currency pairs, you can go for Microsoft spreadsheets. This is the best way to develop your strategies. First, choose a currency pair and put them on your spreadsheet. Then fill the columns with their daily prices. The prices are readily available on the internet. And with the CORREL in a spreadsheet, you will get the correlation between the pair. You can update your data every other day. Correlation changes quickly. For example, suppose in a particular month, EUR/USD correlation is 0.74, and in three months, the correlation is 0.63. This means that the correlation was weaker in three months, but the correlation is still positive. The correlation between the currency pairs is never stable, and the global economic factors are directly connected to them. So if the correlation is strong today, it doesn't mean it'll remain firm in the long run. And this is why a period of six months is suggested in defining correlation. Trading with the pairs: A trader can sell the pair with a positive correlation and buy the couple with a negative correlation. The main thing is to purchase a pair that has a higher correlation, thus ensuring that they move together. The long history of high correlation will result in profit. You can always control the loss with stop-loss. But it is not entirely possible to gain profit with the trade even if the pair moves upwards. So with any correlation strategy, the position is the key to minimize loss. To sum up... The currency pairs are the primary source of Forex trade, and to get a minimum profit, first, you need to understand the relation between the currencies."
16,"In 2021, Anyone Can Make Money By Playing Video Games!",finance," I grew up playing games like Risk, Monopoly, a little Chess... and still remember buying my first computer somewhere around 1986 solely to play a computer game on. It was an Apple IIc, and that first game was some type of Pirate Adventure. I wish I remembered the name. It wasn’t all that good, but still, I was hooked! Since that first adventure, I’ve spent thousands of hours as well as dollars playing just about every type of digital game that has followed! PC games, Atari, Wii, mobile games... you name it, I play it! I’d always generalize the cost (to myself at least) thinking “some guys play golf 3 days a week at $100 a round... I play computer games”. That’s my story, and I’m sticking to it! However, the story has changed... “Pay to Play” has become “Play to Earn”! If you would be to search terms like “crypto games”, “blockchain games”, “make money playing video games”, and others, you’d find some really incredible statements. Today, quotes like the ones below are becoming more and more common! “I made $400 last week playing a computer game” “I just sold my RPG character for $200 profit” “I was offered $1k for a skin for my laser rifle of doom” (I made up the “laser rifle of doom” part) “I bred my pet thingamajig yesterday and sold the baby!” (it’s digital, for those of you wincing) In 2021, thanks to the blockchain, there’s a growing community of gamers who are making real dollars daily, mining, fighting, shooting, jumping... all while playing the same type of mobile and PC games that you had to PAY to play just a short while ago... ...but let’s start at the beginning. You paid $172,000 for a what!? Yes... all the way back in 2018 a CryptoKitty named “Dragon” was sold for an incredible $172,000. (300 ETH) Don’t be too surprised, it’s justified! It’s an adorable digital image, or “NFT” of a cat, after all. It’s a lot of money, but for NFTs and blockchain gaming, flipping a Kitty today may as well be considered the stone ages. It’s still a record, but while you can still get started collecting these digital felines for as low as a couple of dollars, big-dollar trades still happen daily. On the flip side of mortgaging your home to buy a digital picture of a CryptoKitty, Bored Ape, or CryptoPunk, you may feel better if you begin your adventure into making crypto (it’s real money, dear!) by playing a video game where you can “make money” instead of spending it. I’m not saying owning a CryptoKitty or any of a plethora of “Avatar NFTs” we see popping up on various exchanges isn’t one way to do it... I’m saying to me at least, as a life-long gamer I’d much prefer playing a mobile, console, or PC game to collecting pictures in a digital wallet. So what the heck is an NFT? I could go into a long explanation... but since this article is about gaming and not cryptocurrency, I’ll tell you an NFT is a “non-fungible token”, and leave you google it if you really want to dig in deep. I do want to share more, so I’ll ‘splain it as simple as I can for you Lucy! A CryptoKitty, as stated above, is a type of image called an NFT. (the collection is called “CryptoKitties) It’s a digital picture of a cartoon cat. There are thousands of different ones that have different shapes, colors, expressions and traits. (kind of like a real cat, but eats less) The difference, is only one of each design is actually a legitimate “CryptoKitty”. (or a legitimate whatever type of image it happens to be) To be clearer... each NFT is a “one of a kind”, so if you’re thinking “but can’t I just make a copy?”, nope you can’t. I mean... you “can” make a copy of it if you really dig the design and want it on your desktop, but it would only be a copy of that particular NFT, not the real McCoy! Ok... so what makes one real, and the rest fakes? The blockchain. Now, I’m going to be true to my word and keep my promise of not making this an article about crypto or the blockchain, so just know this: the difference between an image that is an actual NFT, and a copy of one, is there is an underlying digital code that designates the real thing. So real in fact, that artists are creating or importing their paintings and creations to the web as NFTs, numbering them as they would a lithograph, and selling their entire collections. So if you are an art fan, check with your favorite creators... you may be surprised to find all of their “works of art” on an online marketplace! NFTs are viewed on certain marketplace websites and digital wallets where the copies cannot be displayed, so that is how we know one is real, and the others are not! Having said that, sure, there’s more to it, but just know that there’s a 100% secure way of knowing an image is a real NFT. In addition, there can be more than one NFT with the same identical image. However, each has a unique underlying code, so even if they look exactly the same, they are not! Look at it like the playing cards or comic books of old... there may be 1,000 created (or “minted” as it’s called in NFT land) but they will each be numbered 1 to 1,000. And guess which is more valuable.....? I knew you’d get it! And these NFT’s make money how? You’re getting warmer! There are a lot of different types of games coming out these days where you can make money playing. There are RPG’s, MOBA’s, Shooters, games in first person and in third, dungeon crawls... you name it! If you’re thinking “how did I not know this!”, I was the same until recently! I have been gaming almost daily since I stepped into Ultima Online back in 1997, and I can’t even begin to tally how many hours and/or dollars I’ve invested into gaming. Now, our hobby pays! After 30-something years, my wife still thinks I’m bonkers... but I got a totally different look from her a few days ago when I told her I sold my game character for well over $200. Legit. I sold two more yesterday, and another this afternoon. Some of these only cost me $10 or $15, some much more. Some are free. I sold another NFT character last week for $1,950, and it was sold on the game’s website, not on the black market. So not only can an NFT be a picture of an Ape, Vegetable, Duck, or Stripper on a pole (we’ll leave it at that) but it can be a character in a game, a weapon, a mount, armor, or more. One game is giving away free pet turtles with each character. For the uneducated on “pets” in computer games, it’s not the kind you keep in a bowl in your bedroom. It’s a companion that fights with you in an online game and may shoot fire from its eyes, heal you, or similar. Soon after being handed out for free, they’re now selling for around $60 each. So an NFT can be an image, a video, music, a meme... or even a shirt or shoes! But we’ll leave the NFT clothing explanation to another article. ;) Remember that rare skin you paid out the nose for a year ago in Apex? Or the L33T character you built up in Fortnite or Warcraft? If you’re no longer playing that game, it’s money under the bridge. And you don’t own the bridge! In this new breed of blockchain games, you could have LEGALLY sold that character, skin, weapon, land, house, mount, or whatever it was when you tired of the game. For a profit. Maybe for a LARGE profit. Yes, in the past we were able to find ways to get around the system and dump our pixels from time to time. We’d sell the account on the black market, or cut a deal with someone like a drug dealer on a Chicago Street corner. Then we’d over who went first... “You give me the account and weapon first!” “No you give me the money first”. Sometimes the deals even went through. Others well... let’s just say half of the parties walked away happy. I made good money when after 4 years of daily playing I sold my Ultima Online account for somewhere around $2,000, but I needed to find a trustworthy “go-between” to broker the deal. Even then, I was sweating it! With today’s crypto games, not only do the games provide the platform to buy, sell, or trade your character and items, but it’s encouraged, and done with good old U.S dollars! I’ve made $ playing 4 or 5 different games already this week, as well as flipping (buying low and selling higher) NFT characters! How else can I make money playing games? The way you earn varies from game to game, but each week seems to reveal another new strategy, platform, or idea. Many are new strategies, and while some have “triple A” 3D animation and graphics, others are simpler and use basic one-dimensional graphics for the gameplay. Some of these games are actually tied to a token on the blockchain. The game developer creates their own token, not too unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, and it can be bought or sold on the open market as well as used in the game as currency. Could you imagine if back in League of Legends, Guild Wars or Final Fantasy, when you were ready to move to a new game, you could sell or easily convert your gold to cash? Some of today’s blockchain games encourage it! Not only can you now buy and sell characters and weapons, the gold in the game can be traded, bought, sold, or saved like real currency, stocks, crypto, or collectables. Never have I been as excited about PC and mobile gaming as I am today! As an example, I am doing some work for a new game that will launch soon called Pepper Attack. Pepper Attack has its own token or coin... called MYTE. It can be used in the game as currency, but also be traded like Bitcoin. A lot of today’s blockchain games offer this same benefit. Hi ho, hi ho, it’s off to mine I go! Just by owning an NFT from the game, you can login on a daily basis and click “mine” earning real-value tokens passively. Your Pepper goes to work like one of the 7 Dwarves mining MYTE, and later on you can convert it to other tokens or cold, hard cash. There's more to do in this particular game as well. Like any good RPG or MMORPG, each pepper has a unique combination or skills like attack, defense, evade, hit points, and more. As an example of the possibilities, if you have a high attack score, other characters will be able to pay you in MYTE to “train” them, raising their score as well. In addition, these NFTs have unique physical traits, some are common and some are very rare. This game in particular have toons that look more like anime-ish elves with weapons and a stem... I have to admit the artwork is really spicey! (see what I did there?) Other games are of course totally different. Some people will simply collect these NFTs/characters as an investment, like playing cards or comics. Others will use them in the game, and still others will do both. Either way, they can be held, or sold for a profit! Unlike the games of the past, when you’re ready to move on you don’t walk away and lose all the $ you have spent for characters, skins, weapons, potions, and other items. When you’re done, you’ll be able to sell your character and items... possibly for a profit... maybe a lot of profit... and move on. These are not your father’s computer games! As we move ahead in the genre, we are seeing AAA studios coming out with big-dollar productions, like Blankos, Mist, Illuvium, Ember Sword and others. Some of these games actually let you buy the land you build on! Did you have your own house in Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, or Archeage? What if you could have used It as a shop and been paid in dollars for your wares, rented it to another player, or sold it for cold hard cash at a huge profit down the road? In many of today’s games, not only is it common, but extremely hard to come by, and quite expensive. Not only are people paying thousands of dollars for a plot in some of the games that have land, but they’re paying it many months before the game is even released. They do it, because in many cases they know that they can easily 2X, 10X, or even 50X their investment a short piece down the road. Seriously? Seriously... and the early bird catches the worm! Other games with lesser budgets are more graphic-based, but have super earnings potential as well, and are just as fun to play. These include Splinterlands, (a card game like Magic!) Crypto Blades, Axie Infinity and more. Regardless of if the new blockchain game of your choice is a RPG, MOBA, a card game or racing game... the fact that you can put some coin into your pocket playing adds a whole new element. It’s heckafun making money playing a game! The early nerd catches the worm! In many cases, if you can catch a game before it releases, the land, characters, weapons, and other items... in most cases all NFTs... can be grabbed at a tiny fraction of the future value. Of course, always check out the game details and team first, and be confident it’s a good place to put your money. Not all games are made the same. If you’re lucky enough to find out about and partake in an early sale, for example, like grabbing a character NFT or two in “Pepper Attack” before the late September launch date, you may be in for a real treat! There are plenty of new titles coming down the pipe that look to be fun, have great communities, and offer earning opportunities. A web search will find services and websites that will keep you on your toes and alert you of upcoming blockchain game releases, marketplace opening, and more. As we look forward, the future of gaming on the blockchain is really, really exciting! Not only are the games getting better and more fun, but they’re getting better at making the economics work more smoothly as well. The games are not without challenges, as they need to be made to sustain themselves economically over the long haul. In addition, they need to have higher levels of security (thanks blockchain!) and of course, work without becoming “pay to win”. Thankfully, the new breed of developers have risen to the challenge! The next time you look for a new game to add to your phone or desktop, or just want a change of pace, look to a game that pays to play! Your wallet might thank you. Another perk, is your husband or wife will appreciate it as well! Instead of hearing “are you going to play that stupid game all night again?”, you may start to hear things like “I’ll put the kids to bed tonight sweetheart, so you can get online and play”. One can only hope... Nick Cifonie"
17,What is Remortgaging?,finance," People sometimes get confused when it comes to ""why do people remortgage"". There are a number of valid reasons why people remortgage their property. If you currently have a mortgage and your repayments are high each month but your income has remained the same, this is an example of you having good financial status. Your property has low market value and you have made no improvements so far. In short, you can say that your mortgage is good as new. This situation applies to you if you take advantage of fixed-rate remortgages. You basically take the value of your existing mortgage and add onto it the cost of your new home improvement job, then apply for a new loan: Remortgaging. The only difference with this new deal is that now you will have to pay a slightly higher interest rate due to the risk that the new lender has of losing his money if you default on him. The reason that lenders charge a higher interest rate is because they know that if you do not pay back the full sum on time they will lose the entire capital that they have put into the loan. This is why you should always ask whether you can take advantage of fixed-rate remortgages before deciding to take up an interest rate that could be higher than the rate that you currently pay each month. Another good reason why people choose to remortgage is to borrow more money for home improvements. You can borrow more money on this type of remortgage because the initial repayment period is shorter. It is the period between the day you took out the loan until the day you complete the home improvements that are counted. So, if you want to increase the size of your garden or buy new furniture there is no better way to borrow money than through a remortgage. This is also ideal for those who want to spend a little money on their home before they get it up to speed with the rest of their home improvements. If you have taken on any new or expensive debt recently, you could consider applying for a remortgage. Many lenders are willing to lend money to individuals facing the possibility of a short term period of financial hardship, so long as they are able to provide a solid repayment plan that shows them how they will be making repayments on their new loan. It is important to remember that the longer you take to repay your existing home improvement work, the bigger the chance of you falling behind and losing any further progress you have made. A remortgaging will simply allow you to catch up if you fall behind, allowing you to continue enjoying your current lifestyle. If you have found yourself unable to keep up with your mortgage payments, your lender will often offer you a 'cash out' option at the end of the term of your ltv deal. You can then use this lump sum of cash to pay off your debts, effectively eliminating interest charges and other charges from entering into a new mortgage agreement with the bank. In many cases, you can also choose to move your house into the secured equity part of the ltv deal in order to free up some equity, thus increasing the equity in your home. However, your lender will usually only allow you to move into the ltv arrangement if you are in fact able to keep up with payments on your existing mortgage. If you were to fail to do so, your home could be at risk, even if your current home loan is still valid. One of the main benefits of a remortgaging deal is that you will be able to save money on the overall cost of the property. Even when you have to take into account the additional costs of paying a builder or renovating the property, the savings made by taking on the remortgage are significant. The amount of money that you will save when you remortgage will almost always be higher than the value of the property itself. Therefore, it is important to bear in mind that in addition to paying fees to a builder or renovator, you will need to keep up with ongoing maintenance costs that could be running into thousands of pounds each month. In addition, you may need to make improvements to the property itself such as repainting and repaving, as well as maintaining the interiors and exterior of the building. Another advantage of remortgaging is that it gives you financial security. As your repayments on the original mortgage are being spread over more years, you will eventually be repaying a much smaller amount every month. This means that as the period of the repayment has lengthened, your monthly outgoings will also decrease. As a result, you will soon find yourself with a lot more spare income and less debt to worry about. On top of this, it is often possible to borrow more money after taking out a remortgaging plan. Therefore, there is an opportunity to take out a larger mortgage and extend the term of the loan, which will reduce monthly outgoings. If you are thinking about remortgaging, you should first make sure that the deal you are getting is likely to be worthwhile. It is not a good idea to borrow more money just because your house price is going up. Instead, look for a fixed rate, low rate or variable rate remortgage deal. Check online to compare the different quotes available from various lenders so that you can make sure that you get the best deal possible. Although the initial outlay of taking out a remortgage can be high, it will pay off in the long run, as you should be able to lower your monthly repayments and improve your credit score at the same time."
18,Choosing the Right Mortgage - 3 Things You Need to Know,finance," Fixed-rate mortgages have low-interest rates and this makes them a popular option for homebuyers. If you choose fixed-rate mortgages, you have the comfort that your monthly payments will not rise. You know right from the onset that the interest rate will never go up even when the economy is poor. In addition to this, if the interest rate is higher than the fixed-rate mortgage then the repayments will be lower. However, there are disadvantages to fixed-rate mortgages. Variable-rate mortgages are generally known to have higher interest rates than fixed-rate loans, but if you can plan well you could lower your monthly payments. One of the advantages of a variable-rate loan is the fact that if the interest rates go down you could benefit from the lower interest rates. Moreover, if you get a low-interest rate you can save a lot of money every month. A variable-rate loan will increase your monthly payments but if you manage to pay off your loan in time then it will save you from paying high interest rates and it will also lower your monthly payment. Before you choose the type of mortgage you want to take out, it is very important to consider how much you can afford to pay for a home mortgage. It is important to do research on the variable mortgage rates and compare them with the current interest rates in order to know what is the best option for you. The longer the introductory period, the lower the interest rate and vice versa. Research should be done in order to make sure that you can qualify for the mortgage that will suit your needs and requirements. The main factors that affect your eligibility include your employment history, current income and your level of education. When you have completed the entire process of applying for a mortgage, you should contact your lender. You may even want to talk to your lender about any special options available to you. There are many home buying assistance programs that a lender can offer to help you qualify for a mortgage. These programs will lower your interest rate and may also reduce the overall loan amount that you need to repay. Mortgage rates vary and depending on the value of the property will determine the mortgage that will suit you. Fixed mortgages come with fixed interest rates and this is the best mortgage for people who want to secure their future and can make their mortgage payments for many years to come. Adjustable mortgages come with flexible interest rates and they are an ideal choice for young families. If you plan to sell your house within a short period of time, adjustable-rate mortgages come with shorter repayment periods. When you start searching for a home you may be surprised at the different mortgage offers that you receive. It is best to shop around with several lenders in order to secure the best rate. Your credit score will determine the type of mortgage that you will qualify for and there are lenders who specialize in offering loans for people with low credit scores or even no credit scores. Before you finalize your mortgage it is important that you ensure that the lender is the best for you and this means that they will look at your financial situation before offering you a loan. Using a mortgage broker can make the whole process much easier. The most important step when it comes to choosing the right mortgage broker is that you feel comfortable and that you can trust them. Being comfortable with who you deal with is very important. If you do not feel at ease with the person who is handling your mortgage sales then chances are high that you will not get the best deal. Therefore, take time before you make your final decision and put yourself at ease."

20,What Documents Do I Need For a Mortgage in the UK?,finance," What documents do I need for a mortgage in the UK is the question that comes to many people's minds. Many people assume that there are only two documents that they need and that these are the mortgage papers and the driving license. However, that is not the case. You need other important documents as well, such as proof of identity (which will be asked for if you are applying online), as well as proof of your UK residency if you are applying for a UK Mortgage with a property deposit (which will also be asked for). This can take some time to go through, so you might want to consider using an expert who can do it all for you. So what documents do I need for a mortgage in the UK? The first thing that you will need is your original passport. This is absolutely necessary for any non-UK person to apply for a mortgage in the UK. Without a passport, there are no benefits to applying for a mortgage in the UK, as you must prove your identity. Without a passport, the process of obtaining a mortgage in the UK becomes much more difficult and can take many weeks. The next documents that you need to have before applying for a mortgage in the UK are your original driving license and your Marriage certificate. Both of these are not required for you to apply for a mortgage in the UK, but it can be very helpful. In fact, both of these documents can serve as your proof of identity as well as to prove your marriage age. This means that when you go to a lending institution, such as a bank, for a mortgage, the lending institution will see your marriage certificate and immediately know that you are not married yet. These are two of the most important pieces of documentation that you need to have with you before applying for a mortgage. You may have some concerns about how these documents will affect your ability to get a loan, especially if you have a poor credit history or have been at fault in the past for some type of accident. However, lending institutions are legally obligated to accept all forms of documentation pertaining to a person's history before approving a mortgage for that person. Your License is there simply to prove that you are of legal age to drive. You can also use these as your proof of identity, meaning that you will need to have a valid address registered with the DVLA as well. Next on the list are your passport and identity cards. These are used to prove who you are and will be needed by a lending institution if they are going to lend you money. What documents do I need for a mortgage in the UK if I want to get one with no credit check attached to it? Well, your current passport and your passport card. What documents do I need for a mortgage in the UK if I want to borrow a smaller amount of money? You will need your bank statement, your rent payment record, your council tax bill, your mortgage provider information, and proof of your income. If you're unable to provide any of this with the lender, then this means that you won't be able to borrow the money that you're looking for. This means that you have to be more proactive when it comes to being able to borrow money. Are there other documents that I need for a mortgage in the UK that is not covered by this list? Yes, there are. However, this is the bare minimum list that you should have. If you want to learn more about borrowing mortgage advice in the UK, then speak to a licensed mortgage advisor. They will be able to tell you which types of mortgages are available and how much that you'll need."

1,5 Benefits of Working With a Mortgage Broker,finance," If you are considering getting a mortgage, one of the key questions you may have is why use a mortgage broker. A mortgage broker helps you find the right type of mortgage for your individual situation and can help you understand the basics of mortgage lending. The advantages of using a mortgage broker are that they can access many different types of mortgage products and have knowledge of how lenders work. In addition to all of this, there are some risks of not obtaining advice from a professional mortgage broker. One advantage of mortgage brokers is that they are able to locate better deals than a regular consumer can. Because brokers are usually employed by one specific lender, they often know that the interest rates, loan products and other fees will not be available to consumers if they try to get the same information from other lenders. This knowledge helps them find better deals, but also help them steer clear of deals that may turn out to be bad for them. A broker has the ability to steer you away from bad deals while helping you find the best deal at the best interest rate. Another advantage is that a mortgage broker can shop around for you and help you secure the best mortgage possible for your situation. A mortgage broker has access to multiple mortgage lenders, so they can shop around and secure the best deal for your needs. Because a mortgage broker works for just one lender, they can save you time by only having to go with the best deal. The broker has the ability to gather together quotes and find the cheapest, most competitive loans for you. This allows you to go with the building society that has the lowest interest rate while saving you the most money in fees. Not all brokers work for a single lender. There are many brokers on the FHA and VA listings, and this can be beneficial to consumers. There are also many non-profit brokers that can work with both FHA and VA loans. These lenders have lower fees, so many buyers will benefit from choosing a broker that is connected with multiple lenders. A broker working with several different lenders also has more options, which gives you a better chance of finding a good mortgage. Brokers often find mortgage deals through referrals. They receive information about loan offers from people in their own market. Because they are going to work directly with the source, they know what to look for. Many brokers will alert the buyer that a deal is from a sketchy lender and will explain why you should only consider this source. This type of service makes it possible to find competitive loan offers. Fees can also be saved with mortgage brokers if you decide to work with a local lender. Because brokers receive their commission directly from a lender, they are forced to cut any fees they receive in half. This is not always the case, however, and many brokers receive no mortgage broker fees at all.  Every broker sets their own fees that can vary dramatically from broker to broker. The best part about these mortgages is that they allow you to take a look at the same deals from the source that you can. You do not have to travel anywhere to view deals. All you need is a computer with Internet access and you can quickly and easily compare different loans. The same can be achieved with a quick call to a broker.  Brokers may even show you one or two mortgages from their agency, letting you make a decision. Some online brokers do not require you to take action, but you are still responsible for making an initial decision about a mortgage. If you do not like the deal you see, you are free to go and find a better one. One last reason why it makes sense to work with a mortgage broker is that most lenders offer some sort of special circumstances or package. Usually this involves lower interest rates, longer payment periods or other special circumstances that make the loan attractive. These can be great benefits, but there may come a time when they are no longer applicable. In that case, you would need to go back to your lender and apply for a standard loan. While this is not always necessary, it is a good idea to keep your eyes open for special circumstances whenever you start shopping around for your next home."
2,Do You Know Series — Whether To Use A Housing Agent,finance," Very often, Singaporeans buying or selling a home for the first time are completely clueless as to what happens in a property transaction. A real estate agent will be able to clearly explain and guide you through the process from analysing your financial status including available grants for HDB properties to a detailed timeline from sale to purchase and identifying the type of property based on financials and investment objectives. Option-to-purchase? What’s that? When do you put down the downpayment and when do you need to start applying for a bank loan? And what are all these documents they’re asking you to sign? How much will you cash out after the sale? Will there be a negative sale? What do negative sales imply? What other hidden fees prior to net cash? Can you be bothered to do your own research to find out what happens in a property transaction? If the answer is no, you should probably engage an agent to take care of everything for you. Can you be bothered to do your own research and execute the entire transaction on your own? Ultimately, agents are there not because their work is rocket science or anything you couldn’t do on your own if it were a matter of life and death. The real value in hiring an agent is the fact that they give you a whole lot of convenience, and have more complete knowledge of the market and how to smoothly affect a property transaction (from purchase/sale to completion). In general, a real estate agent is more than someone publishing a sale listing on related platforms. He/she brings along with them a wealth of experience in analysing finances, managing and planning the process in transition to completing the offer and transaction. It protects both the buyers’ and the sellers’ interests and minimises any pitfalls that may occur. Reach out to HeyJoles if you need any further consultation or advice on any realty queries."

Financial freedom starts with establishing your net worth by listing down all your debts, cash on hands, savings, and investment. NET WORTH = (Liquid + non-liquid + other non-liquid assets) - (immediate liabilities + long-term debt). Liquid assets are easily convertible into cash Non-liquid assets are not easily convertible into cash, for example, house Other non-liquid assets for a longer period (insurance products) Immediate Liabilities are debts payable within one to two years Long-term debt is payable beyond one to two years The overall net worth should be positive. Making a budget and stick to it is key in guaranteeing bills payments while you check the living costs to ease the temptation of spending lavishly. Achieving budgetary change is by establishing areas of expenditure. A proper savings plan comes by identifying where money is leaking. Track expenditure ranging from major bills to coffee bills. Debts are the biggest hindrance to achieving financial goals. Some debts accrue acute interest hence achieve debt freedom becomes a nightmare if installment payment is low. Getting out debts is one step at a time. Pay off all debts except mortgages (mortgages cut down taxes). Start by paying off small debts first to build momentum for clearing enormous debts. Once a debt is cleared channel its payment to another debt rather than absorbing it into the budget. The aim of an emergency fund is to bail you out in times of financial distress. This fund cushions you against unexpected events, e.g. job loss or illness. “Everyone needs an emergency pot (of money) for three to six months of expenses,” McGrath says. Multiple streams of income provide an individual with various sources of cash flow. This is a fallback plan in the event of job loss or financial constraints. Stable sources of income guarantee earlier retirement plans, paying off debts, and future investment opportunities. Conclusion Examine yourself based on the outlined tips and identify areas of amendments in your finances. Saving money, controlling expenditure, and minimize your debt leads to financial freedom. This ensures better provision for oneself and family. Who doesn’t want to be debt-free?"
4,The role of the Federal Reserve in the midst of the Covid-19 economic crisis : a renewed mandate?,finance," The role of the Federal Reserve in the midst of the Covid-19 economic crisis : a renewed mandate for the Central Bank of the United States? In the past decades, notably since its Chairman Paul Volcker (1979-1987), the Federal Reserve has already proven throughout various crisis that it was able to act rapidly and effectively. This is especially true more recently, with the redefinition of its role when the FED was confronted to the very severe financial crisis of 2007-2011 and today, in the midst of a worldwide economic meltdown due to the virus Covid-19. Indeed, contrary to the ""Free Market Economic Theory"" of Adam Smith and its non interventionist policy during the Great Depression of 1929-1939 in particular, the Federal Reserve has recently been able to provide at times seemingly ""unlimited"" financing and stabilize the economy, acting not only as a lender but peculiarly as a ""savior"" of last resort. Therefore, in light of the current economic crisis due to the dramatic effects of Covid-19, the impact of inflation in the US should be moderated by the gradual actions taken by the Federal Reserve, in accord with its mandate: ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"" (Federal Reserve Act in 1977). While reaffirming constantly his commitment to realize the mandate of the Federal Reserve, Jérôme Powell, its actual Chairman is also contributing to change the way of communicating with financial markets operators and economic forces, differentiating further from past behaviors of central bankers. In fact, following the steps of Ben Bernanke (Chairman of the Federal Reserve, from 2006 to 2014) during the 2007 crisis, J. Powell is not acting and communicating as a central banker focusing merely to sanction any excesses. He is ""working and exchanging"" very openly and proactively with these forces, in order to provide solutions to the crisis, along with a thorough and predictable road map of measures to be implemented. For now, the bond market is not speculating an imminent surge of inflation. From a yield of 1.70% in early March 2021, the 10-year Treasury Note yield is currently sitting at historically low level, hitting 1.16% on july 20. Moreover, from the ""whatever it takes"" approach and the reality of current high inflation reports due to a strong pent up demand of goods and services after an extreme global ""economic suppression"" in 2020, the Federal Reserve is gearing its efforts to manage the most realistic scenario of a rapid ""V shape"" economic recovery. However, the current relatively high inflation (above 5%) shall be transitory. It is likely to decrease to the FED sustainable and desirable level around 2% (pre-pandemic level), once this abnormal growth of economic demand logically recedes over the next 12 months (The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judges that ""inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate""). Finally, despite an understandable short term high level of volatile reading of inflation, the trending strategy of  ""don't fight the FED"" is more valid than ever. Specifically, the endeavors of the Federal Reserve to do ""everything"" to support the economy in regards to its renewed mandate are being nowadays transparently and concretely forwarded farther. It gives subsequently, a comprehensive pathway to overall economic forces and undoubtedly to financial markets institutions."
5,How To Get A Cheaper Mortgage,finance," When you buy a home, one of the most important things you will have to do is work on how to get a cheaper mortgage. If you already own your home, or if you plan to purchase one soon, there are many ways to achieve this goal. First, start by asking yourself what factors are important in choosing a mortgage lender. Second, consider interest rates and closing costs. Before shopping for a new mortgage, use interest rates calculator to calculate how much you could afford to spend each month. Using a mortgage payment calculator, figure out how much money you could save if you were to refinance with a different lender. Mortgage calculators are available free online, and they can quickly determine how much you could save with a refinancing. Use them before deciding which lender to go with. Your debt-to-income ratio is important when choosing a mortgage. This ratio measures your debt relative to your annual income. The higher the debt-to-income ratio, the greater your risk of defaulting on a loan. The better your credit score, the better your options will be when it comes to finding the right subprime mortgage. Mistakes when looking for a mortgage Many borrowers make the mistake of believing that all lenders are the same. In truth, there are subprime mortgage lenders that specifically deal with bad credit mortgages. These companies specialize in dealing with borrowers who don't have high credit scores and who are struggling to meet their financial obligations. They can help you get approved at a better interest rate. If your credit score has dropped, you don't have to give up on your ability to get approved for a mortgage refinance. There are many steps you can take to improve your credit score. One thing you can do to improve your score is to pay down your debt. By paying off high-interest debt, you'll improve your debt-to-income ratio and give yourself better financing options. Another thing you can do to improve your credit score is to make sure you always have adequate money for monthly expenses, including home payments and any other loans or debt you may owe. A mortgage calculator can help you figure out the amount of money you need in order to afford your mortgage. Mortgage calculators will show you how much your payment would be based on your current financial situation and income. If your income is lower than your mortgage payment, there are things you can do to improve your situation. You can change jobs or start to work part-time or increase your hours at your current job. Another option is to take on a second job or save up more money to make a larger down payment on a new house. A mortgage calculator can help you figure out the amount of money you need to save or reduce your monthly payment. Lenders with poor credit Alt-A Mortgage lenders are beginning to deal exclusively with borrowers who don't have perfect credit. Alt-A mortgages were specifically designed for borrowers who had a bad credit score or a low FICO score. With the subprime mortgage crisis that occurred a few years back, many people fell into this category. Alt-A mortgages were created to help these borrowers who couldn't qualify for prime rates by providing them with a solution for their financial problems. If your credit is good, and you have a reasonable income and expenses, you could be a candidate for an alt-a mortgage. In order to find out if you qualify, you'll want to obtain a copy of your credit report from all three credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union. You'll want to check your report carefully to see exactly what errors exist and if any of them could be responsible for keeping your interest rate too high. It's important to improve your credit score in order to qualify for the best possible interest rate. Once you've found any errors, you'll need to dispute them in order to get them corrected. If your FICO isn't as high as you'd like, you may still qualify for a better interest rate. Mortgage lenders are competing for your business, and they need to offer competitive interest rates in order to keep borrowers happy. Prime mortgages are known for having lower interest rates and longer terms. Because of this, it's important to look around at different mortgage lenders and find one that will offer you a prime mortgage at an interest rate that you can easily afford. Unfortunately, if you've had financial difficulties in the past, you may not qualify for prime mortgages. You'll want to check into getting a subprime mortgage instead, as subprime mortgages often come with lower interest rates than standard prime mortgages. Lenders are hesitant to give out prime mortgages due to the increased risk, but many subprime mortgages have better terms than standard prime mortgages. Many borrowers end up refinancing their subprime mortgages after a few years, when their interest rates have dropped significantly, resulting in lower monthly payments."
6,The Averaging strategy in the share market,finance," INTRODUCTION Investors must realise that investing in the markets has its ups and downs (literally) that it is important to keep it all into the right perspective if investments do not go your way. There is a method of playing the markets in a way that you can take advantage of the market drops. The Art of Averaging Averaging is a term one may come across in the markets now and again; what this refers to is the average price paid for a particular share if you had bought shares in that particular company. To calculate the average price paid for a particular share you add up the total amount you have paid for the shares and divide that by the number of shares you have bought in that company. The answer is the average amount that you have paid per share. Try this mathematical question: There are five numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 What is the average number? The calculation: Add up the five numbers:  10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150 Divide the total of the five numbers (150) by 5 150 divided by 5 = 30 (answer) You can do this easily with a calculator. There are so many share trading platforms available these days that investing directly into the sharemarket has never been easier for the ordinary man and women. So how does averaging work? If you purchase stock at regular intervals you will pay different prices for each stock because share prices go up and down. Imagine if you bought something at the supermarket last week at the full price then bought the same item this week on special. The average price you paid for the item will be somewhere between the higher price and the lower price. The sharemarket works like that. By purchasing a particular stock at regular intervals you will manage to pick up some shares in it when the price is lower. This is the advantage of saving regularly. In fact I think there is a case for purchasing more shares when the price is low. The average price paid per share is determined by calculations as explained earlier. The averaging strategy can also be used in cryptocurrency investing. Bitcoin is more volatile than the sharemarket so an astute investor who has an eye for a bargain can invest when the price has dropped. There are so many share trading platforms available that playing the markets are accessible to everyone. I have joined two of them in New Zealand. Most countries have share trading platforms available. Signing up for them is easy; you require some form of identification. Just follow the directions and you are all set up. TO SUMMARISE Playing the markets requires a positive mindset and a cool head. If you have these you can profit from falling markets. Averaging is a method that takes advantage of falling markets."

11,"FHA and Conventional loans, which is better?",finance," For many first time homebuyers with limited finances for down payments, both conventional and FHA loans are available to facilitate the purchase of your new dwelling. While both can help you solve your problems, it is essential to know which is better than the other and what makes it the best. So which is the best? FHA and conventional loans can be better but depending on the borrower's needs, status and preference. It is quite difficult to qualify for a conventional loan, but it also has a higher loan limit if you do qualify. In this case, FHA loans seem to be the best choice when you have a lower credit score. Although you might not be eligible for a conventional loan, you should not leave it at that point; you have an option to help you buy your dream home. This loan is FHA because federal Housing Administration-approved lenders offer it with few restrictions. Why FHA Loan is the Best ·      You can qualify for a loan with a five hundred and eight credit score ·      It allows for a higher debt to income ratio of up to fifty percent ·      All homes like mobile homes, multifamily properties, condos, and single-family homes are eligible for the loan. ·      The loan has low integer rates. ·      The loan has adjustable and fixed-rate loan options. Cons of the Loan While FHA loans are the best, they have their drawbacks. ·      You must stay in the property as your primary home ·      You must pay lease insurance ·      Sometimes the interest rates can be higher Mortgage Insurance Requirements For you to qualify for a mortgage loan, it is obligatory to pay a mortgage insurance premium. Lenders need this insurance to compensate for the risk of lending at favorable conditions. ·      You will need to pay for a one-time mortgage insurance premium proportional to your first loan. ·      The other requirement is the paying of an insurance mortgage annually. Conclusion Loans are meant to help someone in a financial crisis but still need money for essential things like home buying. While both conventional and FHA loans are helpful, FHA loans tend to be better because of the more minor requirements."

This, in essence, decides the length of time it takes for you to receive your refund. So, if at all necessary, register electronically. You'll get your money back sooner! Tip #2: Make a claim for credits and deductions. Quite likely, you'll use your tax return to demand a few deductions and credits, such as RRSP contributions and charitable donations. All of this is good and dandy. However, you might be able to make a stronger case. There are numerous tax deductions available, including home office space, tuition, student loan interest, and so on. The more claims you make, the less you will have to pay. If you're unsure, consult an accountant, who will help you determine which deductions and credits you're eligible for. Tip #3: Don’t forget your investments! Last but not least, don't forget to claim your investment gain when filing your taxes with the Canada Revenue Agency. The CRA receives this information from banks and brokers, but it is also your responsibility to include it on your tax return. You could face penalties or fines if you don't report it. By filing your investment taxes meticulously, you can save a lot of money. Stocks come with a number of credits that can save you a lot of money. Both of these credits are available if you correctly file your taxes. Assume you had $100,000 invested in the iShares S&P/TSX 60 Index Fund (TSX:XIU). That's a 2.5 percent dividend yielding large-cap TSX portfolio. On a $100,000 investment, the yield translates to $2,500 in annual dividends. That's a substantial sum of money. You might believe you'd have to pay a lot of taxes on it. But reconsider. Dividends are eligible for a large tax credit. The dividends are increased by 38 percent, taking the total to $3,450. The grossed-up sum is then subjected to a 15% tax credit. What's the end result? A tax credit of $517! And you can get it with a regular brokerage account — no RRSP or TFSA needed! Capital gains tax status is potentially also more lenient. If you made a 10% ($10,000) profit on your XIU stock, you would only have to pay taxes on half of it. When opposed to work revenue, this essentially cuts the tax rate in half. That's a significant amount of tax savings, but only if you file your taxes on time. If you don't, fines will eat away at your savings."

16,When Are Corporate and Personal Taxes Due in Canada in 2021?,finance," 2021 Tax Due Dates for Canadians The new year has arrived, and as diligent accountants, we're already making plans for 2021. To get things started, we'll go through the most important tax deadlines that Canadian taxpayers will face this year. We will look at: Personal Tax Deadlines in 2021 Corporate Tax Deadlines in 2021, and GST / HST Deadlines in 2021 Personal Tax Deadlines 2021 SELF-EMPLOYED Your tax return is due on June 15, 2021, whether you or your spouse received business income in 2021. Taxes owing are still due on April 30, 2021, even if the actual filing of the return isn't due until June. NOT SELF-EMPLOYED If neither you nor your spouse earns self-employment income, your tax return and any owing taxes are due on April 30, 2021. For taxpayers, this is the most common situation. TAX INSTALLMENTS If you are required to pay tax installments in 2021, they are due: March 15th June 15th September 15th December 15th RRSP CONTRIBUTION DEADLINE You have until Monday, March 1, 2021 to contribute to your RRSP and have it reduce your 2020 tax owing. Corporate Tax Deadlines Corporate tax deadlines vary from personal tax deadlines in a few ways. Corporations may have year-ends other than December 31st for tax purposes. We can, however, easily determine when your corporate tax returns and owed amounts are due. CORPORATE TAX RETURNS Corporate tax returns are due six months after the end of the fiscal year. Let's look at a couple of examples: When the corporation's tax year end is on the last day of a month, the return is due by the last day of the 6th month after the year-end. For example, a December 31, 2020 year end would have a June 30, 2021 due date. When the last day of the tax year is not the last day of a month, the return is due the same day of the 6th month after the year-end. For example, a September 15, 2020 year end would have a March 15, 2021 year end. CORPORATE TAXES OWING The deadlines for paying outstanding balances are set earlier than the deadlines for filing tax returns. The short version is that taxes owing are due 2 months after the year-end. However, there is an exception that is very common. Corporate taxes are due 3 months after the year-end if the following criteria apply: The corporation is a Canadian Controlled Private Corporation. The corporation claimed the small business deduction for the current or previous year. The corporation and all associated corporations (if applicable) had taxable income less than $500,000 in the previous year. Since the above exemption is so common, there's a fair chance your corporate taxes will be due three months after the end of the year. Because it’s a bit trickier, we recommend asking your accountant or sending us a message to make sure you’ve got the right date. GST / HST Deadlines There are a few common scenarios for GST/HST return due dates. MONTHLY FILERS When GST returns are filed on a monthly basis, the return and any outstanding amounts are due one month after the reporting period ends. A filing period of June 1-30, for example, means the return is due on July 31st. QUARTERLY FILERS When filing quarterly GST returns, the return and any outstanding amounts are due one month after the reporting period ends. For example, a filing period of July 1 to September 30 means the return is due on October 31st. ANNUAL FILERS (EXCEPT INDIVIDUALS WITH DECEMBER 31 YEAR-ENDS) When a business that is not an individual files an annual GST return, the return and any owed sums are due three months after the reporting period ends. For example, if the filing period is July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, the return is due September 30, 2021. ANNUAL FILERS (INDIVIDUALS WITH DECEMBER 31 YEAR-ENDS) Individuals who file GST on a yearly basis and have December 31, 2020 as their fiscal and tax year-end have slightly different deadlines. They correspond to the tax deadlines for self-employed people. The following are the deadlines for 2021: GST owing is due April 30, 2021 Filing of the GST returns is due June 15, 2021 If you have any questions or need clarification about when something is due, reach out to your accounting firm in Toronto or message us. We truly enjoy helping and we take pride in being organized and making sure that we don’t miss deadlines!"

18,What Are Forex Signals?,finance," Forex signals started as a natural evolution of financial markets. They solve the most monotonous actions any trader is likely to perform. As expected, they help identify great trading opportunities while predicting the best entries. By definition, a Forex signal is a recommendation on a specified financial pair to be executed at an upcoming price and time. Whether you're a beginner or expert, Forex signals can help you enhance your trading activities. Also, seasoned traders can expand their profitability and ROI using great Forex signals. For new traders, forex signals are a must, as traders can earn while they learn about the markets and eventually become successful Forex traders. The signals also help shorten the learning curve.  As new traders attempt to understand the logic behind the signals, they can get a complete insight into which trading options the signal is based on.

This is one reason the Premier Forex League prefers live streaming signals over SMS, email, or push notifications. We use our own trading platform that live streams as our signals show without delay. Classification of Forex Signals There are basically three classifications of Forex trading signals. Manual vs. Automated Forex Signals This classification is based on how the signals are generated. Manual forex signals are generated by an individual. In contrast, automated trading signals are generated by computer software that tracks and analyses price action based on proprietary algorithms. Entry vs. Exit Forex Signals This classification is based on trade detail. Some providers only provide entry signals, while others provide both entry and exit. Longer-term trading rooms usually only provide entry signals. But, on short-term intraday trading signals, a trade suggestion will contain both entry and exit signals. Paid vs. Free Forex Signals This classification is based solely on the price of a provider. Some providers offer free Forex signals, while others require payment. Paid signals such as ours are charged on a monthly basis. As previously mentioned, there can be manual and automatic signal providers. Manual signal providers can be professional and experienced traders, market analyzers, and strategists. They generate Forex signals based on their trading knowledge, experience, fundamental and technical analysis skills, or personal strategies. Automated providers usually use algorithms coded to generate trading signals when specific parameters are reached in the market. Automated signal providers, such as Expert Advisors (EAs) like us here at the Premier Forex League, mainly apply technical analysis methods that rely on mathematical predictive indicators, such as Moving Averages, Fibonacci levels, Price Action, Price Channels, and Stochastics.

1,4 Reasons why it is Beneficial to make a Down Payment for your Car,finance," A down payment is the percentage of the car price that you pay upfront to the dealer. It is the amount before getting an auto loan. Lenders usually want you to pay a small amount of down payment to assess your financial credibility. The usual proportion for a down payment is 20% of the purchase price for the new car. And, it is 10% of the price for the used cars. Why is Down Payment Essential for a Car Buyer? Here are the four reasons which prove the importance of making a down payment: Making a down payment helps you to get car loan approval. When you are paying a particular amount for your car upfront, the lenders not only judge you as a credible borrower, but their risk also reduces in the process. If you choose not to make the monthly payments later, their overall loss will be lower. Thus, if you want to get auto loan approval, make a down payment. It will solve your troubles, especially if you have a bad credit score. Since a down payment reduces the amount of loan you need, your monthly payments will also go down. It will lessen your financial burden while you repay the loan. And, thus, it will give you peace of mind. It will also enable you to make monthly payments on time even in the face of other expenses such as car maintenance, car insurance, student loans, mortgages, etc. It will improve your creditworthiness and credit score. The more money you give as the down payment, the lesser will be the auto loan amount. It means you will have to pay interest on a smaller loan amount. Not only this, but your interest rates will also reduce because the lender has more faith in your financial capabilities. Hence with a significant down payment amount, you can reduce your financial costs as well. A new vehicle loses at least 25% of its value in the first year. If you do not make a substantial amount of down payment while buying the automobile, the asset value may depreciate quickly. The auto loan amount will remain higher than the market value of the vehicle. Hence, if you make a down payment, you can reduce the loan amount. You will also owe the lender far less than before. Down payment is essential for everyone including, first-time car buyers. When you buy a car for the first time, it is harder to get auto loan approval. Hence, you must conduct thorough research and pay a substantial amount upfront while buying the vehicle. It will improve your creditworthiness, and so, the lenders will help you get your first car loan. What to do when you have No Down Payment? Although making a down payment is vital for so many reasons, few people cannot arrange it. The reason for that lies in the low cash flow available to them and the lack of financing options. But if you need to apply for a car loan without making a down payment, you can still manage to achieve your goals with the help of a few tips: a. Improve your credit score to improve your creditworthiness. It may take some time to remove past financial mistakes from your credit report. So, you must choose this option if you have a couple of months to buy the car. b. Getting a co-signer to share your burden is another technique of getting an auto loan without a down payment. A co-signer can also provide you with credibility. c. Also, a few lenders provide no down payment auto loans to their applicants. Search online for such lenders and negotiate a car loan deal to your benefit. Down payment is essential. But, if you cannot manage the cash for your down payment, you should give up on buying your favorite car.

2,Identity Theft Protection for Your Children,finance," As a parent of children on the internet, our first instinct is to protect them and make sure they understand to never give out their name or other personal information to anyone. But, just like in the case of an airplane emergency, the parent actually needs to protect themselves first in order to best protect their children second. This also applies in the case of identity theft protection. The truth is, with more kids currently being educated through the internet, both adults and children are extra vulnerable to having their identities stolen. More than 1 million children in the U.S. were identity theft victims, resulting in losses of $2.67 billion, according to a child identity fraud study by Javelin Strategy & Research. No one is too young to be targeted, with two-thirds of the victims under the age of eight. Another 20 percent are eight to 12 years old. It’s important to make sure your identity is protected from criminals and then extend that protection to your children and other family members, so your lives aren’t turned upside down because of identity theft. Why are children’s identities stolen? Criminals gravitate towards children’s identities because they know they are less likely to spend their time monitoring their own online activity. Kids are online to communicate with their friends, not check their bank account balance. Criminals can use you or your child’s stolen Social Security number (SSN) and other personal information to open new credit cards and other credit lines, make fraudulent purchases, change your billing address and even obtain a driver’s license in you or your child’s name. The longer the activity goes undetected, the more is stolen. This criminal activity can negatively affect you and your children’s lives for years. Sometimes the theft isn’t detected until a child turns 18 and wants to begin establishing their own credit. Keeping everyone’s identity safe Only share your child’s or your SSN and other identifying information with trustworthy organizations for official purposes, such as school registration. Make sure your child understands to never give out this number or any other personal information such as their address or phone number to anyone. Whenever you do submit personal information, ask how the organization will protect it. Also inform your kids not to click on links or pop-up advertisements while they are on their phones or doing their homework. Sometimes malware is automatically downloaded onto devices just by clicking on links. Same is true for links inside an email. If you receive a call requesting personal information about you or your child, don’t immediately assume it’s legitimate, assume it’s fraudulent instead. Hang up and call the organization back if you think it is an official phone number. A live person that can identify themselves will answer if it is legitimate. Shred or burn any documents with you or your child’s personal information before you throw them away or put them in the recycling bin outside. Monitoring your identity and credit is essential to protecting your family. A credit and identity protection service can help provide you with alerts when your SSN is used, so you can act quickly if your personal information is at risk. In certain plans, you can add your children for family protection. Whether you’ve already been a victim of identity theft or you want to be proactive about staying safe from fraud, you should always keep updated on your credit activity through the use of the most powerful software available. Remember. The best program does the work for you, so you don’t have to worry or give it a second thought."

During his 13-year reign as Fidelity Magellan Fund Manager between 1977 and 1990, Lynch helped Fidelity Fund surpassed the US stock market index S&P 500 with a mind-blowing 29% average annual return which means every $1 invested in his fund year in 1977 turned to $27 by the end of his management.

4,"The Stock Market Investing Secrets of John Templeton, one of the World’s Greatest Stock Market Investors",finance," Are you looking to build a profitable investment portfolio? If yes, you should strive to discover the stock market investing secrets of John Templeton, one of the best stock market investors in the world during his lifetime. He began his career on Wall Street in 1937, and he took just three years before buying a small investment advisory which was valued at just $2 million. Thanks to Templeton's practical business approach and ideas, the stake rose to $400 million in 1967 when he chose to sell it to interested buyers. The very committed American-born British investor didn't rest on his laurels; he took a step further by venturing into the mutual fund business when he launched the Templeton Growth Fund in 1954. Thirty-eight years after its establishment, the fund averaged a +14.5% annualized gain as it outperformed larger stock market indexes before selling it to the Franklin Group. Late John Templeton was a fearless investor who never shies away from taking risks. He loved investing in companies many believed were far from maximizing their full potential. Company's location, net worth, sales rate, and financial capacity doesn't mean Templeton as he was willing to do business with both young companies aiming for steady growth. Talking of his records and achievements during his 95-year existence, Templeton was among the first people to invest in postwar-Japan. He was equally among the first to sell out of Japan in the mid-1980s. How did he manage these feats, what were his secrets and sources of inspiration? Here are some answers below: • He isn't afraid of taking Calculated Risks The stock market involves taking calculated risks if you must become a role model to upcoming investors. Templeton bought $100 shares in more than 104 companies ($1 or less per one) tipped for bankruptcy due to the European war in 1939. In the end, his investment gave birth to more than $40,000 because all but four companies survived the scare. • Templeton is a Value Investor Templeton was goal-oriented and a fundamental investor who knew what he wanted and did everything to get it. He maps out a “bargain-hunting” investing approach, which played a massive role in his success story. He focused on stock's value instead of trends or outlooks. • He distinguished himself from other investors by doing what they fail to do Templeton found the best strategy that suits his philosophy, and he stuck to it, even when others were doing something different. • He explored the 50/50 Rule of investment To be successful, you must know how much you earn, how much you spend, and how much you invest. According to Templeton, an investor who desires to succeed must learn to invest 50% of his earnings while spending the other 50%. The Bottom Line As much as you already have a unique investing strategy, deploying some of Templeton's secrets won't be a wrong move. Instead, it would boost your chances of getting a spot among the world's successful stock market investors within the shortest period."
5,Investing In Stocks,finance," There are some common misconceptions about stocks in general. The public has a view that only the super wealthy 1% should be involved in the stock market. However, this isn't true. With brokerages that offer commission free trades like Robinhood and Fidelity, you can purchase fractional shares and still benefit from the stock market long term. In this article, I want to talk about some of the reasons for investing in the stock market. First off, I want to talk about what inflation is and why it matters. If you visit the grocery store regularly, you will quickly realize that your favorite yogurt prices rising each year. Or maybe your favorite brand of almond milk is a lot more expensive than it used to be. This is what inflation is. It's the prices of things around you increasing. Let's say that you make fifty grand a year and your living costs are thirty grand, you would have around twenty grand left for savings. Forget about taxes for a moment. But as the federal reserve came out and claimed that the inflation target is 2% a year. This means that what cost a $1 today will cost $1.02 next year. You might think that's not a big issue but your living costs are thirty grand now which means that at this rate, your living costs will become $30,600 next year. Wait a minute. Your salary stays the same because your employers don't give you a raise every single year. Eventually, you start to lose purchasing power, which is what you can afford with your salary. This is where investing comes into play. The scenario described above is the most fundamental reason for investing, but you may also wonder why the federal reserve would set an inflationary target of 2%. This is because they want to the economy to expand which creates more jobs. Job creations are a good indication of how well the economy is doing. If prices are rising a little bit each year, big corporations or individuals with deep pockets, will soon realize that the cash they are holding onto are losing value each year, so they will make big purchases now instead of later. When these people or corporations make big purchases, it drives up the demand slightly which forces the supply to increase as well in order to match the pace at which the demand is increasing. This increases real economic output and that tells us whether the economy is actually expanding or contracting. Now you don't have to be a genius who picks every single stock correctly. You can invest into an S&P 500 index fund that tracks the economy. As the economy continues to expand, you can take advantage of that. Although you may not get the most return for your money, but your risk is very diversified. Instead of riding on one company, you have five hundred top US companies to balance out your portfolio. The companies that don't perform well will get balanced out by the ones that do. I recommend checking this blog for further info: https://thegeekyinvestor.blogspot.com/"
6,Is it a good idea to invest in Amazon stock?,finance," Is it a good idea to invest in Amazon? Amazon is a huge multinational company; the stocks are valuable, and have proven themselves as lucrative to early investors time and time again as the company experiences huge growth and change. Although the market is quite stagnant right now, it seems a good time to invest as the company reaches the brink of breakthrough with new products and services that may revolutionise our lives as we know them, and increase the value of the company, and its stocks, even more. Stock Currently, the Amazon stock price is neither rising nor falling significantly. After a drop from just over $2000 dollars in July of 2019, the Amazon stock price has not fully recovered, and now has hovered between approximately $1700 and $1900. Currently, the price is at $1898.00, after a growth during the Christmas period, which may mark the beginning of a recovery for Amazon stock. Clearly, since the birth of the company in 1997, the stock has grown hugely, but may be beginning to slow after years of market success. Competitor eBay is experiencing a similar plateau in stock price, having spent 2019 moving between $27.02 and $42.00; despite the growth in online shopping, it appears that the stock price is currently fairly stagnant, although Amazon stock comes at a much higher cost. Equity Assets for Amazon has been a consistently (and significantly) growing figure. In 2019, the total assets owned by Amazon reached $199.099 billion, and of this, $43.401 billion was held a cash. The figure of cash held by Amazon has also significantly grown (by 45.81%) this year alone, pointing to a growth in the strength of the company even if stock price has remained fairly stagnant. Since 2017, the long-term debt attributed to Amazon has fallen to $22.472 billion, whilst total liabilities have reached $142.591 billion. This leaves the company with quite a low shareholder equity, given its size, at just $56.508 billion. This figure is, however, rising, suggesting that the company has continued to, and will continue to grow in size and strength despite the relatively high debt. Looking to the future As a giant company, Amazon is constantly developing to keep up with technological advances, and is often leading the charge. With developments to the home assistant Alexa, shortening delivery times and piloting their new streaming service, Prime Video, it is hard to imagine Amazon suffering many failures in the near future. Alongside this, the company is developing cashless, cashier-less stores based in facial recognition technology, and in AI and home robots. Undoubtedly, Amazon is set to release products that will change the way our world functions, and will become more and more integral to human existence itself, and therefore experience huge company growth that may translate into more valuable shares."

Developing a mindset that can catapult you to financial success is the only way to earn wealth aside from getting it through inheritance.  It could also be the only way to sustain your millions once you have them. The right mindset comes from thinking positively, self-awareness, continuous learning, skills development and enhancement, and creating productive habits. Hard work is also significant to improve your lifestyle and habits. Without the right mindset, a person can neither have the strength of character to attain his goals or continually improve and enhance his skills to sustain his sources of income. Thinking well like a multimillionaire will serve you well in life, and not just limited to earning millions. Unleashing that millionaire mindset in you will help you get rid of bad habits and develop the characteristics that attract success in whatever it is that you focus on. With the right mindset, you can achieve your goal of making your fortune via the following investment channels •	Entrepreneurship (Startup and Digital Transformation) •	Real Estate •	Stocks Investing •	Trading (Cryptocurrencies, FOREX, Futures Contract, and Options Trading) •	eCommerce Once you have unleashed that millionaire mindset in you, you can’t simply get back to where you were before. Learning to control yourself, increasing your knowledge, and enhancing your skills to develop what it takes to earn huge profits is not easily learned nor sustained unless you have this deep intent to make it. In all things, the right intention and consistency in action are what set apart millionaires from ordinary people. The will to take steps to make it happen even when it means sacrifices and hard work is the key to achieving access. With your millionaire mindset, you are your best resource – the secret success formula. You can easily equip yourself with all the tools to manage yourself and your business and the insurance against all risks that may threaten your wealth generators. How to Develop a Millionaire Mindset to Help Your Earn Your Millions If you aspire to be a multimillionaire or even a billionaire at some point in your life, you need to have a clear intention of why you want it. Many successful businesses and investors would teach you that success is not about the money but what the money can do for you. Start With Your Vision You must be very clear on your WHY – as in, why do you want to earn at least ten million in the soonest possible time? What will be the positive impact of achieving it and the negative impact it will bring if you are not able to attain your goal? When we have a clear vision of what is about to happen, there is an exponential increase in the inspired action that we are about to take towards achieving this particular goal. Successful people, regardless of what business they are into are always clear on the impact and legacy they’re building. The greater you connect to that impact, the more will you will have to do even with those inconvenient and uncomfortable things that result in rapid growth and big. Furthermore, multimillionaires are living in the “now. Instead of putting things off, they immediately take action, regardless, of how scary and impossible it may appear at the moment. Knowing that what you’re doing is right when combined with the “now” mentality is sure to push you to achieve what you greatly desire. Know Your Passion When you are passionate about what you do, it’s not working at all for you. The love that you have for what you do allows money to inevitably flow towards you. When you have this mindset or shifting your mindset to loving what you do will provide you extra powers to pursue success through your passion. This is what gives you the consistency in doing things that you have committed yourself to accomplish. Cultivate a Growth Mindset Millionaires and billionaires endlessly pursue personal growth hence; they are coachable. Most often, when one seeks wise counsel, they negatively respond to feedback. Recognize the fact that a coach sees you and your business from an outside perspective. Place your full trust and confidence in your coach, for he has the wisdom and the outlook which you lack at this point. The more willing you are to accept feedback, the faster your business and investment will grow, and the more you are near to earning your millions. Focused on Providing Solution to Target Market Needs Identify the problem that your business is solving – being focused on solutions means that you can see a solution to an issue that others failed to see. So, in any crisis, the mind of a millionaire knows that there is always a solution to any problem. Regardless of any circumstances, they can see opportunities behind every issue. For them, even failures had their benefits. It is only a matter of trying to see what is behind every issue to identify the solution. By focusing on the solution instead of the issue, a positive mind is not easily rattled in a situation that may easily derail others. So the bigger you grow, the greater are the risks, responsibilities, and problems. Millionaires are excited to find solutions because they know that helping people is the key to success. Evaluate Risks Against Profitability A business always entails risks and profitability, which is why a successful leader makes sure that they weigh all pros and cons before making a decision, and, when they do, they make sure that the profitability always outweighs the risks. Continue Learning Life is a continuing process, and so is a successful business or investment. If you want to maintain what you have gained, you have to go on learning. Life itself provides you with the wisdom and knowledge you need through your experience or those of others who gained mastery in the industry before you. Whatever learning process you have to undergo, continue learning, and consistently learn from failures for mastery is perfected through them. Hone Your Leadership Skills Focusing on your leadership skills can create a dramatic shift in your personal life and business. As you grow and enhance your leadership skills, the more you are attracting people with leadership potentials in your business organizations. People who have the right mindset think like a millionaire even before they become one, and by doing so, they attract the necessary resources to help them achieve success. If you want to be a millionaire, start with the right mindset. Think like a millionaire so you can have what a millionaire has, for this will allow you to take the inspired actions that a millionaire takes. The end process is SUCCESS, which transforms you into what you dream you become – a TRUE MULTIMILLIONAIRE! Isn’t it time for you to start developing a millionaire mindset?"
8,Charity: The Greatest Money-making Secret,finance," Elizabeth W.Dunn, and Michael I. Norton, of the University of British Columbia and Harvard business school, were selected to spend money. During this process, a certain amount was assigned to spend on others and themselves. Results revealed that people who spend money on others experienced happiness. From the description above, we have shown how the benefits of giving go beyond the simple feel-good factor. In today’s world, charity is one of the greatest money-making secrets. I’m sure you’re wondering how? Yes! It may sound awful, but reports found that donating to charity improves health and wellbeing. Islam, Christianity, and other religions place a great emphasis and reward on giving charity in secret. While this money is given, the organization put money in reserve. It's no doubt that excess cash is allocated. Today, a lot of philanthropists are competing with countless billionaires to talk about charity. In fact, Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates visited the Daily Show with Trevor Noah. They talked about the importance of international aid and philanthropy. Since getting rich or attaining financial freedom is essential, how do you go about that? The secret is to put money into perspective. However, you’ll have to decide whether or not you get fulfillment from charity organizations. It feels good to make a difference in the lives of others. At the same time, you can be very generous in making your cool cash. Investing in charity is a worthwhile endeavor, but you can also be richer being a charity. Less poetically, the idea is this: Giving makes you rich. On the other hand, it quite backward-sounds to economics that charity is the greatest money-making secret. You obviously need to have money, right? Or in the pithy words, would you love to have money without being a Good Samaritan alone? Why Charity is The Greatest Money-making Secret According to the Volunteering in America report from the corporate for National and Community Service, the percentage of people who volunteer their time to a good cause every year is 30%. Now, you can make your way from these fundraising events. Below are the reasons why you could make money. ●	You can raise more than $1 million from annual gala events ●	Selling a product for the cause is a moneymaker for many charities ●	Advertising and promotion can expand a charity’s reach leading to more profit ●	Celebrity endorsement can multiply the impact of making more money ●	It brings a lucrative revenue stream when charities launch a cookie sale to raise money. Furthermore, when every cause seems like a worthy one to people, it’s essential to have a strategy for giving that is proactive rather than reactive. Meanwhile, you don’t need to compromise the purpose of the charity organization. So, ensure the giving or organization has the most impact through fundraising. Bottom Line Understand what your donation achieves and listen more than you speak. Examine your relationship with philanthropists and source for funds through various means. With this, you can make 2021 a year of real, lasting progress for your charity organization."

10,3 Methods Financial Companies Use to Get New Clients,finance," Nowadays, financial companies have to be as creative as they can because of the rapid changes that are going around the world. By changes, I mean the new ways in which customer-based companies offer their clients services that are more likely to be liked or believed by the customers. There are a lot of financial companies on the financial market that offer people different kinds of services, actions and for that, they use many different ways. Since I have observed the general tendencies of the market, and all of them are unique, I tried to single out the 3 most effective ways, which helped companies to become successful in their activities. No-deposit Bonus One of the widely used ways by huge platforms, such as Forex.com or Binance.com was a no-deposit bonus. Other than having no information about the financial market, one more crucial factor which hinders customers is having not enough money to start the trading/investing, for which crypto-platforms offer them the no-deposit option, for only to register on the platform. Disclaimer: the above-mentioned way does not mean that works successfully in any case. For example, the Binance.com platform stopped the no-deposit option, because many people used their parents, friends, or relatives’ IDs without permission, which caused the company a lot of money. Bring a Friend Usually, someone, who googled the information about any company on the financial market, for example in the crypto-industry, is someone who is already interested in it and tries to find the most secure way for it, or is new and wants the information to decide, whether it is worth or not. Moreover, we are encompassed by a group of people around us, especially friends, with whom we share mutual interests. Offer “2 for 1” is boosting people’s positive decision to become the customer of the company, because they offer something, which can be done with your friend and when the price is the same? Why not. Participate in Community Events Last but not least, as my research has shown, people are more acquainted with the companies whose names they have heard not only on one specific occasion but in different ones. Business is not only doing your financial job on the market, it should be taken care of and actively involved in people’s lives through many different projects. This is why successful financial companies are the ones who take care of charity events and organizations. When the customers have heard your company’s name outside the financial sector, credibility increases. This means that your company is financially rightly conducted and the customers should not worry about the financial situation. Their investment, in this case, will be secured. Conclusion Finally, to sum up, due to the fact, that I wanted to emphasize the 3 most important customer-catching ways it does not mean this is the golden formula for any company to become successful in the financial sector. Moreover, these are not the only 3 ways to become successful either, there are many other valid options, but first and foremost,(from my point of view) what customers need from the financial company is credibility (due to the complexity of the issue) and transparency about his/her own case."
11,Blockchain strategies and approaches,finance," Disclaimer: It is worth noting that Blockchain is in its infancy stage. There are no defined set of rules or regulatory bodies. The adoption rate and effectiveness is based on factual research and what we (Blockchain industry) know thus far. No one exactly knows the full effect, benefits, drawbacks, etc for each new blockchain strategy / approach undertaken. Results may vary and the entire Blockchain industry simply does not have a large enough sample size or data to analyze. This article may be thought-provoking and educational to the en-masse. Hegion aims to increase the adoption rate of Blockchain technology among the general public through respectful and responsible promotional efforts. Blockchain Strategy and Approaches Just 3 years back, adoption of blockchain technology was just an afterthought or simply chatter. Fast-forward to 2021, the chatter is beginning to become serious forethought in many organizations across various industries. This article piece is written on the assumption that you have at least a certain degree of knowledge of the Blockchain industry. Like all other industries, due diligence is paramount and one of the main factors is to ensure you deploy the optimal strategy or approach to increase efficiency in your organization. Identify and Set goals The application of Blockchain technology is plentiful and can be applied across a wide spectrum. This can be painstakingly troublesome for companies thinking to implement the technology optimally. Organizations planning on adopting Blockchain should identify issues and points they think they would be able to solve with the implementation of Blockchain. Organizations should map out goals on what they wish or envision for Blockchain to achieve. The organization’s level of the resources such as expertise, knowledge, willingness of top management, etc will affect and influence feasibility of adopting Blockchain into the said organization. Besides the internal locus of control, the organization would also need to take a look into the industry wide environment. Certain industries may be “blockchain-friendly” while Blockchain may be a hindrance in certain industries. If many requirements or answers such as ROI of implementation are still unclear, the organization should reconsider adopting Blockchain technology. Optimizing Blockchain Strategy and Approaches Once an organization has identified issues and is fundamentally ready to adopt Blockchain technology, they should choose the angle of approach and strategies that will best suit them. Hegion has identified and classified the various strategies into four (4) main approaches. Organizations should first need to know where in the industry they wish to be positioned – this would help streamline and optimize their adoption of Blockchain. These approaches have all it’s pros and cons and there are certain other strategies that may cross realm or may not be mentioned in this article. For ease of reference, we have listed down the most common approaches. Industry Leader The “leader” approach must be willing and committed to take advantage of their positional approach to set the standard norms in their industry. Organizations who wish to take this approach would need to understand the resources required and back-end work needed to rally their other stakeholders in their respective ecosystem sphere. Organizations who take this approach will cement their market position in the industry and establish control of the market. Large financial institutions or service providers in the logistic or healthcare industry will usually be candidates for this approach. Pro Able to eliminate “first-mover advantage” disadvantage Few regulatory rules and motions Able to set the tone and greatly influence future regulatory rules when the time is right Establish the market norms and be the de facto leader Cons Constant innovation and actions must be enacted Technology advancement may render any adoption obsolete Governmental oversight may happen quickly that may negatively affect de facto rules and norms Things to take note for “Market Leader” positional approach Resources such as skilled manpower and financial power are usually required Constant R&D, innovation and implementation must be trickled down to all or most stakeholders in the industry ecosystem the organization is in. Slowing down will dissolve any advantages that had been built up by the organization Ideal cooperation such as dialogues with Government regulatory bodies is encouraged. They stand between long-term growth and immediate cessation of service. Disruptors Organizations who identify with the “disruptors” approach are often entering a market which they need not worry about protecting. They are non-dominant and may be practically unknown to the wider community. A disruptor approach would mean offering services that the customers can leverage on – and eliminate steps or finding a more efficient way to reach the customers’ goals. This approach is only considered useful if the organization adopting the “disruptor” approaches are able to pry away / reduce the customers’ dependence on existing players. Baas services are well-primed to adopt this approach if desired. Pros Able to approach markets with innovative solutions with lesser concerns as there is no existing market to “protect” Services offered can be tailored with more ease to market demands and shifts More fluid and able to adapt to future rules changes and regulations Cons Success of this approach is dependable on ecosystem and existing players Market sentiments and limitations will affect the outcome. Even if solution is good, the public may not be ready to embrace it Higher degree of knowledge and expertise is required from target market Things to take note for “Disruptor” positional approach Should be entering a market space where they are “new” – bringing novelty while solving issues. If they are not new in the market they serve, it is not considered an disruptor Partnering up with notable or reputable players that are able to compliment each other’s offerings is essential. This approach is not recommended for promoting (organizational) core services as it is a double-edge sword and ROI is usually on either end of the “success” spectrum. Opportunists Opportunists approach is doing what the name suggests. Organizations who will undertake this approach will usually wait, weigh its options and implement the most appropriate technology when it is required. These organizations usually do not have the full resources or are not in position to adopt the leadership approach – the ability to encapsulate their market ecosystem – for any reasons. Pros Beyond the initial higher investment required, it reaps long-term benefits and cost-savings if implemented optimally The wait-and-see approach – the luxury of weighing options and choices. Joining a network that has “established” framework Cons Higher amount of initial resources is required to implement technology successfully Higher risk of adopting the “wrong” blockchain technology as rules and regulations may change and affect the network (blockchain) bubble they joined Things to take note for “Opportunistic” positional approach Constant lookout for innovative approaches so as not to risk losing out to competitors in similar trade. The R&D or marketing team of each organization should always be alert to developments in the sector and ecosystem they are serving Usually applicable for organizations who are in industries that leverage on permissioned network environment Innovators The innovator approach is a more unique strategy for an organization to undertake. These are usually larger organizations or players who can easily adopt the “leadership approach” but are looking to innovate or improve their current state of business. Organizations who embrace this strategy usually want to change the way things are done in their ecosystem – they are in a position of influence in their industry but unable to single-handedly convince the entire industry to adopt the Blockchain solution they are proposing. “Innovators” approach will be useful to an organization when they are trying something “new” and there are no industry norms. Innovators will spearhead the movement of the feasibility of Blockchain technology they are planning with other stakeholders in their ecosystem through conversations, feasibility studies, partnership, etc Conclusion There is no single “correct” approach when adopting and implementing Blockchain technology for your organization or business. Chances are you will utilize a mixture of blockchain strategies. Keep in mind always that Blockchain is still at its infancy stage and there are no defined set or rules and regulations. What may be today’s’ best blockchain solution for your organization may be obsolete tomorrow. When adopting strategies, always conduct your due diligence and conduct a feasibility study – just like any other business decision making process."
12,Proven Forex Strategies,finance," There are thousands of proven Forex trading strategies available on the internet. Still, the question is, if it was any good, would someone give them away. The answer; probably not. So what can you learn from reading this article? Not many people know how to start designing their strategies, which is where this article will help you. After reading the following, you will be able to experiment with your system and maybe even stumble across a real winner. First of all, you will need indicators in your currency trading strategies, readily available through the MT4 platform for free. You will have no problem finding signals hinting at the direction of a currency pair. There are too many of them to go through in one article. Still, all you need to know is that there is plenty of information on the internet explaining how to use each one; all you have to do is seek, and one will find answers. In this article, we will go through the indicator categories so you can compile what will work with what. Trends One of the most common Forex trading strategies is trading with the trend, which you can establish using indicators such as Moving averages, Bollinger bands, ADX, Parabolic SAR, Commodity Channel Index, and standard deviations. Do not panic if all that sounds complex because the truth is it is tricky. Still, all you need to know is when each one gives you a buy or sell signal, you don't need to know the inner workings and calculations. Oscillators Oscillators indicate the range of a currency, for example, a range between 0 and 100. If the indicator is at the top of the field or near the ""100"" mark, then it is an indication that the currency pair is overbought. Suppose the opposite is in effect and the currency is near the ""0"". In that case, it is an indication that the currency is oversold. There are many different Oscillator indicators such as Average true range, Bulls power, Bears power, Envelopes, force index, MACD, RSI, Relative Vigor Index, and many more custom designs from programmers. Volumes Volumes indicate the buying and selling power of a currency. The money flow is displayed through an indicator that will show as a trend either up or down. An uptrend would suggest more money flow through the buying market, and a downtrend would indicate more money flow through the selling market. The indicators to look out for that will give volume to your trading strategy are Accumulation/Distribution, Money flow index, On balance volume. Putting it all together So this is where you start to see how indicators can make up your strategy. Imagine you have a chart with a couple of moving averages on the price and maybe a Bollinger band giving you an indication of an uptrend. You add an Oscillator to the chart that gives you a signal of overbought. So you are not going to buy off the result of the trend indicators because your Oscillator indicates it is overbought. You could wait until your moving averages cross over and take a sell trade or get in early when the price moves through your mid-Bollinger band. Either way, you have just developed your first strategy. You could even get more technical and add a volume indicator and see when buying power starts to decrease and take the sell even earlier. Experimenting is the key to success, and it could take years to get it right. There are some excellent strategies out there for free, but you will often find they only work in a specific type of market. A perfect way to start developing your strategy is to take one of these methods and add another indicator.  As stated at the beginning of the article, nobody in their right mind will give you a mega winning strategy for free. You can either pay a subscription to use the system or buy it outright in the form of an EA. I discovered very early on that trading Forex requires a serious approach for it to be of long-term profitability.

13,Trading using the 80/20 rule,finance," The 80/20 rule when copying traders is a fairly simple concept, even for beginners. By copying several low-risk traders on eToro, and relatively few high-risk investors in order to maximise profit. Having a varied portfolio also allows you to mitigate the risk of losing money, as one bad investment will not clear your bank entirely. The basis of this rule is that the 20% high risk aspect of your portfolio is the portion that will yield significantly higher results. The 80% that is devoted to low risk investments may not be particularly lucrative, however it is in place to create a reasonable profit in order to mitigate the 20% investment that is in higher risk investments. Clearly, creating a steady income is the goal of this investment, as a lower base rate to support any higher-risk investing. The 20%, which is allocated high-risk investment, is designed to yield more one-off style pay-outs in larger volumes. This is because generally speaking, higher-risk investments are those which fluctuate more, and reach higher highs and crash to lower lows. Although this obviously comes with higher risk (the clue is in the name!) it also means that a smaller amount of money, when invested at a low stock value, can create more money than a larger investment on a share that fluctuates less. As a higher-risk investment, this does mean that losses may sometimes happen, which is why this style of investing only accounts for 20% of your total portfolio. Furthermore, as I said earlier, these losses are what the 80% safe-investing is aiming to mitigate. The long-term goal of this system is to build wealth more gradually. Frequent trading, which is what some traders do, can initially yield better results than passive trading. Over the course of a longer trading period, however, it is obvious to see that the safety net of low-risk investments can offset the dangers of high-risk investment and lead to a better profit pattern, even if the early days are somewhat slower. Furthermore, the 80/20 method allows for further diversifying your portfolio and protecting it against risks. This method is clearly more secure and is a safer option for those at the beginning of their investing journey. From the information above, it is clear that the sensible option is to follow the 80/20 investing rule. If you want your investment to grow in the safest, steadiest way possible with the greatest mitigation of risk, then this is the strategy for you! It is also extremely easy to follow this strategy by using the copy trader function on eToro."
14,How Does A Property Bridging Loan Work,finance," A bridging loan is a type of short-term business finance designed to get you from A to B by bridging a gap in your finances for a short to medium time period. It's commonly used by property buyers and investors, but is suitable for a range of other business purposes too. When you take out bridging finance, the lender will usually have a first or second legal charge against your property. How does a bridging loan work? A bridge loan allows you to purchase a property before you've sold your existing one. It's also commonly used by those who want to fund renovations or a new build project before they can secure a traditional mortgage. Due to the short-term nature of the finance, it's sometimes referred to as a 'swing loan', 'gap financing' or 'interim financing'. If you're planning to use a bridge loan to purchase a new home while you wait for your current one to sell, you'll use equity in your current home as a downpayment on the purchase of the new one. Bridging finance can be used by businesses as well as individuals. There are many products out there that are tailored for different purposes. Bridging finance is available from specialist brokers who have access to non bank lenders and institutional institutions that lend money in specialist areas. Bridging can be obtained for United Kingdom, Spain, France, Germany, Austria and many other parts of Europe. The United States is also very acquainted to the aspects of bridging finance on commercial and residential properties. A business bridging loan is a type of commercial finance that, again, enables you to access funding over a short period of time. Providing you meet the eligibility criteria and have an exit strategy in place that is deemed valid by the lender, you can use the funds for a variety of things. Some businesses use bridging finance to get a working capital boost or to cover short-term cash flow challenges, for example. It's important to bear in mind that although bridge loans provide immediate cash flow, interest rates are higher and you'll typically have to offer collateral. Businesses may also seek out a bridge loan when awaiting long-term funding. For instance, a startup engaging in an equity financing round that is set to close in six months may take out a bridge loan in order to cover costs until it is received. These costs could include things like payroll, inventory, rent, utilities and other expenses. Property bridging loan A property bridging loan can come in useful if you want to buy a property but are waiting for the sale of an existing one to complete. In this instance, you can use the loan to cover the period between buying the new property and selling the old one. Property bridging loans can also be used if you're in a chain and part of it falls through. In the majority of instances, you can add the loan's monthly interest payments to the balance of the loan and pay it off at the end of the term. As long as you have equity, a way of paying off the loan and sufficient security, it's possible to be eligible for a property bridging loan even if you have a poor credit rating. You can also use a property bridging loan to: Buy a property at auction Pay for renovations Buy land for development - to cover the costs between purchasing and building on the land Buy an uninhabitable property - to cover the costs until you can get a mortgage (which may be once the works are complete) One of the benefits of bridging loans for property is that the application process is usually quick: you can apply online and receive an approval within 24 hours. If your application is approved, you can expect to receive the funds within two weeks. The lender will need to value your property and carry out the necessary checks first. Sometimes you can pay the lender to have your application processed faster. Open vs closed bridge loans Bridging loans fall into two categories: open and closed. A closed bridge loan has a fixed repayment date. If you're purchasing a property and are waiting for the sale to complete, you'll usually receive this type of loan. Open bridging loans have no fixed repayment date, however you'll typically have to pay it off within 12 months. Bridging loans explained - FAQs What is a bridge loan? Bridging finance is usually a type of short-term business loan. It's best thought of as a temporary loan which gets you from A to B, until you can either clear the loan in full or secure a more permanent form of finance. That's where the ""bridge"" idea comes in - finance to get you from one step to another. How do bridging loans compare to regular term loans? In theory, they differ because they are for a specific short term purpose, whereas term loans often have more general commercial purposes. In reality, the speed of getting the cash in your account is the main difference. It can take weeks for some lenders to complete a term loan, but a bridging loan can be ready in 24–48 hours. What can I use bridging finance for? Lenders that offer bridging loans usually do so for the purchase and renovation of property - it's a form of property development finance. They can be both commercial and residential, and the works can be ground-up property developments or just adding a bathroom to a flat. You can use bridging finance for other short term commercial purposes, as long as you have a clear exit in place - although it depends what appetite the lender has for your plans. What is a bridge loan 'exit'? Exits are what lenders say when they mean how you are going to either clear the bridging loan in full (with the interest costs) or move it onto a more permanent type of finance, like a term mortgage. You might hear us speak of closed bridging loans and open bridging loans. Closed loans are a line of credit with a fixed exit date in place. For example, the sale of the property to pay back the loan is already in place at the time of taking the loan. Open loans are given without the exit yet fixed, so you are given ""up to"" a certain period. We can discuss your options here and which lenders best fit your needs. What bridging loan interest rates like? Given the specialist nature of the loan - i.e. it's for a specific short term purpose - the interest rates can be higher than traditional term loans. You can sometimes choose to have the interest payments 'rolled up', which means you pay a lump sum at the end of the agreed term. This can make it a useful finance type for those without the required funding at the early stages of receiving the loan. How can I use a bridging loans to finance developments? Bridging loans form the crux of what property developers use to fund their projects. Let's say a developer owns a site and has planning permission from the council to build a small apartment block. A good solution for this property development, to spread the costs for the company, may be to get a bridging loan for 3–6 months, which gives them the funds to complete the work. This loan is fully paid off after the period either by the sale of the apartment block or individual apartments, or by moving the bridging loan onto a longer term finance product like a commercial mortgage. Bridging loans can sometimes be used in other commercial areas where a short term temporary loan may be required. This is providing there is a clear 'exit' from the loan. Non Standard Bridging Loans Subprime bridging loans exist usually, because clients find themselves unable to qualify for mainstream or bridging finance and would like to purchase a property. This can be due to any number of reasons: Having complicated income streams. Poor credit history, or no previous credit rating. Non-standard personal circumstances or borrowing requirements. Non standard bridging finance really should be your last place for finance having exhausted family, friends, mortgage lenders and second charge lenders because the interest rates and fees are high and not repaying the money borrowed when the Bridge comes to an end can have very severe consequences. Private bridging lenders charge Interest rates range from circa 0.5 to 1.5% per month - yes per month - with lenders charging fee between 1–3% of the amount you borrow. A typical Bridge term from private lenders would be 6 or 12 months with interest rolled up i.e. added to the loan. How you repay all this money when the Bridge comes to an end is key to understanding how Bridging lenders think. A lender is not really interested in your income or your job or for that matter your credit history as they are lending you money based on how they will get it back as this will be classed as sub prime lending. What I mean is the 'exit' strategy - a word you will hear right at the very beginning of a conversation with a lender. This exit strategy is the deciding factor to understanding if you are likely to be offered finance - how will the lender get their money back? They do not make any money until you repay the loan plus all the rolled up interest so the exit has to feasible, realistic and achievable. For example you want to borrow £100k to finish a house you bought at auction for £200k and then sell it for £450k - think what is the exit for the lender? Easy - you complete the property improvements, put the house on the market and sell it. A lender would be comfortable with that arrangement knowing the works would take 6 months, the value would increase to £450k and then you would have 6 months to sell it. What kind of fees are involved with bridging loans? This depends on the circumstances of the loan - in general, there will be a fee for arrangement of the loan and there are administration fees as with all products. This varies from lender to lender, and our team is on hand to explain any complex terms and conditions so you know what to expect. What about bridging loans for property refurbishment? It's a good product for renovations and refurbishments because you get funds really quickly to allow you to start the works immediately. In fact, bridging loans are often used to convert properties into a state where a lender can provide a commercial mortgage. Not all properties are eligible for certain types of mortgages - you can use bridging finance to get the work done and get the property into a state where you can exit into a full term mortgage. Can I use a bridging loan to buy a property at auction? Yes, lots of buyers at auctions use bridging loans to assist with the purchase, rather than go to a traditional provider where the process is much lengthier - after all, you often only have up to 28 days to bring the funds to the table at auctions, making a bridging loan ideal. Read here for more about auction finance and what to expect, or our guide on buying property at auction. How do first and second charge bridging loans differ? If the property you're securing the loan against doesn't have any other loans secured against it, you'll get a first charge bridging loan. However, if, for instance, you already have a loan against the property as its mortgage is outstanding, a second charge bridging loan will apply. Am I eligible for a bridging loan? The lender will take various factors into account before making a decision as to whether or not you're eligible for a bridging loan. Property will usually be required as security and depending on the terms of the loan, you may need to provide proof of income. If you're taking a bridging loan out for commercial purposes, you may also have to show evidence of a business plan. How much can I borrow with a bridging loan? The amount you can borrow will depend on how much the property or properties you are using as collateral are worth. Broadly speaking, you can borrow between £5,000 and £250 million. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) tends to be between 65% to 80% Where can I apply for a bridging loan? You can use the Platinum Global Bridging Finance to find a bridging loan. High street banks, mortgage brokers and alternative specialist lenders offer bridging finance. The process is quick - you'll typically receive a decision within 24 hours and it takes around two weeks for the money to be transferred. What do bridge loan rates tend to be? Like the majority of loans, bridge loan interest rates can be either fixed or variable. If the interest rate is fixed, it remains the same for the duration of the loan term, so monthly payments will be consistent. If variable, the interest rate can fluctuate. Usually, the lender will set the variable rate in line with the Bank of England base rate. Bridge loans usually have higher interest rates than other types of loan. Also, individuals who are yet to pay off their mortgage can end up having to make both a mortgage payment and a bridge loan payment until their previous home is sold. The interest rate is the main cost of bridging finance, however there are other fees to consider, including: Arrangement fees - usually between 1–2% of the amount you borrow Broker fees (if you use a broker to find bridging finance) Exit fees - some lenders will charge an exit fee of ~1% of the loan amount"

18,How To Get Rid Off From Forex Trading Scams Or Frauds in 2021,finance," Rayner Teo once said that, Trading the Forex market may be easy, at the same time it can also turn into a nightmare. Why? 🤔 Because when you are trading the market with a real account and of course which contains your real investment (that maybe you’ve gathered from a lot of sweating and hard work) there are a lot of factors to look out for. Such as, Often your emotions take over you. You suffer to make decisions due to psychological effects. And that’s not even the BIGGER picture. There is a very specified error that is causing havoc to the online trading industry. I’m sure that you’re aware of my claims. Don’t you? Let me clarify it to you, “ I’m talking about Forex scammers “. And tell me, “Are you a victim too”? Not gonna lie, it is becoming a WILD DISEASE man! Various people with low and cheap mentality are doing this sort of disgraceful work and I think all of you guys know the reflexive action of their work. And let me tell you that I’ll be shedding a light on a few types of scams that are seen quite often these days. My only hope is that you might get the idea of scamming by reading this. So, that being said, Let’s fight together. But before all the fuss. You might be wondering how you’re gonna identify a certain appearance whether it is a scam or not. From that perspective metaphorically speaking, there are few certain things that can help you examine the scams. Here is the ABSOLUTE procedure- The first thing you wanna look out for is certain commitments like “Guaranteed Profits”. I mean let’s be honest here, the Foreign exchange market is HUGELY volatile and due to that circumstance, not even the BEST market trader can guarantee 100% profits. So, don’t fall into this wicked trap. Moving on, the next important thing that you should always remember that scammers don’t oblige with authority. Feeling a little dizzy? I understand! In simple words, what I’m trying to say is, it is a wise choice to avoid all the aspects that don’t come up with the regulatory license. There are some unregulated brokers who possess quite a reputation”. You know what I totally agree with you. That’s the reason I specifically said it is a wise decision to avoid them not to use them. Hope you’ve understood. Now, let’s get ourselves with some ongoing Forex trading scams. -Forex Trading Scams Using Robots -The revolution of technology was meant to be the solution to every problem, Alas! It’s now the center of numerous scamming acts. Also in the Forex Industry, There is no exception to it. Moving on, the Forex robots were created using algorithms or computer codes whatever you may call them. And there is another important thing that you should know is “Not All Robots Are Scam”. And, trust me, I mean it! There are some trading robots that hold quite a reputation due to the feedback of their users. Also, you can get access to an effective trading robot if you do enough digging. Now you might be wondering, “How the hell I’m gonna find an effective trading robot because almost 80% of them are just myths”. If that is the problem, then I might know the solution. Forex Scammer Offers Guaranteed Profits We often encounter several commitments such as a robot providing 100% guaranteed profits. Let just be clear, I’m not saying that this is impossible but from my point of view rather unusual. And like I’ve mentioned earlier always try to ignore these sorts of appearances. Because from my perspective that’s a wise move otherwise you may end up losing BIG time. Again, these sorts of greedy offers may tempt your mind but don’t forget to check the statistics. The profits may be fabricated as a delusion. Think about that for a moment! Don’t fall for their marketing tactics. Scammers will do anything to make you believe that they are not a myth and that’s the primary symptom that will help you to find out whether they are a scammer or not. So, the moral is: If anyone tries their heart out to convince you then simply just ignore them. On the other hand, if they show you the statistics of their trading history then you might consider them. Because the numbers don’t lie, do they? “To get pure trading signals from the experts, we recommend PipsWin.com Right now they’re offering a lifetime membership of only $200.

And I bet you already know enough regarding the Forex signal providers so I’m not pulling an in-depth conversation regarding it. But if you’re a freshman then you should know that the Maximum number of signal providers are individual traders and they provide several market predictions. Again, it’s not an easy task, you’ve to be ABSOLUTELY tremendous with the charts and the timeframes. Also, a signal provider always stays up to date with the latest economic and political affairs. Speaking of signal providers, there is something that you should know. Which is what? Now, let’s showcase a few sorts of signal scamming factors. Here are they: Signal Charges: This signal charge is something that you’ve to pay in order to access the market predictions that a provider supplies you. And they show you their tremendous results to motivate you with a definite purpose that you may buy them. And often the signal turns out otherwise and you end up losing money. Broker Related Signals: This sort of scams are quite rare to see but for your kind information you should know that it still exists. Some of you might be wondering, “what the heck is he talking about?” Well, this the brief explanation: Broker-related or broker-tied signal means you’ve to actually register with a brokerage company in order to get certain market predictions from an individual signal provider. Sound relatable? Moving on, in this procedure the signal provider benefits from both ways and which obviously includes you and the brokerage company as they give some percentage to him. And from numerous market geniuses’ point of view, this is actually illegal. Trading Scams Through Phone Calls I think many of us are familiar with these sorts of scams. For those who still haven’t faced this, you guys should know that there are few tricky people out there who will sell their service thoroughly by calling you. They are experts in this field, so they will tell you mind-boggling stories if you invest with them. Some of them might sound like- -If you invest with us, you’ll be rich in 7 days -Invest with us and double your money in 3 days -Invest and become a millionaire in under 30 days. I mean like seriously! Lol! For your own safety if you encounter something like this, simply just ignore it. Trust me, it’s for your betterment and you’ll thank me later for this. So, these are some of the examples of scams that are often happening around us simultaneously. And also it’s quite sad but true that people are really buying this sort of scams. We all need to avoid it. But how? Well, first of all, you’ve to be ABSOLUTELY patient while making the decisions. Don’t rush in anything, it doesn’t end well, and history says it all. One of the primary things that you should always live by is learning to check the backgrounds. Uncover the truth, it’s a good habit. Again, if the offer is very tempting then ask yourself a few questions while making a decision. Such as- -What’ll be your approach when you don’t think the offer is made for you? -How obligatory the contract is? -Is the Broker or service provider giving you enough contract info about them? -Do they have a business address that is verified by other customers? -Is the company registered by maintaining absolute authority? -Do they give you their background info and recent performance stats? There are some questions that you should ask yourself before making a haste decision. I’m confident that it will help you to avoid unbeneficial decisions. Also, if you have faced a different sort of scam which I didn’t mention or I’m not familiar with, then feel free to tell me. I’ll look into it and try to discuss it with an in-depth explanation. Till then stay clean, stay safe. Gratitudes."
19,Affiliate Marketing For Beginners - What It Takes To Become Successful,finance," The online marketers who make the most money have a huge list of opt-in subscribers and they send them emails about selected products for sale. One of the ways these affiliates can almost guarantee that they get sales from their list is by offering their list free bonuses for purchasing this new product through their link. Actually, there are times that individuals will buy the product in order to get the bonuses, which they might want more than the product. For people just starting out in affiliate marketing and advertising it is going to be very difficult for you to compete against an affiliate like this. It is actually the competition that is going on right now that makes it extremely difficult for any new affiliate to become successful. If you happen to be in the Internet Advertising and marketing niche and have a list you need to understand that there are other affiliate marketers who have huge lists who may end up offering better bonuses than you, thereby getting them the majority of the product sales. You have to become unique in that what you are offering, making sure it is different to what every other person has in place. In addition it must preferably be something that can't be found anywhere else, without paying a lot for it. One thing you have to understand about having a list, is the fact that the folks on your list are on other lists also. You should also try to make certain that you write your own emails for the product because if you are using the email that the product owner provides, other people are using it as well. If you're wondering why no one is purchasing from you, it might be mainly because someone else has a big bonus so to get individuals to buy from you, you have to become an expert in the field you're in. You are going to discover that if you can have yourself defined as an expert in your field this can be one good way to increase the volume of revenue you generate. A very effective technique of doing this is to write incredibly informative articles and having them posted all over the internet. Another thing you should bear in mind is that article advertising and marketing will help you build credibility but it is very important to get your name out there as much as possible to as many folks as you possibly can as well. Once men and women come to know you and trust you, they're going to invest in from you, even when a competitor has a better offer simply because men and women don't like to invest in from strangers, but rather from somebody they're able to trust. You need to become trustworthy, in order to become a top-notched affiliate marketer, and that takes having a reputation and in the world of Internet marketing, reputation is everything, so you have to be unique and credible. In order to become a successful affiliate marketer, you will need a list of subscribers who like what you have to offer. You should not forget to work on building your credibility and also trust and you need to also find some valuable and unique bonuses to provide to your list. Your ability to succeed will rely on plenty of variation but mostly included in what we talked about above. Most important however is that all successful affiliate marketers are known to take massive action, on a consistent basis."
20,What do economic crises teach us?,finance," Many crises have a common phenomenon - overheated asset. When a certain value causes a stir in demand, it is sold much more expensive than its real value. When the price approaches a figure that is unacceptable to potential buyers, the market hits the price. There are fewer people who want to buy an asset, sellers lower the bar, but it does not help. Panic sale replaces the hype demand. This continues until the price bounces off the bottom and goes up, but is no longer at this rate. In turbulent markets, you can earn, but the risk of losing everything is much higher. In this article, we will tell you how it happens in the example of several crises. Tulipmania in the Netherlands This is the first well-documented economic crisis. The story is simple: among the usual tulips began to appear unusual flowers with mottled petals. Rare bulbs turned into a profitable asset: the price of one many times exceeded the annual earnings of the artisan. Among the buyers were flower growers, professionals, art collectors, investors who planned to earn money on flowers. It is obvious that tulips do not grow in winter. Then enterprising flower growers began to sell the crop, which was just going to grow in the season. There was a deal with such conditions: the seller promised to deliver the goods by the spring, and the buyer undertook to buy the goods. The price was determined before delivery, at the time of the transaction. This commitment, signed by the parties, could be traded no less successfully than the tulips themselves. Prices for such paper actively fueled by rumors of speculators and promises that soon everyone will be interested in the flower and prices will rise many times. This is how futures trading works: the investor buys not an asset, but an obligation to buy or sell it in the future, but at the current market price. It was during the tulip crisis that futures trading became a phenomenon. Two years later, when the psychological bottom was passed, the market grew again, although not until the indicators of 1636 Tulips began to sell at a fair market price, without the hype of demand and panic sales. Then the price of tulips gradually decreased, no longer causing catastrophic consequences for bidders. Sick, but once valuable tulips in a few generations died out. And history got the first detailed documented stock market bubble. The names of those who made fortunes on speculations with tulips have not reached our days. However, the conclusion begs itself: earned those who were able to stop in time and leave the game just at the moment when the price of bulbs and futures was growing or was already as high as possible. Tulip dealers were lucky: they managed to sell the overheated asset before the market collapse. Some even compare such crises with the gambling industry. Like there is difficult and practically impossible to come up with a working strategy in keno or roulette, it is also very hard to predict any crisis that will take place in the future. Black Thursday Economists still argue about the causes of this crisis. However, the collapse of the exchanges that preceded it, developed under the same laws as the tulip crisis in Holland. In the 1920s, the U.S. economy experienced an economic boom after World War I, with production and market capitalization growing. Government policy encouraged big business, actively formed consumer society. At the same time, loans were cheaper, allowing low-income citizens to receive large sums. This led to the fact that a lot of Americans began to speculatively trade securities. Demand for shares raised prices, rising prices attracted new investors, prices rose again, and more investors were involved in speculative trading. Shares were bought much more expensive than their fair market price, often on credit. Then margin loans, which are used to this day, became widespread: the investor attracted leverage for trading. This allowed operating in sums several times greater than equity. Profits from transactions with such a tool increases, but the risks grow: in unprofitable transactions settlements with the lender can destroy all the capital of the investor in one or two transactions. The stock market lost about 40% of its capitalization, or $30 billion. With Black Thursday, the Great Depression began, an economic shock that the United States, and then the world, experienced for several years. After this crisis, in 1932 in the United States there was a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), designed to prevent a repeat of the stock market collapse. The regulator monitors the issuance and circulation of securities, does not allow to make transactions that will significantly affect the level of prices, and does not allow abuses in the market. Now there is such a body in every country where there is at least one exchange. Black Monday On October 19, 1987, for no apparent reason, the Dow Jones Index, the value of the 30 largest U.S. companies, fell. And that's after a rapid growth for several years. The chain reaction spread across the globe, with Australia's stock exchanges losing 41.8 percent, Hong Kong stock exchanges 45.8 percent, Canadian exchanges 22.5 percent, and the UK falling 26.4 percent. Interestingly, the global financial crisis was saved by the low power of computers. Transactions took place in automatic mode, they were executed by stock terminals. When trying a panic sale, the systems simply depended on the number of applications and slowed down the collapse of prices. Versions of what happened are still being discussed. One of the main ones is the automation of the exchange. Applications were submitted by robots and executed by the same, which led to too many operations and system hovering. Despite the shock fall in indices, stock markets recovered relatively quickly - in a couple of years, and the real economy almost did not get hurt. The main lesson learned then by stock regulators is that trades should be suspended if the market is too loose. What a computer glitch made in 1987 is now part of the exchange practice. If there is a rush of demand or a sharp sale, the trades stop for a few minutes. This does not allow the securities to significantly change their value. Conclusion It is difficult to predict precisely when the crisis will start. The situation may heat up for several years and even look quite prosperous, as it was on the eve of Black Thursday, but the collapse will happen unexpectedly. The market is a lively and self-regulating system whose behavior is not always predictable. In addition to the readiness to meet the crisis, not with empty pockets, it is important to understand the theory. If you know how the market, exchange, tools work, you can protect yourself from unreasonable actions. Most mistakes in a crisis are made by untrained investors who trust their intuition, rather than proven strategies."

1,Collateralizing and Resolving America’s 2020 Economic Crisis!,finance," Capital (as opposed to consumer) credit is the kind of credit that serious investors are issued in order to purchase wealth-producing capital assets such as stocks, bonds, commercial real estate, machinery, copyrights, and patents, etc. It’s a variety of credit that is issued with a relatively low interest rate that allows the investor to pay off the loan in a relatively predictable amount of time. And once paid off, these wealth-producing capital assets continue paying out dividends, which in turn create a passive, residual income that requires nothing more from their owners than the time and effort required to endorse and deposit dividend checks. If you think that sounds like a pretty sweet deal, you’d be 100% right. The problem however is that in order to secure a capital credit loan, investors must be able to prove that they don’t really need the money. This proof comes in the form of COLLATERAL ASSETS which the bank can confiscate if the loan is not repaid in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. In other words, investment bankers are very conservative old codgers and they tend to minimize their risk by making extremely secure loans. The bigger problem is that over 90% of Americans currently LACK THE COLLATERAL required to gain access to these low interest, low risk, capital credit loans. That is to say, over 90% of Americans LACK THE OPPORTUNITY to participate in any significant way, on the ownership side of the economy where almost all the new wealth is being generated. As the result, over the past four decades, the wealth gap between the few at the top and the many at the bottom is wider and more toxic than at any time since the 1929 stock market crash and the great depression that followed in its wake. This dilemma could accurately be called economic COLLATERAL DAMAGE, and it undermines any possibility of a genuine political democracy, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. How Can We Rectify This Toxic Situation? The question at this point becomes, how can we rectify this toxic disparity and make sure that every man, woman and child in the US (regardless of race, gender religion, age, political or sexual orientation) has the realistic opportunity to participate in the ownership side of the American economy where almost all the new wealth is being generated, while creating no government and no consumer debt. In that light consider the following verifiable FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. When divided by 330,000 people (our current population) that translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life and eliminate one really big reason for terminating a pregnancy. •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 70 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Biden/Harris as well as Trump/Pence. My question is WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
2,Why is it worth having your savings in a different currency?,finance," One of the most comprehensive ways of communication and connection has always been money and currency. Usually, those countries that had the same currencies were united or were allies. The tendency remains the same even in the 21st century and the fact that certain countries have similar currency still means that those countries have something in common. While one of the universal languages can be English, one of the most universal currencies is USD. English is the commonly spoken language, used for communication by people to people, while the money currency is the way political entities, in this case, countries communicate and find common ground for negotiations. USD is one of the most popular currencies, which is used in every single country, yet it is definitely not used as a primary currency in the majority of them. For this, we have the exchanges and the specific rates which are imposed for the exchanges between the currencies. Many countries have their own currencies and their own money, but in order to travel somewhere or trade with something, we most usually use USD and EUR. This is the most popular couple in the world. The coin has two sides Just like every physical coin has two sides, the existence of the different coins also has two sides. It is well known that the USD is the most used currency, for trading, measurement, for purchases and it is also one of the most stable currencies as it is strengthened by gold. Another example can be the EUR, which is also very common in Europe, as every member of the Eurozone uses EUR as their primary currency, meaning that despite living in Greece, you can still travel to Belgium and have the same money, without any need for the exchange. USD/EUR is definitely one of the best-known currency couples, yet it does not mean that some other currencies are not more in value. A clear example can be the GBP or the Swiss Pound. Though there are some currencies that are way lower than the above-mentioned ones and thus, are lower in value as well. The difference between any currency is quite important especially for the country and its economy as well as for the ones who trade with the currencies. The main importance of the currency exchange rates and the constant fluctuation is for the brokers and the forex market. The whole concept of the forex industry is based on trading with the differences in values and the possible changes in the values. It is mostly about the predictions, yet the kind of predictions, which follow a certain chain of tendencies, caused by the changes in the economy, inflation, depreciation, appreciation or etc. Traders of the forex market use every new change and possible outcomes for opening and closing their positions. The system is simple, if the currency pair changes accordingly to your prediction, you will be earning quite a decent amount of money, yet the market is extremely dynamic and even the smallest social, economic or political event can rotate the wheel. The savings VS currency changes We obviously work to earn a living, but we also work to make some savings for ourselves or for future generations. Some even might be saving money for the black day. And indeed in 2020, the black day has come, when we all heard about coronavirus, though the black day continues for a year already. Some smart people care about their possible darker days and have prepared for it, by saving the money. Those people turned out to be smart, but some of them turned out to be even smarter. While people in different countries, rather than the US and eurozone, have income in their local currencies, they usually make their savings in the local currency straight away. Yet, as mentioned before, some smarter people converted the local currency to international currencies like USD or EUR. Another interesting fact to note is that during the global pandemic every single currency depreciated against the USD, meaning that the USD got even stronger on its positions. What does this mean? It means that people who made their savings in their local currency, actually lost a lot of money, compared to the amount of money they had, before the drastic changes in the exchange rates. A very clear example can be Georgia, the country on the crossroad of Russia and Turkey and neighboring Armenia and Azerbaijan. The country has a local currency, Georgian Lari, aka GEL. It should be said that the currency was never outstanding with its strong position against the USD, yet currently, it has depreciated so much that 1 USD is almost twice as much GEL as it was only 5 years ago. This means that people who made their savings in the local currency have basically lost twice as much money as they could have saved, if they converted everything to the USD or EUR currency, once they had a better rate. The global inflation is still going on, and the USD is strengthening its positions against every other single currency, leaving all of the rest with a guess whether the currencies survive the dollarization or shall soon lose the value at all. One way or another, this is a good lesson for those people who are still thinking of the savings, yet do not rely on the most stable indexes."

6,Is the Process of Buying a Car Worth your Time?,finance," The car buying process is lengthy and time-consuming. Purchasing a car can be cumbersome as you first research the type of car you want, figure out your budget, and then hunt for a lender to obtain an auto loan. However, even though the car buying process is long, you need to figure out if it is worth your time. In the current times of dealing with a pandemic, it is not always safe to use public transportation like the subway or bus. You need to have a car for traveling safely to your work, college, grocery store, or even when you visit your family. Owning a car means that you have the convenience and flexibility to plan your activities. So, when it comes to buying a car, you can overlook the long process as you are getting the benefits of convenience, flexibility, and safety. Understand a few tips and tricks that will help you in making the car buying process simple. Lemons are cars with defects. They are not fit for daily transportation due to re-occurring maintenance issues. The safest way to ensure that the automobile is not a lemon is to request a vehicle history report. Check the number of previous owners and find out many times the car needed major repairs. Car ownership details, repair history, and test drive will help you to identify whether the vehicle is a lemon or not. Once you research for the car that you wish to purchase, you need to decide on obtaining an auto loan. One of the most important aspects of auto loans is the loan term. A shorter loan term can help you achieve lower interest rates and overall a cheaper auto loan. An ideal loan ranges from 60 to 72 months. Anything higher than 72 months can attract high-interest rates, and you will end up paying more money in interest. Opt for a shorter loan term. It will help you to invest the money that you save on something else of importance. You can also get a better interest rate when you put 20% or more as a down payment. The debt to income ratio is the amount of debt that you have against the income that you earn. The lower the debt to income ratio, the better. Before you purchase your car, you should check if your income is sufficient for the monthly auto loan payments. Another thing of importance is a steady source of income. Stable employment and income source will increase your creditworthiness in the eyes of the lender. You can also check your debt to income ratio on online auto portals and focus on repaying old debts before going for your new auto loan. Buying a Car: Worth the Work; Worth the Wait Buying a car may seem tiring, but if you are clear on the vehicle and budget, you can finish the process quickly. Therefore, make sure to shop around dealerships and get information and guidance from online auto loan companies before you purchase your next car. Remember buying a car may be a long process but is worth the work you put in."
7,Red Flags - What kinds of brokers should you avoid?,finance," New traders are always making some mistakes when it comes to choosing the brokers. Online trading is becoming more and more accessible, which means that traders and investors buy and sell financial instruments via online trading platforms. The brokers or banks are offering to them the right place to go in and invest money, but sometimes they are not trustworthy. Trading decisions are made on the trading platform and then the information about the actions is instantly sent to the broker. Online trading grew in the 1990s when computers were getting adopted in our daily life. When the computers started to get more affordable and traders could connect via high-speed internet with online platforms, there became more people, who were interested in joining the trading platform. The connection between the trading platforms and the people become very demonstrative in the 21st century. Access to financial markets is developed so much that we have never seen this kind of results before. People are noticing that it is really smart to have some information about trading. They at first educate themselves, and then the wanting to try trading comes with it. This trend seems to be only increasing in the future with 1.7 billion people with mobile phones.  Online trading gives us long-termed benefits and financial security if we do it right, but what if we have no education or information about it? Well, first we need to decide what kind of trader we would like to be. In the biggest financial foreign exchange market, there are three types of traders. Analyst - is a person who analyses the information and context is everything. They are people who use fundamental analysis and technical analysis in order to see what the future may bring. Trader - they just buy or sell different things in online platforms, there can be dozens of strategies that they are using. Some of them are even trading with cryptocurrencies. Risk manager - The trader who also is able and skilled enough to manage the risk the market may come with. All kinds of traders are obligated to know everything about financial markets. They need to be professional in it. A trader must always have an eye on the market operations and how to define and understand the market changes and how to profit from them. Before the internet was here, traders and investors were working via messages and emails. They needed to make selling and buying decisions by just talking with their broker. The whole process of it was exhausting, slow, and brokers needed to confirm everything, including the transaction details, type of trade, length, the account, exit price, and every detail that they may be needed in the future. This was a devastating process of work. Trading platforms are providing the trader the allowance for a wide range of the types of orders. Everything can set up very fast if you have a broker of your preference and the trading plan. How to choose a broker? Well, it can be harder than you imagine. There are so many red flags one must be aware of. If you are a trader who needs to choose a broker, you need to think through the brokers that are compatible with your investing goals, fitting in your needs, educational needs, and investing strategies. Of course, this is not rocket science, but many traders are forgetting sometimes that they need a broker who will promise a low level of disappointment. There is no exact way to guarantee that the trader is choosing a perfect broker for him\her. The investment returns are never guaranteed. Even if you will choose the best online broker  that really fits in every requirement you have for them, the benefits can be still low. For example, Forex traders in the second-biggest foreign exchange market in the world, in South Africa, are suggesting that before we all start clicking on everything related to brokers, we all must do some research. Basic education will always help to make logical decisions. A truly experienced trader or investor is someone who made dozens of mistakes, so one can’t do anything without mistakes, but still, there are some red flags, that traders in South Africa are paying attention when choosing a broker, and as they are really good at trading, we all can take some notes from them. Red flags - Be aware Brokers always want to earn more commissions and yes, they are under the stress, most of their time, but brokers are not always very trustworthy and honest with their investors. Sometimes they may even sell risky products because they somehow benefit from it. Some brokers are extremely unethical and the trader can see that when they are telling the half of truth all the time. South Africans are suggesting for brokers, who are not mixing the truth with untruth because it is honestly very confusing. Today, traders are paying attention to the licenses and regulations the brokers are providing from them. For example, If you will see the XM broker reviewed by South Africans, you will notice that in every review, the trader is talking about the trading environment the XM broker is providing, and of course, the fair terms. This is a simple truth because, at the end of the day, every trader wishes to be more secure in the changeable financial market. Other than the half-truth strategy, some of the brokers are using “no-explanation” strategies. Meaning that when they are working with their investors or traders, they prefer to hide everything from them. It can be very annoying when you are a trader and your broker is just in silence every time and not telling you any information about your investments and trades. “This is right for you” is never enough, you need to ask for reasons, why is it a good investment. Even if the opportunity is a really good investment, the investor still needs to have the choice of investing or not investing in it without getting manipulated and gaslighted. If you are a trader, and you somehow are in doubt - spell it out. Everything depends on you if you think something - tell the broker. Everyone has different needs but every proper trader knows that they need to research for a broker who doesn’t have bad reviews, shady past, or no license. The trader should always discuss everything with a broker. The relationship needs to come from respect. The good broker will always make sure that the client is seeing how things work in the financial market. They are explaining reports and research for better solutions when there is a problem. Investment ethics is very important because when the broker is having a good client, they need to take care of them. It is necessary to be open to every detail. Over time, a good relationship is respected and the communications are getting more honest. A respectful attitude will pay off with high profits. A positive relationship is one of the main keys to success in the trading industry."

13,Interest in cash is falling - what's the next banknote?,finance," When thinking of many, many people still imagine either a paper banknote with an easily recognizable historical figure on it or a metal coin. That is what money has been for thousands of years now and for the first time in its history, the way we pay is soon to be completely changed. Physical money often referred to as cash, once was an innovation of its own. In general, there was no payment structure or a method up to some point in history. People used to trade products for services and the other way around. This worked fairly well for a while but as the civilization emerged, growing needs and demands resulted in the creation of the universal currency. They used to be made from gold or silver, underlining their immense value. Later, precious metals were changed with regular ones finally leading money’s development to paper banknotes. They went through a number of changes as well. Most importantly, more and more advanced security systems were implemented into banknotes to prevent counterfeit and other criminal activities. However, other than advancements, money as a concept has not seen a major change. The real game-changer was the introduction of debit and credit cards in the second half of the 20th century. The first credit card was introduced in 1950, followed by a debit card in 1966. However, these innovative ways to perform financial transactions and use money did not find instant success. The hype around them arose in the 1990s when cashless services became popular for the first time. The trend was particularly visible in Europe and the United States. Soon, commercial banks started introducing more cashless services and a whole variety of debit as well as credit cards. The launch of the first cards was undoubtedly a crucial event in banking history. However, this was not going to be the last one. The 1990s, the era of credit cards, brought an immense technological development. This was partly the reason why cashless payments started to emerge in that period of the 20th century. More companies had access to the infrastructure needed to accept cards and the number of such facilities boomed in just a blink of an eye. Today, the developed world is dominated by digital technologies and the financial sector is quickly adapting to the present day. The 21st century saw a rise of global markets online, where users can trade with currencies. Those listed on quite a lot of sites gain profit by buying and selling different currencies. The year 2009 also witnessed the birth of bitcoin - a virtual currency. Today, they are also being actively traded on forex trading websites, representing an important sector of the industry. Cash is dying: what methods of payment are replacing it in the 21st century? Physical money is certainly falling. Once the most reliable source of payment has been proven to be not as convenient and safe as we thought it was. But the lack of trust in cash is not only occurring now because of its disadvantages. The new millennium brought even a more diverse palette of payment methods to us. Technology is what really drives the world today. A soaring number of people have access to the worldwide web and needed gadgets to use it. Social mobility is increasing along with the overall global spending. The Generation Z-ers are expected to be the biggest spenders the world has ever seen, with the estimated purchasing power of roughly $143 billion in the United States alone. They also have more demands for companies and service providers. Young people demand smooth, smart, and most importantly digitized services. In response, the financial industry is trying to deliver on the modern demand. The development of fintech began the exact same time the first credit card saw the sunlight in 1950. No, fintech was not a term back then, but the fact is that this smart industry has gradually developed to what it is today. It is a combination of 2 terms - financial and technology. It now already covers a broad area of financial services such as banking, money lending as well as insurance and aims to compete with the traditional service providers. Now almost every bank in the developed world offers mobile or online banking services. Without them, establishing or maintaining a customer base is impossible. Money transfers happen within seconds both locally and internationally. They have many benefits, including being more convenient, faster, and cheaper. Moreover, the safety rate is also higher with them. The chances of crime are much higher when using physical money as cash is easy to counterfeit. Moreover, the presence of cash increases the risks of theft in the case of companies with physical branches. Fintech is revolutionizing the world. Many thought that it would only find good use in developed nations as digitized services require constant access to the internet. However, the examples of India and Kenya have changed the existing perception. In underdeveloped countries, where there is a lack of physical financial services, for instance, commercial bank offices, fintech proved itself highly beneficial. By investing in the needed infrastructure, poorer nations can increase the general population’s access to financial services, which is crucial for economic development. Some nations are already making a major move towards their cashless future.  In 2018, for the first time in history, card payments took over cash in the United Kingdom. Now only 34% of all payments are made with cash in Britain. However, frontrunners on the pathway towards going completely cashless are Northern European countries. For example, only 2% of all payments are made using cash in Sweden. The cashless future is quite close and it is a better future for all. It would mean delivering better, smarter, and faster financial services for customers worldwide while keeping transactions safer than ever before. Erasing cash from shops and other businesses could potentially decrease crime while fraud due to the weak security of physical money would almost disappear. Further development of fintech and its wider adoption will also result in increased access to services in all corners of the world, boosting the global economy. However, saying no to cash is still difficult for many. Roughly 5% of Britons still rely solely on cash. Moreover, going cashless in the nearest future is more realistic in developed nations. This process still requires nationwide advanced infrastructure to support the transaction. Rejecting cash in the nearest future might leave many without any means to pay or use financial services. However, it is certain that the future, foreseeable or not is cashless and fintech is what will be behind it."
14,Why Singapore became the finance centre of the Far East,finance," Singapore is one of the smallest states in the world, its area is only 710.2 square kilometres. Until the middle of the 20th century, the country was an English colony, in 1951 it acquired the status of a self-governing state within the British Empire. In 1963, the city-state became part of Malaysia, but in August 1965 it seceded and became independent. Prior to modernization and becoming the finance centre, Singapore was a poor third world country with no obvious economic advantages and significant reserves of natural resources. Even the country had to import fresh water from Malaysia. Most of the population lived in slums and was illiterate. The country was rife with corruption, drug trafficking and piracy. How did the country manage to achieve these results in a short time? Modernization of Singapore was ensured by efforts in four key areas, such as: economic reforms that set the vector for investment and innovation development, social modernization, an effective fight against corruption, and political stability. Fighting corruption Today Singapore is one of the least corrupt countries in the world. However, in the 1950s, bribes were taken openly, this was a tradition of local authorities. The new government has set the task of eradicating corruption, regardless of personal connections and making no exceptions. A special Anti-Corruption Bureau was created in the country, reporting personally to the Prime Minister. The bureau's employees were endowed with broad powers, had the right to detain and search suspects of corruption. Members of the Cabinet of Ministers and even relatives of the Prime Minister became the object of anti-corruption investigations. As a result, a number of high-ranking officials ended up in prison, some are still serving their sentences. Many corrupt officials fled the country. When a close friend of the Prime Minister was convicted of corruption, Lee Kuan Yew, perhaps the architect of modern Singapore sent him to prison. Simplifying regulation and enhancing the prestige of the civil service has become another area of ​​the fight against corruption. The powers of officials were regulated in detail, a number of prohibitions and restrictions were established for them, decision-making procedures became much simpler and more transparent. The salaries of judges and civil servants were raised. Thus, the salary of a Singaporean judge has reached several hundred thousand dollars a year (in the 1990s it exceeded a million dollars a year). The salaries of civil servants in positions of responsibility have been raised to a level comparable to that of top managers in private corporations. Today, officials are regularly interviewed about the pitfalls of corruption. They systematically receive advice on how not to accidentally get involved in corrupt schemes. Officials are warned about accountability under the law on preventing corruption. Bureau staff regularly lecture college students about the dangers of corruption, both for themselves and for the whole society. Officials are prohibited from accepting any gifts in the form of money or in any other form from people in business with them. It is also forbidden to accept invitations that could put an employee of a government department in any kind of dependent position. If an official cannot refuse a gift, he or she can accept it, but must immediately give it to the head of his department. An official can take a gift only if he pays for it in advance at a price determined by the accounting department of his department. Simple and transparent business conditions The government has relied on attracting foreign investors, developing the financial market and high-tech industries. Singapore has adopted simple and transparent procedures for registering and regulating businesses. The city-state became the first country in Asia that was able to establish favourable conditions for foreign corporations, and the latter began to open branches in the country. A simple and transparent taxation system with low tax rates was established. To avoid double taxation, Singapore immediately signed about 70 agreements with foreign countries. Simultaneously with the simplification of the business environment, the city-state government implemented a consistent industrial policy in which government leverage played a significant role. The authorities allocated priority sectors, invested in them and developed them, and then these segments, having reached a certain level of development, like locomotives, pulled the entire economy forward. In the 1970s, a new priority area appeared - the electronics industry, in which small Singapore was able to take the place of one of the world leaders. The development of the industry has allowed not only to create high-paying jobs, but also to equip Singaporean enterprises with the latest technology. In the 1980s, an IT plan was adopted, within the framework of which a total computerization of state institutions took place, which gave an impetus to the development of the computer industry at the expense of government orders. This prompted private companies to accelerate their computerization as well, giving the computer industry an additional boost. Today Singapore is one of the most computerized countries. At the end of the 20th century, the government found a new priority - the development of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Currently, preferential programs for business continue to operate in the country. So, for small and medium-sized enterprises, dozens of programs of preferential lending have been developed, the state assists them in recruiting personnel, compensates for up to 90% of the costs of training and retraining. Foreign high-tech companies investing in research and development receive a ten-year tax exemption. Social modernization The most important role in the modernization of the country was played by the reform of the education system, which took place in the 1960s – 1970s. Minimum educational standards binding on all schools were created. Among other things, it became mandatory to study English and teach a number of subjects in it. The government has invested in educating Singaporean students at the best universities in the world, while establishing leading research and education centres in its homeland. Another important social aspect is the successful housing and communal reform. The state has made a bid for citizens to buy apartments in their ownership, and not live in rented housing. In four decades of independence, more than 90% of Singaporeans have moved to government-sponsored apartment buildings. The Central Provident Fund has become a key instrument of housing reform. Each working Singaporean receives a special personal account in it, to which he is obliged to transfer 20% of his salary, the same amount is transferred by his employer. These funds are charged with bank interest and are not taxed. The sheer scale of the government's housing program has made the construction industry a powerful engine of Singapore's economic development. Private companies used the experience in the construction of multi-storey residential areas to develop the hotel stock, and a hotel boom began in the city-state. Thanks to it, Singapore can comfortably receive up to six million tourists a year: this is twice the country's population. Conclusion The success of the Asian city-state is interesting first of all because it took place in the absence of obvious advantages and was ensured by an exceptionally competent state policy. However, there is nothing among the measures that is not known to a wide range of decision-makers: support for priority industries, simplification of procedures and improvement of business conditions, and fight against corruption. Much of this has been used many times in different parts of the world. It is obvious that success was not ensured by unique measures, but by their intelligent application by highly motivated professionals."
15,The Only Economic Strategy That Systematically Lowers Your Taxes While Paying Off the National Debt,finance," Many American voters cast their ballots on the basis of taxes alone. Whoever promises the lowest tax rate automatically wins their vote. And this fiscally conservative voter generally votes for the Republican candidate and opposes the Democrat candidate. But interestingly enough, over the past 40 years it’s the Republican not the Democratic administrations who have significantly increased the national debt. It was the GW Bush administration that (based on the fraudulent claim that Sadam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction) dragged us into the forever war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The war debt in conjunction with a huge tax cut for the wealthy, increased the national debt dramatically! Now in the age of Trump it’s another monstrous tax break for the billionaire class along with the completely and totally mismanaged (and still expanding) COVID 19 virus outbreak that is again exploding the national debt. And sooner or later it well be we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) who will repay this debt in the form of higher taxes. But there is an economic strategy (totally ignored by our politicians) that’s systematically designed to lower your taxes while systematically paying off the national debt at the same time. It’s chief proponent, Dr. Norman Kurland, President of the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ.ORG) has labeled this strategy Capital Homesteading. And in order to explain it, let’s begin with two FACTS. A Systematic Solution Based on Facts First, on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. Second, that translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 80 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
16,You Would Never Have Thought That Having Accounting Internship Could Be So Beneficial,finance," The internship program is a link between the working world and the higher education of students.

17,Rosbank: Rapid Digital Transformation during Quarantine,finance," Interview with Head of Mortgage Products and Digital, Rosbank, Societe Generale Group CONSTANTINE FELUKOV: What is your role within Rosbank, and what sets the bank apart from other financial institutions in Russia? IGOR DMITRIEV: I am Head of Products, Marketing and Digital Business at Mortgage and Real Estate Ecosystem Business Line at Rosbank, Societe Generale group. I am responsible for launching and managing of products, building of digital platform, program management, marketing and digital acquisition, development of digital B2C & B2B channels. Our bank is a digital business leader in mortgage in Russia. We were the first bank to launch pre-approval via a web channel (at our website), pre-approval via a chat bot (at Facebook, as well as at VK, which is Russia’s popular local social network) and a real-estate database with AI. If we talk about our general approach – we provide several paths for our clients to get their mortgage: on the website, via chat bots, approval by phone and at our partners (web, IOS and android applications). We understand that a strong market position at the forefront of collaboration with clients and partners is impossible without modern back-office and credit processes. Our main priority is decreasing operational cost, so that we are able to provide a better price for our clients and a better profitability of our business. We launched a wide program of internal automation: AI & machine learning, robotization, document recognition, a step-by-step process for our branch offices, business process automation. Alongside the development of classical mortgage products, we are working at developing an ecosystem and bundle products for our clients and partners. FELUKOV: What is the competitive situation for the financial institutions in Russia? How does Russia generally compare with other Western companies in terms of IT development and does being a part of Societe Generale Group give the bank any advantages? DMITRIEV: When I analyzed the offerings of Russian banks 6 years ago, a typical digital solution in our market had poor functionality and design. Over the last several years, the situation has changed. Russian banking market is now one of the most modern. However, if we talk about the most interesting market where the new developments are taking place – I would look to the Asia-Pacific region (APAC). Obviously, being a part of worldwide group allows to Rosbank to take many advantages. For example, we are able to share our business experience, design, and expertise globally. FELUKOV: Historically, how did Rosbank go about managing its IT department? What were its IT practices, in what ways did it outsource its IT tasks? DMITRIEV: If we talk about our mortgage business line, we have a long history of evolution not only in terms of the project approaches (Agile, Scrum, LeSS, Waterfall), but also in terms of the team management. Seven years ago, we had only 8 developers in-house and an outsourced team of about 10 developers and analysts. Currently, our team consists of around 80 in-house digital analysts, product managers, system analysts and developers, and 30 developers and system analysts on an outstaff model, and around 5-members team on an outsource model. We have chosen to grow expertise in-house, using an external provider to manage the flexible part of our team, and such “hybrid” team proved to be quite successful. Fortunately for us our main partner for front-end solutions, an IT company CMD-soft, understood our goal of having in-house expertise and, as a good partner, adapted its approach to better comply with our needs. FELUKOV: Could you tell the readers more about Rosbank’s partnership with an IT company CMD-soft? DMITRIEV: Our partnership with CMD-soft continues for more than 10 years. During the period of fast growth of our digital program, we had a couple of issues: the speed with which CMD-soft increased its allocated resources was slow, and there were problems organizing collaborative development. However, all issues were resolved and for last 3 years we have a very effective relationship. I think success of effective collaboration results from efforts of both sides. CMD-soft understands our business and project management needs and is able to provide us complex solutions for development of our digital platform: outstaffing specialists, outsourcing development and technical consulting. At our side, we have learned the details of resource management of our partner and understand that we are able to get a cheaper price if we plan our resource needs with a long-term approach. I will be honest to say that CMD-soft is a flexible partner, oriented on a win-win approach to business. There is a popular saying in the IT industry: “We will not do it, because it was not included in the technical requirements”, and I have never heard it from the managers of CMD-soft. Instead, what I hear is: “It was not included in the TR, but let’s find an approach to do it”. I think it is really important to have a partner with common values. FELUKOV: When the government required quarantine and effectively shut down all retail locations in March 2020, did that feel like a threat to the bank’s business? DMITRIEV: Yes, that felt like a threat. Especially so for out mortgage business, because prior to the shutdown a normal business process had been to ask a client to visit a bank’s office to confirm and sign the deal. In the period of quarantine, the visiting of branches became difficult. FELUKOV: What strategy and extra steps did Rosbank undertake to position itself on the winning end of the quarantine? How did the bank prepare itself for the post-quarantine world? DMITRIEV: Quarantine stimulated us to do what we always wanted to do, but didn’t think our business would depend on. Our strategy has been to keep the client safe and do the work remotely as much as possible. That meant relying even more on the digital component, and providing ways to eliminate branch visits altogether. And that is across all our product offerings and across all our coverage area, i.e. across all of Russia. We rapidly launched a fully digital deal with our partners (with electronic signage) and branch-less deals with our manager visiting the client. That required intense work, which our “hybrid” IT team was able to absorb. And, it kept our business moving. It turns out that this adaptation effort became not only a foundation for anti-crisis response of our business, but also a driver for future growth. For example, using electronic signatures we were able to provide our mortgage loan for a client in Singapore. FELUKOV: What is Rosbank’s vision for future development, and what role does IT play in it? DMITRIEV: I think that main competitors of banks are social networks and social media platforms, which currently are trying to provide their own financial products. I also believe that aggregators, which are currently the partners of banks, will be the first to leave banks behind in a battle for the first contact with clients if they are able to use banks as mere service providers. But banks possess a great advantage - long-term trust in their financial expertise, and offer a priceless value – their money management skills. The money management is especially important, because in a broader sense it is the management of welfare and financial future of the banks’ clients. I think that banks will be able to win the battle for clients. But to do that, banks need to transform their business models and in effect become IT companies with a banking soul and a set of values."
18,Should You Prefer Trading Commodities Using Futures Contracts Or Options?,finance," It's one of the most common topics in the trading industry with which lots of newbies and seasoned traders wander around. An obvious idea on both requires choosing the best-suited one from Options or Futures Contracts while trading commodities. So in today's article, we will discuss the characteristics, obligations, execution process, prevailing risks, degrees of profit or loss, etc. of both trading types in brief. Hopefully, it will help traders to make the right trading type. Options Trading: An option is a contract between two parties. The buyer may buy or sell a financial asset/security/commodities at a predetermined price within a predetermined date. In options contracts, investors don't have to buy or sell the asset if they decide not to do so. To get this right of taking decisions, buyers have to pay a premium for the options contract. We can use options for contracts in many areas and markets. Like in real estate, in business deals or to buy cars. For more details, we recommend it to surf some online trading education sources for better understanding. The following features of the options contracts attract traders to trade options: Options have minimal and limited risk Traders can withdraw from an options contract within the validity period if they decide not to do so. Less costly as the premium is only a percentage of the underlying asset. One can even make a profit, and not just when the price of a commodity rises, but also if it goes down. Options trading also involves some risks which should be mention here: Options trading involves high market risk, which means the market can move in various directions with no ample warning. Fundamental issues can influence the value of an underlying asset. Options have higher spreads because of lower liquidity. Options often expire worthless, resulting in a total loss of whatever the buyer paid for the option. Future Contracts: A futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell an underlying product at a specific price at a specific time. Here, the word 'obligation' implies that traders must buy or sell the underlying product at the agreed-upon price when the contract expires. We know the predetermined price to buy or sell the asset as the forward price. Besides, the predetermined time, which is when delivery and payment occur, is known as the delivery date. Though futures can pose unique risks for investors, yet there are several benefits to futures: Futures Always Have Intrinsic Value Liquidity in future markets are very high, and these markets are more efficient and fair Future contracts cost low commission and execution fees Allows high leverage Futures are great for diversification. However, Futures always has unlimited risk. Here are some noteworthy disadvantages of future trading: The high level of leverage offered by future trading can be a double-edged sword for traders. Futures contracts are written for fixed amounts and terms. Low execution fees can encourage traders to over-trading Futures contract only offer a partial hedge. Futures are for large amounts of the underlying commodity or instrument. Therefore, they can be too large for the new trader to try to learn futures trading. Choosing Future Contracts Or Options: Both futures contracts and options have their advantages and disadvantages. So, choosing one over the other can be a bit confusing and challenging. Most experienced traders choose both types of trades depending on different situations, risk appetite, and liquidity. And some traders focus only on one type of trades. However, active traders choose futures contracts to fill their target of making profits from the ups and downs of the market as futures have high liquidity than options. The futures market is widely used for commodity trading such as crude oil, natural gas, coffee, cocoa, etc. On top of that, Future contracts are useful while managing the costs of commodities. On the other hand, some other traders prefer options for insuring their investment as options require low costs of commodities than future contracts. It seems easier as there are many free or paid binary signals providers helping traders decide to buy or sell a call or put. Final Words: So to conclude, we must encourage you to research thoroughly on both the future and options. Knowing every ins and outs before trade execution will help you to make the best decision. Both these trading types have their pros and flaws. So, you should choose the one which matches your strategies, goals, and risk appetite."
19,ACTIVATION OF UAN,finance," Universal Account Number (UAN) is the bank account where an employee’s provident fund (EPF) transfers are performed. In many firms, salaried representatives are provided EPF as an aid that saves taxes and continues to long-called savings. Many representatives are conscious of their capital being combined to their PF collects, but not usually recognize where this capital is and how to approach it. To check PF profit, you are required to turn on your UAN first. This is an adequately simple process that you need to adhere to if you have never turned on your UAN before. Once you turn on UAN, you will be prepared to look at PF balance. Each employer leading to EPF carries a 12-digit Universal Account Number. The Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) designates it. The UAN of a staff member continues the same throughout growth regardless of the amount of organization he/she advances. Every moment a staff member shifts his/her work, EPFO assigns a unique member identification number (ID), which is associated with the UAN.

1,Why USD is a Safe Haven During the Crisis,finance," The year 2020 has been a turmoil for the whole world. The rocky start in international politics with the United States military assassinating General Qasem Soleiman in Iraq has put the world at high alert as Iran was threatening a war which led to price fluctuations on Oil. Shortly after the global pandemic has led to the struggle of even the world’s leading economies. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has caused one of the biggest health hazards of the modern history of the world. Most of the countries in the world started to close down their borders in order to either contain the spread inside their own territories or just keep foreigners from transferring the virus unknowingly. The world is not as bleak as it looks though. Some European countries started opening up as the drop in the new COVID-19 cases is manageable in the end. Social distancing laws have also eased which gave the service sector a headroom to breathe and start making money. Although international flights are still restricted to the point of tourism industry not being as viable as it used to be. But, people are surviving, and in the end, that is all that matters. Since the unemployment rate is rising to record high in developing countries like the United States of America for example with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world one would think that the currency market should also be crushing, but in reality, it is not. On the contrary, this is the best time to start investing in some currencies. While new coronaviruses are spreading quickly across the whole nation and causing huge drops in the global economy the US dollar is fairing surprisingly well and is viewed as one of the safest assets to invest in. There is more than $1.8 trillion USD circulating around the world at this moment. At one point it even soared 4% on the US dollar index. This is not caused by smaller investors though. Most of the global financial institutions like federal banks are keeping a lot of USD reserves with large parts of international transactions being done in the USD. Why is USD so reliable? Even in the face of protests caused by the death of African American male, George Floyd, at the hands of Minneapolis police department where he was choked to death on live camera while begging for a room to breathe the US is considered to be a politically stable nation. This fact says a lot of considering the peaceful protests quickly turned into violent looting and rioting sprees in many states of the United States with police forces clashing into civilian organized groups at every corner. It is worth noting that this belief in the stability of the United States dollar is coming from the rigorous practices that financial institutions all across the country are leading. The liquidity of USD is one of the best and volatility doesn’t fall short as well. It is not expected for the price to fluctuate drastically in comparisons to other currencies like Turkish lira for example or Argentinian peso. This has been recognized fact not only by the outside world but US politicians as well. In 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic started shaking the world the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin came out with a speech that can be equated to him boasting about the stability and influence of the US dollar. He said that he takes huge pride in the fact that a lot of people across the world are utilizing dollar as a reserve currency and the fact that it bears a strong value. It is worth noting that the official currency of the US is largely utilized outside the boundaries of the country. This has been true for almost a century now after Gold Standard lost its trust all across the world since the First World War. A lot of countries like Great Britain started taking loans which they haven’t done ever and these were taken from the United States. Even after the Second World War, the case was with the US when a lot of funds came from that very nation to rebuild the whole of Europe. President Nixon is highly regarded as a person solely responsible for destroying the Gold Standard. On August 15th of 1971, he announced that the US would no longer convert the dollars to gold at a fixed value and thus completely abandoned the gold standard. There is around $1.8 Trillion in circulation all across the world at this moment. Even more, it is widely believed that more than two-thirds of $100 bills and almost half of $50 bills are held solely outside the United States of America. It is also true that the US model works on transparency while other huge world economies like China suffer from high government interference. They are plagued by dishonorable financial practices that benefit the ruling party of the republic. European Union and Euro being the second candidate but suffering from much higher volatility which makes it less of an adoptable currency. Lots of countries in the EU are still retaining their own currency as sometimes adoption and transformation may lead to economic problems, external shocks, as well as big changes in the competitive positions in the domestic market."

3,What If Everyone Participated on the Ownership Side of the US Economy?,finance," Politicians always talk about jobs. But the real issue is NOT JOBS. It’s INCOME! For example, Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Mitt Romney (i.e. the one percent generally speaking) have never had a real job. But they have more than enough income. On the other hand, you can have multiple jobs, as many people do these days, and still be unable to pay your rent. That said, there are two ways to generate income. You can work for a wage or a salary. Or, as the one percent has clearly demonstrated, you can simply own enough wealth-producing capital assets (stocks, bonds, land, machines, etc), collect enough in dividends, and you’ll do just fine. Since 1980 wages and salaries - the workers’ side of the economy - has stagnated. In contrast, the ownership side of the economy has exploded so much that it’s created a huge, unprecedented plutocracy/oligarchy along with a wealth gap between the few and the many so large that it threatens what little is left of America’s claim to being a political democracy. As proof of that pudding a recent study shows that in 1990 the United States had 66 billionaires. In 2020 we now have 614 billionaires. Furthermore, during the past four COVID dominated months billionaire wealth has grown an average of 23% while millions of workers have lost their jobs, their health insurance, and their ability to support themselves and their families. In other words, America is in dire need of real change. The question is, what should that real change look like? That said, consider the following COLD, HARD FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 Trillion Dollars annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. 90% Lack the Opportunity More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several month ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! In that light let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise here is, how can we make sure the average American citizen has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where most of the wealth is being generated? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars-worth of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every American citizen annually (man, woman, and child) •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via future earnings/dividends (not from savings) •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create a predictable, stabilizing, residual income for its owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GEVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What this strategy would do however, is give every American citizen access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. In the long run it will help democratize the free market, end poverty, stabilize family life, balance the budget, and pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. So for example, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education. In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the load on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts and impedes concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Today’s Crisis Wouldn’t Be a Crisis If the Obama administration, the GW Bush administration, or the Clinton administration had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Trump has the same opportunity for over three years now and has shown no genuine interest in making America great once and for all. Joe Biden? How about you? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
4,Let's End Wage Slavery in the USA,finance," A wage slave is any person (regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or political party) who is confronted with the choice of accepting a job or starving. It’s anyone who lacks the resources to take care of themselves and their family without selling the most productive hours of their day/week/month/life to someone else in exchange for a buck. So how do you know if you’re a wage slave? Do you thank God when it’s Friday? Do you prefer weekends over weekdays? Would you stop working if working stopped paying your wage or salary? Do you regret that someone else has purchased and now owns a high percentage of your life? Do you wish your necessities were all covered by your monthly dividend income? If you answered yes to any of these questions you are undoubtedly a 21st century wage slave who’s picking cotton on a 21st century plantation and working for someone who values you as little more than a means to a buck as opposed to a fully functioning human being. Most of us are Wage Slaves But please don’t be insulted if you’ve discovered that you’re a wage slave. Most of us are economically enslaved by a system that privileges a few at the expense of the many. You’re absolutely the rule and not the exception. Most people, if they’re able to tell the truth, dislike their jobs as well as their bosses. But they feel trapped. They have little choice other than to continue working as long as they want to eat and have a roof overhead. Great choice! Then here in the USA many of us celebrate our freedom. Many of us celebrate our political democracy, a government of, by and for the people. Many think that slavery is a thing of the past, and if you work hard and play by the rules you’ll win in the American meritocracy. But if you spend 8 hours a day, and 40 (or more) hours a week, working in an autocracy, a workplace dictatorship, are you really free? If 1% of the population owns and controls most of the wealth as well as the entire political system, do we really have a political democracy? Do you actually believe that America is even remotely close to being a meritocracy? If so, good luck! So How Can We End Wage Slavery in the USA? So the question becomes, how can we end systematic wage slavery here in the USA? In that light, consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 Trillion Dollars annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and tech developments that account for this growth. 90% Lack the Opportunity More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several month ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! In that light let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise here is, how can we make sure the average American citizen has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where most of the wealth is being generated? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars-worth of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Paying “We the People” to Pull Together… Consider the following scenario… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT loans •	at 0% interest •	to be repaid with future earnings from pre-tax, dividend dollars, not personal savings •	to every American citizen annually •	along with the stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for the purchase of these assets and to create a predictable, stabilizing, residual income for its owners? This strategy, known as Capital Homesteading, would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GEVERNMENT DEBT! And it creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets. And it wouldn’t be inflationary. All created funds would instantly be backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive fully insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What this strategy would do however, is give every American citizen equal access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. In the long run it would democratize the free market economy, end poverty, stabilize family life, balance the budget, and pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. So for example, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education. In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the load on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts and impedes concentrated wealth as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Today’s Crisis Wouldn’t Be a Crisis If the Obama administration, the GW Bush administration, or the Clinton administration, etc. had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Trump has had the same opportunity for over 3 years now but shows no interest in actually making America great again. Joe Biden? How about you? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."

6,What I Discovered About Forex Trading,finance," More people are discovering and trying out Forex Forex, Forex, Forex... It's all about Forex. It seems to me recently, more, and more people are discovering and trying out Forex, exploring it, and are very eager. First, let me flashback to August 2017 when I opened my first account with a Forex Education provider as well as funded my first brokerage accounts. It was utterly intoxicating as I undertook effort, eager to amass millions on my terms based on my skill and intellect. I could travel and trade anywhere! I had recently retired from the Navy, and due to several changes in my life, I had ample savings, which I was willing to use a portion to fund my Forex adventure. And I was traveling a lot internationally at this time, not on Uncle Sam's dime or under his protection, and beginning to buy investments in other countries, and there grew quite a swollen head of mogul I was becoming. Why do people jump into Forex? What I see today with some others discovering Forex is sometimes the same thing, people with a little 'excess' cash due to having reasonably well-paying jobs, but who want to get out of the rat race and to achieve their dreams and desires, funded by their profiting from trading. They all thirst to find riches and charge into Forex, hoping to use their skill and intellect to amass their future fortunes. We all do; it seems many of us who jump into Forex indeed do have visions of sugar plums dancing in our heads. I can relate to the rush I see others experiencing. My experience When I first begin trading, I did not have any friends or associates I could discuss my experiences with, outside of the one associate who introduced me to the Forex education provider, and several brokers he recommended. At the beginning of my journey, I JUST KNEW if I was the smartest person now trading, and if not, I was going to be amongst those in the most intelligent person group!!, LOL. What I didn't know and refused to listen to was all the advice about the factors which most correlate to successful trading, and many of these have no connection to being the smartest person. I came to this conclusion following my initial time in Forex trading and after making tremendous gains of profit only to be followed by even higher losses. By ignoring those key factors which more experienced traders tried to share with all the newbies, I mostly made or ended up making nearly every rookie mistake one can. I, therefore, suffered financial losses and humiliation those who make rookie mistakes feel. Key Factors for Successful Forex Trading The factors I determined to be KEY to being a successful trader I have also observed quickly separate people; these are having extreme discipline, the ability to pay attention to detail, discipline, willing to take calculated risks, discipline, ability to recognize patterns, discipline, and then most of all, discipline. I cannot say it enough, disciplined thinking and habits should be the foundation for every decision you make and action you take. These factors are vital in achieving the results of making profitable trades or suffering avoidable losses. I will discuss discipline further in my next article and share the exact amounts I both profited and lost."
7,The One Skill Every Forex Trader Should Master To Succeed And How To Master It.,finance," There are many skills one must learn to become a successful forex trader. But, there is one skill every trader should master to succeed in this business. That is, the skill of accepting loss. You could have the best trading system in the world, be the most disciplined trader, and know all the candlestick patterns there are, but the market will always go where it goes. You can’t tame it, you can’t control it. It goes where it goes. That’s the simple reality of the markets that most seminars and marketing information about trading leveraged products skip. So, if you lack the courage to take a loss, soon you will be sweating and praying for the market and the gods to turn your running losses to profits. Ask any trader who has said those prayers what happens eventually, the chorus answer is they lost a lot more than they were willing to lose. If you are to hone this skill, you need to understand why most traders like you struggle with trading loss in the first place. Two reasons why traders struggle to accept loss. If we looked at the struggle to accept trading loss from face value, it is because traders fear to lose money. You do all your planning, enter a trade, say, it goes in your favor, and suddenly it turns red. What does a typical trader do? They move or remove the stop loss - if they had it in the first place. Why? Because it is painful to close a losing trade and lose money. At the back of their minds, they are convinced that their analysis about the direction of the market can’t be wrong, it is just market makers hunting stop losses and pretty soon the candles will reverse and print in their direction. Sometimes, they get lucky. But when they are not, the negative trade can go and go and may never come back to profit. Why would a sober trader leave a trade run deep into losses if they didn’t fear to lose the money in the first place? Maybe the right question is: Why do traders fear to accept losses like a plague? When a trader funds a trading account with rent money, borrowed money, let’s say, any money they cannot loose. They manage to create for themselves a challenge to first, make money to cover the lender or pay the bills and second, turn a profit for them. This challenge will create emotional pressure to not loose, because you imagine all the bad things that will happen if you lose the money. What our novice trader will do, when faced with a losing trade is break all the damn rules and refuse to close the losing trade because he just can’t afford to lose the money. What they don’t seem to realize is by not accepting to lose, you lose. Often big. How to accept trading loss. Reorient yourself with the psychology of trading. Trading is more of a mind game than the mechanical aspects of learning to read charts and the fundamental geopolitical factors that move markets. You can only learn to accept loss, when you are convinced that you can’t learn enough about trading to control the markets. It goes where it goes. What you can do, is build up the basic trading skills like technical analysis, reading price action, then create a trading strategy that leads to an edge where over a certain number of trades your wins make up for the losses. Conclusion. Trading forex and any other leveraged products (Cryptos, CFDs, Options, Stocks, Commodities) is not as easy as advertised. The markets are brutal. Every trader out there wants your money, the same way you want their money. You can only succeed as a trader if you are humble enough to take small losses because you are certain the big wins will eventually cover for the losses."
8,Factors that inhibit the popularity of Forex in numerous countries,finance," The past few decades have been extremely important for the development of the financial industry globally. The entire ecosystem has shifted from a traditional industry that did not use much digital technology to a completely web-based sector. The picture has completely changed today as the financial industry is proud to be one of the most digitalized sectors on earth. This has helped the development of many rural areas globally whilst making financial services more accessible and affordable to millions of people. When thinking about the digitalization of the financial sector, the first thing that comes to mind is commercial banking. Unlike just a couple of decades ago, making a money transaction or performing a basic financial operation required going to the bank branch, waiting in the queue, and then engaging in a lengthy process with the staff. All of these can now be done by simply swiping one’s smartphone and using the mobile application. This has become the new normal and we got quite used to it. Even thinking of what the process was like not long ago is difficult as we have completely adapted to the new reality. Nevertheless, commercial baning or insurance companies are just the surface of the big change. Forex trading has benefited significantly throughout the process of rapid digitalization. This sector has been around for quite some time now. A long list of now extremely famous billionaires and philanthropists have started doing their business by forex trading. One of those people is a globally recognized businessman, philanthropist, and educator George Soros. The 89-year-old made the first bits of his $8 billion fortune out of Forex trading. Now, he is one of the most influential personalities in the field, having donated more than $32 billion to open foundations throughout his lifetime. Forex in the digital era Unlike back in days when George Soros started trading, the forex market has become much more accessible for anyone who is willing to invest their money in it. The internet has made a gigantic network of forex trading platforms possible. Therefore, now anyone can trade from any part of the world. As a result of the soaring access to the internet globally, more and more people start trading. Yet, the entire sector is not just based on the spreads and luck. To become a successful trader, one needs to have sufficient knowledge and preferably experience. Unfortunately, many people compare forex trading to gambling, citing that one is completely dependent on luck. The truth is that luck plays minimal to no part in forex trading. One with relevant knowledge and experience in the field can make big amounts of money out of trading. Nevertheless, this is not the way to achieve overnight success. There is the misconception that forex trading can make people rich overnight, but that is simply not true. Rather, success in forex is determined by months and sometimes years of sleepless nights lost money and continued efforts. Nations globally are striving to enable for more forex operations within their jurisdictions. Some of the most developed countries like the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia are implementing laws aimed to foster the sector. However, many countries, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the middle east are falling behind. Emerging countries that are rapidly developing try to support the forex industry. One of the best examples is Georgia, a small country located on the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The former Soviet republic implemented liberal laws that aim to attract investors not only from Georgia but from overseas countries. Moreover, the nation made quite a few changes to adapt to the crypto industry and even became one of the largest crypto mining hubs in the world, thanks to the company like Bitffury. So is there a pattern? Why is Forex not as popular in some countries? Or why are some nations not even legalizing it? The big misconception - Forex sector’s affiliation with gambling The biggest hindering factor for the popularity of forex is many countries is its misleading affiliation with gambling. Many people strongly believe that forex trading is all about luck and once you get in, there is no way out. For someone in the forex sector, this would sound simply funny. However, the issue remains serious and the industry should do more to address such allegations and misconceptions properly in efforts to fade them away. Otherwise, the trust and the overall image will remain blurry and dark for the general public of many nations around the world. To put it simply, forex as a sector has an extremely bad reputation in many countries. This is primarily due to the fact that the vast majority of people who try trading lose money at first. As mentioned above in the article, losing money during the first period is simply fine. Forex trading requires lots of technical knowledge that is accumulated throughout the experience. Reading a textbook about forex will not make you an A-listed trader. The fact that people ‘bid’ money and then lose makes the forex sector look and sound like a gigantic casino hall where rich people go to have fun. In reality, this obviously is not true. In countries where attitudes towards casinos are extremely conservative, forex is particularly tabooed. Strict legal frameworks One of the most important factors for forming a welcoming forex environment is the country’s legal framework regarding the matter. For instance, the United Kingdom is extremely open with an independent regulatory framework, supporting companies working within the market. However, this is not always the case in every country. Even today, forex trading is completely forbidden in some nations. For instance, in Iran, one could be imprisoned for trying to trade with currencies. The situation is similar in the vast majority of the middle east and some nations of Southeast Asia. naturally, the popularity of forex is questionable in an environment where trading is outlawed."
9,USEFUL TIPS: HOW TO CHOOSE A FOREX BROKER,finance," Forex trading is one of the most popular ways to make money for millions of traders around the world. Of course, one of the essential conditions for a successful transaction is to choose a quality and reliable brokerage company. If you do not know how and which broker to choose, you will find on this page some tips that can help you cope with this task. Today, hundreds of large brokers offer their services to traders. The choice is truly enormous. We suggest studying the general rules on how to choose a successful broker. MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE IS NOT SO DIFFICULT! In this section, we will examine in detail the six main criteria to take into account if you want to choose a quality and reliable intermediary for successful work in the Forex market. At the beginning of our story on how to choose a broker, we would like to emphasize that a reliability problem is the most important. Even the most effective trading strategy and informed decisions will not bring the desired profit if the brokerage firm cancels profitable trades without explanation, authorizes slips and quotes, does not allow to withdraw gains for weeks and does not not provide high quality user support. You can avoid such problems if you carefully study the reviews of the company you are interested in. To properly select an appropriate broker, you need to consider both customer reviews and the availability of licenses from regulatory authorities. In most cases, any reliable broker licensed by the regulators strives to provide high quality transactions and good terms. This is not surprising, since in most cases traders can submit complaints to regulatory authorities. They, in turn, have the right to impose various sanctions on unreliable companies, ranging from fines to revocation of licenses. When deciding how and which Forex broker to choose based on the reliability criteria, it is certainly worth mentioning the need to take into account the company's experience in the market and the comments of professional traders on its work. In most cases, newcomers who have a very limited budget at the outset cannot afford to choose a large, reliable brokerage company known in the market and licensed by recognized regulators. This is why, in this case, we recommend that you seek an optimal balance between attractive trading conditions and the good reputation of the intermediary. By analyzing the question of how novice traders make the decision to choose a broker for their work, it can be concluded that in most cases, they pay particular attention to the size of the leverage and minimum deposit. Such an approach can hardly be called the best, as it is unlikely to be successful. Significant leverage can make it possible to multiply the deposit several times a day or to siphon off all the profits in a single transaction in the event of a sharp change in the market. Speaking of how to choose the right Forex broker for a novice trader, we would like to note that maintaining a minimum deposit level is a great opportunity to learn how to trade: in this case, you can feel the atmosphere of low risk trading. In addition, a reliable broker in most cases provides demo accounts to clients as a platform for training and testing trading strategies. Before you finally choose a professional broker, you need to pay attention to the hidden commissions. Most often, brokerage firms decide to choose and establish not only spreads for their clients' open positions. It can also be an additional fee for withdrawing funds, providing services, etc. This is crucial if you want to know how to choose the right Forex broker and not lose money earned in the future. Each brokerage firm independently decides how to deposit and withdraw funds for its clients, as well as the daily deposit / withdrawal limit. Today, almost all brokers are able to use wire transfers to bank accounts and credit cards to replenish and withdraw the deposit. In addition, in practice, you can almost always choose a broker suitable for trading, who will support the payment system that suits you (Skrill, Paypal, VISA, MasterCard, etc.). Most often, a minimum fee is applied to these payments and the money is properly credited to your trading account within minutes. It should be noted that some reliable and competent brokers support automated withdrawal. Before choosing a broker, you should assess your need for this useful service with the companies that interest you. This is a very important feature that allows you to automatically transfer money earned from the Forex market to your electronic wallet at virtually no additional cost. restrictions. We recommend that you choose a broker that offers a functional and understandable trading platform that supports the most popular and functional terminals. The availability of the web version of the trading platform and mobile applications for trading can be considered as an important advantage that motivates the choice of such a professional broker. Of course, in most cases, these types of Forex trading platforms have more modest functionality, both for performing good technical analysis and for using trading signals and other tools. However, in any case, this is an important advantage. This allows you to better understand how to correctly choose a broker. The comments and opinions of the trader's peers on the work of a particular broker are in most cases crucial for beginners in the Forex market. However, the approach to their evaluation should be critical. Often, novice traders can blame even the most reliable and successful brokers, because it is the user who decides how to trade and which strategy to choose for the job. Very often brokerage firms also pay for promotional evaluations. Don't trust everything you read. In other words, it is necessary to choose and account for trading only really useful advice from impartial and experienced traders. Before choosing a reliable and quality broker, it is necessary to assess its quality of customer service. The availability of qualified assistance 24 hours a day on the phone, on Skype or by email is no longer an advantage, but an essential condition for any successful Forex broker. In most cases, with the competent wording of the question and adequate communication, the assistance service of any brokerage company can provide complete answers to all your questions. When it comes to how to choose the ideal broker, you need to pay close attention to bonuses, promotions and other ways to encourage customers. For example, in most cases, you can receive an additional bonus of between 50 and 200% of the amount you first deposited into your account, depending on the amount credited. In addition, the provision of various analytical services and free trading tools is an important advantage. Now you really know how to correctly choose a broker and which reliable intermediary to use. CONCLUSION It may seem that it is extremely difficult to choose a good broker and this task is time consuming. In fact, this statement is close to reality. However, if you follow our recommendations, you can find a Forex brokerage firm that meets all of your requirements. We sincerely hope that our recommendations can help novice and experienced traders to choose the best broker for trading."

Obviously, there are outliers as there always are, but this is more or less how it usually plays out. It goes without saying that there is a lot of value to be gained with free courses, but there is even far more value in paid courses. So in the end, usually the best forex trading courses for beginners are paid and give you the best value. Of course, there are many more factors to consider, and these aren't the most important of them all, but they are nonetheless necessary to find your perfect course. So when you are finally ready to learn forex trading and become a bonafide forex trader, remember not all forex education courses are equal."
12,Avoiding the flood — tax issues with water rights in agribusiness,finance," Background The recognition of water as a precious resource in Australia has led to a proliferation of statutory licensing schemes throughout our various states and territories. In many cases, a water license will feature as a significant asset of a typical primary production business. Moreover, primary producers are increasingly becoming involved in transactions and dealings involving water rights. These include, for example, the sale of water licenses as part of an overarching land and business sale, the trading of water rights or the transfer of water rights between related entities in the course of restructuring private groups. It is therefore critical for advisers acting for primary producers to have an understanding of the broader legislative regime governing water rights, as well as the particular taxation treatment afforded to water rights under the income tax legislation. Legal framework Common law Historically, landowners have had common law rights to use the water flowing on to their land, to extract water from underground sources and from rivers or streams flowing through or adjacent to their land (known as ""riparian water rights"").2   These rights were inseparable from the land and were necessarily transferred upon the conveyance of the land. The only limitation on the amount of water that could be extracted was not to interfere with the reasonable usage of other landowners possessing such rights. Moreover, a landowner could have no greater right to water than their interest in the land allowed. Water rights did not exist as a distinct legal concept and were instead part of the bundle of rights associated with land ownership.3 Statutory licenses The common law has been largely replaced by legislation in all states and territories4   that provide comprehensive statutory schemes for the regulation of water resources by the issuing of water licenses. This includes water resources in major river systems such as the Murray–Darling Basin and more localized water resources such as aquifers and lakes. In general terms, the holder of a water license has the right to extract a certain volume of water from a specified water resource for a prescribed use on the terms and conditions of the license. These water resources might include a water course, ground water, springs, dams and other water works. Relevant state and territory government departments maintain water registers that record and maintain information about water rights and their ownership. However, unlike property registers, there is no overarching concept of infeasibility of title applied to water rights registered on a water register. Water trading The volume of water that can be extracted from a specific water source is an important term of the license. This volume is expressed as the water entitlement, being the permanent entitlement to a certain volume of water. The proportion of the entitlement that the license holder may use in a water year is referred to as the allocation. The allocation is subject to change, depending on water availability, environmental flow requirements and relevant state and federal laws. The allocation, entitlement and/or water license are all trade able. In New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, water rights can be purchased and sold on a permanent or temporary basis by both landowners and non-landowners. Water trading is most notable within the Murray–Darling Basin, which is Australia’s most active water market. A number of water exchanges have now emerged providing a platform upon which water rights can be traded within the basin with ease. Water rights as legal property The separation of water rights from real property provides a basis for water rights to be regarded as legal property.5   Indeed, the legislation in some jurisdictions is highly instructive on this issue. For example, in South Australia, both water licenses and water allocations are deemed to be: ""personal property and may pass to another in accordance with the provisions of the [Natural Resources Management Act 2004] or, subject to this Act, in accordance with any other law for the passing or property.""6 The New South Wales legislation, although not specifically stating that water rights are property, provides for a system that treats water rights in a manner similar to real property. For instance, the New South Wales legislation allows for mortgages and caveats to be registered against water licenses.7   Similar provisions exist in both South Australia and Victoria, but the relevant provisions in South Australia are, as at the date of writing, yet to commence. The recognition of water rights as having a separate legal existence from the land to which those rights relate is fundamental to the taxation treatment of water rights under the income tax legislation, which is explored below. Taxation implications Revenue or capital account The ability for license holders to engage in water trading activities necessitates an assessment of whether gains made from the sale or transfer of water rights may give rise to revenue gains rather than capital gains. Revenue gains are potentially assessable as ordinary income under s 6-5 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Th) (IT AA 1997) and naturally would not qualify for any of the present concessions applicable to capital gains, including the general 50% discount.8 There also remains the possibility that licenses and allocations could be treated as trading stock if transactions were particularly frequent. It is not inconceivable that a taxpayer involved in regular and systematic water trading activities could be regarded as conducting a business of dealing in water entitlements. There has been considerable growth in the marketplace of public companies, fund managers and other large organizations buying and selling water rights. Although a significant proportion of those assets may be leased, some are turned over in the course of trading. It may also be possible for an isolated transaction involving the acquisition of a water entitlement with an intention to profit on its sale to give rise to ordinary income.9 For the most part, however, water rights owned by primary producers are likely to be regarded as held on capital account and should therefore only give rise to taxation under the capital gains tax (CT) regime."
13,What does Forex regulation actually do?,finance," Not too long ago, for many people, the word ""trading"" was a very foreign and alien concept. The truth is, not a lot of people were trading, and it was mostly something that only the people who had the necessary knowledge and experience in the financial market did. The situation is vastly different today. In this digital age of the internet, everything is much more accessible to the general public, and this does include trading. People who otherwise won’t have had anything to do with trading are finding it much easier to get into it and sometimes make it not only a hobby or a source of small additional income but something that they may potentially do full-time later on. It is our firm belief, that one of the biggest reasons for this change is, without a doubt, Forex. Forex is absolutely huge. By some estimates, around $5.1 trillion’s worth of money is being traded every single day on the global Forex market, making it one of the most popular methods of trading out there. Forex managed to open the doors of trading to millions of people around the world, and to this day, remains one of the preferred ways of trading for most newcomers. This, in large part, is due to the fact that it has a much lower entry point than its predecessors of trading. Aside from the respective Forex platform’s minimum entry amount, you’re the one choosing exactly how much you want to trade with, which is a gamechanger. As Forex becomes more and more popular and the number of participants heavily increases, the need for a stronger and more effective regulation increases as well, because as it grows, so does the responsibility that rests upon it. With such high volume and the amount of people trading, needless to say, the security concerns are high. Due to this, regulation is one of the most important aspects of Forex trading in general, and countries and companies go to great lengths to ensure that the regulatory environment is up to impeccable standards. What purpose do Forex Regulations serve? Due to a very different nature of different types of Forex environments in their respective countries, there doesn’t exist one universal definition of what Forex regulations do, but there are definitely some general aims that most of the countries share when they’re building their regulatory environments. In general, Forex regulations are there to ensure, that the business is conducted in a manner that is ethical and fair to the existing and potential customers that may trade on Forex platforms. This is done by necessitating them to follow and comply with the rules and standards that the regulators set out. The regulators provide necessary licensing and registration for the platforms, after which, they’re subjected to continuous audits, reviews and other forms of evaluations that will constantly make sure that they’re complying with the laws and meet the industry standards. What type of demands are set by Regulators? As mentioned, the goal of these regulations is to create a secure and encouraging environment for the market to prosper. This is done by setting up specific rules and laws that ensure the safety and well-being of the traders. A very common practice by international Forex regulators is to impose the requirement of minimum operating capital. As an example, Australian Forex brokers are required to have a minimum of $1 million in operating capital. This ensures, that the companies that open for business are very serious, and are in there for the long run; thus decreasing the risk fo the customers from the companies that are there just for a quick profit. Another common international demand from regulators is for the trading accounts to be in segregated bank accounts. As an example, England’s FCA demands segregated accounts in the Bank of England, which provides an extra layer of security. The requirement for regular audits and reports is one of the most effective tools that all the financial regulators use for controlling Forex platforms. Depending on the specific regulatory jurisdiction, they may be yearly, quarterly, or even monthly. This ensures, that the activities of the broker remain transparent, and keeps the traders’ interests safe. What many of the regulators do is to combat the fraud and protect the victims of brokers’ unethical behavior by encouraging the spread of education among traders. They do this by detailing useful info on their websites, running informational campaigns, and more. Though it may not seem so on the surface, spreading awareness like this is very effective, as it’s always better to prevent a scam from happening in the first place, as opposed to compensating it when it does happen. How many regulators are out there? Seeing as every major country that’s heavily involved in Forex has one of their own, there are probably hundreds of financial regulators monitoring Forex activities in the world. However, You have the well-known ones like FCA, CySEC, ASIC, FSA, ESMA, etc., and they all, more-or-less, serve the same purpose, with minor differences based on their specific market. Curiously, if a broker is licensed by any of the EU member states, their license covers the whole continent. This has led to some security concerns in the past, as many of the brokers deliberately went with the countries that were more lenient with providing licensing, Cyprus’ CySEC being an example. Although this is not to say that CySEC doesn’t do a decent-enough job at providing a robust regulatory environment. On the contrary, it’s one of the most highly-respected regulators out there."

15,Why Binomo Download In Thailand In A Time Of Crisis,finance," A crisis is looming at the doorstop of every nation as the coronavirus outbreak is breaking down the boundaries of what was considered to be solid and stapled as a norm of the modern world. We are witnessing how the paradigm of globalism is being shifted from a worldwide phenomenon into a scope of characteristics and definitions explained in history and economics textbooks. What seemed to be unbreakable has shattered as countries are resorting to isolationism instead of mutual assistance in the face of a global threat. The fragile balance of globalization and the interconnection of nations through their mutual dependence on each other has been disrupted by a single event that halted the seemingly uninterruptible sequence and continuity of production in a key nation that the rest of the world relied upon. The outbreak of the coronavirus in China simply placed the world before the fact that global economies are not interdependent, but dependent on China, and if the latter sneezes, the rest of the world will say ""bless you"". The human cost of the outbreak is still far from being tallied as the death toll is approaching the two hundred thousand mark and millions of people will be directly and indirectly affected by the consequences of the pandemic. The socio-economic landscape for most countries will feel the effects of the pandemic like an earthquake that will shatter families and make financial survival the most acute problem of the year and likely, the decade. It will take years to calculate the human impact of the virus, but the economic reality is already becoming painfully clear. Not a single country will be spared from the effects of the pandemic in an economic sense, as major powerhouse economies will experience considerable drops in their GDP. The United States is predicted to lose over a quarter of its production in 2020. The Chinese economy will display its worst economic stats in the last decade and most European countries are sliding down into recession with every passing month of imposed quarantine restrictions. The jobs that will be lost as a result of the economic downturn will be calculated in the millions, which will inevitably lead to a rise in social and psychological pressure on average citizens. Productivity of labor is likely to decrease under stress and markets will experience an unprecedented influx of labor that will have no vacancies to fill. The United States has already reached a historic landmark of three million unemployed and the number is set to rise in the coming quarters as major industries like the defense sector and electronics, highly dependent on Chinese manufacturing facilities that have been shut down, will be forced to lay off workers indefinitely. Governments will be hard pressed to juggle between social and industrial policies, making bailout packages for individual sectors limited. The Southeast Asian region will not be spared from the impact of the outbreak as its key industries – the tourism sector, shipping and related industries – will experience a considerable drop in investment flows. The quarantine imposed by the largest touristic countries has left hotels, restaurants and tourism agencies with no fund inflows, and even forced them to pay out compensations for early bookings. The 2020 tourism season can be called cancelled or dead on arrival, as tourists will fear risking travelling to countries that had experienced coronavirus outbreaks, no matter the desire to spend time on a beach. The economy of Thailand is heavily reliant on tourism, which takes up a seventeen percent share of national GDP. The loss of such an important source of income is undoubtedly to cut jobs and leave millions of locals without sources of income. The predicted ten percent drop of the country’s GDP is to be softened by measures taken by the local government, but they are likely to be too little. But the loss of regular jobs on the market and the closure of hotels, resorts and restaurants does not mean that citizens will be left with no choice of generating income. There are industries that are constantly open for newcomers and exhibit income levels that outstrip those of office jobs. The trading market is no longer a high entry threshold industry, as average citizens with even meager savings can learn the ropes of the trade through an endless variety of information sources and start on their way to earning on heightened market volatility, which is being observed in times of crisis. Prospects From Binomo Thailand One of the major platforms offering citizens of Thailand the opportunity to earn on heightened market volatility is the Binomo platform. The broker acts as a comprehensive platform offering anyone willing to trade the tools and instruments needed to catch market trends and reap the rewards.

16,Getting The Right Training In Forex Trading,finance," The forex trading world is a very polarising place. It can be a haven for some but more often than not, as many people who lack training have tried everything, they could but still failed to tell you, it can be a very confusing place. Advances in technology have allowed for easier access to trading the forex markets, anyone with a smart device with a screen can attempt to make money. It’s that easy, but actually making money has proved time and time again to be the hard part. The problem is most people, before they even begin, view trading as a sort of easy way to get money and riches. They don’t prioritise an education in forex trading, and they are sorely under equipped when they do take the plunge and tackle the market. As a result, they fail, blaming the markets. These are very preventable things, things that a quick online forex trading program could have mitigated. The various millionaire philanthropist personas we see online hailing trading forex as the source of their millions certainly don’t help either. Whereas it is true that forex trading can earn you a lot of money and some of the best traders earn millions, these Internet personalities armed with half-truths do more harm than good. A lot of them describe forex trading as a way to become a millionaire within a very short time. They stress on the benefits and positive aspects of trading and avoid all the not very pleasant aspects of trading, like how long it takes, what you stand to lose if you aren’t properly prepared, the level of psychological fortification you will need as well as the fact that forex trading is far from easy. As a result, people misinformed by these personalities move in droves towards an almost assured collective failure. The Truth The truth is that forex trading is not a get rich quick scheme and needs to be viewed as an endeavour that requires patience, skill, and the correct mentality. These things need to be ingrained into you over time through training and practice. If you receive proper forex training, things like anger at losing trades and a fear of the market will be pre-emptively addresses and will have neither have the chance to impact your future trading nor have any place in your trading career as they tend to hinder the success of any trader. Beginners wouldn’t even know where to look, the internet is flooded with numerous sites that purport to be the best at providing forex training for beginners, but there are a few tell-tale signs that you will need to look out for and avoid at all costs. The most important of them include promises of getting rich very quickly, this is the biggest sign of deception, as well as downplaying how important the role of psychology is in forex trading. Any good forex trading program will tach you that you will not be able to trade your best if you’re off your game, something that happens a lot in trading if you aren’t mentally prepared. An education in forex is the best way to start your career in forex trading. Once you have the right training, there’s nothing you won’t be able to achieve."
17,Social security benefits for a family (COVID-19),finance," Before COVID-19, Karen was a graphic designer who worked for small marketing company. Her partner David worked as a sole trader in the tiling industry. They have 2 kids, aged 6 and 9, who are enrolled in primary school. David’s work primarily is in the household repairs area, and he uses a sub-contractor for some assistance with his jobs. He typically pays the sub-contractor $30 per hour on jobs that require a second person. Before COVID-19, this occurred generally about 32 hours per week (ie. 4 days). The offsider had their own ABN, and David paid them directly without withholding tax. He had three sub-contractors that he would call, based on the work to be done and their availability. Another two days a week, on average, David was able to complete the work personally. Based on interim figures for 31 December 2019, David was due to earn approximately $90-95,000 for the year. This was based on generally working about 45 hours per week. As a result of COVID-19, a lot of David’s work has dried up. Instead of 45 hours per week, he is down to 24 hours on average (3 days). This work is with ongoing contracts, as opposed to one-off jobs. None of the sub-contractors are ""available for work"" anymore. Karen was working as a mid-level employee on a full-time basis prior to COVID-19. Her gross weekly salary was $1,355, equating to $70,460 per annum. Her superannuation was paid on top of this, at 9.5%. Due to COVID-19, Karen’s company significantly reduced non-senior staff, and she was made redundant on 25 March 2020. Her payout was to be 4 weeks, plus accrued leave of 1 week, which was received on 3 April 2020. Despite the JobKeeper payment being created by the federal government, Karen’s employer is standing by their decision to make her redundant, leaving Karen unemployed. David and Karen have gone to their accountant to discuss what measures are available to them, as a result of the downturn from COVID-19. Solution David David’s earnings after expenses and before tax have reduced from usually about $3,960 per fortnight to $2,160 per fortnight as a result of the reduced level of contracts. As he is self-employed, and his work has reduced by more than 30%, he is eligible to apply for the JobKeeper payment with the ATO. As David is eligible for JobKeeper, he will receive $1,500 before tax each fortnight. During COVID-19, David will earn gross income of $3,660 ($2,160 + $1,500) per fortnight. He is also eligible to defer any income tax payments for 6 months with the ATO. Karen As Karen’s income has reduced to nil, she will be eligible to apply for the JobSeeker payment which includes a Coronavirus supplement payment. She does not need to serve a waiting period, and no assets or liquid assets tests apply. However, Karen would be ineligible to receive any JobSeeker and Coronavirus supplement payment due to the income test. The income test, which determines eligibility, takes into consideration David’s income. David’s income will include the JobKeeper payment, as it is taxable in his hands. As David’s gross income is greater than $3,068 per fortnight, this is above the upper limit for the assistance. Family tax benefit With the reduction in income, the family may be entitled to receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB). However, FTB is calculated on full financial year, and must be estimated for both 2019/20 and 2020/21 income years. As Karen’s income will be the lower income for the 2019/20 income year, we will look at her income first to determine eligibility for FTB Part B. Firstly, David’s income is expected to be less than $100,000 for the income year. However, as the FTB Part B cut-off amount is $21,973 per income year for parents of a child between 5 and 18 years of age, Karen will be above that amount based on her income for the first 9 months of the year. Eligibility for FTB Part A is based on total family income for the full 2019/20 income year. The limit at which no amount is available to be paid is $109,379 per income year for the family. As at 1 April 2020, the estimated yearly family income (David $93,000 and Karen $60,000) is well above the FTB Part A limit for the entire year. The family will not receive any amount for Family Tax Benefit Parts A or B in the 2019/20 income year. In relation to the 2020/21 income year, Karen will be eligible to apply for Family Tax Benefit. However, it should be noted that a claim should be considered carefully, based on the understanding that full year incomes are taken into consideration. It is possible that a debt may be applied later. Based on David earning an estimated amount of $93,000, the family would be eligible for the base rate of FTB Part A, which is $119.56 per fortnight. Also, FTB Part B of $110.60 per fortnight would be available. Source: https://www.accountsnextgen.com.au/"

19,ABBC Coin - Improvement of Money,finance," ABBC Coin - Improvement of Money Since the time our antecedents at first started trading with each other, our economy and the vehicle of exchange for trade and portions have been reliably creating. From cowrie shells to gold coins, paper money to Visas — increasingly present and better sorts of money have had the choice to help to extend and the more mentioning cash related conditions. We are progressing toward a continuously fluid game plan of portions; concentrating on solace, straightforwardness, and security. Today, basically every nation on the planet has its sort of fiat cash, given by a central force — banks and governments — regarded at its ability to fill in as obligation credits. The world as we most likely know it has staggeringly moved from the customary to automated; so are associations that continue improving their organizations and methodology by digitizing assets. The now-ending up being propelled economy seems to require the necessity for money that could be easily moved and used in the mechanized area. ABBC Coin is among the fundamental mechanized money related structures, or usually known as computerized monetary standards, which intends to give a predictable portion system in purchasing stock on online stores.ABBC Coin Price is $0.115186 with a 24h trading volume of $37,664,479 at the time of writing. These days, obvious changes have been advancing. In the long run, cash may lessen being utilized to make a way for progressively virtual kinds of money. Arrangement to Crypto Portion as a byproduct of product and adventures is something that has been going on even before human advancement began. The primary change has been how it was organized consistently. From exchanging to computerized types of cash, systems for portion have changed definitely since the start, and we are yet to defy surges of changes later on. Arrangement trades are the essential techniques for the portion of our begetters. 9,000 years earlier, this was the establishment of the economy in Egypt. Wheat, yields, milk, and some different harvests can be traded to a related individual for a comparable worth. In any case, at long last, the arrangement ended up being too difficult to even consider evening consider evaluating. As an answer, thing money was introduced as cowrie shells in China, India, and Africa. This is progressively gainful appeared differently with bargain anyway sometimes, it got futile. The issue was that cowrie shells were not regarded a great deal and it had no control from power. The headway from item money to coins made it more straightforward and faster to coordinate trade. Thusly, money not, at this point must be checked and its value could be easily directed by examining the division. The Song Dynasty in China was one of the first to introduce this new kind of portion in the eleventh century, while in 1661, the Swedish Banco released the chief European banknotes. Starting now and into the foreseeable future, paper money or cash transformed into the standard methodology for portion. Entering the late twentieth century, BankAmericard — the fundamental current Mastercard — was moved. Heaving around tremendous totals of money got inconsequential and we could now coordinate both huge and little trades without struggling with cash. Additionally, as the electronic solicitations of people advance, so do the portion commitments. With almost everything open on the web, the ascent of virtual money related structures gets inevitable. Advanced types of cash have shown a lot of certifications as they can moreover diminish the cost of trades, accelerate trades, and make new helpfulness to money. At present, there is a normal $250 billion worth of every single cryptographic type of cash accessible for use, and different endeavors and associations are starting to organize it as a portion gateway. Expected of Payments ""Cryptographic cash and portions are tied at the hip,"" this is a declaration from the COO of Crypterium Austin Kimm. Despite that, Mr. Kimm said that for advanced cash to be standard, there ought to be a regular use case, further explaining that ""the more you can spend it the more people will recognize it."" The modernized business community is creating and the future has a spot with the associations that can stay in control. As noteworthy retailers and associations like Overstock, CryptoPet, 1000 EcoFarms, and Shopify start enduring crypto-portions, customers can have a predictable electronic shopping experience. By and large, online business is required to create at 175% all through the accompanying 3 years, coming to almost $5 trillion by 2021. Advanced money winds up being a central sort of money that is logically useful to use and haul around. Say goodbye to your old cowhide wallet because best in class wallets are right now in! Through these wallets, you can safely store your cryptos, perform faster trades, and check your trade history at whatever point you need. Cryptographic cash portions hope to make a more globalized and borderless economy, similarly as to fight budgetary dissimilarity via conveying fiscal organizations to people without access to money related adjusts and charge cards."
20,How To Pay Off Your Mortgage in 5-7 Years,finance," My wife and I were ""home buyers"" for at least 7 years on our current residence. Notice that I said home ""buyers,"" and not home ""owners."" There is a common misconception that when you take out a mortgage, you are immediately a home ""owner"" Assuming that you have a 30 year mortgage, the reality is that you are simply in the process of buying the home over a 30 year period. The bank, is the true owner of the property. If you don't believe me, try missing a few mortgage payments, and see what happens. 3 months ago, we paid off our 30 year mortgage (in 7 years, or 23 years early). Now we are true home ""owners."" In this article, I'm going to show you step by step how we were able to accomplish this. Using our existing income, and without incurring any additional debt. Equity Let's talk about ""Equity."" Equity, or appreciation, is the difference between what your home is worth and what you owe to the bank. So if you owe $100,000 and your house is worth $300,000, then you have $200,000 of Equity in your home. We had roughly $250,000 of Equity on our house. We owed the bank $115,000 and our house was worth $367,000. This $250,000 is dormant. Meaning, it looks good, but it wasn't doing anything for us. Home-Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) So the first thing that we did was we 'tapped' into this equity. We went to the bank and took out an Home Equity Line of Credit for $50,000. What is an equity line of credit? Also called a HELOC, an home equity line of credit is a liquid line that you are able to draw funds from at any time for any purpose. It's like a gigantic credit card. Although the HELOC had a limit for $50,000, the amount that we owed on it was $0 at the time that we took it out. This is because, similar to a credit card, you don't owe anything until you actually use it. Use HELOC to Pay Down Mortgage Immediately after we got the HELOC, we withdrew $20,000 and applied it to our Mortgage (additional principal payment). So at this point, we have $20,000 due on the HELOC, but our mortgage has been paid down by $20,000 (from $115,000 to $95,000). Use HELOC as ""new"" Checking Account Before I go on, let me mention that after we used the $20,000 to pay down our mortgage, we still had the same $115,000 of debt ($20,000 on HELOC and $95,000 on Mortgage). So to payoff the HELOC, we just used it as our new checking account. When we got paid, we took 100% of our paychecks and applied it to the HELOC. Now you may be wondering, ""with all of our money going to the HELOC, how did we pay our bills?"" Remember the HELOC is a ""liquid"" line. So at the end of each month, we made 1 withdrawal from the HELOC to pay our bills (including our mortgage). 100% of Cash Flow For us, our monthly paychecks totaled roughly $6,000. Our bills, including our mortgage, and all of our living expenses (gas, groceries, etc.) totaled approximately $3,500. So by applying 100% of our monthly checks to the HELOC, and then using the HELOC to pay our bills, we were able to use 100% of our monthly cash flow to pay the $20,000 HELOC off. So with and estimated $2,500 of cash flow ($6,000 minus $3,500) the $20,000 was paid off in 8 months. Repeat The Process We repeated this process until the remaining $95,000 was paid off (approximately 2 years). What Do You Need? Cash Flow - You must have positive cash flow in your household budget Credit Score - A decent credit score (650 or above) Equity - Positive equity in your home. What You Should Know VERY IMPORTANT: The HELOC should be used to paydown your mortgage. It should not be used to fund a vacation, buy a car, or a boat. ALSO IMPORTANT: The HELOC is not a Home Equity Loan (HEL). A Home Equity Loan is a 2nd mortgage, and it is treated the same."

1,The role of AI in finance,finance," Today, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, robots, have gone beyond the imagination and are embodied infeasible business scenarios, becoming a profitable investment. In the financial sector, operations are already trusted in accounting, fraud detection, customer credit rating, resource planning, and reporting. But the introduction of technology entails new challenges and risks. Automation for profit Algorithms responsible for the cybersecurity of data detect fraud before it happens, and can quickly check the transactions of all portfolios of the bank. If a person takes a loan, AI will be able to evaluate it as a potential borrower faster and more accurately than a living specialist, taking into account more parameters. Automation of routine processes allows you to protect the company from errors that the employee can make by negligence. Robots are also able to perform more functions, reducing company costs. Therefore, banks introduce robotic collectors that call customers with little debt. According to forecasts, if you trust AI to 30 processes, you can save four times as much - up to 85 million rubles. Financial institutions use AI to create chatbots that answer customers the simplest and most common questions. The bot can even quickly form an investment portfolio based on the preferences and interests of a particular client, as well as prepare detailed reporting of expenses and remind about payment of bills. Another crucial area in finance, where AI is necessary, is compliance with regulatory standards. It monitors changes in the law and helps to comply with it - from the ""know your client"" rules and the fight against money laundering to the laws governing asset management. Why train a machine? Machine Learning (MO) is a technology-based on artificial intelligence. It is based on a mathematical model that identifies patterns in data arrays and predicts how the situation will develop. How does MO work in practice? In all companies, over time, the blacklist of counterparties is growing - companies with a high risk of default. At first, those who delay payments or are registered in risky jurisdictions fall into it. Over time, the filter becomes more complex, and machine learning will help to identify previously implicit patterns associated with macroeconomic indicators, credit ratings, data from third-party auditors, and how the company is written about on the Internet. Technology will do such a job better than a person who may simply not be able to cope with such a volume of information. Challenges to Innovation However, the role of AI is not without problems. The most important is the lack of qualified personnel. According to the study, 30% of the financial world only heard this term but did not understand how AI works. And today, the entire industry faces an important task - to increase the level of technical literacy. The second serious problem is the lack of data for work. The larger the initial data, the higher the accuracy of AI predictions: with a small sample, the probability of error is 20%, with a broad array - up to 2%. The introduction of AI into the work of financiers is hindered by several other barriers: the cost of operation, the lack of apparent benefits from the use of civil defense, the requirements of regulators and the ethical issue. New technologies - new risks When introducing new tools, the company faces risks that were not previously encountered in its practice. They can lead to financial and reputational costs. This raises the legal question of liability in the event of an error: who will be to blame - a financial specialist or an AI developer. Consider a practical example. A trained algorithm may not always be able to avoid bias. Thus, according to a historical sample, in recent decades, women have been less likely to approve loans. And, based on the data presented, the algorithm will conclude that women are unreliable borrowers, and will refuse even creditworthy ones. The bank may face claims from regulators who see gender discrimination in these decisions. The introduction of AI and machine learning will scale financial systems. This is relevant, given the projected increase in the number of financial transactions until 2025. A person cannot handle this amount of information. But this does not mean that AI will force a living specialist out of the financial sector. If the algorithms are engaged in routine operations, then the employee will always have the ultimate control and live communication with customers. Conclusion Generally speaking, AI is indeed a great tool in finances to avoid complicated situations and arrange matters, which usually require a lot of effort from humans. When you have a robot, doing tasks it is almost impossible it would make any error. But while the role of artificial intelligence is growing in finances, it could lead to other problems too."
2,Is private equity right for your company?,finance," If you have a revenue generating company that's been operating for a couple of years, and you're interested in taking it through to the next stage of growth - whether it's some cash injection or a complete overhaul - then consider looking into partnering with a private equity investor. First of all, what is 'private equity'? In short, it's finance provided by investors in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Private equity (or PE for short) is generally associated with mature companies with growth potential that need regeneration. A wide range of industry sectors benefit from private equity funding such as technology, industrial, healthcare, banking and finance and more. People are often confused about the difference between private equity and venture capital. Venture capital is actually a form of private equity but the main difference is that it tends to fund younger companies such as start-ups and emerging companies. Now that you know a little bit more about private equity, don’t stop there - there’s plenty of resources out there that will teach you all you need to know about private equity funding. This is only the beginning. Once you’ve read up a bit more about private equity and how it works, let’s take you through what you would need to do to acquire this type of funding for your company.

We understand how complex it is to search for the right private equity investor, so we've listed some key questions you should ask when trying to find the right investor to partner with for the long-term: How much control will management and shareholders have?

What will happen if either party wants to exit the deal? What costs will the business be responsible for? What is the investment horizon? What does capital structure look like?

3,What type of regulation to expect in finance in 2020,finance," There are many things to expect from 2020 and increased regulations are definitely one of them. Over the last decade, the world of finance has changed a lot. A lot of good happened, but the last decade also brought some problems to the finance sector. 2020 is a whole new opportunity for the world to develop new trends and come up with new ideas for the everchanging financial sector. Regulations When people hear regulations they get a sense of scare right away, but it is not something that we should be necessarily afraid of. Regulations are often the way to help certain fields further develop, but sometimes, of course, authorities use them to control and change the sectors according to their wishes. Regulations are very important in many fields, as they can be the guarantee of customer safety. When it comes to regulating fields like crypto, regulations can have different effects. For example, in many countries, regulations held crypto to further develop. These countries include Switzerland, Australia, etc. But at the same time, there are countries like the US and India where the government used regulations to control the market. As time goes, regulations are changing very fast. In the last decade, we saw some countries changing their regulations to help the finance sector and the trend should be the same for this year. What can 2020 bring? The whole world develops very hard. Something to keep in mind is that at some point in 2020, half of the world’s population will have access to the world of internet. As the world is headed to a fully digital future, there might be some things that can change this year. Authorities will have the need to come up with plans to navigate the online world seamlessly. Many have suggested that further tweaking the capital will be one of the top priorities in 2020. Under the Trump administration, financial officials said they're working to change many regulations, which Gregg Gelzinis, an economic policy expert at the Center for American Progress, said usually means loosening banking controls. As 2020 is an election year in the US, regulations that the Trump Administration plans to adopt will be done at a faster pace. Also, many have suggested that greater focus will be put on the financial and operational resilience of companies. How they adapt to technologies, change with innovations and so on. Also, this year will be very important to respond to political and social pressures in areas like sustainability and financial inclusion. Banks spend more resources and attention on safety than ever. Safety concerns continue to grow, driven by focused, well-funded, skilled adversaries and by a growing digital world. According to many studies, cybersecurity is one of the main things concerning the authorities and many companies, so we might see some changes in this field. There are many companies around the world reporting every day that they are facing cyber dangers. In this situation, we might see a lot of changes in cyber regulations. Crypto Crypto regulations are changing very often. Still, as of today, society does not have enough knowledge to come up with a regulation that can work for everyone. Universal regulations are very hard to find because there is a huge difference in the attitude that the government has towards the currency. Many countries are changing their attitudes towards crypto. But there are still some countries where a crypto exchange is still illegal. This field has a lot to go but it is not hard to think that they will be a lot of regulations on crypto coming this year. 2020 has just started but already a lot of things happened. The novel coronavirus has affected the world economy, and the situation is getting out of hand. There might be some regulations coming into force this year because of this."
4,What Does An Insurance Broker Do?,finance," Many people are not fully aware of the functions that an insurance broker carries out. Basically, he is a middleman between an individual who wants insurance cover for something and an insurance company which supplies that insurance. There is a myriad of different insurance companies offering a wide range of insurance policies at often vastly different prices, and the insurance broker’s job is to provide the client with all the information in order to arrive at an informed decision about the policy required. Some people believe that an insurance broker works for an insurance company, but this is not the case. In fact, many insurance brokers are self-employed individuals, or work for a small brokerage with perhaps half a dozen staff. Either way, they are not employed by insurance companies. The only sort of interaction an insurance broker has with an insurance company is in the course of his work to find the right policy for each client. These days, of course, many people who need an insurance policy are persuaded to go online to one of the price comparison sites in order to find the product with the cheapest price. Naturally, everyone wants everything they buy at the lowest cost, and that is fair and reasonable. However, the problem with price comparison sites when it comes to insurance is that they cannot take into account all the differing circumstances of an individual. For example, we have all seen recently the dreadful flooding in the North of England. Now let us suppose that, when it has all dried up and been restored, and the riverbanks strengthened, and so on, that you decide to move to one of the towns involved. They are, after all, in some very pretty parts of the countryside, so why not? Now obviously you will require insurance for your new home and for your contents. So, let’s say you go off to a comparison site and find a really good deal that costs less than any of the others, so that is the one you buy. So far, so good. But then global warming, or climate change, or whatever it is being called this week, steps in, and your new home gets flooded. What a disaster. Still, there’s one good thing when you have dried everything out, and that is that - thank heaven – you bought that insurance policy when you moved. Only to discover that the policy that you bought online was from an insurance company that specifically ruled out flood damage in the village to which you just moved. Of course, you didn’t know that when you bought the policy, because it was way down on page seven of the small print. That doesn’t alter the fact that you are not covered. Tough. Insurance companies can, and do, change their policies all the time. It is entirely up to you to see to it that you purchase a policy that is right for you and covers you for all your needs. Yet with all of the thousands of policies offered across the insurance spectrum, how can you possibly be sure? That is the job of an insurance broker: to look at the whole picture and marry you up with the policy that, first and foremost, covers all your needs, and second, is at the best price. The price is NOT the most important consideration, but the price comparison sites would have you believe that it is. That is why they are called price comparison sites. Sure, you can get the cheapest policy, but if it doesn’t cover you for the very thing which happens, it is just money down the drain. (In the case of flooding, literally). Finding the right insurance is very complicated. Take shipping goods overseas, for instance, when you need transit insurance coverage. Do you need total loss only, named perils, all risk, open coverage, single coverage, warehouse to warehouse? And what about general average coverage? You can see how complicated insurance can be, and why there are even insurance brokers who specialise in certain fields."
5,There Are Good Reasons To Use A Freight Forwarder When Importing Goods,finance," If you are importing goods into the UK there are a lot of processes involved in getting them from the supplier you buy them from to your warehouse here in the UK. This is why using the services of a freight forwarder may be a good idea, since they can take a lot of the stress out of the process of international shipping. They will deal with all the processes of shipping from end to end and in most cases will also deal with customs clearance. When you are shipping goods internationally there is a whole lot that goes on behind the scenes in order to ensure that your goods arrive safely. However, a good freight forwarder – whether an individual, or more often a company – will take care of all that and make it seem simple, even though it isn’t. In general, customs brokers deal with the import and export side, while the freight forwarder deals with the actual logistics, but many freight forwarders can act as customs brokers as well, thus dealing with all of the customs requirements under one roof, so to speak. The freight forwarder can get involved in any or all of the following steps: Arranging transport from the point of origin – such as your supplier’s factory or warehouse – to the port or airport for shipment Preparing documents, licenses, and all relevant paperwork for export at the point of origin Negotiating, booking, and loading cargo for sea or air freight Arranging for insurance and tracking delivery as needed Preparing documents, licenses, and all relevant paperwork for UK customs authorities Arranging haulage and delivery to your agreed location in the UK Those are the basics, but where a freight forwarder comes into its’ own is having all the necessary contacts to handle the various parts of the job. Very often, the freight forwarder will outsource things such as haulage from your supplier to the port or airport and arranging international shipping insurance through an insurance broker. If you are new to importing, or even if not but you want to make the process as simple as possible, then a freight forwarder is the answer. There are a number of considerable advantages, not the least of which is that you only have to deal with one person rather than several different freight and haulage companies. With contacts internationally, they will be able to find service providers wherever you happen to need them. They can also negotiate on haulage, shipping, and warehousing costs for you. With the knowledge that they have, they can deal with all of the tiresome and complex paperwork that is involved in international shipping. However, there are some disadvantages to using a freight forwarder, not the least of which is that you have to allow for its’ own charges, so if you have all the right connections you may be able to save money by keeping everything in-house. It also means that you surrender control over your shipment to a third party, so you need to be able to trust them. When you get a quote from a freight forwarder it is essential to go over it thoroughly in order to see exactly what is, and what is not, covered. This should obviously include transport costs, such as from your supplier to the port or airport, sea or air freight costs, and costs of collecting your goods this end and delivering them to your warehouse. Then there may be special costs, such as refrigeration for perishables, or perhaps the use of a crane for very heavy items. You may need storage before or after shipping. For some routes there may be extra port charges. Then there is the cost of all the export and import documentation. There may be surcharges to cover fluctuations in currency exchange rates. You will also obviously need insurance in order to cover the goods against loss or damage, and ideally a specialist shipping insurance broker should be used for this. There could be extra charges for palletisation or packing of the goods. You can see that there is a whole lot more to importing – and exporting – goods than you might think, if you are new to the business, but a freight forwarder can take all of this off your hands."
6,How do you protect yourself financially from the impact of COVID 19?,finance," As the country focuses on the spread of the Coronavirus, communities across the U.S. are impacted by the closure of businesses, schools, events, churches, etc.  And in a lot of cases many people are quarantined. While these requirements are probably necessary it is causing people to have some major financial concerns.  Even though many aspects of our personal financial life are out of our control right now, there are financial moves you can make to protect yourself during the short and long term. Don’t Sell Your Investments Out of Panic If you have watched the stock market plunge in March this has likely caused your 401(k) to decline as well.  One thing you absolutely do not want to do is sell any stock-based investments right now out of fear.  Selling stocks after a huge decline in the market is the worst thing you can do to your long-term financial goals.  Remember, the goal of investing is to buy low and sell high.  If you are panic selling, you are doing just the opposite.  This is not the time to make emotional-based decisions when it comes to your stock investments.  This isn’t the first time the market has dropped, and it probably won’t be the last. If You Are Unable to Pay Your Bills Contact Your Lenders If you have lost your job or even furloughed and can’t pay your bills, contact those that service your debt and let them know your situation.  They may be able to offer you some options to help like waiving late fees or delaying or even skipping some payments.  One of our tips includes asking to change the date of your payments, requesting a different payment plan or even payment extensions.  It never hurts to ask! Don’t Over-Purchase Items I’m sure you have heard all the stories about the run on toilet paper and other essential items.  While it’s OK to stock up on some items in case you are isolated for a while, make sure you are not over preparing.  Only buy what is reasonable for you and your family.  Also, don’t over-buy on credit.  Using a credit card to over buy can definitely do you more harm than good. What Do You Do If You Lose Your Income? Every state will vary in the programs they offer to help those families financially impacted by the coronavirus.  Review your state’s unemployment programs to find out what works best for you.  This link can lead you to your state’s unemployment policies to see if you qualify for any state or local assistance. (https://www.dol.gov/general/location). Take Advantage of these Historic Low Interest Rates We now have some of the lowest borrowing costs in history so it may be time to take advantage of these low rates.  The most significant example is with first mortgages.  The fixed-rate mortgage rate is near a record low of 3.47% and some people may find an even lower rate.  This downtrend may even extend beyond mortgages.  If you currently have high-interest debt, you may want to consider looking into debt consolidation with a personal loan or other forms of borrowing like a home equity loan or auto loan. Watch Out for Scam Attempts Scammers are always looking for opportunities to take advantage of vulnerable or older adults, especially in times of emergencies like this one.  Be very watchful of emails, texts and social media posts that are promoting fake information or unapproved and misbranded products dealing with the coronavirus. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has tips to help protect you and your family from crisis related scams (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/02/coronavirus-scammers-follow-headlines). Social isolation for the older population can be a real issue.   This could include an increased possibility that they would fall prey to scammers.  Older adults and their family members should be aware of the most common types of scams.  This resource will help (https://www.consumerfinance.gov/practitioner-resources/resources-for-older-adults/protecting-against-fraud/). Boost Your Emergency Fund It is suggested that everyone have at least three to six months’ worth of expenses ready to use in case of an emergency.  I know times like this most people can’t think about bolstering their emergency fund, but you at least need to think about it.  If you are one of the fortunate people whose income and work schedule haven’t been interrupted, you might want to think about saving more aggressively in your emergency account.  And, if you haven’t received or earmarked your tax refund, this could be an outstanding way to use it. Look for Ways to Cut Expenses It’s always smart to look for ways to get your costs under control.  Just make sure you don't deny yourself too badly. Here’s one of my favorite ways to decide what costs I can cut back on.  Print out your most recent bank and credit card statement and highlight all your expenses.  Ask yourself ""Did I really Need That""?  If the answer was no, try cutting that out of next months expenditures.  Some of the usual costs may not be practical right now, like cutting back on your cable bill or Hulu.  If you are stuck at home, you may need that distraction. Here’s My Takeaway The best thing to do right now is take a deep breath and don’t panic.  We all know that fear and panic can lead to irrational thinking which can definitely lead to poor financial decisions.  We are living in uncertain times, but we will get through all of this.  So, make some educated and reasonable financial decisions and remember to concentrate on what’s really important – your health and the health of the people you care about."

9,5 questions by beginner crypto traders answered by Binomo platform,finance," Statistics show that 80% of crypto traders have been in the industry for less than a year. For many of them, the learning curve in that first year is steep. In this article, the team of the global trading platform Binomo answers 5 common questions asked by newbies. It's not as much the device that matters but which platform you use. It's better to pick a provider that has full cross-platform support. Many profitable occasions will come when you are away from your computer, so you'll have to act quickly and close the trade on mobile. You need a native app for best results, though: web interfaces often have responsiveness issues on smartphones. Binomo offers lightning-fast execution on all platforms: web, desktop, iOS and Android. Most exchanges do close for the night and on Sundays. But you can still trade in the OTC (over-the-counter) market. If you have to go to work during the week and can only trade during the weekend, we suggest that you pick a trading platform that provides access to the OTC market. For example, on Binomo there's a wide range of OTC assets and a handy non-stop trading mode. Trading platforms work hard to prevent fraud and money laundering. If it were possible to deposit money, say, with a card and then withdraw it to an e-wallet or in crypto, it would open huge opportunities for criminal activity, all the way to funding terrorism. It can seem like a nuisance that you have to use the same card or wallet, but it's standard practice across the world. On Binomo, you can deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto. Binomo supports bank cards, Neteller, PerfectMoney, Boleto Brazil, and other systems. A common newbie mistake is listening to rumours and so-called crypto influencers on Twitter. This can work a couple of times, but eventually your favorite influencer will be wrong and you'll lose your money. We suggest you start learning about technical indicators as soon as you begin trading. Tools like Fibonacci levels and Bollinger bands aren't rocket science. You'll have to invest a couple of hours of your time in each indicator, but it will take your trading to a new level. Binomo offers 30 different indicators and technical tools. There's also a section with 10 free strategies for different levels, including 5 for beginners. Beginners sometimes think that a bonus is a gift of sorts, but it isn't. Bonuses are an incentive for traders to trade more and generate fees for the platform. Awarding bonuses is a common practice, but terms differ. Here is how bonuses work on Binomo. You can get a bonus for topping up your account, participating in a promotion, or as a VIP client. For the Standard pricing plan, the maximum bonus is 80%, rising to 90% and even 100% on higher levels. Free users don't receive bonuses. A bonus can be withdrawn when the trader generates a turnover that exceeds the bonus by a certain leverage factor. This way both sides win: the platform gets the fees and the trader gets the bonus. Trading is both a profession and an art, and it can take years to master. The only way to learn is step by step – with the support of a professional trading platform.

11,Third world countries where trading is most popular,finance," The financial world has seen lots of changes throughout the last few decades. Sparked by the increased accessibility to the internet, online trading has become the industry with an immense volume and size. The Bank of International Settlements based in Zurich, Switzerland reports that the average daily trading volume on Forex has hit $5.1 trillion in 2016, a massive achievement for the sector. Such growth of the Forex trading market was primarily boosted by technological development. Just a couple of decades ago, just only very few people had constant, quality access to the internet and much-needed hardware technology. However, as technological corporations started investing more and more in the development of computers and other technological means of internet communication, both accessibility and affordability soared importantly. As a result, today, more people can trade online than ever before. The figures for the trading volume and its increase from the Bank of International Settlements show the immense impact it has had. The industry used technological advancement efficiently. They have established a variety of easy to use online trading platforms that attract millions of people from around the world. Due to its simplicity, many new users find success in trading without entering it without lots of money. Surprisingly, 9.6 million people globally are now online traders. That is a great number which is constantly increasing. However, many people think that online trading is successful and widespread only in well-developed nations. This misconception primarily comes from the thought that richer nations have better infrastructure and more access to certain services while their citizens can easily afford trying new things, like Forex trading out. This truly is done by more and more people worldwide in an attempt to establish a new source of income for themselves and their families. Yet, such people are not essentially concentrated in the west. Many developing and third-world nations are home to some of the most thriving trading communities globally. This breaks the misconception about the abilities of third-world and developing economies, particularly in the field of trading. The fintech industry, which combines finances and technology has also gained momentum in underdeveloped and emerging economies. Significantly, the number of mobile bank users is one of the highest around the world in India, while the absolute majority of people in Kenya use e-banking services to pay utilities and perform other financial transactions. What many people do not realize is that investing in the much-needed infrastructure that would support digital services is much smarter than opening up physical branches. The 21st century gives us an opportunity to remote and be productive without visiting a certain place. As a result, more people have a chance to be actively engaged in economical activities, boost their nations’ growth and increase personal income. Below, you will see a few underdeveloped or developing nations where trading has become widespread. South Africa The African online trading market has grown from 1.3 to roughly 2 million in just a single year from 2017 to 2018. The biggest hub on the continent is located in South Africa which effectively represents the absolute majority of online traders in the region. Such a soaring trend in South Africa should be no surprise to anyone as the nation has been transforming into a technological and financial hub in recent years. Platforms with comprehensive information about trading in South Africa have rapidly emerged in recent years. They list the ever-expanding number of top Forex brokers in the country. The list, which used to be rather short, is not quickly growing as more and more brokers in the nation achieve global success. Despite the immense economic turmoil surrounding South Africa and its government, online trading truly is the industry that took off. Being one of the richest nations on the African continent, online trading managed to establish a solid user base. This particularly is due to the fact that an increasing number of international corporations open their offices in major South African cities, such as Johannesburg and Cape Town. They aim to attract young talent from this fast-developing nation. India The Indian economy is one of the fastest-growing on earth. The country is going through a China-alike transformation with skyrocketing growth rates. The country is particularly focusing on utilizing the absolute potential of technological development by investing in digital services and education. India also is the country with some of the highest rates of e-bank users. This suggests that the nation’s population is gradually adapting to the modern environment. As a result, online trading has become immensely popular among Indian nationals. There are no recent precise figures on the exact number of online traders in the country. However, the 2016 research said that there were estimated 590,000 of them in India. After 4 years, this number is probably much higher. Indonesia The transcontinental nation between Asia and Oceania is one of the biggest hubs of online trading on earth. The islands have good access to the internet and are fairly regulation-free in this field. However, one of the main factors that drive the online trading market in Indonesia is different from regular ones. The thing is that Indonesia along with Thailand is also a hub for Expatriates from around the world. People are attracted by the great climate and cheap prices. Researches suggest that due to the flexibility and remote character of online trading, the focus has been taken away from major financial centers such as London and New York. Only roughly 5% of online traders worldwide live in major financial hubs. Countries like Indonesia effectively attract the eyes of thousands of people to move and establish their workstations in affordable and warm nations in this part of the world. Countries that are developing their financial systems just now have an unprecedented chance to start from the blank page and implement digital solutions from the very beginning. This makes it much easier for such nations since in more developed ones, physical services are better established and are much more difficult to replace. When it comes to online trading, major clusters are still located in developed economies and western regions. The United States remains the biggest online trading hub country with over 1.5 million active users. For comparison, the entire continent of Europe has an equal number of traders. However, when it comes to the numbers for regions, Asia is leading the way. The continent has roughly 3.2 million online traders, making it the densest online trading market on earth. Asia and Europe are followed by Africa as the third largest online trading market in the world. Despite the presence of Europe, Asia and Africa make it up for almost half of all online traders. Considering the fact that the majority of nations in the aforementioned regions are either underdeveloped or emerging economies, the vast contribution they make is clearly visible."
12,"Beware - Bitcoin / Forex / Cryptocurrency Millionaires Fraud - ""Vanessa Parker""",finance," A description to warn people who may be approached to deal with a Bitcoin, Forex or Cryptocurrency investment process by a team of; Vanessa Parker, Lauren Nicholas, and Henrich Jones. As well as any dealing with cloudinmine.com. Bitcoin Scam / Forex Scam / Cryptocurrency Millionaires Scam by Vanessa Parker on Instagram. This is a warning article of what happened to me with someone, apparently a woman conned me into thinking she was making great profits with Forex trading, mainly in cryptocurrency, even had a trading platform, called Cloudinmine.com and ended up taking $8,000 USD from me. I was stupid and naive. Names may be changed for future actions but the concept will be repeated. Vanessa Parker, Lauren Nicholas and Henrich Jones Connected with me on Instagram. Vanessa Parker: Contact number / WhatsApp: 31 6 87446718 Instagram Account: @networkwithvanessa Business Coach 7 Figures Forex/Binary/Crypto Trader Learn How To Make Income At Home Netherlands #1 Forex Entrepreneur Vanessa Parker says she is the #1 trader in the Netherlands Been doing it for more than 10 years Her Husband does it also Has an 8-year-old son Has a sheltie dog Promised with a $500 USD investment, it could turn into $5,500 USD in 7 days for a cost of 10% commission on monies earned. Did a search on Vanessa Parker and found one article warning about her fraud and the initial process that she uses. I stupidly ignored but did mention it to her. She stated: ""That is not me. When you become a celebrity, as I have in my field, being the #1 trader of the Netherlands, there will be haters. There are many people who impersonate me."" All lies... she (if it is in fact a she) is in fact a fraud and a scam. Uses a platform called Cloudinmine, that you are required to set up a very simple account. The site promotes itself as a DECENTRALIZED TRADING & INVESTMENT PLATFORM WITH BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE but from first glance looks like a crypto-mining service. Summary, beware anything to do with Cloudinmine.com. She does not explain or mention anywhere how the trading aspect works. The platform is suspicious: no legal explanation of the site, no privacy policies, no terms of the agreement, no description of the trading platform. Even social media links don't work. But it does show a balance of the account for you. Vanessa Parker asks for all payments to be either transferred in Bitcoin or deposited through a Bitcoin ATM Says she doesn't have access to funds personally but can only trade with them You see the balance of the initial deposit on the Cloudinmine.com screen. After a few days, it looks like the trading is going well as the balance goes up much faster than expected. This gives you a happy feeling that this is going to work out. All the time, Vanessa is singing praise and showing Payout examples in the tens of thousands that her clients have received with her. When your balance gets to a really nice return within the week, a notice comes from Cloudinmine that ""unfortunately trading has stopped on your account due to the plan you subscribed to, which is Gold and the account right now can't receive more than 7000 USD and that there is still another 2900 USD on the way but the account must be upgraded to Platinum for an additional 1500 USD to unfreeze it and it must be done within 48 hours. Once that is paid, all is good and trading is all good for the remainder of your 7-day period. Of which at the end of it you must pay the commission before you receive the funds back, so don't be thinking the commission comes out of the profits. After a deposit of $500 USD and then an additional $1,500 USD, in 7-days I had a balance of $35,607! WOW, score right? Wrong. After paying the commission of $3,500 USD you are told that your broker will submit a request to Cloudinmine to release the fund to your bank account (if you wish to have it wired. There is an option to have it sent in Bitcoin as well). But guess what ""Withdraw Denied. The request to withdrawal has triggered a need for a private key to resolving it from having a timeout when it's not ought to. This rarely occurs to accounts with a huge amount of money as yours, you are a click away from having your money... "" And they show a nice screenshot of a warning report of this stating ""Your account has exceeded the termination clause programming on our system... Kindly pay $2,500 USD to acquire your private key."" I then continue to explain to Vanessa that this is very suspicious and once again very secretive which caused doubt. Also, that paying it will be very difficult. Vanessa is so kind as to offer to help with paying for 50% but I would still need to come up 1,250 USD before earning can be sent. Vanessa parker than forwards my account to a supposed Supervisor of ""The Company"". Enter Ms. Lauren Nicholas (or Lauren Nicolas depending on which account you view): Contact number / WhatsApp: 33 7 58 46 17 67 Instagram Account: @bizwithlauren Marketed as: Speaker, Coach, Entrepreneur 8-Figure Business 20+ Countries Visited Crypto Millionaire Who proceeds to ask how she can help and then when I explain my situation, all she can say is ""I do not want to hear your story. Just pay it"". She then continues to explain to Vanessa that I assaulted her and does not want to help. And also, returns the assistance payment from Vanessa Parker back to her and tells ""The Company"" that my broker paid it and to not accept it, because I assaulted her. Vanessa Parker than forwards me on another supposed Supervisor, Mr. Henrich Jones who once again says nothing but ""Just pay up the $1250 so the transfer can be done"". Contact number / WhatsApp: 49 176 94944975 Instagram Account: @bizwithlauren Marketed as: Speaker, Coach, Entrepreneur 8-Figure Business 20+ Countries Visited Crypto Millionaire So then, this is paid, another 2,500 USD and I receive this lovely OTP (One Time Password) via text message and told do disclose this to anyone All go right? Even after guaranties from Mr. Supervisor Henrich Jones and even Ms. Lauren Nicholas (Nicolas). Perfect, money wire being transferred... Even told by Vanessa Parker that, even though Henrich Jones says it will be transferred ""Now"" she then says it will be ""1 Hour"". And then guess what, 12 hours later... An email stating that the ""Kuwaiti officials in conjunction with capital fx options securities protecting all middle east and Cloudinmine transactions has been placed on your account a tax managerial transfer charge... = another $700 USD and... MUST BE PAID IN BITCOIN! And then my profits would be available to be submitted to my bank account in three minutes. So, obviously I contact Mrs. Vanessa Parker - Forex Trader and Mr. Henrich Jones - Cloudinmine Supervisor, and CRICKETS!! No reply to many messages on WhatsApp and Instagram. So, total paid: 500 USD initial investment. 1,500 USD Platinum upgrade account because I made to much for Gold level account. 3,500 USD commission to Mrs. Vanessa Parker for $35,000 profit of which I have never seen a penny. 2,500 USD for OTP (One Time Password) to release profits as the $8,000 USD LOST.

14,Tips on Finding Mobile Phone Contract,finance," You need to take certain factors into consideration when looking to find an ideal mobile phone contract. It is worth remembering, all along this process of looking for an ideal mobile phone contract, that the whole thing is a major commitment. Most of these mobile telephony service contracts are designed to go for several years. They come with a ‘fine print’ clause where you agree to be penalized heavily, should you decide to cancel before the lapse of the period you initially sign up for. So, in a nutshell, getting into a mobile phone contract is a major commitment: one that you should certainly not take lightly. Given those facts, we will now proceed to provide some tips that can help you in finding an ideal mobile phone contract. Quality of service as a consideration when looking for an ideal mobile phone contract It is very important for you to ensure that the mobile telephony service provider you consider getting into a contract with provides a reasonably good quality service. In this respect, for instance, you will want to know just how extensive the mobile telephony service provider’s network is. You will also want to know whether that particular mobile telephony service provider’s network is prone to things like clogging and call dropping. You will further want to know how good their customer care facility is: that is, the facility where you can call in case you have problems. If you are looking for data services, so that you can be browsing the Internet on your mobile phone, you will want to know just how reliable the services of the company you are considering getting into a contract with are. Cost of service as a consideration when looking for an ideal mobile phone contract Mobile phone providers must now let their customers know when their contract is up, Ofcom announced the rule change in May last year. You need to ensure that the mobile telephony service provider you get into a contract with charges reasonable fees for the service.

Then you will want to know whether the company you are planning to get into a contract with offers data services, through which you can send texts and browse the Internet on your mobile phone. Pretty much every mobile telephony service nowadays offers these services, but the costs vary considerably. Fairness as a consideration when looking for an ideal mobile phone contract This is, in other words, the question as to how fair the contract you are considering getting into is. Of course, the contracts are normally skewed in favor of the mobile telephony service providers. Ultimately though, you need to get into a contract that at least has some semblance of fairness. That would be fairness with respect to a question like the one on just how easy it is to get out of the contract.

16,Using The Services Of A Freight Forwarder To Import Or Export Goods,finance," When you are an importer of goods from abroad to be distributed and sold in the UK, you can either arrange it all yourself or use the services of a freight forwarder. A freight forwarder is simply an individual, or more often a company, that arranges for goods to be shipped from one place to another. The company doesn’t actually ship the goods itself but organises everything behind the scenes. And there is quite a lot that goes on behind the scenes. The whole point is to ensure that the products that you need actually arrive at your warehouse, office, stockroom, or whatever, when they are supposed to and in perfect condition. Many freight forwarders also act as customs brokers. The customs broker deals with commodity codes, and it is essential to get the right code, in order to ensure compliance with customs declarations and to pay the correct amount of import taxes and customs duties. If you use an incorrect commodity code, you could have your goods delayed or even seized by customs. You could also pay too much VAT or duty. The regulators won’t mind that, but if you finish up paying too little you could be subject to fines and penalties. In fact, some items such as animals, plants, or anything that could be potentially hazardous, that is moved with the wrong commodity code, could find you breaking the law and you could be in serious trouble, even though it was without intent. The freight forwarder takes charge of all the physical steps involved in moving your goods from point A to point B and this could include arranging transport overland from the supplier to a port or airport, preparing all the documents and licences required for shipment, and negotiating the booking of the cargo for transport by sea or air. The freight forwarder may also undertake the tracking of the goods in delivery, and set up insurance as required. It can also arrange for haulage from the port or airport to final delivery to your business or to any other location in the UK that you require. Many of the above steps are not undertaken by the freight forwarder themselves, but the beauty is that they have the connections and experience to organise delivery of your goods to your final destination without any problems, which is what you obviously want. Whether you are importing something from China, Indonesia, the Caribbean, the US, or Timbuctoo, a freight forwarder will make the process simple and straightforward and ensure your goods arrive without any nasty surprises. Yes, of course, you have to pay the freight forwarder’s fees, but it should make the process of importing goods a simple and easy matter. Of course, it works the other way around too, so if you are exporting goods it works in the same way, but simply in the opposite direction. One of the most important factors is the insurance of the freight that you are importing or exporting. It’s a fact of life that accidents can and do happen. They may be few and far between, but if they happen to strike you, it can cost you a lot of money in the case of the goods being lost or damaged beyond repair, and being unable to supply your customers with goods that you have already sold to them. It could also do untold damage to your reputation. Now you can actually buy freight insurance online, but this could have some issues if you don’t know the company with which you are dealing. You are better off using the services of a marine insurance broker who is used to handling the insurance side of goods in transit. There are a lot of different elements to this, and unless you are fully aware of what you are doing, you could come very unstuck. Apart from any other considerations, every shipment of goods from one place to another is different and involves many different transactions, such as road transport, storage, shipping, air transport, more road transport, and so on, and you need to make certain that your goods are covered no matter what may happen on the way. This is why a marine insurance broker is best placed to help you find the insurance which covers everything you need at the lowest cost."
17,There Are Lots Of Things To Consider When Moving Home,finance," Moving home is one of the most stressful things that we ever do – some would say that it is the most stressful. There are a thousand and one things to do and remember to do, and you might also have to work right up to moving day and go back to work straight after you have moved. This can mean that getting everything sorted in your new home can take weeks, and even longer if you have decided to redecorate. There are lots of decisions to be made, such as whether to take something with you or whether it is time to throw it out and buy new. There are so many different people that you have to inform of your new address, some obvious ones being the bank, so that all their records are up to date, and your car insurance company, because they often rate your premium based on your postcode and if they don’t know you have moved may refuse to pay out if you make a claim. You also have to remember to cancel the electricity, and possibly gas, together with your water supplier. You need to arrange for your broadband supplier to install it at your new address because, believe it or not, some broadband suppliers take up to six weeks to connect you, so you could be without an internet connection. You also need to cancel your newspaper delivery, and your milkman if you still have your milk delivered. Then there are all the things that you forget to do, such as notify Tesco of your new address, only to realise about a year later that you are not getting any Clubcard points because they went to your old address! (Tesco are actually very good about this and will replace them because you haven’t used them). You might also need to put everything into storage for a few weeks if you have to move out of your present home and cannot move into the new one immediately. If you have children, they have to leave their present school and you have to arrange for a new school for them in your new area. That may mean buying new school uniforms, so that they are ready to go to school as soon as you arrive. Where are you going to keep the family dog and cats on moving day? Are you going to pop them in the car and take them with you? That’s probably not a good idea because when you arrive at your new home there is nowhere to keep them while the removal men walk in and out of the home carrying furniture and with all the doors open. They could just wander off and get lost, so you need to book them into a kennels or cattery, or have a friend look after them, so that you can go back and pick them up later. No wonder moving home is such a stressful experience. And those are just some of the things that need to be done. Then there is the choice of a removal company. You need to get a reputable company and not just a ""man and van"" job if you want your belongings to be protected and safe on the journey. This is especially the case if you have valuable and heavy items such as an American style fridge freezer or perhaps a grand piano. And then there is something else, and that is insurance. Many people are blissfully unaware that their home contents insurance may only cover them for items in their home, and that it may cease the minute those goods leave. So, if something should happen to your belongings in transit to your new home, there is a very strong possibility that they may not be covered. This is why you need to check your contents insurance policy very carefully and if they are not covered, take out some house moving insurance to cover them in transit. Yes, your removals company will have a certain amount of cover, but it is likely to be very limited, and nowhere near enough if your goods should get damaged in transit. An insurance broker will be able to arrange this for you for very little cost, and also cover items in storage if need be."
18,Do you want to reduce your taxes for next year?,finance," Whether you are a first-time filer or a seasoned veteran, there are tips that can help lower the amount you owe in taxes or increase your refund.  See how many you can implement now to keep more of your money in your pocket. Get organized:  Don’t wait to deal with your taxes every April. Start a box to house all your tax-related documents and fill it all year long with receipts for deductible expenses, 1099 forms, end-of-year statements, etc.  When it’s time to start preparing your return everything will be in one place. Claim all the deductions you can:  Tax deductions can shrink your tax bill by reducing your taxable income. You can choose to itemize all your deductions, or just take the standard deductions that are available to all taxpayers.  These types of deductions have almost doubled in recent years, making it a smart decision for most people.   This list of tax deductions can help you as you prepare your taxes. Claim all tax credits:  It’s important to take advantage of all your deductions, but don’t forget tax credits.  They can save you more money than a basic deduction.  There are many available tax credits (education, adoption, dependent care, energy-efficient home improvements and many more. Give back:  Charitable contributions are an easy way to reduce your tax bill.  Remember, there are many ways to give back beyond just writing a check.  Toys, books, clothes and other household items may be donated to shelters or other organizations.  Expenses from volunteer work can also be a tax benefit.  Cost of travel or a donation to the charity you volunteer for can also be deducted but the non-profit organization must be a 501©(3). For taxpayers that need extra tax savings, think about bundling some contributions or putting two years’ worth of deductions into a single year.  This could put you over the standard deduction allowing you to use all your smaller deductions. Feed your IRA:  Contributions to a retirement plan is the best way to reduce your tax bill.  Remember this – the money you contribute to a traditional IRA is a pre-tax contribution, so it lowers your taxable income.  This means you will owe less in income taxes, whether you itemize or take the standard deduction.  For 2020, you can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA plus $1,000 extra if you are 50 or older.  You can contribute up to $19,500 to your 401(k) plus $6,500 extra if you are 50 or older.  Contributions to Roth accounts won’t give you any tax deductions. Use a Flexible Spending Account (FSA):  An FSA lets you put away funds for qualifying healthcare expenses on a pre-tax basis, which shrinks your taxes.  For example, if you contribute to your FSA and spend it on prescription drugs or doctor visits, that money won’t show as taxable income.  Keep in mind that this is use-it-or-lose it money or 12 months. Contribute to a 529 plan:  If you have kids heading to college in the future then this plan is for you.  These plans can vary by state but there is virtually no limit to your contributions and can grow on a tax-free basis before being spent on education expenses.  Research 529 plans before you contribute. Buy a home with a mortgage:  Even if you are lucky enough to have the funds to purchase a home out right, you may still want to buy it with a mortgage.  Mortgage interest is deductible and can help your tax bill.  Also, the funds you save by purchasing with a mortgage can be invested for your retirement. Use the correct filing status:  If you file your taxes with the incorrect status it can be costly.  Review the deductions above to see what status will help you the most. If in doubt, consult a tax professional:  While you are preparing your taxes and you’re unsure about something, consult a pro.  It’s well worth the small expense to avoid an audit or tax penalty."
19,Artificial Intelligence: an inflexion point for humanity. A sectoral approach towards strategic investing.,finance," 02/21/20020 - Published by EUCC-RIID. Dr. Christophe AUBIN-NURY de Malicorne Senior manager in international banking and financial services, specialized in investment, private equity and economic development advisory. Consultant Specialist in finance & economics at ARS, a US government agency and member of CEDIN, Research Center in International Law. Artificial Intelligence: an inflexion point for humanity. A sectoral approach towards strategic investing. According to McKinsey’s predictions at the end of 2018 regarding artificial intelligence, the technology could bring more than 13 trillion dollars to the GDP of the world economy in the next ten years. This will happen first, by streamlining production processes, to allow employees to create added value while being freed from repetitive tasks. Then, the challenge for the digital and AI revolution is to promote consumption more targeted to consumer demand, in order to optimize their potential. The history of humanity follows an innovation trend, which began with the discovery of fire, the invention of the wheel around 3500 BC, printing, cars, trains, electrical engineering, and other crucial innovations having led the paths to our current level of prosperity. This curve started to rise considerably during the 20th century. This exponential rate is due to the rapid development of computer technology at the end of this century and the recent emergence of artificial intelligence. The 21st century, however, should see the trend of human innovation to a level never seen before. Despite the possible drifts, the influence of artificial intelligence on the innovation curve will not only be beneficial to society, but also crucial to its development. Understanding that it is evidently impossible to forecast the future, it seems nonetheless obvious at current stage, that our society is inevitably headed for a dramatic change in regards to lifestyles and economic activity through artificial intelligence because nowadays its growth is  considerably enhanced by artificial capabilities and deep learning notably. In reality, the use of AI in the various economic activity sectors will allow consumers to save valuable time, but also to offer them increasingly personalized products and services, therefore more attractive to them, both nationally and worldwide. Subsequently, it will be an essential vector of growth in order to accelerate the economic development of developing countries. This new way of producing and consuming implies new prospects for economic growth and sustainable development. At the start of 2020, the financial markets are at record levels. However, current economic and political contexts prompt us to rethink our investment strategies as the world enters a new era of growth. It is at a major inflection point, particularly in terms of its future exponential economic development, due in large part to new technologies, but especially to the recent emergence of artificial intelligence and its direct or indirect global consequences. These latest developments make it possible to anticipate a spectrum of sectors with high growth potential in the medium and long term in regard to this new paradigm, driven by new advanced technologies and advances in robotization which make production more efficient, cheaper and faster than ever. Among the sectors that should benefit the most from this evolution, there are particularly: -Digital transformation: deep learning, internet of things, data intelligence, cloud -Security: data, goods, infrastructures, persons -Health and biotechnology -Robotics -E-commerce -Uberization of services -Luxury goods -Nanotechnology Our civilization has indeed reached a major inflection point from the development of artificial intelligence technology, as it has triggered an impressive acceleration of innovation. In fact, the challenge of innovation is changing radically because it no longer depends only on the capabilities of the human brain. In addition to their intrinsic possibilities, artificial brains make machines more and more intelligent, thanks to their capacities for autonomous learning and action. Furthermore, In a context where the population of developed countries only represents about 20% of the world population, artificial intelligence will increase drastically the speed of innovation and propel humanity into a new dimension of global development growth, thereby generating multiple investment opportunities.

1,When Moving Overseas You Need To Insure Your Goods Against Loss Or Damage,finance," Moving overseas is a big deal. Whatever  your reason, and wherever you are going, you are leaving behind people you may  have known all your life – be they friends or relatives – and going to a new  land with a different culture, sometimes very different, and where in a lot of  cases English is not the first language, or may not be spoken at all. Indeed,  you may have had to start learning a new language in the weeks before the move. Now it may be that you plan to buy some new  furniture when you arrive in your new homeland, but if you are like most people  there will be things that you want to take with you. And if you want to take  things with you it will be because they have a value to you. Indeed, they could  be very valuable indeed, such as antique furniture or glass, or large original  paintings. And if you value them you will want to ensure that you are protected  against loss. Of course, nobody can protect you against total loss of something  that is irreplaceable, for the simple reason that you cannot replace it, but at  least you can gain financial compensation as long as it is covered by  insurance. Fortunately, the chances of your goods  being lost or destroyed during shipping are not all that great, although it can  and does happen. According to the World Shipping Council which carried out a  survey in 2017, between 2014 and 2016 an average of 3.8 containers were lost  each day, but that was out of a total of 356,000. Ships transported £8.5  billion worth of cargo every day, and 99.99% of it arrived safely. However, there is always that element of  risk, even if you think that it won’t happen to you, so the answer is to take  out overseas removal insurance. This will give you the peace of mind  that, if the worst happens, you will at least receive compensation. The first thing to do is to consider what  you can leave behind. You don’t want to take everything including the kitchen  sink because the less you take the less the shipping is going to cost you.  Furthermore, the less you take, the less the insurance is going to cost you as  well. So it’s time to sit down and think about what you really NEED to take and  what you can leave behind, either replacing it when you arrive at your  destination or not. If you are not going to replace it, then there is no point  in taking it anyway. Then the next thing to do is to value the  items you are going to take, and value them accurately. Don’t over-value them  just because you love them. You may have a favourite armchair, but just check  out what it would cost you to replace it. Equally, you don’t want to undervalue  anything because if it is a total loss you are only going to get the amount it  was insured for. You need to write a description of the items and also take  photographs. Apart from any other consideration, this will make replacing them  with as near identical as possible much easier if they are lost. When you are ready to go, you will need to  have all your items professionally packed. Some insurance policies will not pay  out if you pack the items yourself and they get damaged. When you are ready to get  insurance quotes, you will need to decide what sort of insurance cover you  want. There are different types. Probably the best is warehouse to warehouse  cover because it covers you as it says on the tin. You can also get all risk  insurance which covers most events, but not something like war or an asteroid  strike. Named perils only covers specific named items, and it is cheaper. Even  cheaper is total loss as it only covers you for that. You can also get general  average coverage which is included in some policies. This covers the situation  when someone else’s cargo is lost or damaged: all those shipping goods have to  jointly pay for any damage to the vessel or its’ cargo. So you could have to  pay towards someone else’s loss even though your own items arrived safely."
2,Moving Home Is One Of The Most Stressful Experiences We Ever Undergo,finance," Moving home is always thought to be one of  the most stressful experiences we ever have, and if you have moved home you  will probably agree. Furthermore, the average Briton moves home every seven  years, so in a lifetime that is ten of those experiences, and in some cases a  lot more. If you move across town, you can probably  still keep in touch with friends from your last home. If you move across the  county, it’s not so easy. If you move from one end of the country to another  you may never see some of those people again. If you move abroad, it can be  even worse because you may never see any of them again. Yet, moving home is something that we all  do from time to time. Certainly, some people find a place to settle and stay  there for 30 or 40 years, but most of us move for one reason or another. Very  often it is because of a job. Your company wants you to move from London to  Manchester to take up a new post, or the other way around. You want the job  because it’s a promotion and will make you more money, so you take up the  offer. However, as with all things, there is a downside in that you have to  make new friends and leave the old ones. Possibly the worst thing is the actual  moving day. There is so much to deal with. This is probably why it is so  stressful. That’s just moving in the UK. If you move abroad, you may be going  to a country where you have to learn a new language and become accustomed to a  completely different way of life. Wherever you are going, there is also the  problem of moving all your belongings. First you have to decide what you want  to take with you and what you don’t. We all – almost without exception – have  collected a lot of things over the years that we never use. There is a saying  that if you have something you haven’t used for two years you will never use it  again. It may very well be true. So one advantage of moving is that you can  ditch things that you will never use. That makes a lot of sense. Why pay to  move things you will never use again? Then there is the problem of moving things  that you want to keep. Again, especially true if you are moving overseas. You  have to hand them over to a shipping company and hope that everything will  arrive intact. The same actually applies even if you are only moving a few  miles, because accidents can happen. That is why you need moving insurance,  and this may not be covered by your contents insurance. If you are moving  abroad it almost certainly won’t be. Some contents insurance policies do cover  moving to another home, but others most definitely don’t. This is why you need  to look closely at your policy to ensure that goods in transit are covered, and  if not, get that cover added to your policy, for the appropriate premium of  course. However, that may only be £30 or £40 if you are moving in the UK. If you are moving abroad, it is a completely  different kettle of fish. There are different types and levels of insurance that  you can obtain, and which you need will depend on what you want to insure and  where you are going, as well as the level of cover that you require. The good news is that if you are moving  abroad, the premiums are not all that exorbitant. Typically, they can range  from 0.6% to 4% of the cost of replacement of your possessions, depending on  the level of cover that you require. However, there are  different types of cover available and they are at different rates with  different companies! This is why, if you are moving abroad, your best bet is to  use the services of an insurance broker that specialises in marine insurance.  It can be very different from the sort of insurance that you need for your  contents in the UK, but a marine insurance broker will be able to help."
3,Will you be responsible with your tax refund?,finance," What’s the first think you will think of when you file your 2019 taxes?  If you are like me, it’s REFUND.  It doesn’t matter if it is a small refund or a large check you are expecting, it’s always a nice uplift to your savings or checking account at the beginning of the year. You definitely don’t want to be one of those people that squanders away their refund check, so make sure you change your carefree spending habits and start thinking how you will be responsible with your tax refund. It’s Time To Start Your Taxes By now you should have received most of the forms you will need to file.  Take a minute and make a plan that will allow you to pay off some of those nagging bills, self-indulge a little but still allowing yourself to meet your financial goals in 2020. What are the first steps to your plan? •	File your taxes early.  The earlier you file, the quicker you get your refund. •	Always select direct deposit instead of waiting for a paper check. •	Utilize a tax service that have experts to answer all your questions. Now that you have prioritized your financial objectives, which of these options meet your goals? Save Your Refund •	You probably already know the importance of having an appropriate savings account, and always keep that account separate from your checking account. •	Start an emergency fund or add to the one you already have.  You don’t want to rely on credit cards to bail you out of financial emergencies.  The best emergency fund should cover at least three months of expenses. •	Use your refund to start saving for a down payment on a new home or condo.  Even a small refund can help you attain those large goals. Spend Your Refund We all have bills.  Use your refund to pay down some of those balances. •	Pay off some of your small balance credit cards.  The more debt you take off your plate the more financial flexibility you will have.  Make sure you pay off the cards with the highest interest rate first. •	Make an additional payment on your large loans like your auto or home mortgage.  Make sure that payment goes towards your principal only.  This will help lower your balance and could mean less interest you have to pay during the life of the loan. Use your refund to help build your credit •	Obtaining a secured credit card is a great way to build credit.  This is how it works.  If you want to get a $750 limit on a credit card you can use the $750 from your tax refund or savings account as a security deposit for the card.  You can still use the card to make purchases as long as you make your monthly payments on time. •	Having a pre-paid debit card is also a great alternative to cash.  You can put a portion of your refund on a pre-paid debit.  This will also decrease your stops at the ATM. Enjoy Your Refund Don’t forget that life is all about the right balance.  Even though having a savings account and paying your bills are important, it’s OK to treat yourself every once in a while.  Just make sure it’s not an overly expensive indulgence.  So, set aside a small portion of your return to spend on the most important person, YOU.  But, only spend what fits in your budget.  Something as simple as taking the family out to a movie, a spa day or just a night out can feel like a real treat. No matter how you plan to spend or save your refund, just be smart.  Evaluate your financial goals, create your plan to save, spend and enjoy some of that return."

5,Signs That You Are Doing Budgeting Wrong,finance," You want to save up for your future, and you want to be more financially stable. These goals are pretty standard, but they are actually quite challenging to attain. Budgeting is the simplest but one of the most effective methods of saving funds. But as simple as it may sound if your will to resist an impulse purchase is weak-- then you are bound to make a few budgeting mistakes. You need to develop good spending habits and be able to resist any temptation to spend more than you should on things that won't serve you in the future. Find out what budget mistake you might be making in this article. Defining a Budget Before we get to the juicy parts, let's define what a budget is first. Simply put, a budget is a spending plan that you make for a specific period. Creating a budget involves determining how much money you are making and how much expenses you incur for a specified period. People usually budget with a particular goal in mind like saving up for a holiday trip or treating themselves to a good restaurant or something even more significant. You need to be specific with your goals because basing your budget on a vague idea is a sure way to a failed budgeting effort. Budgeting You Might Be Making Here are some budgeting mistakes that you may be making: If you set your goals too high, then you are setting yourself up to fail. There is nothing wrong with aiming high, but make sure that you are not expecting yourself to do so much in such a short time. For example, wanting to have $1 million is doable, but ask yourself if it's realistic to expect yourself to save up that much in two months. The thing with unrealistic goals is that it hurts your motivation whenever you fail or if you are not progressing as much as you want to. For example, again with the $1 million goal-- if you don't save up at least half by the end of your first month, you would realise how it is not possible and end up not following through your plan at all. How do you even make a budget without knowing how much money you make in a month? If you don't know how much your salary is, you would not know how much you can actually spend on bills, rent and other necessities. You would have spent every cent before you can even set aside for your savings. There are two kinds of expenses-- make that three. The first kind of expense is incurring ones. They are your electric bills, water bills, rent, loan repayments, and other expenses that you know are coming every month with no fail. The second kind is the ones that are not fixed, but you know are necessities like food and groceries. The third one is stuff that you buy to treat yourself (which is good in moderation) and things that you probably don't need at all (like a vase you bought because it's on sale). Not taking note of your expenses can lead you to treat yourself a little too much or to give in easily to your impulse to buy. When you know exactly how much your necessary expenses should be, you can adjust the third kind of expenses accordingly. This means that you are spending more than you earn. It is already a bad budgeting sign if you are used to having a negative number in your account. Not fixing this bad spending habit is a budgeting mistake because what can a piece of paper with a plan do if your willpower to resist overspending is as fragile as a baby's head? Until you address this issue, then there would always be a destruct button to your budget plan that will inevitably get pressed when a sale comes around. Duh-- not sticking to the plan is an obvious mistake, but it is one that most people make. You would be saying things like ""I'm only going to go over my budget just this once,"" or ""This is the last time I'm doing this,"" then the next thing you know-- all your money is gone, and you have not followed your budget plan for six months. Heck, you might even have stopped making budget plans in your second month. The Takeaway The things is, sometimes the answer is right in front of you, but you are not seeing it. If you think of it, this list is composed of obvious reasons why your budget is failing and why you are doing it wrong. But sometimes you need a helping hand to point these things out. Just keep in mind that your budget goal needs to be realistic, you must know your finances inside out and that you should stick to the plan so you would not go astray."
6,Is Dst A Good Investment?,finance," Various types of DST properties are available for investors, including multifamily apartment buildings, retail centers, medical offices, or self-storage buildings. The DST properties have long-term lease contracts with the tenants. With our 1031 exchange portfolios, there are numerous properties available for our qualified accredited clients, with an average minimum direct investment of $25,000. Although DSTs are typically considered securities under federal securities laws, they are treated as direct ownership of real estate under Section 1031 of the IRS tax code. Thus DST investments are eligible for 1031 exchanges both when you initially invest and when the DST liquidates. The real estate sponsor firm obtains properties under the DST and then sells shares of the DST to investors. Investors then roll their 1031 exchange capital into the DST to acquire a beneficial interest. Investors are able to easily access these institutional quality properties with professional management by pooling their funds together. Advantages of a 1031 DST: Tax Deferral and the elimination of complex property management responsibilities. A DST also increases diversification by the number of properties, geography, and types of property. The investor also gets the freedom to diversify and include real estate like NNN retail, multi-family apartments, assisted living facilities self-storage, and more. If an investor passes away in the event of owning an interest in a DST, their heirs get an immediate capital gain, and it eliminates the taxes due on the initial gain forever. In a nutshell, a Delaware Statutory Trust (DST) is a legally recognized trust for carrying out business and can be used as a conduit for replacement property for accredited investors during a 1031 exchange. DST 1031 exchange has multiple financing ratios to satisfy the investor's exchange requirements of taking greater or equal debts as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 1031.

9,What you should know before finding cash buyer for your property?,finance," When it comes to selling your home, the ideal scenario to get your property sold quickly is to find a buyer who has cash at their disposal. Having said that, cash buyers don’t come along very often, and finding someone who has cash funds can often be a difficult task. As a property seller you really need to know the facts about dealing with cash property buyers, whether it is on the open market or via a quick property sale company. Below are some common misconceptions that you may or may not have known. Cash Buyers NEVER Pay Full Market Value One fact that all home sellers need to bare in mind is that no cash property buyer will ever pay 100% market value for a home. It’s inevitable that anyone looking to sell their home quickly for cash is going to receive a lower offer – as the buyer is the one in a more powerful position. Let’s look at it this way, if a used car trader bought your vehicle from you at 100% market value, and then went on to sell your vehicle on their car lot at 100% market value; how would they keep their business running? The answer is they couldn’t. The same applies to cash property investors, they are in the property business to make a profit. Some cash buyers will want more than others, some are fair with their pricing whereas others will want 30-40% discounts on current market value. A cash property buying company is likely to pay less than a cash buyer you find on the open market via an estate agent. The reason for this is that the cash buyer on the open market doesn’t usually have as many overheads (staff, offices etc) as a big cash buying firm. Having said that you may be surprised at the offer some companies will make, so it’s always a good idea to shop around when you are looking for a company to deal with. Cash Buyers RARELY Search The Open Market The next snag about cash buyers is that they rarely search the open market. You wouldn’t see an investor on the high street browsing the local estate agents window, or looking at the premium listings in the Newspaper and Magazines. The likelihood is that you will find cash investors at auctions, on estate agent mailing lists and investment companies. Some companies that claim to buy cash buyers and say they have investors available are actually relying on Buy-to-Let mortgages, and you need to be careful of this situation arising. A mortgage investor can only complete as quickly as the mortgage company will allow, and this isn’t what you are signing up for! What you want is a quick sale, and the only way to guarantee this is with a genuine cash buyer. You can determine if a company are genuine cash buyers by asking them to provide you with proof of funds. Cash Buyers Are A RARE Breed As mentioned before cash home buyers are rarely looking on the open market, and what makes things even harder is that they are rarely discoverable at all! The easiest way to source a cash buyer is by using a firm. Remember you MUST do your homework on quick sale agencies, and you need to make sure the company you are dealing with are legitimate and honest. Look at reviews, don’t accept the first offer you are given, and don’t be bullied. Using a cash buying firm or seeking a quick sale via a cash house buyer should be the very last step in your search for a fast sale. The advantages are you will get a guaranteed quick sale, and the disadvantage is that you will be selling at a below market value price. It is up to you to make this financial decision."
10,4 things to look for before investing in a stock,finance," What are 4 basic things to look for before investing in any stock? The following 4 things are both essential and very important, providing an analytical framework to perform due diligence for safer investments. You cannot control the risk or the potential volatility in the financial markets but applying these 4 things on each stock will provide better risk-adjusted stock picks. And they can help you become pickier in the stock market, as these 4 things have several criteria to take into consideration. The 4 things to look for before investing in a stock are: Fundamental analysis Relative and absolute valuation Macroeconomic environment, business cycles and sector, industry of the stock Technical analysis Let’s analyze more these 4 things. Fundamental analysis. What fundamental analysis does is examining financial ratios to check very important factors which can impact the price of any stock. There are 4 types of financial ratios, and these are profitability, leverage, liquidity and operating or efficiency ratios. These financial ratios combine data from income statement and balance sheet such as revenues and earnings, to determine if the stock is attractive and has also potential for future growth. If you remember that buying a stock makes you an owner of that company even at a very small percentage, then it is prudent to buy fundamentally safe stocks. Stocks of companies that show profitability, have reasonable debt or even zero debt, plenty of liquidity and their management uses efficiently the assets to produce more wealth and added value for the shareholders. At the same time, you should analyze the trend of these financial ratios, look back 3-5 years to check how they have changed. Is net profit margin rising? Is debt increasing? And do not neglect the very strong importance of cash flows, the operating cash flows and the free cash flows. Stocks that show increased cash flows and naturally positive ones should be preferred to others that do not. Would you buy a stock of a company that is very likely to go bankrupt within a short-term period? This precious information can be shown by thorough fundamental analysis. Invest time reading the 10-K, 10-Q reports published by public companies frequently. And keep monitoring the economic news about specific stocks that are of interest to your portfolio. Relative and absolute valuation. Once you have performed the fundamental analysis of a stock you should check its relative and absolute valuation. A great stock may be overpriced compared to the price observed when it is traded on the stock exchange. You do not want to pay an irrational price. It is better to find undervalued stocks to buy and overvalued to sell short. You can perform relative valuation for any stock comparing popular valuation ratios of any stock such as P/E, P/Sales, P/Cash flow, and P/Book Value with the relative valuation ratios of the whole market, the industry and the sector it belongs to. Again, check the trend of these ratios over time. Is the stock relative undervalued because its recent P/E ratio is at historical low levels for the past 3-5 years? Absolute valuation is much more difficult but there are many financial sites which for a reasonable fee have it ready for you. The risk in absolute valuation is that in any DCF or DDM model very small changes in inputs and assumptions can have a large impact on the fair or intrinsic value of the stock. But it is also prudent to have this absolute valuation in your mind before buying or selling a stock. Macroeconomic environment, business cycles and sector, industry of the stock. Any company operates within an economic environment at which there are limitations and restrictions or risks. There are two main categories to analyze a stock in a broader financial analysis. The top-down analysis and the bottom-up analysis. The top-down approach in simple words is to look first at how the global economy is performing, then check business sectors and industries, and finally choose the best stocks within specific sectors and industries. Bottom-up approach is the exact opposite. As many analysts have recently expressed concerns about a global slowdown of economic growth in 2019, some sectors which may perform well if the slowdown occurs later in 2019 could be utilities, real estate, health care and consumer staples. Technical analysis. Finally, timing is crucial for stock investing. Technical analysis can add more value to your fundamental analysis of any stock, providing increased odds to make as much as possible accurate timing buying or selling stocks. Technical analysis is all about probabilities. Under no circumstances it is 100% correct, but if used it can improve the odds of buying a so-called oversold stock with great fundamentals and make a profit. Or sell stocks that appear to be overbought and have poor fundamentals. There are many technical analysis indicators and strategies, but you can start with a very simple such as the crossover and trend of important moving averages such as the 20-period and 50-period moving average in any time frame. As a conclusion these 4 things can help you perform due diligence analyzing any stock, increasing the odds of selecting equities that meet your criteria and having a reasonable basis to make a profit. Rather than gambling, you will have performed solid financial analysis, which can adjust the risk taken to compensate for a desired and logical rate of return."

The chance to associate with all degrees of traders in the case of starting or expert will fabricate your experience and certainty just as assist you with maintaining a strategic distance from exorbitant mix-ups. The fifth instrument, and as I would see it the most significant, is to discover a guide/mentor to assist you with your trading. I once conversed with a story trader on the CBOE that solitary had a secondary school training in a situation where everybody had the base of a business degree from one of the Ivy League schools which revealed to me he because so effective on the floor was on the grounds that he had a veteran trader mentor him.

14,5 Easy ways of Investing in Real Estate for Beginners,finance," Purchasing and holding real estate is an interesting investment approach that can be both pleasant and profitable. Unlike property and bond investors, planned real estate proprietors can utilize the advantage to purchase an asset by spending a part of the entire cost upfront, then clearing off the balance, plus interest, over time. But for beginners investing in real estate can be a challenging task. They may hesitate in investing or maybe unknown of the ways through which is done. So here in this blog, Laurent Carrier — a provider of retirement planning services & financial services to Colorado Springs individuals and business owners, will explore some of the ways to invest in real estate. Look for Wholesale Properties Funding in real estate is exactly like spending in the stock market in at least one way: you’re seeming for the most beneficial agreement. If you’re a savvy stock exchange investor, you apparently won’t purchase too many assets at their high if you intend on retaining them for an extended time. Rather, you’ll follow the postulate of becoming selfish when everyone else becomes nervous. You’ll purchase assets that are knocked down and take a chance when they turn around. Invest in REITs Customers invest in REITs for the identical purpose they spend in real estate ETFs and mutual funds; they need to invest in real estate externally holding substantial property. REITs engage you to do precisely that while also expanding your holdings based on the variety of real estate classes each REIT invests in. Invest in Rental Properties Whether you purchase an asset and be there while leasing out apartments or buy a home individually for lending, rental businesses are an immeasurable source of passive revenue. They aren’t completely passive though, as you’ll have to implement some preservation (or spend on a business administrator to control it all), but in general, they are a stationary investment. You could do something termed as house hacking which is holding an investment property and letting out apartments in the property or residing in one of the units while letting out the rest. Flipping Houses Flipping houses can be a little unsafe, but also greatly satisfying. And, since property values are back on the rise, this is an immeasurable opportunity to get begun flipping homes. Flipping a home is the amount of buying houses below market value, fixing them up, and then marketing for an interest. To be a prosperous flipper, you require to track down those discount places — the more limited work you have to do the more satisfying. The absolute flip house would be one that only requires insignificant superficial renovations. You could then make the house seem more aesthetically pleasing and market for interest."
15,What Forex Brokerages Should Look For in a Forex Trading Platform,finance," While we assume most of you already understand, let’s quickly relook at what a trading platform is. What is a Forex Trading Platform? A forex trading platform is a software that enables trading, such as opening, closing, and managing market positions through a financial institution such as a forex brokerage. These trading platforms may also be specific to certain instruments or markets such as stocks, currencies, options, futures. For the most part, forex trading platforms such as MT4/MT5 are offered at a subscription fee. However, on rare occasions, some fx trading platforms, especially the ones new to the market are offered for free in exchange for commissions on a specified number of trades per month. Traders across the globe use a wide variety of trading platforms depending on their trading style and volume. However, MT4/MT5 by MetaQuotes is highly popular among most traders with 15 million users worldwide. This is because MT4 trading platforms are user-friendly, comprehensive and flexible at the same time. Additionally, MT4/MT5 does not have any strings attached, in the sense, there are no trading volume quotas to meet. This is another reason why MT4/MT5 is offered by most forex brokerages universally. How to pick the right trading platform for your forex brokerage? As a forex brokerage, picking the right trading platform is crucial. This decision must be based on the features and the fees involved. Here’s a checklist of things to look for while choosing the trading platform for your brokerage. It’s an important lesson to borrow from massive retailers. Giant retail stores have been selling their own branded groceries at a much lower price because white-labelled products sell. Retail or FinTech, the concept here is the same. Simply subscribe to a product that has been developed by one company and market it as your own. It gives you a ready-made solution effortlessly, without the hassle of spending a ton of money and time. Additionally, a white-labeled forex trading software boosts the visibility of your fx brokerage, strengthening the loyalty of your existing clients. Look for a forex technology provider that doesn’t just offer white-labeled forex solutions, but is also able to customize as per your business needs. Every single customer of yours may have their own unique style of trading. Some may prefer using a desktop-based trading platform, while some may choose a web trader or even a mobile trader. Irrespective of where the trading platform is hosted, the stability and reliability of the platform is of utmost importance. This can be a deal maker or a breaker with avid traders who make large, frequent trades as they are always looking for a forex trading platform that never or seldom crashes. It is important to note that your future customers will interact with these trading platforms, a lot more than they would with your brokerage or your website. Therefore, the user experience is the factor that will decide how long your customers will stay with you. A trading platform, whether desktop, mobile or web that allows for placing an order or closing a trade immediately in one click is an ideal one. Not to mention, the swift opening of several graphs in a single click. In addition to single-click trading, management of stop-loss and overall navigation are advantages that a trader may consider. Also, if a platform offers several charts and tools, the ability to access and apply with ease is critical. While choosing a forex technology provider it is important to choose one where support is included free of cost. A technology partner who offers forex turnkey solutions should be able to help you with questions or issues whenever you face any. Additionally, a partner with a strong tech team like Sanfrix, can rectify issues and can also deploy any new software updates immediately. In this day and age, you must offer your clients the flexibility to trade from anywhere at any time. Therefore, trading platforms must be accessible across devices such as web, mobile, and tablets. This isn’t just a flexibility feature for your customers, but also an advantage to the 0verall growth and profit of your forex brokerage business. A forex technology provider like Sanfrix is able to offer intuitive forex trading platforms that can be accessed as a web trader, mobile trader (iOS or Android App) or on tablets. Furthermore, they can be fully customized and branded to your liking in terms of look and feel as well as the functionality. We cannot stress the importance of partnering with a provider that doesn’t just offer full customizable trading platforms but also has immense API capabilities. The veterans in the technology team at Sanfrix have catered to numerous clients with their API needs as far as forex technology is concerned. Any external plugins, custom development, and APIs can be flawlessly integrated into any of your existing systems whilst making sure the communication with the trading platforms are intact. An ideal forex technology provider will offer a wide array of instruments such as major and minor currency pairs, cryptocurrencies, index, stocks, forex, energies, metals, commodities, and futures. Many traders like to test their trade strategies ahead of time to ensure they’re working without losing actual money. A good Fx technology provider should be able to offer simulations and demo capabilities to hypothetically test trades. On the other hand, a feature like this acts as a practice space for amateur traders. Charting capability is one of the most essential features of a trading platform. Several forex traders rely on the charting to visually examine the movements of prices on charts. Also, another important feature to look for is if your provider allows a trade to be placed directly from the chart. Furthermore, traders use technical analysis methods to forecast pricing. Tools such as Fibonacci retracing, Gann signals, and more help in such an analysis. Finally, the cost and pricing models play an important role in decision making.  A technology provider such as Sanfrix charges a flat subscription fee and does not charge you based on trading volumes. This feature should be your primary concern when looking at pricing options as this can eat into your profits. Additionally, we at Sanfrix understand that start-up costs can be overwhelming and therefore, we can work out a pricing plan that works best for your business type ensuring you’re only paying based on your usage. Sanfrix offers all of the above features and more. To fully explore all the exciting possibilities, request a free demo today!"
16,Why Should You Do A 1031 Exchange In Michigan,finance," Home to almost 10 million inhabitants, Michigan is a popular investment spot for several reasons. Its proximity to 4 out of the 5 Great Lakes and unique shape make Michigan one of the famous states in the country. Another major factor is the flourishing car industry in the state, particularly in Detroit, which is the home of about 3.8 million people. Detroit is also known as a manufacturing powerhouse in the US because of some four thousand functional factories on its land, including those owned by giant brands such as Chrysler, Ford & General Motors. Detroit rightly deserves the title of the 'Motor City'. Apart from this, the city is also a leader of the health care economy in the country. What Michigan has for visitors and real estate investors? Michigan's vast diversity makes it an ideal travel destination for tourists. From hiking in the woods to gambling at the casinos, the state has plenty to offer to its visitors. Detroit's robust economy also makes it a hot spot for real estate investors, as new jobs and steady wages create a functional space for investing in the city. Even though the financial crunch in 2008 had dampened the state's economy, the Wolverine State had already made a comeback long ago. What are the Profitable Markets to Invest in Michigan Low cost of living and housing make Michigan appealing to several Millennials. Don't worry if you don't have a lot of capital. All you need to do is spend some time researching neighborhoods, and you'll find Detroit is the place where you should be. Suburbs like Beverly Hills, Franklin, and Birmingham offer a moderate lifestyle, far different from a fast-paced lifestyle of a sprawling metropolis. You can also consider Ann Arbor, Novi, and Troy if you would prefer to invest outside Detroit. The demographical data shows retirees usually choose to settle down in warmer states, whereas, Grosse Pointe Shores and Bingham Farms are quite popular among those who are up for all seasons. Both are small, nearby communities, with negligible crime rate and above-average rental prices. Perfect opportunity for investors doing a 1031 Exchange in Michigan Though a 1031 exchange offers great benefits to every investor, it entirely depends on the investor's decision and how they make the most out of their exchange. Other things like property's location, living condition, job availability, crime rate, etc. play a significant role in shaping up the future of any real estate investment. As a 1031 investor, you would certainly want your replacement property to be in a place that has a low crime rate and excellent opportunities for job-seekers. Michigan is one such place. Plus, the resources this state provides. It's one of the ideal locations to find a replacement property for your 1031 exchange.

17,Places You Can Save Money For Your Family,finance," Most families are spending more and more money every year (and not just because the cost of living rose) while also saving less and less. One reason is that few household managers spend much time reviewing expenses and expenditures to find ways they can save money. However almost every family has places where costs can be cut and pennies can be pinched -- and if those freed up funds are then used to pay down debt and save for the future it could have a dramatic impact on their quality of life. Food is one big area where many families could be more thrifty. Families spend an average of $2,434 on food away from home, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you (and your spouse and your children) eat lunch out every day of the week then try brown-bagging at least one of those days. If just one of you does it you may save up to $400 a year and if you can double or triple that savings you could finance a family vacation with it. Another major expense is your home. When was the last time you looked at refinancing? Can you find a lower interest rate? Can you renegotiate to a shorter time frame? Even if you can't change your mortgage payment you may be able to pay a bit extra each month which over time will help pay down your mortgage faster. Also, don't overlook your utilities. There are ways to save in this area as well including updating your insulation and weather stripping, keeping up-to-date with maintenance and cleaning of your furnace and air conditioner or using a programmable thermostat to take advantage of those times when your house is empty or the family is asleep. Transportation is another major expense for many families. Not only are vehicles expensive to buy but also to maintain and operate especially with gasoline prices at such high levels. Is carpooling an option for any members of the family on at least a part-time basis? Make sure to combine errands and trips to cut down on your travel and save money when buying gasoline by taking advantage of special programs and discounts and remaining vigilant about gas prices. In addition, following a regular maintenance schedule and proper tire inflation can also help you achieve maximum gas mileage for your vehicle. Choosing your bank wisely can be another way to save money. Make sure the bank you use offers free (or at least low cost) checking as well as electronic bill-paying. Electronic bill-paying and a debit card can cut down on your need to use checks and postage which will save you in the long run as well as help you better manage payments so you will avoid fees, penalties, and higher interest rates. Cutting your credit card costs can be another major savings. This means making sure you are using the best possible credit card with a low interest rate and low or no annual fee. Shop around until you find your perfect match and don't forget to cancel and cut up those rejected suitors. Health care is not really an area where you can cut expenses but you can save money by taking advantage of special offers and programs. For example, many employers offer a Flexible Spending Account where you can save money before taxes for out-of-pocket medical expenses for prescription and nonprescription drugs, dental expenses, and eye care. Tuning up your insurance policies can also help you save money. When did you last compare rates for your home, your vehicles, and yourself? Some other ways to cut costs are to raise your deductible level or using the same company for multiple coverage (your home and vehicles). When you are shopping around make sure to give your current company a shot at keeping you. Sometimes they can offer a better rate too. Another major expense for many families is the cost of communication including local and long distance phone service, cell phones, cable or satellite television, and Internet access. Review your expenditures and cut out the services you don't need. Can some of these expenses be bundled to save money? Are there better plans for your needs? When looking to save money it is important to become an aggressive shopper. The Internet makes it possible today to compare prices and product reviews while not spending a lot of time and money driving from store to store. Any big ticket item (and that includes your weekly groceries, cleaning products and health and beauty aids) deserves a closer study. Over the next, month take time to review your family expenses and expenditures in each of these nine areas. Making a few alterations in your family's spending habits will soon make a difference in the overall household budget. You can raise your family's quality of life by making just a few changes in your monthly budget."

Sometimes advertising is intrusive, but when used correctly, it naturally integrates with content, and looks very organic. Ad monetization typically occurs when your site receives a lot of traffic. But this option is worth attention only if your traffic volume is constantly growing. Selling services from your site is one of the fastest ways to make a profit.

19,Different Types of Cryptocurrency Exchanges Based on Acceptance,finance," Cryptocurrency exchanges are similar to stock exchanges. But the focus of cryptocurrency exchanges is on cryptocurrency tokens instead of stock trades. Crypto exchanges offer the users a platform to trade their cryptocurrencies and exchange their digital assets based on values according to the market prices. There are various types of cryptocurrency exchanges out there, all of whom support transactions of the following nature- Local fiat-to-crypto transactions Crypto-to-crypto transactions While some crypto exchanges offer the platform to make the process easy for the customer, others expect to provide customers with competitive pricing. Some also seek to provide a platform for the professional cryptocurrency traders to use. Based on an individual's preference for fiat and digital currencies, they can opt for any or both of the following acceptance-based cryptocurrency platforms. Fiat A cryptocurrency wallet and exchange is an online platform assisting in transactions of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. The process of fiat-to-crypto is the conversion of government-backed currencies into cryptocurrencies. People mostly prefer centralized exchanges for converting their usual currencies into cryptocurrencies. Thus, most people first interact with these centralized platforms. Fiat-based exchanges facilitate the conversion of normal currencies into digital currencies, thereby allowing people to gain exposure to developing digital currency. Fiat-based exchange encourages the influx of new money into the industry. Thus, they function as the most crucial drivers of growth. As most retail investors first need a gateway to the sector before they can move to different platforms, fiat exchange is most preferred and enjoy maximum traction amongst the users. Centralized platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and Bittrex function as fiat convertors. Some of these centralized exchanges also accept credit cards for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, they enhance liquidity and boost the leverage of cryptocurrencies. Non-Fiat Non-fiat exchanges are the ones that are involved in the daily transaction of cryptocurrencies. But they don't allow the conversion of cryptocurrencies to usual currencies or vice-versa. The problem with non-fiat platforms is that they are amongst the most rigid types of cryptocurrency exchanges. Hence, they offer little flexibility. However, it is an excellent option for people who seek anonymity. Non-fiat exchanges are the ideal platform for the upcoming initial exchange offering listing. People who are entirely committed to using cryptocurrencies and vehemently discourage the conversion of crypto assets into normal currencies prefer non-fiat platforms. As they don't encourage centralized institutions or entities to lay their claim on others' crypto assets by acting as intermediaries, they offer a higher degree of security. Most non-fiat exchanges are decentralized. However, a few of them are also centralized. Ddex, Next.Exchange and dy/dx are some of the decentralized mediums that discourage fiat transfer. Bitrue, WazirX, and Poloniex are centralized platforms that are solely crypto-driven. Conclusion Deciding whether you want to go for a fiat or non-fiat exchange can be a tough choice to make. With so many different types of cryptocurrency exchanges out there, making the right call can be even more challenging. However, if you were to take my advice, I would suggest you follow your hunch and decide according to your leanings. If you genuinely believe in the power of cryptocurrencies and think that they are going to be a force to reckon with in the coming years, go for non-fiat platforms and contribute to achieving that reality. If you think there is some time before they can grow into anything substantial, fiat exchanges are the right choice for you. In any case, you would be strengthening the crypto industry."
20,Are DSTs Right For Your 1031 Exchange,finance," Why choose Delaware Statutory Trust for your 1031 Exchange? Delaware Statutory Trust, or DST, is a separate legal entity formulated around Delaware Statutory Law. DST Investments work as replacement property for real estate investors looking to defer their capital gains taxes using a 1031 exchange tax deferral strategy. It is also an excellent option for investors looking to diversify their real estate portfolio. The DST property ownership structure supports investors with less capital. It allows them to own a partial interest in a professionally managed, large, institutional-grade commercial property along with other investors, as individual owners within a Trust. Each owner is entitled to tax benefits, a percentage share of the cash flow income, and appreciation, if any, of the entire property. Advantages Create a valuable inheritance for your heirs If you wish to create a portfolio of revenue-generating hassle-free investments that will provide for your heirs long after your demise, a DST will be a great option. Similar to other 1031 exchange-qualified investments, your heirs will get a step-up in cost basis when they get your DST assets, and they will not inherit any previous deferred capital gains taxes. Portfolio diversification DST allows you to choose the amount you wish to invest, giving you the freedom to invest in multiple DST properties. Furthermore, you can diversify your real estate portfolio. Receive regular distributions Delaware Statutory Trusts are authorized to hold cash reserves in case the property demands repairs or faces unforeseen expenses. However, all proceeds and earnings above the reserve amounts must be distributed to the beneficiaries regularly and within the required time frame. A perfect backup plan for your 1031 exchange Delaware Statutory Trusts (""DSTs"") are a decent backup plan for 1031 exchange investors. DSTs guarantee that 100% of exchange funds are invested in a replacement property, and the investors defer capital gains taxes. Always ensure to identify a property within a DST as your third potential replacement property in the given 45 day identification period. If due to any reason you can’t acquire the first two properties, at least you won't end up paying taxes. DSTs satisfy 1031 exchange requirements, and you will be able to complete your exchange successfully. Even in the cases of boot, DSTs are a desirable option. Bottom line DST ownership option precisely extends the same advantages which an investor will welcome as a single large-scale investment property owner but includes no management responsibility. Every DST property asset is administered by property managers and professional investment real estate asset managers. DST turns out to be a lifesaver if you are unable to find suitable replacement properties with the specified 45-day identification period. If you are an investor and you wish to ensure that you earn maximum revenue out of your property, DST should be your first choice."

1,Does the license of a brokerage determine how worthwhile it is for traders?,finance," Forex brokers come in various shapes and sizes. All of them manage to diversify themselves through things such as maximum leverage, minimum spreads, depositing and withdrawing options as well as various other features that help them stand out. However, there is one feature a broker could have that would change their brand completely. It could potentially make or break their marketing campaign and spell the doom of the company as a whole. I’m talking about the financial regulatory license of course. Almost every country has a financial authority that is tasked with regulating and overseeing the operations of Forex, CFD, crypto and various other financial asset brokers. All of the countries have their take on what a Forex broker should look like which makes them a perfect way to filter through the options you may have as a customer. In this article, I’d like to discuss the indications of a broker’s competency-based on their regulatory license, which hopefully will be of use to you as a futures trader at some point. EU regulation EU regulation can be a bit more diverse. For example, most brokers that wish to access the financial markets of the European Union tend to get a license from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), or the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The only other alternatives they usually have is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which will allow them not only access to the EU market but the UK market as well. The least expected license from ""popular"" countries is BaFIN which is the regulator of Germany. But what do the licenses from these countries implicate about the company? Does it make them a lot more trustworthy and worth to trade with? Well, Yes and No. You see, whenever a broker is regulated by an EU-based regulator, they not only adhere to that specific country’s laws, but also the laws of the whole Union. This is facilitated through the regulation of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The ESMA has been criticized multiple times for having very harsh regulation, but at least they’re capable enough to not let any scammers go through their firewalls. In terms of trustworthiness, EU regulated brokers are some of the best ones to go for, but that does not necessarily make them the perfect brokers from a financial standpoint. You see, ESMA has some serious restrictions on the offering of CFDs, which are becoming seriously popular all over the world. EU regulated brokers can only offer leverage of 1:30 on FX CFD pairs and even lower ones on stocks and commodities. This makes them the least viable option for traders to go for as it inhibits their ability to generate a significant profit from a single trade. In defense of ESMA though, their regulation does help prevent any unnecessary risk. Another major benefit to security from ESMA regulated brokers is the segregation of customer funds from the company’s funds. What this means is that the bank that the broker is partnered up with, and where they have their corporate account, will create additional accounts for customers so that their funds are protected if the broker experiences some kind of technical difficulties or if it simply runs out of business. It’s the additional safety that this region offers to its traders. Offshore and non-EU licenses. An offshore license could mean pretty much anything that is not within a specific country. But in most cases, offshore regulators are represented by St.Vincent and the Grenadines, Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and various other nations across the world. However, the word offshore has received quite a bad reputation among Forex traders, but for good reasons. For example, it’s three times more likely for an offshore brokerage to be a scam rather than an EU regulated Forex broker. But, in contrast with EU brokers, offshore brokers don’t have to conform to very strict regulations on the services they offer to traders. For example, an offshore CFD broker does not have to limit their leverage on 1:30 and sometimes field even 1:700 or even higher. This gives them a little bit of an edge when compared to EU brokers, which entices veteran traders to trade security with profit. In most cases, it works out perfectly and the traders don’t have to face any kind of financial issues due to their choice of a company. One such example is the Georgian FX market, which is relatively new and small. However, the government there has taken full responsibility for regulating the brokers, thus allowing them to not only have a fairly decent offering to the locals as well as international clientele, but also a decent level of security in terms of rule of law and money laundering prevention in the country. Because of this, many Russian, Georgian and Armenian traders have transitioned from international brokers to local Georgian brokers in hopes to find better options than those that are available on EU brokers. Is there an ultimate version of a license? Most of the regulatory licenses are fairly similar when looking at them from a wider perspective. All of them feature AML and KYC rules which are simply undeniable from brokers, and all of them require local as well as foreign brokers to be compensated accordingly if a financial loss is the fault of the company. Other than that, the variation is usually noticeable in the maximum leverage, minimum deposit, and bank account segregation rules as well as the prices of a specific license. Many don’t know this but every license has a price. For example, a license from the UK’s FCA is much more expensive than a license from Vanuatu’s FSA, which is one of the reasons that brokers choose to be regulated offshore. In most cases, the trustworthiness of the broker is determined through their possession or non-possession of a legitimate license. So, if the broker has a license, they’re 90% likely to be legitimate, and if they don’t they’re 20% likely to be legitimate. The quality of the license could sometimes be according to their prices."

3,What Credit Score Will Get You A Mortgage?,finance," There are several levels of mortgages. You may have heard of ""subprime"" from the movie The Big Short. Subprime means exactly what it says....it's below optimal conditions and they charge higher interest rates to give you a loan. To be in the ""prime"" category, you will need at least a 660 FICO score to get a mortgage through a traditional lender. If you do find yourself in the subprime area, you can take either work on your credit score, or apply to the FHA for a loan. The FHA currently has a minimum score of at least 580 for the low downpayment of 3.5%. Anything below that, you will need to put 10% down, which can be a lot of cash for folks to come up with. Mortgage rates are tied to the ""Prime"" rate of the US. This is set by the government and has been at very low levels since the 2008 banking and housing crisis. That means, that money is ""cheaper"" to borrow, as the overall interest rates are lower for everyone. Therefore, if you are thinking about buying a home now can be a great time to buy IF your financials are in decent shape or your credit score is close to 660 and above. If you're thinking of buying a home soon but need to work on your credit a bit to get the best rates, contact us at Ascension Credit Services. We not only can help your credit, we work with several excellent mortgage lenders to get you the best rate possible."
4,5 Credit Hacks to Boost Your Credit Score Fast,finance," Cleaning up your credit can seem tough. Especially since you're busy and have other things to do. But the price of NOT addressing it is much higher for your long term financial health. Here are five of the best tips to make the most out of your time fixing your credit. If you debt has gone to a collector, they likely paid 15-20% of the original debt amount to take it over. And if it gets sold again to another collector, its likely they paid 20% of the amount the previous amount. Meaning if the original debt was $100, the first folks likely paid about $20 for it. The second collector likely paid about $5 for it. This means that if you offer say 30% of the original amount, $30 of the $100, most will take it. This is different from point number 1 in that you have to make sure the debt is reported as settled. Get this in writing. It does you little good to pay a debt, then have it hanging around. Be smarter than that. This goes for ALL payments. Rent, credit cards, phone bill, anything. Being late on these can be reported to credit check most folks haven't even heard of, and impact your future. Part of the known factors that go into a creditscore is the amount of your available credit you're using. A decent rule for this is to not go over 30-50% of your available credit. So, if you have $100 credit limit, please don;t go over $500. It can be hard to do, but it shows good habits and usually does help your credit score. As mentioned above, increasing your available credit can help your score...if you don't use it much or at all. If you've had a limit of $1000 and have been paying it on time or off monthly, your limit should be able to be increased fairly quickly. If you have your credit card with your bank, like Chase, they should be able to see factors other cards may not and be able to up your limit. Improving your credit is a big boost to your overall financial health. Follow the above steps to take your credit to the next level."
5,How The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Works For You,finance," Are debt collectors bugging you in the middle of dinner? Are old collections not helping your credit score? The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), protects consumers from abusive collection tactics. The Federal Trade Commission(FTC) says the most common violations are: Excessive calls or harassment, including calling their workplace. Collectors also lie and say they are an attorney or government agent. They are not. Collection for a disputed amount. The original debt needs to be verified and the amount you settle should be based on that. Collectors are notorious for trying to collect several times the original amount owed. Don't give in to this cheap tactic. Failure to notify (in writing) of a debt. Yes, in writing. It may seem quaint in the digital age, but these need to be in writing. The letter must say how mush is owed, to whom, and what you should do if you believe the debt is not actually yours. If any of the above things have happened to you in the US, the collectors are in violation of the rules the FTC has set forth and may be fined for their actions. It has happend in the past, so its not an idle threat. If you do have debts owed and want to clean up your credit, contact us at Ascension Credit Services. We can help you ghet back on track!"
6,The Different Kinds of Universal Life Insurance,finance," Universal life insurance is a type of insurance that combines a more traditional policy with an investment/savings feature. You pay your premium, which then gets divided between the two (based on the terms established at the outset of the policy) aspects of the insurance. So, part of your premium will cover the insurance payment and the other part will go into the savings account feature – also referred to as the cash value or the investment portion. Because the cash value portion of the policy is typically used to make investments, and therefore provide dividends and grow the cash value itself, these types of policies can be very lucrative to the right buyer. As with all types of insurance, some are better suited for you than others, and universal life is no different. But you must admit, an insurance policy that doubles as a saving account is a pretty cool idea, and when your savings, or a portion of it, is out of sight and out of mind, it’s easy to just let it build up. Universal life insurance is further broken down into additional categories, or types, that allow buyers to access the best type of universal coverage for their particular situation, financial goals and risk-averseness. Type of Universal Life Insurance: Indexed A stock market index is used to measure how the market is fairing. You have probably heard of the NASDAQ and the DOW JONES. These are indexes. When you purchase an indexed universal life insurance policy, the investment portion of your policy is linked to an index, such as these, but not necessarily these exact ones – there are others! This version of the policy is great for people who are comfortable with the inherent risk that comes with the stock market, so if you are risk-averse then this isn’t the type of policy for you. But, with greater risk comes greater rewards, so that is something to think about. Variable Variable universal life insurance is similar to indexed because its stock related, but you aren’t riding an index here. Variable types invest your cash value in mutual funds. Mutual funds are considered safer investments because it spreads your cash value around, allowing you to invest in multiple companies. This is less risky because you aren’t putting all of your eggs in one basket. If one of the companies you’re invested in does poorly and you lose money, you still have value invested in other companies who might be faring better and therefore, make up the difference. Traditional or Guaranteed This policy option is not tied to the stock market at all and is therefore low-risk. Your premium gets split up, your insurance is paid and your cash value is your cash value. Although your cash value builds up much more slowly in this type of universal life policy, you are still building wealth and you don’t have to worry about the safety of your savings. Learn More If you are considering or interested in learning more about this type of insurance, you should speak to an insurance broker rather than directly with an insurance company. A direct agent can only sell the products of one brand. Brokers are independent and can compare various products from various providers to help find the policy you need. Universal life insurance quotes will be available to you through a broker, and because this type of insurance has scalable premiums (based on how much insurance you want and how much cash value you want to build) you can certainly find something within your budget."

9,Cryptocurrency vs. Traditional Finance Instruments (for an investor),finance," Cryptocurrencies in the recent times have risen as an appealing investment option. Veteran crypto trader Glenn Goodman considers the rise of virtual cash as a ""once-in an era"" opportunity. He further adds that ‘individuals should ""grab it with both hands.""’ But does not miss on to warning you by saying, like the reward, the risks are also greater while investing. A majority of investors are usually risk-averse in their investments.They prefer to invest in the cryptocurrency trading platform that can give them the maximum benefits at zero or minimal loss. For them, traditional financial instruments are a no-loss safe investment, but when it comes to digital currencies, they have apprehensions. However, lately, investors have started to rush to the digital currency market, shedding their underlying scorn. In a recent study by Grayscale Investments and Q8 Research, 40 percent of the respondents out of the 1,100 U.S. - based investors survey indicated enthusiasm for owning Bitcoin. Let us discuss the comparison between cryptocurrency(Bitcoin) and traditional financial instruments (shares and bonds) and comprehend their advantages and disadvantages. Stocks, Bonds versus Bitcoin Bonds resemble a fixed-income loan that an investor provides to an organization or to the government; though investing into stocks gives investors shares in a public-traded company. At the point when investors invest into Bitcoin, they become owners of virtual coins, which are free of central bank control. Dissimilar to the peer-to-peer transactionof digital coins, there are some administrative authorities that oversee the investment in stocks and bonds. Investors can sell their bitcoins to third party for cash or for an equivalent value in goods or services. Bonds can be reclaimed at the time of development, where the investors get the par value of the security. Also, about the share they own, the investors can sell or transfer the shares at the market price. If the market is good selling would bring them profit, if not, then loss. Unstable Asset Class Both bitcoins and shares fall under volatile or unstable asset class as the variance in their respective markets decides their value. Bonds are generally stable assets, and thus, they will in general gain lower returns. Bitcoins are more volatile than shares as the digital currency market is still developing. If on one hand stock markets are well-established financial institutions controlled by regulatory authorities, on the other there are no regulatory authorities to control cryptocurrency exchanges. However, in a couple of years when the cryptocurrency exchange market develops, the volatility of the bitcoin may reduce proportionately to the number of organizations trading on stock exchanges. In October 2018, Cboe Global Market had noticed that the 20-day historical instability of bitcoin had fallen to 31.5 percent, beneath that of Amazon.com (35 %), Netflix (52 percent), and Nvidia Corp (40 percent). It additionally saw that the bitcoin's cost was as stable as Apple stock. Return on Investment The interests earned on bonds are exceptionally low. Interestingly, the risk-offs out shines equities when markets go astray. Nonetheless, when the market is bullish, investors can win a great return on their investment. Bitcoin can give its investors a whopping ""2000 percent yearly return."" Loses are similarly enormous if the market is going through a dramatic up and down. Conclusion: As ICOs are slowing down in the cryptocurrency exchange market, it is quite clear that start-ups are deliberately looking for some new approaches to raise their capital. Also, the investors too are looking out for new ways to protect and grow their assets. Believe it or not, cryptocurrencies have gradually found acceptance almost all over the world in the recent years."
10,Is Medical Marijuana Covered by Insurance in Canada?,finance," Medical marijuana can help relieve the symptoms of a number of health conditions. It is known for its ability to relieve pain, nausea, muscle spasms, anxiety and mood regulation, insomnia, low appetite, autism, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy (and other seizures), immune function, and neuroplasticity. Because of the unique range of symptoms it can provide relief for, it is often sought by those who suffer from conditions that are difficult to diagnose and treat, like fibromyalgia and anorexia, and it can even help with the symptoms associated with chemotherapy. But is medical marijuana covered by insurance in Canada for those who need it? First, let’s clear up a couple of misconceptions about medical marijuana. Medical marijuana isn’t quite the same thing as recreational marijuana. Both are plant-based, derived from the Cannabis Sativa or Cannabis Indica species, and both have three major active ingredients: THC, CBD, and CBN. Medical marijuana is used under the guidance and authorization of a medical practitioner in order to alleviate the symptoms of a health condition, and it is formulated differently than the kind of marijuana that is used for recreation. Medical marijuana contains higher concentrations of CBD (cannabidiol), which offers medical qualities, and lower concentrations of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which produces the ""high"" feeling associated with recreational cannabis. In other words, those who are prescribed medical marijuana are benefitting from its medicinal characteristics rather than its mind-altering characteristics, but does that mean they can get their medical marijuana covered by insurance in Canada? How to get coverage for medical marijuana in Canada Medical grade cannabis is eligible for Revenue Canada’s Medical Expense Tax Credit, so you can claim medical cannabis and its related expenses on your tax return—you just need to have your prescription and receipts from an approved producer with a Health Canada license. The tax credit, however, may not be your only form of assistance. Your medical marijuana may also be covered by your Canadian insurance plan. Medical marijuana coverage is still relatively new because the potentially high costs present a higher risk to insurance providers, so not every insurance plan in Canada is going to provide coverage. There are some insurance providers, however, who are starting to provide medical marijuana insurance coverage under Canadian workplace benefits packages. Sun Life Financial is on such provider. Sun Life’s insurance plan requires employers to pay a premium, and in exchange it will provide coverage for medical cannabis through its workplace benefits plan provided the employee is suffering from one of the outlined medical conditions. What are the eligibility requirements for medical marijuana insurance coverage in Canada? Medical marijuana insurance is only available through select insurance providers if it is being used to treat the symptoms of a few specific medical conditions. This caveat is in place to help the insurance providers mitigate some of the risk associated with the high costs of medical cannabis. It is often more costly than established pharmaceutical medications, and there isn’t always strong evidence pointing to the efficacy of its use to treat the symptoms of the condition. Coverage is therefore provided for the conditions and symptoms for which there is clear clinical evidence that the use of medical cannabis can offer enough of a benefit to outweigh its risk. Sun Life insurance currently provides medical marijuana coverage for: severe pain, nausea, and vomiting that is associated with cancer and cancer treatments spasticity or neuropathic pain resulting from multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis (only as a last resort to other forms of treatment) neuropathic pain resulting from HIV/AIDS anorexia palliative care"
11,Life Insurance that has a Cash Value – Why it’s Worth Considering,finance," Summary: If you’re looking to create an estate or ensure your beneficiaries will receive a benefit no matter when you die, whole life insurance with cash value may be the right choice for you. Blog Body: Life insurance is an important and valuable product as it protects your loved ones in the event of your death. It can replace your family income when resources are limited, allowing your loved ones to maintain their quality of life. It also can be used to cover your mortgage and personal loans, financial obligations your family may not be able to assume. According to the Canadian Health and Life Insurance Association, 22 million Canadians owned $4.7 trillion in life insurance in 2018. That represents approximately 60 per cent of the country’s population and works out to an average of $417,000 per household. While that may seem like a lot, insurance experts actually believe that Canadians are underinsured. It’s important to discuss your life insurance options with an insurance broker. Depending on your personal long-term financial goals, a permanent life insurance policy with cash value may be the best option, as it has a cash value that you can leverage. What is permanent cash value life insurance? Unlike term life insurance that lasts for a specific, pre-set period of time, permanent life insurance with cash value lasts your entire lifetime. It’s comparable to building equity in your home as it grows over time and you can borrow directly against it or use it as collateral for a loan. You can also withdraw your cash value, but this will usually reduce your death benefit. Permanent life insurance with cash value offers two options: whole life and universal life insurance options. Differences between whole life and universal life insurance While both whole life and universal life insurance policies are considered permanent life insurance with cash value, whole life policies have a fixed premium, meaning you pay the same amount each and every year for your coverage. Much like universal life insurance, whole life has the potential to accumulate cash value over time, creating an amount that you may be able to borrow against. Universal life insurance policies offer flexible premiums that may allow you to adjust how much you'll pay each year by accessing some of the policy's cash value, although you will need to pay the minimum premium amount or the policy will lapse. Depending on your policy's potential cash value, it may be used to skip a premium payment, or left untouched with the potential to accumulate value over time. Why you should consider life insurance with cash value Life insurance serves a variety of purposes, with the main purpose being income replacement. Many policyholders, however, tap into cash value life insurance for other reasons such as saving for retirement or paying for their child’s post-secondary education. Life insurance policies with cash value provide both a death benefit and cash value accumulation during the policyholder’s lifetime. With cash value policies, policyholders can use the cash value in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to: A tax-sheltered investment; A means to pay policy premiums later in life; A benefit to pass on to their beneficiaries. Is cash value life insurance right for you? If you’re thinking of purchasing life insurance, it’s important to consult with an insurance broker who can guide you through the process and make recommendations, based on your situation and long-term goals. But if you’re someone who likes to prepare for the future and wants a guarantee that life insurance coverage lasts for the as long as you live, then permanent life insurance with cash value may be a good option for you. This type of insurance is guaranteed for as long as you live, provided that you maintain the required payments. As well, you’ll have peace of mind knowing your premiums will stay the same, regardless of age or changing health status. Ultimately, the type of life insurance policy you buy will depend on your financial goals. If you need life insurance for a limited number of years, then term life insurance may be a good option."
12,What are CAP rates (and why should I care)?,finance," Commercial real estate owners and buyers are always confronted with the same question: ""How do I determine the value of a commercial real estate property?""  Homeowners and homebuyers rely on the market data approach which simply looks at comparable sales in the market to determine value.  Commercial properties rely more heavily on the income approach or the income capitalization method to determining value.  The income approach requires an understanding of CAP rates or capitalization rates. In order to begin the analysis, we need to determine the net operating income of the subject property.  The NOI is defined as the net cash flow of the property and is determined by taking the gross income and subtracting the operating expenses.  Gross income includes rents, common charges, parking income, and all other income sources.  Operating expenses are all of the costs associated with running the property, and include: vacancy allowance, management fees, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, etc.  The bottom line figure is the net operating income or net cash flow.  This NOI figure is what we will use to determine property value. Investors have many options when it comes to investing their money.  They could deposit their funds in a bank account and these days earn 1-2% return on their money.  They could buy stocks and bonds with the hope of earning higher (but uncertain) returns.  Many choose to invest in real estate instead.  Let’s say an investor wants to earn a 5% return on his money and buys a property that generates annual NOI of $50,000.  That 5% return on investment is defined as the CAP rate.  In this case, the property would need to sell for $1,000,000 to yield $50,000/year at 5% return ($1,000,000 times 5% equals $50,000.  If the investor demanded a 6% return on his investment, the property would need to sell for $833,333 ($833,333 times 6% equals $50,000).  From this basic example you can see that a property value will change based on the rate that an investor will expect to earn on his investment.  In times when bank interest rates are high, real estate prices generally go down, as investors will expect to earn returns that exceed bank deposits.  When bank interest rates are low, real estate prices typically increase, as investors are willing to earn a lower return on their real estate investments. Since September 2018, we have been seeing an increase in market interest rates.  If this continues and rates continue to rise, we could expect to see downward pressure on commercial real estate prices."

15,Why Prescription Drugs Are an Issue in Canada,finance," Canada is often touted as having one of the best health care systems in the world because of its universal health care model. There is, however, a major flaw in our system. Our universal health care system does not cover some essential medications. This flaw affects, in particular, vulnerable groups of Canadians who face challenges related to prescription drugs. These challenges, aka ""the gap,"" can be divided into two groups: uninsured and underinsured. Who belongs to the vulnerable population? Vulnerable populations include patients who are racial or ethnic minorities, children, elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged, underinsured or those with certain medical conditions. The gap The gap is essentially due to two main factors/elements: Canadians who do not have any form of whole life insurance that includes drug coverage (uninsured), and Canadians who have some form of whole life insurance that includes drug coverage, but still face financial challenges affecting their ability to access the necessary drugs needed to stay healthy (underinsured). In fact, one in 10 Canadians is unable to afford prescription drugs, which is not surprising considering Canada has higher prescription medication list prices than most other countries in the world. According to the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, access to prescription drug coverage in Canada is a mix between public prescription drug plans and private insurance plans. Public plans vary across provinces in terms of eligibility, affordability, and which drugs are covered. How many Canadians are uninsured? Data from a recent report by the Conference Board of Canada reveals approximately 5.2 per cent of Canadians are uninsured, mainly individuals in Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador. This means that these individuals are not eligible for public prescription drug insurance, nor are they enrolled in a private insurance plan. However, the report also mentions that the percentage of uninsured Canadians decreased to approximately 1.8 per cent in January 2018, due to the introduction of the expanded Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). Even more alarming, there are more than four million Canadians that are eligible for either public or private life insurance with drug plan coverage but are not enrolled. Of surveyed Canadians who did not take their medications as prescribed, 54 per cent were not aware, and 3 per cent were unsure if there were public drug programs to help pay for prescription drugs. Underinsured Canadians While many Canadians may be fortunate enough to be enrolled in a public or private drug plan, there still exists the possibility of out-of-pocket expenses due to premiums, deductibles or co-payments, and even annual or lifetime caps. Depending on the plan itself, these out-of-pocket expenses can result in an individual not being able to afford the necessary prescription medications needed to stay healthy. The Canadian Health Policy Institute reported that the majority of the financial challenges faced by Canadians related to drug coverage were a result of underinsurance within existing public drug plans. Drug plans across Canada According to the Government of Canada, each provincial and territorial government offers a drug benefit plan for eligible groups. Some are income-based universal programs, and most have specific programs for population groups that may require more enhanced coverage for high drug costs. These groups include seniors, recipients of social assistance, and individuals with diseases or conditions that are associated with high drug costs. Albertans, in particular, are fortunate in that the province offers several drug plans to accommodate different situations. From the Alberta Adult Health Benefit to Seniors Health Benefits to Specialized Drug Benefits, Albertans are encouraged to educate themselves and find out what drug plan coverages they may qualify for. The Fraser Institute published an article in October 2018 and outlined that in Alberta, families (with children) earning less than $39,250 can access the province’s non-group coverage plan by paying a monthly premium of $82.60. Prescription drugs covered under the program are subject to a 30 per cent co-payment up to a maximum of $25 per prescription. Higher-income families in Alberta can also access this program but with higher pre¬miums. Lower-income Alberta families, as well as a number of additional covered circumstances such as pregnancy, high ongoing prescription needs, and disability, are exempted from premiums and any co-payments for many prescription drugs as well as some over-the-counter products. For example, a single parent with one child in Alberta with an income less than approximately $26,000 would be exempt from the premium and co-pays under the Adult Health Benefit. What does all this mean? All in all, data supports that out of the total population of nearly 36.3 million people, over 13.1 million Canadians were covered under a public drug plan and nearly 23.2 million Canadians were covered under a private drug plan."
16,Secondary Beneficiary on a Term Life insurance Policy – What Does This Mean?,finance," Looking at term life insurance quotes and not sure what they mean about a secondary beneficiary? Don’t worry, this article will help! Naming a beneficiary is a big decision, so it’s important to have all the information you need. What is a Beneficiary? A beneficiary under a term life insurance policy is the person you identify in your policy to whom the death benefit proceeds are payable. Policyholders can name multiple beneficiaries, and the proceeds among them. Naming a beneficiary ensures that, in the event of your passing, your loved ones will be taken care of. There are multiple advantages to naming a beneficiary. For example, in the event of your death, the beneficiary or beneficiaries you name will receive the proceeds from your term life insurance policy without the benefit having to pass through probate. Your beneficiary will receive the proceeds quickly (within 30 days of proof of death by law) and won’t have to go through extra legal proceedings. Beneficiaries are also creditor protected, and other parties cannot dispute the life insurance policy in the same way that a will can be contested. That means that the person(s) you decide will receive the proceeds of your policy without having to deal with your creditors or family members that feel they should have received the money. What is a Secondary Beneficiary? A secondary beneficiary, or contingent beneficiary, is the person you name who receives the proceeds of your life insurance policy in the event that the primary beneficiary dies. It’s highly recommended that a second beneficiary is named on all life insurance policies to mitigate worst case scenarios.  If your primary beneficiary dies before you, the risk of your assets going somewhere or to someone unintended is much higher.  By naming a secondary beneficiary, you can reduce this risk. What are Mistakes People Make When Naming a Beneficiary? Naming a beneficiary is a big decision, so it’s important to know the most common mistakes people make in this area. Here are the top five mistakes people make when naming a beneficiary: Failing to Name a Beneficiary: The biggest mistake people make is forgetting or simply not bothering to name a beneficiary. If you don’t name a beneficiary on your investments and life insurance policies, your assets could go through probate upon your death and face tax consequences that could otherwise easily be avoided. Naming minors: It’s highly recommended that instead of naming your minor children as beneficiaries, you set up a trust for them instead. That removes the risk that a judge will decide who manages the money. Failing to recognize tax consequences: Estate tax differs from province to province, so it’s critical that you consult with an experienced and professional tax advisor to avoid any unnecessary taxation before you name a beneficiary. Failing to name a secondary beneficiary: If you name only one beneficiary, and this beneficiary dies before you, the distribution of your assets may be decided by a judge. Always name a secondary beneficiary to avoid this risk. Failing to update your beneficiaries: Life changes. Make sure that you remember to update your beneficiaries every time you go through a major life change. For example, if you are divorced, you may not want your ex-spouse to receive your term life insurance proceeds. Remembering to update your beneficiaries means that your proceeds will go to the person you intended."
17,When Should You Visit an Oregon Credit Union?,finance," When you join an Oregon credit union, you are not considered a client. You are something more – a member of a community. There are a few essential situations in which you could truly benefit from the services Oregon credit unions have to offer. Learn more about your options before making a decision regarding which lender is better for you. Despite the general opinion which makes you believe banks are your only choice, you should know that Oregon credit unions can offer you many more advantages. It is all a matter of perspective. Do you want to be stuck paying fees for services you don’t need? Do you want to pay high interest rates for the next two or more decades of your life? Do you want to feel as if your opinion does not matter? If the answer to all of these questions is no, then it might be time to look into other lenders. One of the situations in which you could benefit from the assistance of proper financial consultants would be when you are ready to purchase your first residence. It does not really matter if you have your eyes on a house or on a flat. At the end of the day, you will have to find the resources for the home of your dreams. What you should do first is learn how much you can afford to pay for that house. If you begin looking for the right one before you learn what sort of loan you can get, you might be setting yourself up for disappointment. That is why it would be recommended that you talk to one of the consultants from the right Oregon credit union so that you can learn more about your credit score and the kind of loan that they will approve. It is interesting to keep in mind that when you rely on a bank, the situation is even more complicated because they usually have stricter policies. If your credit score is not that great, they will tell you that they can’t help you. But with credit unions, the situation is not that dire. Even if you would need to improve your score, they can offer you useful advice on how to do it in the shortest time possible. Another moment when you should consider opting for the help of a financial consultant from the right lender is when you want to buy a car. It does not matter if you have one that you would like to sell or if you are trying to invest in your first vehicle ever. The right professional will give you the answers and guidance that you require. Again, you would need to find out more about what you can afford before you go to a dealership and take a look at what sort of vehicles they have for you. If you are looking to sell your old car and take out a smaller loan for your new one, then you can skip the credit score check and just opt for it when you are certain about the kind of vehicle you would like to purchase. Either way, it is important to ensure that your monthly payments will be affordable, regardless if you need to make them for the next few months or the next couple of years. If you are thinking about the future and would like to open a savings account, the same consultant can offer you guidance in this matter as well. At this moment, it would be a good idea to think about your plans for the future and take a closer look at your finances. Do your own research online regarding the various lenders that can help you and when you feel certain you have found the top ones, get in touch with them and find out more about their approach regarding financial situations like yours."
18,How Assisted Death is Different From Euthanasia and its Impact on Life Insurance,finance," Medically assisted death became law in Canada in 2016 and has changed how people can navigate their final days. After they have passed on, however, many families are discovering that the life insurance policy the person had may not be paid out. To avoid this in your future, it is important to understand medically assisted death and euthanasia, and how these affect life insurance policies. Today we will discuss the key points that you need to know. The Difference Between Assisted Death and Euthanasia First, let’s discuss the difference between assisted death and euthanasia because these terms mean different things, and they can each impact life insurance policies and payouts. ""Assisted death,"" according to Beneplan, ""is suicide by a patient facilitated by means or information (as a drug prescription or indication of the lethal dosage) provided by a physician aware of the patient’s intent. In these scenarios, the patient is in full control of the process and self-administers the substance(s)."" ""Euthanasia,"" by contrast, is ""the intentional putting to death of a person with an incurable or painful disease intended as an act of mercy."" Euthanasia specifically comes in six different types: Active: a person directly and deliberately causes the patient's death. Passive: essentially, someone is allowed to die. Usually, this is caused by withdrawing or withholding treatment. Voluntary: when a person requests that they die. Non-voluntary: when the decision is made on behalf of a person, usually because the person is otherwise incapable of making a meaningful choice between living and dying. Indirect: this usually means giving treatment that has a side effect of speeding up the death process, usually through pain medication. Direct: this form involves a direct means of assisting death, usually through a fatal dose of drugs. In Canada, this can take two forms: a drug administered by a physician or a prescription that the person takes themselves. While euthanasia comes in many forms, assisted death is very clearly defined in Canada, has numerous safeguards and can only be enacted in very specific situations. Hence the difference between the two; and, when it comes to life insurance policies, this difference is very important. The Impact on Life Insurance For the purposes of a life insurance policy, it is important to note that almost every policy in existence has a suicide exclusion clause, a special clause that either changes or voids the policy if suicide is the cause of death. This is in place to prevent people from committing suicide to give insurance money to their loved ones. That said, as the bill allowing medically assisted death became law, more and more life insurance companies decided that the suicide exemption did not apply. However, the circumstances must be very specific, just as they are for the conditions under which a medically assisted death can occur. To be eligible, the person receiving the medically assisted death must meet all of the following criteria: Be eligible for health services in Canada that are paid for with public funds Be the age of majority Capable of making decisions with respect to their health Have a grievous and irremediable medical condition, psychological issue, or disability Natural death has become foreseeable and reasonable and takes into account all of the person’s medical circumstances. A specific time does not have to be outlined Have requested medical assistance in dying voluntarily and in good faith without any external pressure Provide informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying If all of these circumstances are met, then some insurance policies will pay out and ignore the suicide exemption."

People have different requirements when it comes to managing their finances; some are interested in lower fees while others prefer paying a higher fee but benefiting from convenience and the latest technology.

1,Tax Return Makeovers By Kenya Woodard,finance," January 1 means more than the start of a new year. It’s also a countdown until the end of the month when employers are mandated to send out tax forms so employees can file for their returns. That windfall of money offers a nice influx of cash that goes toward paying down debt (30 percent) or savings and investment accounts (28 percent), according to a survey by Bankrate.com. The average tax return in Florida is roughly $2,877, not far off from the national average of $2,895, according to Business Insider. If you’re looking to use those dollars to spruce up your home, you might come up short: HomeAdvisor.com reports that the average home improvement project cost around $6,649. But fear not! Below are some recommended upgrades that won’t break your budget: Bathroom makeover. The busiest room in the house can look worn down over time. Fixtures fade, the mirror cracks, and grout’s stained. A quick trip to the hardware store can make the difference between a rundown commode and one that’s showroom new. Replace the faucet handles and purchase new shower accessories for fast changes. If you’re feeling adventurous, try replacing the tile or install a new sink. Kitchen makeover. The possibilities are endless – and cheap – in this room. Like the bathroom, try switching out the faucet handles or replacing the backsplash, or installing new flooring. Or maybe it’s time to replace some appliances. Sometimes a new stove or mixer can spruce up the kitchen. But if you really want to transform this space, try replacing or repainting cabinets. Or brighten up the walls with a fresh coat of white or yellow paint. Living room. New flooring can be installed relatively cheaply here. If the furniture is a bit rundown, try slipping on covers and throw blankets for a like-new feel. Rebricking or paneling over the fireplace – the centerpiece of the room – can add an instant and highly visible improvement. Install new window blinds, paint a feature wall, or transform a corner into a cozy reading nook also are easy changes. Bedroom makeover. If the room dedicated to sleep and comfort looks like anything but in your house, a few easy fixes include painting a feature wall, changing out the blinds, or adding a new bedspread. But if you want to step it up, try installing a new closet layout, creating a new bed frame, or upgrading the ceiling fan. Patio. Perhaps the biggest change you can make in this area is adding a gazebo. But don’t stop there! A new patio set works nicely here too, as does new lighting, and a new grill. If you really want to go all out, try some light re-landscaping including sodding or seeding patchy areas of grass, adding lighted pathways, and planting bushes and shrubbery. Of course, if you need assistance with any of the above projects, visit J Edwards Construction Grup at www.jedwardsconstruction.net or call us at (727) 263-0789 and speak with someone today about your home improvement needs."
2,Why have all crypto tax attempts failed?,finance," Government all over the world are considering the regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies as we speak. Naturally, those who have already implemented it have provided a crypto tax legislation alongside it, but it seems like none of these tactics are working. The government is responsible for imposing regulation on any financial service so that it doesn’t damage the investors themselves. In that aspect, nearly all of them have succeeded at some point, as fewer and fewer people are becoming victims of crypto scams. However, it seems like none of them was able to hit the mark with crypto tax regulations, as more and more traders find ways to avoid it. This is largely due to the regulations not being compatible with a decentralized asset such as cryptos. Why are people avoiding tax? In most cases, you’ll find arguments from the investors, saying that cryptocurrencies are not officially recognized as money or a financial asset, therefore paying capital gain on it does not make sense. At some point, they are right. An item that is not classified as a source of income or a tradeable asset usually does not have any tax assigned to it. The only thing we can think of is the car tax that most European states have. Another reason is that people simply don’t understand how to include Bitcoin profits on their capital gain reports. Due to a lack of guidelines, many simply ignore it and just don’t cash out their profits. And the last reason is greed. Naturally, if somebody is presented with an option to avoid taxes and get away with it, they will take it. And the government’s imposed regulation does nothing to prevent it. Most of the legislation is focused on the responsibility of the citizens themselves and not the companies, which provides this scapegoat for the crypto trader to simply not report his gains. What do crypto tax laws look like? There are two types of crypto tax law that the governments enforce. It is the civic responsibility and corporate responsibility modules. The civic responsibility module depends on the goodwill of the citizen themselves and hopes that they will voluntarily report their capital gain on cryptocurrencies. Naturally, most people simply don’t do this as they don’t cash it out. Actually, not cashing out the cryptocurrency helps it remain in the ""untaxable"" framework, thanks to the non-tradeable asset classification it has in numerous countries. As long as traders keep their cryptos on a wallet, they can’t be taxed on any gains. The corporate responsibility module is directed towards the companies offering crypto services. These could be any crypto mining company or a cryptocurrency exchange. The government simply relies on these companies to report the trading activities of their customers, so that sufficient tax could be calculated. But there is a serious issue with this framework. It only touches the local companies and not foreign ones. How people avoid crypto tax In the case of the civic responsibility module, many people simply don’t report or cash out their profits, as already mentioned. But a new trend has been on the rise lately when crypto investors simply divert their funds to a traditional financial company. For example, some Forex and CFD brokerages have started to accept crypto deposits. This is usually used as a liquidity provider platform. The investors deposit their funds on the brokerage, then simply withdraw it on an eWallet, and then finally cash it out at a relevant ATM. In fact, if we look at some broker reviews, we’ll see that nearly 10% of the brokers’ customers choose to deposit in crypto. This could be an indication that crypto traders are simply trying to diversify, but it could also be accounted to the tax evasion mechanisms. When it comes to the corporate responsibility module, the traders have a much easier time. They simply don’t use the local companies. That’s why we see so many US citizens avoid Coinbase and go for exchanges like OKEx or Binance. Not having their funds on a local exchange, means that their trading habits cannot be reported and documented legally. Once they’re ready to cash out, they go through the same process as they’d go with the civic responsibility module. What can be done about this? There is no clear vision about a strategy to reduce the number of investors avoiding cryptocurrency taxes. The only real example of this is in South Korea, but the regulation there is so strict, that the whole essence of cryptocurrencies is sacrificed for the sole reason of taxation. In South Korea, investors are forced to use IDs to clarify their taxes. Anonymous transactions are illegal, which means that any attempts of making such payment will expose the trader. Another way the government can handle the cryptocurrency tax regulation is to simply get rid of it. Yes, that’s right. The best way to deal with a cryptocurrency tax is to remove it from the regulatory framework completely. Here’s why. There should be no tax The current legislation for crypto tax is not effective at all. The government is lucky if they get at least 40% or 50% of the intended amount in taxes. This means that the resources they use for imposing such regulation are being wasted on just half of the results expected from the project. Improving the process would require even more resources such as funds and manpower, and at that point, even a 100% gain will not be enough to cover it all. The best way the government to handle this is to allow the traders to enjoy their capital gain. When a country’s citizen has more money to spend, they’re more likely to spend it locally. They’re more likely to invest and strengthen the local economy. Local companies are likely to increase their sales because there is more money available for the customer base. This is known as consumer purchasing power. The more power the consumer has, the more likely it is that they will either invest it somewhere or support a startup or an already established company. Thanks to the increase in sales, the companies grow, which means that they start paying more in taxes to the government. So, in the end, those tax that was intended on crypto capital gain, still go back to the government, and in this case, they get the whole deal, they collect 100% of it. So by simply removing the legislation, we get a more liberal market, more purchasing power for the local consumer, larger companies with a better growth factor, a more reliable stream of revenue tax, decreased costs because a new commission is not required. The only problem that this could cause is that Forex and stocks traders can complain about their taxes, and that’s why governments are reluctant to implement it. But the thing is that removing taxes on those tradeable assets will also boost the economy. Overall, the best solution for the crypto tax evasions is the removal of the tax policy completely."

4,The Hidden Secrets of Consulting Companies in Toronto,finance," Is your company looking into starting a new large project and considering hiring a consulting firm to assist? There are many consulting firms in Toronto and around the world, so you need to know how to choose the right firm that is going to fit your project’s needs. Many firms will boast expertise, skills, industry knowledge, customer satisfaction and project success, but with so many options you need to narrow down your list of consulting companies in Toronto to hire to a firm whose approaches, methodologies and provided roles are going to sync well with your needs. The Toronto consulting firms’ market is highly fragmented; there are a large number of independent consultants to choose from, but also large global strategy consulting firms. It may be difficult to choose the right company for your project, as they vary in size, options, and expertise. There are consulting firms that specialize in just information technology, or just management consulting. With many options, you can pick and choose exactly what the project needs but first, learn a few secrets that will help you choose the ideal company. Hidden Secrets of Consulting Companies Secret 1: Distracting Sales Terms Do not get caught up in superlative terms when considering management consulting firms; everybody is the ""best."" When you visit their website, ignore words like ""best,"" ""industry leader,"" etc. These words are self-promotional sales fluff. If a company uses them too often, especially without examples why they are the best, this can be a red flag. Secret 2: Availability of Top Tier Partners Every company has great teams working with them; will their best teams be working on your project if you hire the company? Find out who their top people are and find out if they will be available for you. Secret 3: Not Having Something for Everyone When looking at consulting companies in Toronto, you need one that has the appropriate strengths. Consulting companies with high quality teams have high expenses, which means sometimes they take projects that aren’t exactly their strength as fillers during low times to reach sales quotas. You need to understand the company’s strengths, which you’ll mostly likely find on their website. Choose a company that has the expertise you need. That being said, there is also a downside to hiring management consulting firms that are actual industry leaders – they are expensive. If you are a small company, you may not be able to afford them. In this case you should still seek out the best Toronto Consulting Firm, but choose one that has experience working with small businesses, startups and entrepreneurs – and one that tailors a package of services for this market. Choosing the Best Firm For Your Needs With the knowledge of some hidden secrets, how do you choose which consulting companies in Toronto are right for your project? Ask yourself, do they have a wide range of competencies? Are they mainly in the area of markets and products? Do they specialize in one area? Are they a company that is involved in management consulting, such as The Burnie Group in Toronto? Don’t go to the company with the narrowest specialization if your project may involve aspects from multiple markets or industries. What services does the consulting company you hire offer? If they aren’t going to be handling the entire project, they may outsource parts to another company themselves, resulting in loss of control of certain project areas. Alternatively, your company may end up hiring a second consulting firm to fill in the gaps, or to finish specific stages of the project. Find out the history of the consulting firm, what industries have they worked in, and which markets they operate in. You can ask for references to companies that have hired them before to find out how well the firm performed in the aspects of quality, communication skills, flexibility and overall satisfaction. Also discover where they currently operate or have operated in the world in the past. There are a variety of markets in the world, so you want a firm with experience where your project is based. In business, communication is key. How will the consulting firm be communicating with you, and how will they delegate responsibilities internally? Single points of communication allow for feedback to be properly redistributed within the consulting firm to the appropriate teams. A project manager is an asset as they will be able to supervise all the teams involved, and siphon information to you, the client, about every aspect of the project, and inform about any risks. With all the information about the consulting firms in Toronto gathered, you can make an informed decision about whether their price value will be right for your project. You can choose an established company for their reputation, brand and experience; or choose a cost-effective smaller company for their attention and diligence to your project, out-of-the-box thinking, and increased flexibility for the project’s scope."
5,Real Estate Outlook May 2019,finance," Los Angeles, CA. Our economy is losing steam. Economic growth is expected to slow to the 2% to 2.5% range this year, from nearly 3% in 2018. Factors contributing to this include vanishing fiscal stimulus, the impact of tighter monetary policy  and the affects of trade with China  which could  result in a deceleration in  real estate values. Economic growth for the first quarter in particular will be weak due to the impact of the government shutdown at the beginning of the year. With the tight labor market and some tax refunds, private consumption should  remain the growth engine that will help real estate investments in the months ahead. Despite a relatively tight labor market, inflation pressures are projected to remain restrained. The current capacity utilization has reached 78%. It is around four percentage points below the long-term average. We now expect the fed funds rate to be maintained at  current level for the near future, thereby stabilizing the relatively high hurdles in the real estate investment markets. As we do not foresee a severe downturn or even a recession, we are keeping a middle-of-the-road provision to real estate investments. However, as we cannot rule out further political and economic setbacks, we are maintaining our preference for a more ""hold"" position based on our publication ""Market Cycles"". However, on the question of which real estate investment offers the strongest potential, we continue to hold a small allowance to midsize apartment investments.  They appear not to be expensive, at least given the expectations of earnings growth of around 7%, according to the cyclically adjusted projected capitalization rates. On the other hand, as a further deceleration in the economic expansion cannot be ruled out, and due to the mix of concerns and uncertainties, we caution real estate investors to keep a very close look at all real estate markets. According to PwC Real Estate 2020: ""Building the future"", looking forward to 2020 and beyond, the real estate investment industry will find itself at the centre of rapid economic and social change, which is transforming the built environment. While most of these trends are already evident, there is a natural tendency to underestimate their implications over the next six years and beyond. By 2020, real estate managers will have a broader range of opportunities, with greater risks and new value drivers. As real estate is a business with long development cycles – from planning to construction takes several years – now is the time to plan for these changes. Finally, yet importantly, for coping with the bumpy road ahead, we believe that real estate invested in well-diversified regions will provide the best cushion."
6,Car Title Loans and Other Options to Improve a Bad Credit Score,finance," When you yourself have a low credit score for any reason, whether it's as you didn't repay debts on time or because of human and other errors in your record, you will see that most conventional lenders will not lend you cash. However, subprime lending companies offering car title loans might help consumers with bad scores, especially in times of emergencies. A history of defaulting on payments is among the reasons that will cause the credit bureaus to reduce your rating. For consumers who are excluded from borrowing money at low interest rates, it's a Catch-22 situation. If you can't get yourself a loan from banks, how will you repay your debts and improve your FICO score? One of the ways out of this dilemma is to use for a car title loan from firms that primarily use borrowers who've bad ratings, regardless of reasons for the low score. Because they accept your vehicle title as collateral, these companies do not look at a bad rating a deal-breaker. So if you want money immediately and are willing to pay an increased interest rate than what a conventional lender will charge, you are able to turn to a car title loan lender for help. Having a low score does not automatically disqualify you for a car title loan; because your car or truck supplies the lender with sufficient collateral to cover their costs should you default on your own payments. Boost your Credit Score Each time a borrower makes a regular payment, or fails to produce a payment on time, their record will reflect that fact. Here are a few steps that you could take to improve a low score. An annual copy of one's credit report might be requested from the three credit bureaus and have they checked for errors. If you discover erroneous or missing entries, contact the agency and creditor directly and fix any mistakes on your own report. However, this can be a long, drawn-out process that could take months or years. Credit Card Debts To Be Played Off To cut back your debt you can begin paying off debt or you may move debt from a not exactly maxed-out card to a one with increased available credit. This will reduce your debt. Maxed-out cards will hurt your FICO score. *Avoid Applying for Fresh Loans before approving your loan your vehicle title loan lender will run an obligatory credit check on you. Each time you apply for new loans, this fact will show up on your record. By taking a break from applying for new loans, you are able to avoid inquiries into your history. your lender will report your history of paying back the loan to the credit agencies. By repaying an Atlanta title pawn on time and depending on the schedule in the agreement, you are able to set up a positive payment history that is a good mark on your own record. However, defaulting on payments can hurt your rating even more. You are able to improve a low FICO score by making regular payments on your vehicle title loan. In this way, it is possible to improve a negative rating so you can eventually qualify for a conventional loan."
7,What do successful traders have in common,finance," When starting Forex trading every beginner trader has just one thing in mind - how to be successful and make as much profit as possible. But the reality shows that only a small percentage of traders are actually successful and continuously profitable. This leads unsuccessful traders to a thought that others have something in common, some sort of a skill or piece of a knowledge that is available only for them. Looking at the all-time successful traders such as George Soros who made one billion from shorting the British pound, it might look like that the trading is for superhumans and simple people cannot repeat the same. This assumption is far from the truth. Every person who became successful in Forex was once a beginner who made his/her way to success. While their journey was different, they still had things in common that made them reach their favourable result. In this, I do not mean the secret formula of Forex success but the qualities that all of them shared. So what are the things that all successful traders have in common? Let’s take a look Determination Do you want to be the next most successful Forex trader? A good businessman, great sportsman? The list can go on and on. Whatever goal you have set for yourself you cannot reach it without determination. In order to succeed in Forex trading, you need to be determined that you will reach your desired result. The road to becoming a successful Forex trader is not a smooth one, you will have a lot of up and downs. If you are not determined enough to become successful you might just stop trying whenever you see a challenge. Passion Passion is very similar to determination. Having a passion for something means that no matter what the obstacles are, you will keep going towards your goal. You need to be passionate about What you do, without this you will lose interest very quickly. According to a South African Forex traders list, many of the most successful Forex traders in South Africa started trading with a very small budget and only with mandatory knowledge. They, as many beginner traders have seen losses and disappointment in trading, however, their passion made them overcome all of those and succeed. Will to learn Most successful Forex traders that you might be hearing about are self-taught. Forex trading is an industry where there is always something new to learn. First, you need to learn about Forex, learn from your mistakes as well as from others and keep learning even when you are already profitable. The ability to teach new things to yourself is one of the most important qualities that unite successful Forex traders. If you are able to learn things and always keep yourself updated you have a good chance to be successful. Discipline Discipline is one of the main qualities that can be found in all of the successful traders. It is especially important when you are just starting out. While trading Forex you are all alone at your laptop and it is so easy to get distracted. At the same time, you do not have a fixed schedule and timeline, and no one is checking your progress. Therefore it is easy to just put it aside for tomorrow. Hence, it is important to have strong self-discipline. If you have always struggled with it, do not worry. Discipline is something that is better learnt in childhood but you can still adopt this skill. There are a lot of proven methods to gain self-discipline. This will help you not just in Forex trading but in any other field. Patience Last but not least - Patience. There are no successful Forex traders without this quality. If you have ever tried FX trading you would know that success does not come in just one day, month, or even one year. While you might want to see the fruit of your labour as soon as possible, you will have to wait patiently. Many traders do not understand it, hence once the year passes and they still cannot see the six-figure profit on their account, they simply quit and start searching for some other opportunity that can make them reach. And they usually quit when success is just around the corner. As you can see, there is no secret formula for being successful in Forex trading. But there definitely are some qualities that you need to have in order to succeed. If you lack any of those, do not worry, these are the traits that can be learnt and mastered over time if you have enough determination and passion. These, alongside the self-discipline, ability and will to never stop learning and enough patience are the five main traits that all of the successful Forex traders have in common."
8,"E-wallets quake banking with technology, convenience",finance," Last year will be remembered as pivotal in the evolution of mobile payments. In 2018, mobile transactions set new records for every US holiday shopping season. Consumers are using less cash and shopping on their phones more. American shoppers have begun to use a mobile phone-based digital wallet to make transactions, especially with friends and family that live in other states or countries. A digital or e-wallet is somewhat like a gift card: users place an amount of money into accounts stored on a phone that they can access and then spend as desired. When used like a bank account transactions are identical to any other debit or credit, only the transactions go directly from the e-wallet rather than from a debit or credit card. With global e-wallet transactions expected to reach $2.1trn by 2023 from $594bn in 2016, technology giants are muscling for market share. A pioneer in e-wallets, Paypal was founded in 1998, making it the oldest offering. Google Wallet was released in 2011, and Apple Pay launched in 2014. Paypal has grown through acquisitions and partnerships since splitting from parent eBay in 2015. Google Wallet began rebranding to Google Pay in 2018 to rival Apple pay. The Silicon Valley technology giant has continued to ink partnership deals with apps including Airbnb, Kayak and DoorDash while tweaking its website to facilitate greater adoption. Apple Pay has been making inroads with consumers and merchants alike. A 2017 report found that 48% of merchants thought favorably about the e-wallet. Another 39% planned to add the option in 2018, the same report revealed. Virtual wallet adoption in the rest of the world has been skyrocketing, mainly because debit and credit cards have almost universal acceptance with merchants and customers. With this in mind, Google and Apple are both furiously innovating US versions digital offerings, in order to highlight a clear and distinct advantage that plastic cards don’t offer. Interestingly enough, the rest of the world isn’t so challenged. Digital wallets in countries outside of the US have bypassed the sole ‘money storage’ single use function, by also providing users with e-Commerce options that give consumers an entire financial and shopping ecosystem. Internationally embraced wallets allow consumers to: buy and sell 1000’s of items, transfer monies between friends, buy and send gift certificates, apply for a debit card and even buy gold or silver. Leaders in the overseas market including Alipay (China), ICICIBank (India) and Passfeed, Inc. in the US have disrupted banking by driving customers to their digital wallets by creating total shopping experiences. One of the strongest drivers of the US digital payment growth is Alipay. The Alipay e-wallet recently signed an agreement with payment processor Vantiv to allow Walgreens pharmacies to accommodate digital wallet transactions. Emerging players like Passfeed (a New York City based upstart) have also disrupted the US market with an e-Commerce based iPhone App — eyeing the multi-billion dollar US mobile payments market. ""US investors cannot ignore the trend toward digital payment"", Richard Wang, CEO of Passfeed said. ""The explosion of the US mobile payment market, makes it a very attractive place to be now and into the future,"" he explained. ""By 2020, 90% of smartphone users in the United States will have used some form of mobile payments — we would be very happy to take 1% of that market. Whether American Express, MasterCard and Visa likes it or not, the digital wallet revolution has transformed how consumers buy and retailers sell. Just like 1998, when the internet started to reshape how the world communicates, 2019 is starting to look like the year when a new era of shopping is taking off."
9,How to review a Forex Broker,finance," The Foreign Exchange industry is full of various opportunities both for brokers and traders. Since the industry is so lucrative especially for brokerages there are many of them that prefer to gain profits from people’s trust rather than provide a good service. They mostly target beginner traders due to three main reasons: usually, beginner traders do not know much about FX trading and it is easy to mislead them. Most of the new traders search for opportunities with high returns on investments and it is easy to lure them with nice looking but empty promises. Last but not least, beginner traders often underestimate the need for proper research. If you take a look at the most famous Forex frauds and Ponzi schemes you will see that all of them were targeting new and vulnerable traders and were relatively successful in it. Surely it is not a reason for traders who just entered the Forex trading industry to get scared and quit before even trying, but it should make them more cautious. This article will give you some insight on how you should choose your broker to be sure that your funds are safe and secure. You will learn how to review a Forex broker and distinguish a genuinely good, trustworthy brokerage from a scam. Now, let’s dig in. Distinguish good and bad reviews from each other Since there are a lot of broker reviews on the internet one does not really need to check out everything about the broker by himself as the reviews provide all the needed information together. But not all reviews are equal, there are reviews that provide objective information and there are reviews that try to convince you with something. You as a reader should be aware of what kind of reviews you are reading to prevent yourself from making the wrong decision in the end. A good, trustworthy review should provide the details about the broker in the beginning, for example, the KontoFX review by bestsocialtrading.com reviews all of the aspects of the broker, its regulations, features, information about deposit and withdrawal and so on. Any broker review should give you the information you need to make your decision. Is the broker regulated? By whom? The first thing you need to pay attention to when you are reading the review, or are investigating the broker by yourself is regulation. If the broker has a regulation by the local regulator of the country you live in, it means that the broker is legit and has the proper authorization and licensing. Regulation creates a safe trading environment for a trader. Even if the broker violates the rules or regulations the trader can always approach the regulator and ask to take needed measures. If the broker does not have a license it is better to keep your investments away from it. It is also important to know who regulates the broker as some financial authorities are more reputable than others. If the broker is regulated by the FCA, ASIC, BaFin, you can consider it trustworthy. If the license is granted by the financial watchdog of the Marshal Islands or Belize, there is a chance that the broker is not that trustworthy. When checking the regulation do not just believe the information provided by the broker on its own website but check it by yourself. Some brokers put license numbers that have been cancelled or simply do not belong to their firm. The financial authority of the United Kingdom, FCA warns their residents to be aware of so-called clone firms that copy the license number and other credentials of valid brokerages. Hence, be careful with it and always check the license number on the website of the financial regulator. Where does your money go It's safe to assume that when trading Forex you want to see profits and not losses. While sometimes taking losses can be inevitable, especially when you are a beginner trader you can still reduce them by looking at how the broker generates income. Usually, brokers make profits though spreads or commission per lot. It is always better to go with the broker that uses the first option. At the same time, some brokers might have commissions on withdrawal. Just imagine you made profits and want to withdraw it, but you learn that the broker wants to keep some of them. It would not feel good right? To avoid this situation you need to check this part of the broker carefully. Pay attention if the broker is charging for maintaining your account, for inactivity or for any other services. Ideally, the broker should not have any of these fees, How supportive is the broker? Customer support is a crucial part that is often underestimated. Many traders do not pay attention to it until they need support. It is disappointing to have some issues and find out that nobody from the brokerage can assist you properly. To avoid it check the customer support before you open an account with the brokerage. It is simple to check and does not take more than minutes. Most of the brokers offer online chat, you can approach them with a simple question you might be interested in and see how promptly and professionally will they respond. Brokers usually have their email and phone number displayed as well. If you’d like, you can contact them via email and mobile too. Are the customers satisfied? The first-hand experience is the best. But as you might have heard, wise people learn from others mistakes rather than theirs. Read the reviews that are posted by the customers of a particular broker. They will show you how good or bad the service really is. You should also know that there is no such thing as a 100% satisfaction indicator. Some traders might simply dislike the broker because they have lost money due to their own mistakes. Therefore read the reviews and see if the majority of them are positive. Key takeaways It is not an easy task to finds good brokers especially today when scammers are getting better and better with camouflaging their services and offerings. However, it is not that hard if you know how to review the broker. First of all, read reviews of brokerages, you already know about, hence you will not be misled by subjective reviews. Check if the broker is regulated, which regulatory body granted the license and if the license number is valid at all. See if the broker is charging money for various reasons through commissions and fees. Check the customer support and see if the broker can help you solve the issue if you face some problems on your account. Last but not least see what the customers are saying about the broker and how satisfied they are with the service. These tips will help you determine if the broker is trustworthy, fraud or simply has bad service."

11,How to save money effectively,finance," Saving is important for your future, no matter you believe it or not. It's your best defense against bankruptcy. It insulates you from possible financial loss and gives you the ability to expand your finances and create a money-generating business machine that will help you earn extra. Your potential to flexing your base income is augmented in ways that is not confined within the walls of basic employment. You can start up your own business, use it for loan purposes and earn interest on them while being used, among others.

This article provides you with ways on how you can effectively maximize your financial resources and helps you manage your money by developing correct habits and outlook suitable for your goal. You buy items because you need them. A need is something you cannot take away from a person for these things are vital to his or her very existence and without them, they are categorically considered poor or deprived. Food, shelter, clothing and transportation are the primary examples. In a modern world, car and phone gadgets are a necessary part of a busy working individual. However, unless you are receiving more than $20,000 per month, you basically won't need to have a $60,000 to $80,000 luxury vehicle. The same is true for your telephone media. Having your own cellular phone is necessary but keeping up with the latest model or buying the all the latest releases are not practical and earns you more points on plunging into a staggering financial downfall. Extravagance is the rule of the kings. While we sometimes need to afford a little affluence in terms of the food we eat, the body pampering devices and accessories, such as clothes and body-relaxing services, we also need to consider that these types of activities should only be reserved for special occasions and for cases when you have some excess left in your household budget. Spending more than what you earn or produce is a bad habit that most people get used to doing everyday. Allocate a special percentage of your earnings to go into your savings accounts while spending the rest for your day-to-day expenses. Unexpected charges, such as the visitation of your relatives or a house party due to a certain celebration will be there to stay so you need not make some leeway budget on them and save them should situation not arise. I found that a lot of family still drink bottled water regularly, which wasted a lot of money. The wise way should be getting a budget and good water filter and connect to your water tap. By doing this way, you can save a ton of money in the long run. Conclusion: Saving money is not easy if you don't know how to do it effectively. So, if you want to change your financial situation, try the above methods."
12,Are CFDs a perfect alternative to Stocks and Cryptocurrencies?,finance," The art of trading comes in different shapes and sizes. Thanks to the diversity of the various financial markets, literally anyone in the world can find their preferred asset and trade it with relative success. There are currently no outlining features for each asset that potentially make it the best one to trade with. All of them come with their advantages as well as disadvantages. In most cases, it is recommended that you have an extremely diverse portfolio, but that is usually done with different types of the same assets. For example different currency pairs, commodities and stocks. But what if we could unite all of these assets under one single class and diversify them through that? This is where CFDs come into the picture. CFD is an abbreviation for Contracts for Difference. They are used as intermediaries for the types of assets. For example, if one were to trade an Apple stock CFD, they don’t actually own the stock. CFDs provide the ability to just speculate on the price within a given timeframe. So once you buy a CFD of a specific asset, you are buying the price point of that asset at that time, not the asset itself. This could be a bit confusing for beginners. But a small outline of the advantages and disadvantages are enough to make them clear. The advantages of CFDs Like any other asset class, CFDs have clear advantages over other types that help them stand out within the noise of financial markets. Let’s look into the most effective ones. Leverage Leverage is not something unique to CFDs, but they are indeed considered as an advantage compared to stocks and cryptocurrencies. Margin trading is indeed allowed on both of these asset classes, but the leverage offered is either non-existent or extremely low. With CFDs, the traders are able to use numbers like 1:100 or even 1:400. According to Forex brokers in South Africa, most of their customers are interested in Crypto CFDs thanks to the massive popularity of the digital currencies. Unfortunately, however, the currencies themselves are not enough to satiate their ambitions of trading with high volumes. Those same Forex brokers started offering CFDs on cryptocurrencies, which was the deciding action to win over most of the local market thanks to the high leverage. This can be seen all over the world. Europeans favoring Stock CFDs and the Americas focusing on commodities. The leverage is often the deciding factor to trade CFDs. Lower initial deposit Thanks to the leverage, most traders are able to generate significant profits even with meager initial deposits. For example, if you want to start trading on an established stock broker’s platform, you’d need to deposit at least $5,000 initially. Now, $5,000 is not something everybody has laying around to play with, therefore stock brokers became exclusive to upper-middle-class traders. However, CFDs do not require such large deposits. In most cases, a trader will be able to find a company that is ready to accommodate them with an initial deposit of $250, which is more attainable for the majority of the world’s population. The disadvantages of CFDs Unfortunately, the advantages of CFDs end with the lower initial deposit. Although the asset class may seem extremely useful on paper, the reality is completely different. Let’s now look at the features of CFDs that scare away most traders. Trade limitations Every CFD trade has an expiration date. In most cases, these dates are 24 or 48 hours, which makes long-term trading impossible. Well, technically it is not impossible. A trader can indeed extend the deadline of the trade, but it will cost him quite a bit in fees. Because of this feature, CFDs are usually considered to be tools for short-term trading. They’re like diamonds for scalpers and day traders. But are worth less than dirt for long-term speculators. Not owning the asset For some traders, the ownership of a specific asset is not important. However, for the majority of the people involved with Stocks, cryptocurrencies or commodities ownership is essential. The reasons are quite simple. Cryptocurrencies are something that can be used outside of the financial markets. They can be used as a means of payment in the digital sphere. In some cases, people refuse to except anything but cryptos. A CFD trader may find him or herself at a massive disadvantage were that to occur. Furthermore, most cryptocurrencies are also considered as stocks. So for example, if a new coin comes out and you buy 25% of it, you are considered as a market-maker. Your ownership of the coin is so large that you get a seat at the investor table to propose future business plans for the company. The former is relevant to stocks as well. Having a significant share of the company makes you an influencer. Having that seat in most cases is far more important than just having a high amount of equity through CFDs. With commodities, it is a bit different but ultimately falls under the same reasons. For example, a gold trader may one day decide to use his assets not for trading, but for manufacturing or distribution. Having CFDs on gold prevents that as you do not own it. As you can see, CFDs provide the ability to just trade the assets and nothing else. A lack of variety When trading on a platform designed for a specific asset, you have access to pretty much all of the market. However, when trading with CFDs it is quite hard to get your hands on CFDs for exotic assets. These can be CFDs on newly IPO’d companies, new cryptocurrencies, and exotic commodities. With cryptocurrencies, traders get about 4 to 5 options. BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP and sometimes BCH. With stocks, you’d usually find large companies like Apple, Google and etc. Commodities are also limited to Gold, Silver, Oil and etc. So which option is better? It is extremely hard to say which option is the best for an individual trader. As you can see there are dozens of details to consider before making a choice. But all in all a general classification can be made. CFDs are good for day traders and scalpers, while they are useless for long-term speculators."

14,Share capital or share premium for your Dutch company?,finance," Share capital or share premium for your Dutch company? You have incorporated and registered a Dutch business and wish to fund it with equity. Should you capitalize the company with share capital or share premium? In this article both options will be discussed. Definitions Share capital and share premium (in Dutch: agio) are both considered to be part of the capital of a Dutch limited liability company and therefore both are in principal a tax neutral instrument. Share capital can be brought into a company by paying up issued shares in cash or in kind. Share premium can be brought into a company by a contribution in cash or in kind on the payed up shares of a BV. Under Dutch GAAP (RJ 240.403), all transactions of a company with its shareholders that affect the financial relationship between these parties are to be accounted for directly in the equity. Share issuance and share premium contribution should both be considered as equity. Under Dutch GAAP share capital and share premium will not impact the Profit or Loss account. According to the Dutch Accounting Standards funding of a BV by share issue will be recorded in the Equity as Share Capital. Dutch Accounting Standard RJ 240.221 states that capital contributions made by existing shareholders on account of their financial relationship to the entity that are executed conducted without actual disbursement of new shares (or rights to receive or call shares) are to be recognized as share premium. In the Financial statements funding under share premium contribution will be shown in Equity under Share Capital. Increase of equity Increasing the capital of a BV by means of capital requires the execution of a deed by a Dutch civil law notary. For the execution, the notary will require a resolution from the shareholder which also includes a power of attorney. Additionally, a power of attorney from the company will be necessary. Normally, the notary takes care for drafting the notarial deed, power of attorney and resolution. When the shareholder of a Dutch company is a foreign legal or natural person, the notary will require a legalized resolution. Under certain circumstance also with an apostille and an authority statement (in some cases, the formality of legalization and apostille can be avoided by having the Dutch notary identify the signer. This identification only has to take place once). After the execution of the shares the notary will take care of the registration of the increase of share capital at the Dutch trade register. Before or after the execution of the deed, the newly issued shares can be paid up by the shareholder by means of a transfer to the company's bank account. A share premium contribution requires a share premium contribution agreement concluded between the shareholder and the BV, in combination with a shareholders resolution. There is no registration of share premium with the Dutch trade register or in the shareholders register. After the conclusion of the share premium contribution agreement and adoption of the resolution, the share premium can be paid by the shareholder to the company by means of a transfer. As amount of formalities is limited, a share premium contribution can, in case of urgency, be executed within a day. In situation where repetitive share premium contributions are planned, it is wise to conclude a share premium contribution facility agreement whereby the shareholder and the company can agree on share premium contributions up to a capped amount. This will help the involved parties to avoid conclusion of multiple agreements and resolutions and will give flexibility in case the need for capital can not be assessed in advance. Share premium and share capital redemption Both types of capital can under certain conditions be redeemed without any dividend withholding taxes being levied. A condition for tax neutral repayment of share premium to its shareholders is that the company shall have distributed all its profits and does not expect any profits within the next two years. This scenario is often used in case of liquidation of a company. In case the conditions mentioned above cannot be met, it is still possible to repay the share premium without any dividend withholding taxes levied. The share premium shall first be converted by means of a deed of a civil notary into a share capital. In case of liquidation, redemption of share capital can be executed without any formalities and in a tax neutral way. In case the company will be continued, the share capital redemption can only be executed in a tax neutral way by means of decreasing the nominal value of the shares. Such decrease of the nominal value can only be realized by means of a notarial deed. As an example: in case of a decrease of the nominal value of the shares with 50 per cent, an amount equal to 50 per cent of the initial share capital can be distributed to the shareholder. This distribution will be exempted from dividend withholding tax. Conclusion For accounting and taxation purposes, share capital and share premium are both considered to be part of the equity and are treated in a similar way. Therefore, it is recommendable to make use of share premium after company registration as it can be applied more easily. A contribution of share premium takes less time, does not need to be registered with the trade register and saves notarial expenses. As funding of a company and the repayment of capital can have several tax consequences, e.g. possible taxation for dividend withholding tax purposes, it is advisable to have a tax advisor guide the process of share capital redemption."

Or perhaps, you’re like any business owner and want to grow your business but aren’t entirely sure how.

Once you have a CPA, there are several ways in which they can help your small business grow, here are four of them. Taxes affect every business, whether it’s positively or negatively depends on each business’s tax planning. If your CPA does nothing else, managing your taxes alone provides enormous opportunities for growth.

What’s more, by accurately filing your company’s taxes, your CPA will help you avoid costly and stressful tax audits. The thing that keeps a company in business is the same as the one that puts a company out of business, cash flow. The difference between whether your company stays afloat or sinks is the direction that the majority of cash is flowing. One primary duty of your CPA should be to monitor revenue and business expenses while developing strategies to increase the first and decrease the latter. Your business may only employ a few people now but with growth comes more employees. As your company takes on more workers, paying them correctly and on time becomes more of a challenge. With your CPA’s experience, your business will be in the right place to set up the most effective payroll system. Small businesses don’t grow without going through difficult times. However, for growth to occur, a company has to survive its financial struggles. Your Certified public accountant is a key player in identifying your company’s financial problems. Additionally, your CPA is essential for negotiating payment plans with creditors so that your business will survive today and grow tomorrow. Now that you’ve started a small business, there are three things it can do, decline, stay relatively the same, or grow. Growth is the most challenging task, but it’s also the most rewarding. Bringing a CPA on board helps ensure that your business stays on a path towards growth."
17,Earnings Season: What You Need to Know as a Trader,finance," Investors and traders either love or hate earnings season as the four-times a year event is associated with large price swings in either direction for a plethora of stocks. When Is Earnings Season? Earnings season refers to the period in which publicly traded corporation release their financial results along with a business update as well as their future outlook. Typically speaking, earnings season begins a few weeks after the last month of each quarter - March, June, September, December. Companies typically issue a press release a few weeks ahead of earnings season which communicates with investors the time and date of their release. Alcoa, the major metals engineering and manufacturing company, is among the first major corporations to report its earnings and many among the investment community associate its report with the unofficial start to earnings. There is no official start and end to earnings season but it is generally considered over after six weeks or when the vast majority of 500 companies that make up the S&P 500 component reported their earnings. What Does Earnings Season Involve? An earnings report includes exactly what it sounds like - the dollar amount of earnings (or losses) a company realized in the most recent quarter. Companies also provide their earnings per share which is the portion of their profit divided by each outstanding share of the common stock. The earnings report also contains financial metrics including revenue, gross margins among many more. Prior to an earnings release many Wall Street analysts offer estimates on what they expect the company to report. The earnings report itself follows the format of a press release. The opening paragraph typically contains the company’s actual earnings, revenue and gross margins and a brief comparison to the same metrics which were recorded a year ago. The first paragraph may also include a metric that is important to investors or to the company’s story. For example, Apple said in its most recent earnings release that international sales represented 67 percent of total revenue in the quarter. Growth in Apple’s international markets, particularly China and India is considered to be the company’s next leg of growth and for some investors it is more important than domestic sales. The following paragraph is likely to include a brief quote from the company’s CEO which discusses the company’s results. Moving on, the next few paragraphs likely include any new development that investors should be aware of, including any changes to dividend payments, stock buybacks or acquisitions. More important to many investors is the company’s guidance or outlook for the coming quarter, full year or even several years down the road. This provides a better snapshot picture of the company’s health and sets up a standard for the company to live up to. Examples of guidance include: 1) Company X expects revenue for the full fiscal year to be between $250 and $260 million, 2) Company Y expects gross margin for fiscal 2018 to be between 41.5 and 43.0 percent, 3) Company Z expects operating expenses to rise 10 percent next quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Finally, the company will include its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and any other accounting information it deems necessary. Post Earnings Report Conference Call After a company releases their financial results, management holds a conference call that is open to investors and non-investors. A link to a live stream of the conference call is also communicated to the investment community through the company’s investor relations website. The call will include additional commentary and analysis on the reported results as well as a general business overview and updates on new developments, markets, products or acquisitions. Ignoring the conference call and merely focusing on the financial metrics could prove to be a big mistake for investors. For example, Facebook’s Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman said during his prepared remarks during the third quarter conference call in 2013 that the social media platform ""did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens."" This marked the first time that Facebook’s management team acknowledged it faces headwinds among its core market. Up until Ebersman’s comments, Facebook’s stock was trading higher by around 15 percent. However, the executive’s one sentence alone was responsible for wiping out all of the stock’s gain and it then dipped into negative territory. Coincidently or not, Facebook stopped commenting on teen usage on subsequent conference calls. After management’s prepared comments, the call is open to Wall Street analysts to ask questions on any aspect of the company’s business, including clarification on any of the quarterly results metrics. The Power Of Earnings Season Consider the case of Groupon, the ecommerce merchant that connects consumers with merchants by offering discounted products or coupons. The company’s relevancy in the online space has been questioned by investors amid a heightened competitive environment and the possibility that a substantially larger internet peer, such as Facebook or Google, could easily enter the space. Groupon reported its second quarter results on Wednesday July 27. Prior to the earnings print its stock was trading for less than $4 a share. Shares immediately surged higher by nearly 25 percent following the earnings result which reaffirmed the company’s relevancy in the online market place and a bright outlook. Groupon said in its earnings report that it lost just one cent per share in the quarter while its revenue rose 2.4 percent from the same quarter a year ago to $756 million. The company also provided guidance and said it expects its full year revenue to be $3 billion to $3.1 billion - an impressive figure compared to many analysts expectations. On the non-financial metric side of the story, Groupon said that it added more than one million new customers in the quarter, marking its highest level of growth in more than two years. Following a smashing earnings report the stock continued to rise in the subsequent trading sessions and within a few weeks the stock gained nearly $2 per share and traded at its highest level in more than a year at $5.94. Bottom Line: Be Aware Of This Earnings season is the ideal opportunity for investors to check on their investment, hear from management and re-evaluate their view on the company. There is one aspect of earning season that could provide a deceptive view of the company that often goes ignored by investors. Recall that a company’s earnings per share is simply the company’s total earnings divided by the total number of common stock outstanding. Also keep in mind that many companies implement a stock buyback program whereby they purchase their own stock in the open market to ""retire"" the shares. For example, suppose a company has one million shares outstanding and earns $1 million. Each stock represents $1 of earnings. Suppose the company purchased 100,000 shares of its own stock and a year later the company’s earnings remained unchanged at $1 million. What happened to its new earnings per share? At first glance it improved because each share now constitutes a higher share of total earnings. In reality, the earnings per share metric improved merely on paper and may have provided a false sense that the business itself is improving when as a matter of fact it hasn’t improved (or declined) over the year. Investors who simply take a look at the reported earnings per share without factoring in stock buybacks may be making a mistake in their conclusion."
18,How to remove your name from debt review,finance," We are pretty much sure that the reason why you are here is because you are wondering on how you can clear your name from debt review/debt counselling. Read below as we explain the steps that you can take in order for you to get your name cleared. Step 1 – When can a consumer (YOU) exit the debt review process? Section 71(2)(b)(i) of the National Credit Act initially made provision for consumers to only exit debt review through issuance of a clearance certificate after they have paid all their re-arranged debts in full. The effect of this provision is that in instances where a home loan formed part of the debt review application, consumers have to remain under debt review for the duration of the home loan term even after settling re-arranged short term debts. This provision will however change upon proclamation of the National Credit Amendment Act (NCAA) under section 71(1) as follows: 3 Guidelines for the Withdrawal from Debt Review A Consumer whose debts have been re-arranged in terms of Part D of this Chapter must be issued with a Clearance Certificate by a Debt Counsellor within seven days after the Consumer has – (a) Satisfied all the obligations under every credit agreement that was subject to that debt re-arrangement order or agreement in accordance with that order or arrangement; or (b) Demonstrated: financial ability to satisfy the future obligations in terms of the re-arrangement order or agreement under- (aa) a mortgage agreement which secures a credit agreement for the purchase or improvement of immovable property; or (bb) any long term agreement as may be prescribed; That there are no arrears on the re-arrangement contemplated in subparagraph (i); and That all obligations under every credit agreement included in the re-arrangement order or agreement other than those contemplated in subparagraph (i), have been settled in full. Step 2 – Can then a debt counsellor terminate or withdraw the debt review process? Unfortunately the answer is NO. Because A debt counsellor does not have statutory powers to terminate or withdraw the debt review process. There is however varied ways in which a consumer can be withdrawn from debt review which will be set out below; Once a debt review court order has been obtained a consumer cannot terminate or withdraw the debt review process, they can however approach the court to rescind the order or apply for an order which declares that the consumer is no longer over-indebted. Consumers can only withdraw or terminate the debt review process prior to declaration of over indebtedness as per section 86(7) of the Act and issuance of Form 17.2 subject to payment of debt counselling fees as per NCR Debt Counselling Fee Guidelines Further note that you as a consumer have a right to make direct payments to the creditors as that will not be construed as non co-operation and should not be used as a reason for suspension of debt counselling services by your debt counsellor. If you choose to make direct payments to your creditors you need to note the following; Consumer remains responsible to make all payments as re-arranged, in full and on time. Proof of payments must be sent to your debt counsellor on a monthly basis for record keeping and to enable provision of after care service as a consumer cannot be under debt review without a debt counsellor. Consequences of making short or late payments (e.g. risk of termination by credit providers). Debt counselling fees are payable to a debt counsellor for services rendered and this includes payment of aftercare fees. For a debt counsellor to issue a clearance certificate, all after care fees must be up to date. Where the debt counsellor has suspended provision of service, a consumer must provide proof of settlement letters from credit providers for a debt counsellor to issue a clearance certificate. In a nutshell, the debt review legal process is very complex and it should be explained clearly to the consumers, understood and also not taken lightly. We see a lot of debt review removal companies online that scam most South African consumers, promising them world and fail to deliver. Once you have applied for debt review and you stick to the new rearranged payment and the debt review flag get finally removed from your credit profile, you’ll be eligible to take out credit. HOWEVER, we highly recommended that you work with your debt counsellor first, to establish a sustainable budget before you take on any debt. We hope that this helped. Please remember to share, review and recommend."

20,Everything investors should know about 1031 sponsors,finance," Highlights: •	What is a 1031 exchange? •	Who is a 1031 sponsor? •	DST & role of a DST sponsor •	Difference between DST sponsors and real estate sponsors You must have come across the word 1031 sponsor while reading about 1031 exchanges. In real estate business, a sponsor can be a person or company responsible for searching, acquiring, and managing properties on behalf of primary investors or property owners. A 1031 sponsor also plays the same role. Only DST sponsors are exceptions. But before you explore about 1031 sponsors, it’s important to understand 1031 exchanges thoroughly. A 1031 exchange is an arrangement in which an investor can defer paying capital gains tax on exchanging one property for another, but on one condition, the exchanged properties must be ‘like-kind’. In 1031 exchanges, the term like-kind is used to define properties of a similar nature. Therefore, a rental property can only be exchanged for another rental property. As the proceeds obtained from the sale of the relinquished property are reinvested on replacement property, an investor in a 1031 exchange doesn’t recognize any gain or loss. Hence, they aren’t liable for paying any tax. However, don’t forget that 1031 exchanges only allow tax deferment, they aren’t tax-free. Another thing you should keep in mind is that 1031 exchanges do have deadlines. Upon closing on the sale of the relinquished property, an investor gets a time limit of 45 days, also known as ‘identification period’, for sending a written identification of the potential replacement property to 1031 Corporations. Thereafter, a deadline of 135 days is given for acquiring the identified replacement property. In other words, a 1031 exchange must be completed within a time frame of 180 days, which begins the day when the relinquished property is sold. Upon completion of the exchange, the sponsor transfers the property title to the investor. So, a 1031 exchange sponsor finds, acquires, and holds properties on behalf of primary investors. On the other hand, a DST sponsor owns and manages real estate properties. Role of a DST Sponsor DST stands for Delaware Statutory Trust. It’s an entity which is mainly formed for trade or business purposes. A DST sponsor acquires properties under DST umbrella and then opens it up for potential real estate investors, who then buy shares in those properties. Therefore, a single DST property can have many shareholders. In fact, a DST must have at least 100 shareholders. Surprised? Well, it’s normal. DSTs have large structure and that’s what benefits small-sized investors. After all, a small real estate investor can’t think of possessing a large and advanced quality property. However, DSTs can make it possible. Since DSTs can have more than 100 shareholders, sometimes, an investment can be as low as $100,000. DST investors don’t get the title to the property and only enjoy the status of shareholders. Since DST investors directly own shares in a real estate property, they are eligible for deferring capital gains tax. The biggest difference between DST sponsors and ordinary real estate sponsors is that DST sponsors are owners and real estate sponsors are mediators. However, whether it’s a 1031 exchange sponsor or DST sponsor, both can help investors in deferring capital gains taxes."

1,How to Use Oil Prices As A Signal in Currency Exchange,finance," If you have ever traded stock, then you understand the importance of buying or selling when stocks split or when the company buys back shares. It's true. Similarities between the stock and currency markets exist; but, success in currency exchange entails understanding the relationship between currency pairs. The pairing of the US Dollar and the British Pound proves a dependence between an import and export economy. Oil and Export Economies More analysis of the Pound as a leading exporter demonstrates the significance of oil in conducting business; there are shipping costs and other business costs. Yet, the Japanese Yen gives another scenario of the point that oil plays a major role in export. Traders should beware. Attention to the national average gas price and movement of stock related to oil will be strong signals in a currency exchange. So, the trading signal provided by a stable national average gas price should work in both the Dollar and Pound and Dollar and Yen exchanges. But first, understanding the link between oil and gas allows traders a view of the numbers related. Specifically, in the energy industry the Crude-Gas Ratio measures the value of crude oil and gas; eventually the demand for one or the other causes an increase in prices. Do the math. Because the link between oil and gas carries significance traders should take an advantage when market forces shift both together. National Average Gas Price In brief the national average gas price should provide a reliable entry signal for exchanges between the British Pound and Japanese Yen. Clearing a long-term link between oil and gas, traders would only have to use historical data on gas prices as a point of entry into a trade. When the national average gas price holds steady, fluctuation less than $.05 for more than 200 days initiate a trade. Next, movement of oil and gas related stocks can be a strong exit signal for traders in the energy industry. After market forces move both oil and gas prices together, the energy industry has to react. The 2008 crisis prove a downward shift in oil prices during the recession; then, around 2012 an increase in oil prices and decrease in the price of natural gas. So then, oil and gas companies begin to look for a profit and decide to drill for oil. The ""long-run"" link between oil and gas occurs. Finally, the stock market rebounds after oil and gas companies look to support from related business and products. Entry and Exit To demonstrate a reliable exit signal for a trade of the Pound or the Yen, the movement of pricey, blue chip stocks gives a reference point for traders. Blue chip stocks perform the duty of insuring the respective industry financial depth; you respect the stock because of its ability to close gaps in the market. So, when wide-spread movement of blue chip stock occur, it is expected that several other things are happening. It is important to study. Most markets including the NYSE, S&P 500, FTSE, etc feature several blue chip stocks in respect to industry. The movement of oil and gas related stocks in the energy industry gives a strong exit signal. Traders should expect links because of the causation. For instance, in the energy industry, the blue chip stock CAT or Caterpillar presents an example of how oil prices affect certain currency exchanges. The Dollar and Pound exchange allows a support of the movement of oil related stocks. When participating in an exchange, knowing the relationship between the currency pairs allows for confident entry and exits. The use of oil prices as a reliable signal in trade can lead to profits. Referring to stable national gas average prices and the movement of blue chip stocks will improve your trading strategy. Visit Forex.com for more analysis and trading tips.

2,Understanding Public Liability Insurance,finance," For many business owners public liability is simply product liability insurance, so they wonder if they need it. Of course, if you don’t produce products, you may think that you don’t need this coverage, but you may be making a very costly mistake. Here we’ll explore the topic of public liability insurance, so you have the information you need to make an informed decision. The Basics Public liability insurance is perhaps the most common type of insurance that is taken by businesses of all sizes. Without adequate cover, a business can face exorbitant fees and penalties for any damages caused to customers or clients. Whether you have an established business or are a brand new start up, it is important that you have sufficient coverage to protect you in the public sphere. Why is Public Liability Insurance Needed? Although it is not obligatory for every business, public liability should be considered crucial if there is any degree of public interaction during your business activities. From customers receiving a delivery to clients visiting your place of business, public liability insurance should be considered a necessity. Even if you operate a home based business, if you use your home office as a meeting place or supply products and services, you could benefit from the coverage. The standard public liability covers a variety of situations, but generally, it will provide protection if someone is harmed or injured due to your business activities. This type of insurance may also provide cover if a third party is caused damage. It is worth bearing in mind that even minor damage to personal property could lead to hefty financial penalties. You may be required to pay legal fees, damages, and even fines out of your own pocket if you don’t have an appropriate policy. Does Your Business Need Public Liability? If you own a business where customers, clients, employees or simply members of the general public visit,  you will need public liability insurance. Other examples of where you would need this type of cover is if you have a home based business but have individuals visit for business purposes or if your business organises off site activities or events where the general public attend. A standard policy will cover your business and any subsidiaries, your employees while they are acting within the scope of their duties and any directors or partners of your business. The amount of coverage needed will depend on your risk profile. The risks depend on your industry standards and any requirements specified by law, regulations or even your clients. An experienced broker can help you to assess your risk profile to determine the appropriate level of coverage needed for your business. If your business is in need of public liability insurance, Perth based GSK Insurance is here to help. We can guide you through the options from public liability insurance to product liability insurance, to ensure that your risk profile is thoroughly assessed and you have adequate protection.

3,Why Small Business Owners Need to Visit Business Insurance Brokers,finance," Whether you’re a new startup or an established SME, you may have overlooked the importance of visiting business insurance brokers. While it may appear simple to obtain insurance to cover your business activities, it is crucial that your business is adequately protected against risk with sufficient insurance. A business insurance broker specialises in commercial insurance, so you can have confidence that if the worst happens, you have sufficient protection. The Importance of Business Insurance Business insurance is the umbrella term for various commercial insurance products to protect your business against work related risks. These risks can have a devastating impact on your business should you suffer a lawsuit or financial damages. Business insurance can be used to protect business owners from an unexpected event such as equipment breakdown, third party damages, property damage, accidents, fire or theft. Your business faces risk every day of trading, regardless of your industry or even the size of your business. Insurance helps you to manage these risks to avoid the tremendous costs that could cripple your small business. With adequate insurance, you can focus on running and building your successful business. Business Insurance Brokers Can Help Tailor Your Coverage Every business is unique, so it stands to reason that your business also has unique insurance needs. A business insurance broker can assess your risk profile to ensure that your business is legal and protected. Depending on the nature of your business, there are a number of policies that may be appropriate for your activities. It is also important to note that some insurances are mandatory for businesses in Australia, so you need to ensure that you are compliant with all local and federal regulations. Public Liability While you may be aware that you need public liability insurance for your small business, are you confident that you are adequately covered and paying the best price? Although it may seem more cost effective to purchase insurance online or from your home insurance company, you may actually be paying more in the long run. Business insurance brokers specialise in all aspects of commercial insurance. This means that they have access to deals and packages that may not be available direct or from home insurers. A good broker will evaluate your risk profile and search for the best policies and packages that will provide sufficient coverage. Additionally, your broker may be able to bundle your public liability insurance with all your other business insurance policies for an even better deal. Even something seemingly minor such as weather damage to your premises can have a devastating effect on a small business. This can be exacerbated if your small business is hit by an employee injury claim or a lawsuit that could not only close down your enterprise, but leave your personal assets vulnerable. So, any small business owner should not underestimate how a business broker can help you. If you are looking for business insurance brokers, Perth based GSK Insurance is here to help. We can offer access to a wide variety of commercial insurance products, and our team is available to assess your risk profile to ensure that you’re protected."
4,It's A Mature Bull Market And Time For A Strategic Hedging Plan,finance," Yes it’s time to hedge your risk, but don’t wait for that perfect moment.  Both the economy and stock market are showing signs of stress.  Here's what you need to know. Here are some of the excuses we hear from professional money managers and risk managers for not having a hedging program in place: 	we're waiting for more signals just to be sure; 	I read an article which said the stock market has more upside; 	we'll make a decision after the next quarterly earnings are out; 	I've been managing assets for 20 years and I'll know when it's time, and it's not time yet; 	I don't want to leave profits on the table; 	what's hedging?; That last excuse always causes my heart to skip a beat.  It's troublesome because professional money and risk managers either have forgotten the basics of asset management or have never learned the principals of their profession. We completely understand every other excuse and the reasoning behind them all.  There's just one problem and that problem has been around for as long as the economy itself.  The reality of the situation is that almost everyone fails to see the signs in time to alter course. Or greed comes into play where the asset manager wants to squeeze every last percentage point of profit.  No doubt street creds are valuable when marketing a funds return to potential investors.  I get that too. I've spoken to hundreds of risk managers to ask the simple question ""After you conclude your analysis and it's determined that risk levels are rising, what is your firms policy?""  ""I don't understand."" Is the reply so I take a pause to re-word my question.  ""What steps does your firm take to address the risk and then mitigate the risk?""  The answer is usually something like, ""well, we do more analysis.""  I then ask ""does your firm ever set a hedging program into effect?"" a blank stare, ""What's hedging?"" There are clearly two problems here. the individual or firm who falsely believe there is no immediate concern and ample time for more profits.  They will easily recognize the signs and take action when it's needed; the individual or firm who is completely unaware of the approaching storm and there is nothing they can do about it except to buckle up and hope for the best; The first commodity exchanges were organized as a mechanism to hedge commodity risk.  Hedging is not necessarily complex but you do require access to the derivatives market and need a derivatives specialist who understands the market. Hedging is equivalent to insurance.  You can't accurately predict when you'll need it, and you can't control  things which are not under your control.  So to protect yourself and your property, the prudent person agrees to an insurance policy in exchange for an affordable monthly fee.  The monthly fee is an affordable alternative to the high risk of not recovering after a disaster. Hedging is much the same.  In exchange for a small monthly fee, the firm mitigates their risk against an unforeseen event.  For a business, this means an economic recession or a stock market reversal, either can be devastating.  Will any of this happen tomorrow, can it be predicted in advance?  Well sort of.  In the winter months your risk of slipping on ice or snow is greatly increased.  But the question we don't know is if it will happen to a member of your family or perhaps to your neighbour. Hedging your risk is not different.  Will the economy move into recession or will it remain stagnant?  Will it last 6 months or 24 months?  We're seeing interest rates rise with more to come.  Corporate earnings are under stress.  The economy of China is under pressure and Brexit is expected to throw the U.K. into a recession.  Do you really need any more bad news to make you sit up and take notice. Here's what you need to do.  Firstly forget what everyone else is doing because if you follow the herd, that same herd will lead you off the cliff.  Make your own analysis of the situation and if you can't survive another recession or don't think having to lay-off staff is any kind of strategy then perhaps sound advice from a derivatives and hedging professional might just be the answer you're looking for.  Don't know where to find one?  No need to look any further because derivatives is not just what we do, it's all we do.  Make the call, you'll be glad you did."
5,Can Newcomers Get Approved For Car Loans?,finance," Have you just arrived in Canada, ready to start you new life in the Great White North? With its booming economy, infamously friendly citizens and love of all things maple, it can be an ideal place to live and start a family. Many people will need some form of transportation to get around, either for work or just to explore, and often the best solution is getting a car. However, if you’re a new Canadian, you likely don’t have a credit score yet. So how do you get a newcomer car loan without a credit score? There are actually several ways to secure a car loan without a solid credit score. Let’s have a look at some of the ways a newcomer might go about getting on the road. Newcomer Arriving In Canada Passport Close Up Banks & Credit Unions With Canada being such an attractive immigration destination, combined with its very welcoming policies towards accepting new immigrants, Canadian banks and credit unions have begun to offer many products geared specifically towards new Canadians. From no fee chequing accounts to bonus interest savings, financial institutions recognize the new consumer market that is in need of banking solutions without having a long history of established credit relationships. Something that many of the major banks and credit unions in Canada offer is a newcomer car loan. Unlike normal loans, these loans do not require any previous Canadian credit history and so can be very useful to recent immigrants. However, the loans often have a few stipulations that can put some pressure on many newcomer’s finances including: High Down Payment Requirements Many, if not all, newcomer car loans require a very large minimum down payment to even be considered for the loan. The industry standard is around 25% of the desired loan amount, which can have a huge impact on new Canadians trying to find their feet. The new immigrant arriving in Canada has an average of $47,000 in savings, but will need to spend over half of it getting settled. Almost 20% of new immigrants arrive in Canada with no savings. The down payment requirements are so high as the banks do not yet know what kind of credit user a newcomer might be, and so they need to protect their interests by making the barrier to entry for the newcomer car loans fairly high. Ultimately, this could actually work out for the better for many new Canadians, as a large down payment means lower monthly repayments and a shorter loan term. It is also in the bank’s best interests to work with new immigrants and try to meet their needs, as a happy customer is likely to stay a loyal customer and continue to bank with that institution for years to come. Strict Identification And Employment Requirements Banks are some of the most strictly regulated organizations in any country, and as such, tend to have fairly strict conditions on identification and employments when it comes to newcomer car loans. Whilst this probably won’t be a problem for many recent arrivals, it may present some issues for people with complicated documentation or who haven’t yet established a career in Canada. Limits On Length Of Time Spent In Canada Another stipulation that likely won’t impact most newcomers to Canada but still worth mentioning, is that banks tend to put a limit on how much time you have spent in Canada before you can no longer be classed as a ""newcomer"". These can vary between institutions, but generally sits at around 3 years. If you have been in Canada for 3 years you will likely have some form of credit file built up for the newcomer car loan will likely not apply to you anymore. Again, this limitation probably doesn’t affect the vast majority of new Canadians, but worth mentioning nevertheless for people with special circumstances. Welcome To Canada Flag With Mountains Loan Brokers Another option that can be attractive to recent immigrants to Canada is a car loan broker. These are companies, such as AutoLoans.ca, that take a newcomer car loan application and shop it around to a range of different financial institutions on behalf of the applicant to find them the best deal. AutoLoans.ca has decades of experience in the car loans industry, and we know exactly what new Canadians need when it comes to purchasing their first car. No credit history or low credit score isn’t a problem for AutoLoans.ca, as we have built up sound relationships with dozens of different financing organisations and won’t stop until we get an approved car loan at a competitive rate. Loan brokers may not have as strict requirements as banks or credit unions, so they can offer increased flexibility and lower barriers to entry for newcomers to Canada. How Does It Work? So how do you go about getting a newcomer car loan? Step 1: Apply The first step in the process is to select a lender and go through their application process. These will vary in complexity, length, and the amount of time it takes to complete the application. Typically you could expect a bank or credit union application to take longer to complete than a loan broker, as they will require a lot of identification and supporting documentation. You will likely be asked about your employment history (either within Canada or in your home country), your living situation (renting, owning or boarding), your relationship status (to determine your combined household income), and many other factors. Newcomer car loans taken out with banks or credit unions will sometimes also have to be completed in person, which can take even longer. If you are looking for the fastest and easiest possible way to apply for a car loan with no credit history, an online application with AutoLoans.ca  is the smartest option. Our application process takes just a few minutes and can be completed online, saving you time and effort in what is already a labour intensive process. Step 2: Approval Once you have completed the application process, it is up to your chosen lender to determine whether you meet their lending criteria and will be approved for the newcomer car loan. In any other loan process, this would depend largely on your credit file. However, as a new Canadian without a credit file, how the lender determines your eligibility will likely be based on your down payment, history of employment, and their own appetite for risk. Approval can sometimes take a long time, as banks and credit unions are huge, bureaucratic organisations with many checks and balances that can slow the process down. AutoLoans.ca has a network of many different financial lenders to shop your application around to, which means that approvals can often be made on the same day. This can save you a lot of time and stress, and get you on the road faster. Toronto Newcomer Car Loan Easy Approval Step 3: Choose Your Car Once you have successfully made it through the application process and been approved, it’s time to pick out your car! This step will often take place in a dealership who has a relationship with the financial organisation with which you have taken out your loan. Remember to negotiate with your car dealer when it comes to the price you pay for your new car. Sticker price is never as low as they can go, and it can end up saving you thousands in interest fees over the course of your loan. AutoLoans.ca offers a range of over 5,000 cars directly to applicants, cutting out the need of negotiating with a dealership. Our fleet of new and certified reconditioned cars offer unbeatable value and only the best quality. Best of all, if you aren’t in love with your first choice for whatever reason, you’re more than welcome to swap your car for another one of our selection whenever you want! Step 4: Enjoy Canada! Once you finally have your car in your possession, it’s time to get out there and enjoy your new home!"
6,Does Your Business Need Public Liability Insurance?,finance," When it comes to public liability insurance, Perth business owners often questions whether it is actually necessary. In simple terms, public liability insurance covers you for liabilities towards injury or property damage caused by your business activities. It may also help with legal bills for any claims filed against you. If you’re still unconvinced about whether your business needs this crucial cover, we’ll explore why it is so important here. The Benefits of Public Liability Insurance This form of insurance is crucial for any business where members of the public visit or engage in any activities on the premises. This can include businesses such as beauty salons, retail offices, medical centers. Even home based businesses can benefit from public liability cover, as it provides protection against any claims due to faulty goods or services. A policy can protect you and your business against the potentially hefty financial consequences of unfavourable incidents. For many Australian businesses, public liability is mandatory, but in some cases, it may be optional. In addition to covering the potentially massive costs of third party damage claims, this cover can also provide financial assistance when defending a claim. How Liabilities Arise A liability can occur due to a number of reasons, but all of these can be covered by public liability cover. For example, an accidental fall in a shop can create a claim for an injured customer. However, there may also be a liability where an aggrieved party who claims a breach of an implied obligation that has led to damage. Even trades can be at risk of public liability claims. Imagine that you are working in a public space and a member of the public trips on a cable, tool or ladders, you’ve left on the ground while you work.

7,Insurance Brokers: Preventing the Gamble with Commercial Property Insurance,finance," Many entrepreneurs acknowledge that commercial investments can be a risk at the best of times, particularly in the changing economic climate. So, it is crucial that you protect your interests. Unfortunately, many property owners gamble with their insurance and can end up paying a hefty price. For example, many of the businesses that were affected by the 2011 floods in Queensland were not adequately insured. So, here we’ll explore how insurance brokers can help you to avoid gambling with your insurance coverage. Why Are there Problems With Commercial Insurance? Many experienced Perth insurance brokers attribute the lack of coverage to the nature of the insurance industry and marketplace. It can be challenging for business owners to make informed choices about the policies needed due to the complexity of the products. This is where experienced insurance brokers can help. Part of the role of a broker is to help clients understand the exclusions and inclusions of business insurance policies to ensure that you’re adequately protected. The Importance of Commercial Property Insurance Commercial property insurance is a specialist type of insurance designed for business premises. These policies can help to prevent financial loss from events occurring during commercial activities. This can cover expenses caused by flooding, fire, burglary, accidental damage or other unforeseen events. The cost of the insurance will be dependent on risk calculations, so properties in high crime areas or in areas prone to flooding will be charged a higher premium. Insured or Uninsured Against Stormy Weather? The 2011 floods highlighted why it is vital that your commercial insurance policy needs to be assessed by a professional broker. The wording of policies can be extremely complicated and in some cases, can seem counterintuitive. For example, there have been cases of policies that provide coverage against ""water inundation"" yet have a flood inclusion. This type of wording is common, and you need to understand that there are distinct differences that can impact your coverage. Professional insurance brokers deal with these complicated terms and policy details day in, day out. So, they are equipped to analyse policy wording to determine if it provides the best coverage for your business. Commercial Landlord Insurance Property issues are not restricted to the premises where you operate your business. If you own property that is leased out, you also need to ensure that your investment is protected. While some leases require a tenant to source their own insurance, many leave this as a responsibility for the landlord. This means that you need to ensure that your property is protected against accidental damage, fire, theft or weather damage. While your tenant may have insurance to cover their stock and equipment, this will not help you if water damage creates a need for flooring, walls or other building materials to be replaced. If you are in need of commercial insurance and need to speak to experienced insurance brokers, you can rely on us. As established Perth insurance brokers, we would be delighted to discuss your circumstances and help you to find the best possible deal."
8,How to Choose the Right Mortgage,finance," Contrary to the belief of many Dallas borrowers, there are several different choices to make when it comes to getting a mortgage. Perhaps the emotion and excitement involved when purchasing a home causes people to automatically choose the first 30-year fixed rate mortgage they get offered. However, with some forethought, planning, and careful decision-making, you can save a good amount of money on your Dallas mortgage in both the near term and long term. Some Things to Consider Before Looking at Your Options Deciding which mortgage option is best for you before analyzing your financial circumstances would be like going into a buffet before you figure out how hungry you are or what is best for your diet. You have to make an honest assessment of your situation. To do this, it may help to consider what taking different mortgage options says about your financial circumstances. For example, a fixed rate 30-year mortgage essentially says, ""I will be making pretty much the same amount of money for the next 30 years, and I don’t mind taking that much time to pay off my mortgage."" However, is this truly the case? Perhaps you believe you will be making more within a few years. If so, the 30-year option may still be a good idea, but it would help if you committed to paying more towards the principle once your income increases. Of course, this is just one example, and if you live in the Dallas area, there are tons of other instances where your personal situation may play a decisive role in the decision. Here are some questions to ask yourself. How soon do I want to own my home outright? If you want to pay off your home quicker, you may be able to save on your interest rate by getting a 15-year mortgage. You will be paying more each month, but your equity will climb much quicker as well. How long do I plan on keeping my home? If you think you are likely going to sell your Dallas home within a few years, you can choose to still get a 30-year mortgage and pocket the money you save each month towards the purchase of your next home. However, you could also chip away at the principle faster by choosing a 15-year mortgage. That way, you can sell your home quicker because you will owe less and won’t have to ask as much in order to prevent taking a loss. If you are getting older, you may want to consider how much you will be giving your children if you decide to either move into a Dallas area retirement home or you pass away. If giving your children or another heir a home with a good amount of equity is a priority for you, you may want to consider getting a 15-year mortgage. This makes it all the more likely that your heirs inherit only value and not debt. As you purchase your Dallas home, if you are within 30 years of retirement, you have the chance to limit the amount of stress you will be feeling by choosing a repayment plan that eliminates your mortgage before you retire. This can be a luxury or it can be a necessity, particularly if your retirement income is going to be significantly less than what it is now. Regardless of your final decision, getting a mortgage should be seen as a financial opportunity. This is your chance to not only get a beautiful home but to empower yourself financially for years to come."
9,How To Find The Right Texas Mortgage Lender,finance," In this modern information age, there are mortgage lenders all around Dallas—and some would say circling—looking for your business. While this can be confusing and even irritating at times, it actually presents an opportunity. You are empowered as never before to choose just the right lender for your needs. Here’s how to make sure that happens. When it comes to making sure you are the best-looking borrower possible, think of getting the right lender like asking someone out on a date. You want to ""look"" as good as possible. For a Dallas lender, you ""look good"" when you have a high credit score. This may mean delaying the moment you actually approach lenders and ""ask them out,"" the same way you may take a few months to get in shape before approaching your crush. Think of getting the right loan as a long-term objective. Any work you do now to improve your credit score—even if it takes a few months or longer—is going to be worth it because you will be m much more attractive to potential lenders. Then you will be in a better position to bargain and make demands. Shoot for a score that is at least 620, and try to get into the 700’s if possible. If that’s not feasible, you can still opt for an FHA loan. When you get preapproved, some basic information is gathered about your creditworthiness. This is then used to decide whether you are going to be able to repay the loan. In the Dallas mortgage market, having preapproval in hand makes your chances of getting the mortgage you want approved rise significantly. Check out different rates from different lenders. Cast a wide net. Check online and go into banks. You may be surprised that some of the more established banks have rates that can be affordable. At the same time, the opposite may be true, and you’re not going to know until you do your research. In the Dallas area, given the number of choices you're going to have, it may be helpful to decide on a few criteria you want to consider and get that info for each lender you approach or research. For instance, the interest rate, fixed or variable options they offer, down payment options they have, and how interest rates vary depending on your credit score may all be criteria you will want to take note of as you do your searching. There are several types of mortgages. They vary in length, credit score requirements, repayment options, and down payment requirements. Learn all you can before you start searching. Perhaps a mortgage broker has been instructed to present certain options first and foremost because it will benefit the lender’s bottom line. That’s understandable and it’s good for their business. But if you are aware of all of your options, you will know which ones you should ask about. You want to empower yourself with as much accurate information as you can. Ask, ask, and ask again about anything you aren’t completely sure about. Also, read the fine print. Set aside a lot of time for each meeting with a lender. If they are not willing to answer all of your questions, move on to someone else. If they are, however, you will get a wealth of valuable knowledge. This can then be used to alter your decision and therefore benefit your bottom line. If you're searching for a mortgage, you have a unique opportunity to increase your wealth both now and in the long term. A mortgage in Dallas is likely the biggest amount of debt you’re going to assume over the course of your lifetime. Making an informed decision powered by knowledge will ensure you are well positioned for a stronger financial future."
10,Considering Business Insurance? Risks Carpenters Can Protect With the Right Cover,finance," Every day, carpenters across Australia tackle projects they need to complete and fail to consider any risks they face with these tasks. Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong on a site and you need to ensure that you and your business are protected with adequate business insurance. While you can’t insure against the possibility of not having enough work, you can ensure that your business is protected against employee injury, equipment loss, personal injury or property damage. So, here we’ll explore how with a visit to business insurance brokers, Perth carpenters can enjoy protection against many risks. Public Liability Public liability is vital for carpenters and in many cases, you will be unable to enter a building site without proof of cover. This type of policy is designed to cover any legal expenses against any liability claims. Without public liability, a client or third party could make a claim, and even if you’re not at fault, you could spend a fortune on legal expenses. Injuries Most tradespeople are aware that a job site can be a potentially dangerous place. This means that it is vital that your business insurance package includes protection against injuries. As previously mentioned, all businesses operating in Australia must have public liability to protect against third party injuries, such as a member of the public tripping over your tools. However, you may not be aware that you can obtain sickness and accident cover to provide protection in the event that you’re injured. It may also be a good idea to have workers compensation insurance to cover any injuries to a member of your team. This means that if an accident occurs on your job site and you’re left unable to work, you will receive financial compensation until you’re back on your feet. Many policies also provide cover in the event that you’re too sick to work. There are policies available that provide cover for up to 100 weeks allowing you financial benefit at an average weekly income typical of your business before the illness. Worker’s compensation can be vital for carpenters, as any employee injuries are financially covered. This removes the risk of being left with medical bills, lost wages and compensation costs that could potentially bankrupt your business. Stolen Tools Many carpenters spend years accumulating the perfect tools to perform their trade to the highest standard. This means that if any tools are lost or stolen, it can have a devastating impact on your business. In many cases, commercial vehicle insurance will not cover equipment loss from a damaged vehicle, so you could end up waiting weeks to try and replace the tools. Fortunately, there are tool cover policies that provide the funds to replace any lost or stolen tools quickly. This minimises the impact on your business, so you can quickly get back to work. If you’re considering your options for business insurance brokers, Australia based GSK Insurance is here to help. We can offer a wide range of business insurance products, and our team members are on hand to discuss your requirements to ensure that your business risk profile is covered."
11,Common Cafe Insurance Mistakes,finance," Running a cafe requires a great deal of dedication. You’re likely to put all your time and effort into getting your business up and running, so you don’t want one mistake to compromise all your hard work. Cafe insurance can help to protect you and your business, so it is important you avoid these common mistakes. Not Considering the Importance of Cafe or Restaurant Insurance The biggest mistake you can make about your business is not considering the importance of proper cafe or restaurant insurance. You may have a false misconception that if your cafe is small, you don’t require dedicated business insurance. However, this can be a very costly mistake. Not having proper insurance is an invitation for trouble as you will lack protection against any potential losses. Even if you’re running a tight budget for your startup operations, it is crucial to consider insurance to ensure that you have the best cover for your needs. Allowing Insurance to Lapse Most business owners can appreciate that some months are leaner than others. Many cafes have a booming trade during tourist season and struggle to break even at other times of the year. However, allowing your insurance to lapse during these leaner months is a big mistake. When your insurance lapses, it means that you will not be covered at all, if an accident should occur. If you fail to renew your policy, you could end up being stuck paying lawsuit damages out of your own pocket. Choosing the Wrong Insurance Many business owners tend to buy insurance through their home insurance company. After all, if a company can provide good home or car insurance, they should be able to help with cafe insurance, right? In fact, this ""easy"" option can actually make life more complicated. Insurers who specialise in home insurance, may not be able to recommend or provide the best business insurance. They are unlikely to have access to the entire product selection in the business insurance sector. This means that you could end up under insured or lacking vital cover. So, rather than trying to take the ""easy"" option, rely on a specialist insurance broker who can assess your risk profile and act on your behalf to ensure you are adequately protected. Failing to Update Your Policy Another common mistake among cafe owners is not informing insurance brokers about changes in business assets or activities. Failing to update your policies could create issues in the event of a claim, and you may find that you may only be able to get a partial claim paid if there is a problem. So, it is vital that any changes in your business are reflected in your policy. This will ensure that you can enjoy complete protection against any issues that may arise. If you are interested in cafe insurance, you should speak to us. The GSK Insurance brokers perth team are available to answer any queries you may have and discuss your requirements to ensure that your business benefits from the best cafe or restaurant insurance."
12,Real estate consultants: how should they communicate with millennial?,finance," Real estate is a business area accustomed to change, to constant challenges that put professionals to the test. Whoever adapts, survives. Who does not, has difficulty. The latest challenge is to learn how to sell real estate to millennial. An audience that seems, now, after the economic crisis, more predisposed to buy home. However, millennial are a very particular generation. They are the first to be considered ""native"" to digital. Personal needs are different and requirements are different. That is why we must be able to communicate in order to attract attention. First of all, one must realize who the millennial are ? The generation Y or millennial, and composed by the individuals born between 1980 and 1996. It is a generation that grew along with the technology. Make use of it for just about anything. Unlike the previous generation (those born between 1965 and 1979), millennial prioritize experience, to the detriment of ownership. Indebting to get a home or car is an idea that does not appeal to them. have a major impact on them (especially on employability) and are therefore more cautious. It is because of this attitude, which gives less importance to the ""have"", that companies like Airbn and Uber succeed. They do not sell anything. They encourage sharing and provide experiences. What can real estate consultants do to communicate with the millennial? 1 - Be Authentic Whether you are communicating face-to-face or online. Do not think good rhetoric will convince you. Age is just a number. It's not about being older and having more experience that will automatically gain the customer's confidence. You have to create a connection. And that's only possible if it's authentic. Before talking to someone, in this case a real estate consultant, millennial has already done a research on everything: the property, the agency and the agent. Do not start for an action without any knowledge. On the contrary. Being a little more personal and not just professional, will help you. Try to understand the client's concerns and show that they will help you in every step of buying a home. Always keep in mind that millennial are more susceptible to the opinions of friends and family. If it pleases a customer, it is likely that he will recommend it. 2 - Be fast Millennial are impatient with regard to information. Everything has to be fast. Otherwise, go ahead. An answer to an email or Facebook message from one day to another may seem fast to you. But over that period of time, the potential client has already sent a message to 4 or 5 real estate agents. The first to respond will have the opportunity to do business. Since Generation Y does a lot of research online, make sure that your website is fast and responsive. If it's slow, and unreadable on the phone, you're losing potential customers. No one will make the effort to read small print. 3 - Give importance to the quality of content It goes without saying that the house has 3 bedrooms and two bathrooms. It is not enough to take two photographs of a messy kitchen. Information about the surrounding area to the property is as, or more important, than the property data. Millennial do not just want to buy a house. They want a lifestyle. By giving this information you will also give the impression that you are an experienced person who knows the area well and who is the ideal one to help. Do not forget to have a coherent communication. The language tone you use across platforms should be the same. Do not leave any social networks abandoned, for example. Millennial will discover it and think it does not struggle. 4 - Be the guide For much information that can be obtained online, it does not replace the practical knowledge of the real estate consultants. Your role should be the guide. Help the young people throughout the buying process, Doubts will be many, especially for those who have never bought a home. Make the process customization so that satisfaction is guaranteed."
13,What Your Dad Never Told You About Income Investing: Q & A,finance," One of the biggest mistakes investors make is to ignore the ""income purpose"" portion of their investment portfolios... many don't even realize that there should be such a thing.  The second biggest mistake is to examine the performance of income securities in the same manner as they do ""growth purpose"" securities (equities). The following Q & A assumes that portfolios are built around these four great financial risk minimizers: • All securities meet high quality standards, produce some form of income, are ""classically"" diversified, and are sold when ""reasonable"" target profits are achieved. Yes, the purpose of equity investments is the production of ""growth"", but most people think of growth as the increase in market value of the securities they own. I think of growth in terms of the amount of new ""capital"" that is created by the realization of profits, and the compounding of the earnings when that new capital is reinvested using ""cost based"" asset allocation. Most advisors don't view profits with the same warm and fuzzy feeling that I do... maybe it's a tax code that treats losses more favorably than gains, or a legal system that allows people to sue advisors if hindsight suggests that a wrong turn may have been taken. Truth be told, there's no such thing as a bad profit. Most people wouldn't believe that, over the last 20 years, a 100% income portfolio would have ""outperformed"" all three of the major stock market averages in ""total return""... using  as conservative an annual distribution number as 4%: The per year percentage gains: NASDAQ = 1.93%; S & P 500 = 4.30%; DJIA = 5.7%; 4% Closed End Fund (CEF) portfolio = 6.1% • NOTE: during the past 20 years, taxable CEFs have actually yielded around 8%, tax frees, just under 6%... and then there were all the capital gains opportunities from 2009 through 2012. Try looking at it this way. If your portfolio is generating less income than you are withdrawing, something must be sold to provide the spending money. Most financial advisors would agree that no less than 4% (payable in monthly increments) is needed in retirement... without considering travel, grandkids' educations and emergencies. This year alone, most of that money had to come from your principal. • Similar to the basic fixed annuity program, most retirement plans assume an annual reduction of principal. A ""retirement ready"" income program, on the other hand, leaves the principal for the heirs while growing the annual spending money for the retirees. At least 30% for anyone under 50, then a growing allocation as retirement looms larger... portfolio size and spending money requirements should dictate how much of the portfolio can be at risk in the stock market. Typically, no more than 30% in equities for retirees. Very large portfolios could be more aggressive, but isn't true wealth the knowledge that you no longer have to take significant financial risks? As an extra added safety measure, all equity investments should be in Investment Grade Value Stocks and a diversified group of equity CEFs, thus assuring cash flow from the entire portfolio, all of the time. But the key from day one is to make all asset allocation calculations using position cost basis instead of market value. • NOTE: When equity prices are very high, equity CEFs provide significant income and excellent diversification in a managed program that allows stock market participation with less risk than individual stocks and significantly more income than even income mutual funds and income ETFs. Using total ""working capital"" instead of current or periodic market values, allows the investor to know precisely where new portfolio additions (dividends, interest, deposits and trading proceeds) should be invested. This simple step will guarantee that total portfolio income increases year over year, and accelerates significantly toward retirement, as the asset allocation itself becomes more conservative. • Asset allocation should not change based on market or interest rate prognostications; projected income needs and retirement ready financial risk minimization are the primary issues. There are a few basic types, but the variations are many. To keep it simple, and in ascending order of risk, there are US Government and Agency Debt Instruments, State and Local Government Securities, Corporate Bonds, Loans and Preferred Stock. These are the most common varietals, and they generally provide a fixed level of income payable either semi-annually or quarterly. (CDs and Money Market Funds are not investments, their only risk being the ""opportunity"" variety.) Variable income securities include Mortgage Products, REITs, Unit Trusts, Limited Partnerships, etc. And then there are a myriad of incomprehensible Wall Street created speculations with ""traunches"", ""hedges"", and other strategies that are much too complicated to understand... to the extent necessary for prudent investing. Generally speaking, higher yields reflect higher risk in individual income securities; complicated maneuverings and adjustments increase the risk exponentially. Current yields vary by type of security, fundamental quality of the issuer, length of time until maturity, and in some cases, conditions in a particular industry... and, of course IRE. Short term interest rate expectations (IRE, appropriately), stir the current yield pot and keep things interesting as yields on existing securities change with ""inversely proportional"" price movements . Yields  vary considerably between type, and right now are between below 1% for ""no risk"" money market funds to 10% for oil & gas MLPs and some REITs. Corporate Bonds are around 3%, preferred stocks around 5%, while most taxable CEFs are generating close to 8%. Tax free CEFs yield an average of about 5.5%. • Quite a spread of income possibilities, and there are investment products for every investment type, quality level, and investment duration imaginable... not to mention global and index opportunities. But without exception, closed end funds pay significantly more income than either ETFs or Mutual Funds... it's not even close. All types of individual bonds are expensive to buy and to sell (mark ups on bonds and new issue preferreds do not have to be disclosed), particularly in small quantities, and it is virtually impossible to add to bonds when prices fall. Preferred stocks and CEFs behave like equities, and are easy to trade as prices move in either direction (i.e., it's easy to sell for profits, or buy more to reduce cost basis and increase yield). • During the ""financial crisis"", CEF yields (tax free and taxable) almost doubled... nearly all could have been sold more than once, at ""one-year's-interest-in-advance"" profits, before they regained normal levels in 2012. There are several reasons for this great differential in yields to investors. • CEFs are not mutual funds. They are separate investment companies that manage a portfolio of securities. Unlike mutual funds, investors buy shares of stock in the company itself, and there is a finite number of shares. Mutual funds issue unlimited numbers of shares whose price is always equal to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund. • The price of a CEF is determined by market forces and can be either above or below the NAV... thus, they can, at times, be purchased at a discount. • Income mutual funds focus on total return; CEF investment managers focus on producing spending money. • The CEF raises cash through an IPO, and invests the proceeds in a portfolio of securities, most of the income from which will be paid in the form of dividends to shareholders. • The investment company may also issue preferred shares at a guaranteed dividend rate well below what they know they can obtain in the market. (e.g., they could sell a callable, 3% preferred stock issue, and invest in bonds that are paying 4.5%.) • Finally, they negotiate very short term bank loans and use the proceeds to buy longer term securities that are paying a greater rate of interest. In most market scenarios, short term rates are much lower than long term, and the duration of the loans is as short as the IRE scenario will permit... • This ""leverage borrowing"" has nothing to do with the portfolio itself, and, In crisis conditions, managers can stop the short term borrowing until a more stable interest rate environment returns. Consequently, the actual investment portfolio contains significantly more income producing capital than that provided  by the IPO proceeds. Shareholders receive the dividends from the entire portfolio. For more, read my ""Investing Under The Dome"" article. Annuities have several unique features, none of which make them good ""investments"". They are excellent security blankets if you don't have enough capital to produce adequate income on your own. The ""variable"" variety adds market risk to the equation (at some additional cost), bastardizing original fixed amount annuity principles. • They are ""the mother of all commissions"". • They charge penalties that, in effect, lock up your money for up to ten years, dependent on the size of the commission. • They guarantee a minimal interest rate that you receive as they give you back your own money over your ""actuarial life expectancy"" or actual lifetime, if it is longer. If you get hit by a truck, the payments stop. • You can pay extra (i.e., reduce your payments) to either benefit others or to assure that your heirs get something when you die; otherwise, the insurance company gets the entire remainder regardless of when you check out of the program. Stable Value Funds assure you of the lowest possible yield you can obtain in the fixed income market: • They include the shortest duration bonds to limit price volatility, so in some scenarios, they could actually yield less than Money Market Funds. Those that have slightly higher yielding paper include an insurance ""wrapper"" that assures price stability, at additional cost to the investor. • They are built to reinforce the misguided Wall Street emphasis on market value volatility, the harmless and natural personality of interest rate sensitive securities. • If money market rates ever return to ""normal"", these bad joke products will likely disappear. Private REITs are ""the father of all commissions"", illiquid, mystery portfolios, far inferior to the publicly traded variety in a number of ways. Take the time to read this Forbes article: ""An Investment Choice To Avoid: The Private REIT"" by Larry Light. Income ETFs & Retirement Income Mutual Funds are the second and third best ways to participate in the fixed income market: • They provide (or track the prices of)  diversified portfolios of individual securities (or mutual funds). • ETFs are better because they look and feel like stocks and can be bought and sold at any time; the obvious downside of most is that they are built to track indices and not to produce income. A few that seem to produce above a meager 4% (merely for information and absolutely not a recommendation) are: BAB, BLV, PFF, PSK, and VCLT. • As for Retirement Income Mutual Funds, the most popular of all (the Vanguard VTINX) has a 30% equity component and yields less than 2% in actual spending money. • There are at least one hundred ""experienced""  tax free and taxable income CEFs, and forty or more equity and/or balanced CEFs that pay more than any income ETF or Mutual Fund.

14,Getting the Right Tulsa Loans and Using Them Wisely,finance," Most people will run into situations at least once or twice in their life when they are short on cash. There are many reasons that you might need to consider getting a loan to help make ends meet or to take care of an emergency that you were not prepared to handle. One of the most effective and fastest ways to get the money is through a payday loan. These types of Tulsa loans can provide you with the quick cash you need, so you can take care of any unforeseen circumstances that have cropped up. 1.The Right Lender When you are looking for a short-term loan, such as a payday loan, you will want to pay close attention to the lenders you are considering. While there are protections in place to help keep consumers safe, you still want to understand as much as possible about any lender you will be working with. Make sure the terms of the loan are clear and that you understand them. How much interest will you have to pay, and when is the loan due. Will you need to pay the entire loan back at once, or will you be on a payment plan to pay the loan back over a slightly longer period? Before getting the loan, understand all of its ins and outs. When you need money, your mind will often start trying to figure out just how you can get the money you need, and one of the first things it lands on will be borrowing money from your friends or family. While this might work in some circumstances, it can often prove to be more trouble than it is worth. When you borrow from people you know, it tends to change the relationship dynamic. Most people will find that they are better off borrowing from a third party, such as a reputable payday lender. These types of loans should be used to help you with emergencies when you need to have access to money fast, but they should not be used like credit. Some people who are not using the money wisely take out another payday loan as soon as they have paid off the first, not realizing just how much money they are spending on interest. When you are smart with the loans, you will find that they can work for you, but if you use them unwisely, they can work against you."
15,What Are Signature Loans and Should You Use Them?,finance," Signature loans are also often called good faith loans, and they are typically available through banks and finance companies. You do not need to have any collateral. Instead, you are borrowing based on your signature and your promise to pay back the loan. This is an unsecured personal loan that will have set terms to let you know when the loan needs to be paid back in full, and what the fixed monthly payments will be. Typically, these types of loans will have fixed interest rates, and those rates will vary based on a person’s credit score. If you would like to get one of these types of loans, you should first know that you will need to have both good credit and a verifiable, stable income. This will help to show you as less of a risk to the lender, and it ensures that you will have the means through which you can pay the loan back when the time comes. In some cases, those who have less than stellar credit could still qualify for one of these types of loans, as long as they have a cosigner. These cosigners will have to sign an agreement that will make them responsible for paying back the loan if you are unable to pay it on your own. With this type of loan, the money you receive can be used for just about anything you might need or want. In some cases, people may wish to get one of these loans as a way to consolidate their debt. It can allow them to save money and pay less in interest. However, there are many other ways that the loans could be used. They might be used to make a major purchase, such as a vehicle. They could be used for making home improvements if you are unable to get a home equity loan, and they could be used for any unexpected expenses that crop up. You could even use them to help pay for a wedding or a vacation. Once you have the money, it is yours to do with as you please. These types of loans tend to be very fast, and you will not need to have any collateral when applying for the loan. They tend to have shorter terms, and they can provide you with the money you need conveniently."
16,Should You Pick an Oregon Credit Union Over Banks in Portland Oregon?,finance," Combining proper Merchant Services with your ideas as a business manager is what will help make your goals easier to reach. It all begins with the fact that you need to offer your customers the option to make secure payments. This is the only way you can help your business thrive. As long as you rely on the best Oregon credit union instead of banks in Portland Oregon, you will receive this advantage as well as many others. Let’s talk about payment channels and how useful it is to have more than one option available. As you may already know, different clients have different preferences when it comes to payments. What if you could cater to all of their needs while opting for the services offered by the same financial institution? You can be rest assured that we are prepared to take care of all merchant related aspects, from a financial point of view. To make this entire process even easier for you, it would be recommended that you look into mobile payments, which would involve the ability of accepting payments on your phone or tablet. This will lead to a higher level of convenience that will provide your business a fresh perspective. You can even process paper checks yourself, electronically, by relying on the same system. Even if banks and credit unions offer similar services, the level of service associated with credit unions is far superior than the one provided by banks. To ensure that you are not going to make a decision that you will end up regretting, it would be recommended that you find out more about the levels of commission that motivate bank consultants. The good news is that you will not have to worry about this matter when visiting credit unions. While relying on the services of a credit union, you can choose from a wide range of tools and features that are designed to simplify everything and even offer you the chance to lower costs, while making more efficient payment decisions for your company. It does not matter if you have already opted for a similar set of services and are not happy about how it all turned out or if you are just starting out. As opposed banks in Portland Oregon, the team working at a proper credit union is here to offer you the best assistance there is and help you pick the tools that match your business needs. When you are wondering whether you should open a Business Checking account or just keep your personal finances together with your company’s, the answer is pretty obvious. Even if you might believe that it is easier to just use the same account for both your business and personal expenses or deposits, it will turn out to be a hassle in the long run. The main disadvantage would be the fact that your own funds will not be safe if you have to deal with any lawsuits. This is just something that you need to think about before you make a final decision in this matter. It would be best if you opted for an account that matches all of your needs. A reputed credit union usually puts three different options at your disposal. Depending on what kind of advantages you would like to benefit from, you can choose the basic account option that does not have any monthly service fees or even a minimum balance requirement. If you are looking to earn money wherever possible, you should consider opening a Business Interest Checking account which will allow you to benefit from higher earnings. What you should expect from a Oregon credit union is for our team of consultants to offer you assistance from the moment you get in touch. Financial consultants can guide you towards picking the best solution for your company. Unlike other lenders, credit unions are more than happy to make their services as convenient as possible for all of their clients, no matter if we are talking about personal or business related situations. To keep everything as organized as possible and forget about the regular disadvantages that other financial institutions make you deal with, contact credit union consultants. They will be more than prepared to offer prompt assistance and suitable solutions for your company!"
17,How the Midterm Elections Could Affect the Real Estate Markets,finance," Los Angeles, CA. Democrats  have taken over the House and are projected to push through an agenda that prioritizes infrastructure and tax reform, shaking up real estate markets nationwide and in pricey cities like Washington, D.C., New York and Los Angeles. Groups of Democratic legislators are already aiming to repeal and replace the $1.5 trillion Republican tax plan signed into law by President Donald Trump in December of 2017. That would probably mean higher corporate tax rates and a reversal of Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy. Real Estate market  gurus will soon be predicting  the impact  and advising you how to position your real estate investments.. Your optimal strategy is to ignore their recommendations, at least with respect to the long term. If asked to guess how  real estate has performed  following midterm elections, many investors would base their answers on a simple narrative, such as: ""Republicans favor low taxes. Democrats want to regulate business more heavily. Logically, therefore,  real estate performs better when Democrats prevail than when Republicans do."" Historically, real estate did not always rise following Democratic gains.  In fact, many post-election  gains and declines occurred with the same frequency whether  Republicans or Democrats gained  seats. However, in the first Congressional  session after election days, declines were more frequent when Republicans gained seats. These findings, however, are no cause for celebration by either party.  None of the differences between the Republican and Democratic were significant. What seems to be important is not a mere pickup of seats, but rather a change of control of the House or Senate. Both chambers flipped twice to the Republicans (1946 and 1994) and twice to the Democrats (1954 and 2006). The Senate alone flipped to the Democrats in 1986.  The House alone flipped to the Republicans in 2010 and to the Democrats in 1930. One of the worst periods of real estate following the 1930 midterms posted the biggest post-midterms decline. That period, however, represented one of the worst stretches of the Great Depression, marked by a second wave of bank failures in mid-1931. In short, economics likely overshadowed politics. Similar, the 2008 financial crash was not entirely cause by politics. It had long roots. ""The immediate trigger was a combination of speculative activity in the financial markets, focusing particularly on property transactions – especially in the USA and Western Europe – and the availability of cheap credit"", says Scott Newton, emeritus professor of modern British and international history at the University of Cardiff. He goes on to say ""There was borrowing on a huge scale to finance what appeared to be a one-way bet on rising property prices. However, the boom was ultimately unsustainable because, from around 2005, the gap between incomes and debt began to widen. This was caused by rising energy prices on global markets, leading to an increase in the rate of global inflation. This development squeezed borrowers, many of whom struggled to repay mortgages. Property prices now started to fall, leading to a collapse in the values of the assets held by many financial institutions. The banking sectors of the USA and the UK came very close to collapse and had to be rescued by state intervention."" ""Excessive financial liberalization from the late 20th century, accompanied by a reduction in regulation, was underpinned by confidence that markets are efficient,"" says Martin Daunton, emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Cambridge. To sum up, there is no connection between real estate  performance and outcomes of midterm elections. That fact will probably not dissuade strategists from advocating investing tied to their predictions of changes in the congressional lineup.."
18,How An Investor Can Use A Financial App To Select The Best Stocks?,finance," The stock market offers many opportunities. You can earn a return on your excess cash by investing in the right stocks instead of just leaving the money in a checking account.  Many people including Warren Buffet made lots of money investing in stocks. Can you select the best stock for your portfolio by using a simple financial app like Boachsoft Plata? The answer is a definite yes. Dividends are the periodic sums of money that are paid to shareholders. It may be paid quarterly, semiannually or annually. Studies have proven that shares with dividend payments that grow year after year out-perform the other shares. They consistently provide shareholders with good returns and are associated with less risk which is paradoxical because the lower the risk the lower the expected return. To determine dividend growth rate just when you are ready to purchase stock using a financial app like Boachsoft Plata first  just use an online tool like yahoo finance to search for the dividends that have been paid over a few years. Record them. Switch on your phone or tablet and start a financial app like Boachsoft Plata. Choose the Time Value of Money Calculator. Enter your first dividend in the present value field. This should be the earliest dividend paid out that you wrote. Skip the annual interest rate field. Enter zero in the payment field. The number of periods is the number of consecutive dividends you have written down minus one. So if you write down 5 dividends paid out down your number of periods would be five minus 1 which is four. Enter the value in the periods field. Skip the 'Compounded/yr' field. Enter the latest dividend in the Future Value field. Precede it with a negative sign. It is also called a minus sign (-).  At the bottom you would see a drop down list box. The value should be equal to the time interval at which the dividends were paid. If you recorded annual dividends leave it as annual. If you recorded quarterly dividends then select quarterly. Finally press the Annual Interest button. The value obtained is the growth rate of your dividend. Calculate dividend growth rates for as many stocks as you can using the technique described. Pick the stock with the best dividend growth rate. Combining this with more information like the analysis of the prospects of a company you can choose the best stock and optimize returns. Next we are going to assess the value of a particular stock using an imprecise method. In other words it is just an estimate.  Select the stock valuation calculator in your financial app. In Boachsoft Plata it is called the valuation calculator. You would need the average cost of capital. Use your search engine to search for average cost of capital. In the Dividend field enter the latest dividend. Enter the average cost of capital in the Required Return field. If you have already calculated the dividend growth rate then enter it in the Growth Rate field otherwise just enter 0. Press the button labeled Value of Asset to determine the value of your stock.  Compare the value of stock to the share price. It should be close. If the value is less than the share price then this particular stock is overpriced. Do this for each of the stocks you intend to purchase. Purchase stocks with good dividend growth rates that aren't overpriced. These are just some of the ways you can use a financial app like Boachsoft Plata to optimize your stock purchases. If you consistently do this you will over time earn higher returns than people who don't."
19,"Gold, a Hedge Against the Perils of Interesting Times",finance," Gold, gold coins, gold coin, gold investment, gold investing, hedge, diversification, precious metals, oil crisis, currency, currencies, devaluation, appreciation, investment Article Body: While paper-based investments and real estate are vulnerable to effects of changing times, gold soars. A precious metals investment may save a portfolio when all else fails. The old Chinese curse, ""may you live in interesting times"", has particular relevance to the current epoch of U.S. history. There’s a lot going on right now, much of it scary. Major investors around the world are responding to the events of our perilous age by sinking their dollars, deutschmarks and yen into gold, silver and palladium; Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and billionaire speculator George Soros to name but a few. Big financial institutions like the Central Banks of Russia and China are also leaping onto the metals bandwagon driving the price of these precious commodities ever higher. This is spurring a gold rush not witnessed since the Misery Index years of the 1970s. Many financial experts now view gold in particular as an island of stability in a paper-based investment market growing stormier all the time, a development that bodes well for everyday folks who want to shore up their retirement accounts with a precious metals hedge. ""People the world over are losing faith in politicians, and currencies,"" says Marc Lubaszka, President/CEO, World Financial, a highly successful investment firm specializing in precious metals based in Studio City, Calif. ""This has resulted in a flight to gold and other precious metals, a storehouse of value for more than five thousand years. Investors are taking their money out of paper assets, and putting it where it is likely to earn a better return in uncertain times."" Old Reliables Unreliable Investments once considered as stable as granite are rapidly losing ground, Lubaszka explains. Real estate is but one example. Long praised as a slam-dunk by money gurus, home-buying is no longer viewed as a hurdle-free path to profit. Stratospheric pricing and higher interest rates are putting intolerable pressure on the current housing bubble, factors bound to bust the suds sooner or later and drive the overheated real estate market into deepfreeze. ""The housing bubble will burst rather than gradually deflate, following the rapid and violent pattern of decline of nearly every financial bubble throughout history,"" Lubaszka says. ""Higher interest rates negatively impact not only the health of the housing market but other economic segments as well. The stock market takes a hit because higher rates make it more costly for companies to pay for debt. Higher rates hurt corporate profit margins and reduce stock value, bad news given the deep debt situation so many companies are in today."" Paper is Passé According to Lubaszka, the U.S. dollar has lost more than 80% of its original value since the early 70’s when we went to a floating currency, a situation not helped very much by the debut of the Euro in the late 1990s. Unlike American dollars, a portion of the Euro is gold-backed, a stability feature that has helped it outperform the dollar over the long haul. It is for this reason that many foreign investors have been taking money out of U.S. dollars and putting it into gold and oil instead, one explanation for why the price of both has continued to rise in recent months. ""Gold prices are climbing right now because the Federal Reserve is printing dollars in flood proportions to keep the real estate market afloat,"" adds Richard Russell, editor Dow Theory Letters, a stock market trends and securities report published since 1946. ""This is creating inflation, which erodes purchasing power. All the world’s central banks are inflating right now, reducing confidence in paper globally and encouraging gold-buying. India and China are spurring gold prices as well. India is the world’s largest gold-consumer, and the Chinese government is actively encouraging its citizens to buy gold."" All are extremely encouraging signs for gold investors. Over the course of the past 35 years, gold has climbed in value from a modest $35 an ounce to nearly $600. Contrast that with the battered U.S. dollar, a currency currently worth only 20% of its value in 1970. ""When gold peaked-out in the 1970s, interest rates were at an all-time high,"" Lubaszka says. ""Right now we’re waiting to feel the effects of the last 9 interest rate increases which generally take 6-9 months to begin impacting the economy.  Now’s the time to buy gold because when rates go up, downward pressure is exerted on real estate, stocks and bonds and commodities like gold tend to increase. The opposite occurs when rates travel from a high to a low. That’s the time to reduce gold assets and increase the paper part of a portfolio."" Buy Without Getting Burned Michelle Henderson, a talent agency owner in Los Angeles, Calif. understands the stakes when it comes to investing. ""As an agent I work in a commission-based world, and have to invest in both people and ideas all the time,"" she says. ""Though I’d had bad experiences with stock investments in the past, I knew I would eventually find something that would work for me.  I invested in a diversified metals portfolio made up of palladium, silver and gold, and earned a profit of 38% with the palladium alone. Staying focused on making money, and following World Financials advice, I was able to earn an above-average return and greatly increase the overall value of my assets safely."" Lubaszka explain, ""It’s probably best for the first time investor to begin conservatively by purchasing physical metals instead of gold stocks, which can be very volatile"". According to Clearwater, Fla.-based talk show host and gold analyst, Tom O’Brien, when metals gain 20%, gold equities jump by fifty or sixty per cent. That’s great when it happens but the reverse can occur as well. Buy gold bars or coins, and put them in a safety deposit box. If you chose to purchase coins from a coin shop, make certain you pay the lowest price possible and that they have a buy back policy. If you elect to go with a broker, fees will be inevitable because you are purchasing a tangible commodity. There are brokers, and then there are brokers. The best of the breed will answer all questions, and make the process of first-time gold buying less nerve-wracking. Great brokers are also accessible when needed, and quick to call with any new information that affects the value of the investment. Work with established companies, five years in business is good, ten even better. Don’t bother with firms that badger you with telemarketing offers or apply high-pressure sales tactics. Avoid paying high commissions too. Some brokers have layers of fees, through which they earn more money then they do investing on behalf of customers. There are also companies out there that will not buy metal back. Stay away from them as well. ""Check references and Better Business Bureau ratings"", Lubaszka adds. ""Deal with a company that takes an active interest in doing business with you. World Financial, for example, offers a five-star customer satisfaction guarantee. If questions are not answered or we fail to respond to a prospect’s call or email within 24 hours, that person receives a one ounce silver American Eagle coin free of charge. A financial advisor’s job is to ease the investment process, and to insure that customers get the most for their money. Good advisers are merely good, but the best are worth their weight in gold."" To contact World Financial directly call 818.264.4085.  World Financial is the premiere provider of precious metals to investors nationwide.  Aside from offering numerous incentive programs, World Financial offers clients the right type of precious metal strategy for every investor’s needs.  They are located at 12198 Ventura Blvd Ste 200, Studio City CA, 91604."
20,Why you shouldn't short-change your bedroom,finance," Think about how many hours you spend in your bedroom each week? Even if you’re simply getting back from work and crashing out, the hours still mount up. Having a bedroom that helps your mental and physical well being is essential for your overall health and you should invest time and money into making your bedroom as high quality as possible. Short-change your bedroom with poor quality mattresses or cheap furniture could lead to further more expensive issues further down the line. Not only can your sleep be affected by a poorly designed bedroom but you may develop problems with your back, neck and shoulders. How to invest in your bedroom There are many things you can do to invest in your bedroom and help to make it into a healthy sanctuary where you can enjoy quality rest and relaxation. The most important thing in any bedroom is a high quality mattress. The right mattress varies dramatically between different people but finding one to suit your size, shape and sleep preferences will really help you to see a difference in your sleep quality. Never short change your bed – you’ll instantly notice the difference. You also need to consider your pillows – so many back, neck and shoulder complaints come from poor quality, cheap pillows which have been bought simply because they don't cost a huge amount. Try to invest a bit of money into buying better quality pillows and you’ll save money further down the line in physical therapy expenses. Think about the light in your bedroom too. Always try and find black out blinds or thick curtains to ensure that you’re not woken early, especially in the summer months. Worried about paying for your bedroom improvements? If you’d like to improve your bedroom but don’t think that you can afford to make improvements to it, you could consider taking a personal loan. A personal loan is a great option for relatively small purchases that you can’t afford to make in one payment. By borrowing amounts of up to $5000, you’ll be able to enjoy making investments with higher price items – but you can pay these off in regular repayments over an agreed amount of time. Find the right personal loan for you by speaking with reputable lenders who can offer you a good rate of interest. Always ask about interest rates and fees and don’t be afraid to shop around and compare offers that you receive. If you’re unsure of the personal loan process or don’t feel comfortable asking questions to your lenders, ask for expert help. Expert brokers will be able to help with your application, direct you to responsible lenders and assist you through the process."

2,How To Get Wholesale Houses In 7 Days or Less,finance," Flipping houses for profit can be very lucrative if done right.  It can be a huge nightmare if you don’t know what you’re doing. My name is Tyrus Gross and I have been buying and selling real estate for over 25 years.  This article is a step-by-step blueprint to help you avoid the headaches I went through and to shave years off your learning curve. My sole purpose for writing this is to make sure you know exactly what to do to succeed at real estate investing. The material I’ve provided here is a brain dump of over 25 years of experience (both good and bad). In other words, I want you to avoid the mistakes I made and become as successful as possible as quickly as possible.  If your plan is to buy a house (actually take title to it) and then turn around and sell it, I’m going to show you the fastest, safest way to do that.  But first, I’m going to give you a little background on myself and teach you what not to do. I started investing in Los Angeles in 1989. Like many people, I spent a lot of time and money on real estate material. One so called guru taught me to get the list of pre-foreclosures and then go door-to-door. He instructed me to literally go knock on the door of people that were about to lose their home. Surprisingly, there were a few people that let me inside their house (as a side note, many people are very emotional when they’re about to lose their house). I had a friend that got invited in and he found out the hard way that the homeowner had a loaded shotgun in the back room and was extremely emotional about the fact that he was going to lose his home that he had been in for over 20 years and raised his family in.  For the record, I’m instructing you to never go door knocking uninvited. There’s a much better way to buy houses.  Never put your life in danger when buying houses. There are a ton of opportunities to buy discounted properties and I’m about to share with you much of what I’ve learned over the years. The fastest and most streamlined way to buy houses at a discount is to buy them from wholesalers. Before I explain the wholesale buying process, I would like you to envision what I was doing before that. I was told by several gurus that I needed to get a list of REOs (Real Estate Owned - an REO is simply a foreclosure that has gone back to the lender) and then buy the house from the bank at a deep discount. Let me tell you from experience, that is not an easy process unless you already have an established relationship with the REO manager at the bank. Even then, it’s a real challenge to get the bank to come down to a price you want to pay. Many times, door knocking and trying to buy REOs from the lender is a complete waste of time. I spent hours and hours, even months and months leaving voicemail messages just to get someone to call me back. I lost track of the number of voicemail messages I left for REO Managers (I don’t even know if I had the right person) and I called and recalled at least 40 different lenders. Let’s stop and think about that for a minute - months and months of time flushed down the drain. I don’t know about you, but I can’t stand to waste time. Even when you get a decision-maker on the phone, you still have to negotiate them down to a price that makes sense for you. Now let’s compare that to buying from a wholesaler, but first I want you to know exactly what a wholesale deal is. A wholesale deal normally is 70% of ARV (After Repair Value). So if the ARV is $100,000, a wholesale deal is no more than $70,000, which after you have made the repairs, leaves you with $30,000 in potential equity or profit. My personal philosophy is that if I can’t buy it wholesale, I’m not buying it. The average wholesaler gets five deals a month, every month. In addition, the wholesaler doesn’t make any money until he/she flips the property to an investor like you. In other words, they want to do business with you. When you call them, you’re not trying to sell them anything, you’re calling to make them money. That’s a call they enjoy taking. You may be asking how this process works and why the wholesaler is willing to do this. Using our example above, the wholesaler has the property tied up at $65,000 and flips it to you for $70,000. He/she is going to make $5,000 for every deal he/she flips without taking ownership of the property (they’re really just flipping/assigning their right to buy the property over to you). The wholesaler puts up very little money, usually $100-$1,000 to tie the property up and makes a nice chunk of change on the backend. Rinse and repeat. Keep in mind, the wholesaler is doing all the time-consuming activities and negotiating a great deal. I don’t know about you, but I’m fine with him/her making money as long as it’s still a wholesale deal. I suggest you get on the wholesaler’s email list to get first crack at these deals. I also suggest you also do an Internet search for wholesalers and let’s say you’re investing in Phoenix, AZ.  Type the words ‘wholesale houses for sale in Phoenix, AZ’.  Here’s a website that I recently located and gives you some idea of what I’m talking about.  http://phoenixwholesalehomes.com/  There are many ways to find wholesalers and I’ll go into greater detail on how to find them in my next article."
3,Trade War So What?,finance," ""Trade War"" So What?           September 17, 2018 Off and on now for months headlines in both print and television have been full with stories about the huge threat posed by the Trade Policy of the Trump administration. It is as if some horrible economic catastrophe will impoverish the world. Make no mistake, we are not Trump fans, but on this issue there truly is some fake news going on. Powerful economic (read Big Multinational Companies) and extreme ideological forces (read dishonest partisans) are at work here. There is certainly cause for concern but, to know where near what it is shaping up to be. The expansion of world trade in the past 50 years has been remarkable and in a general sense been of tremendous value to the people of poor countries. Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. There is however, an underlying perception that had this not proceeded in the manner that it did, people around the world would be suffering. First of all there was never was ""free trade"". There has always been and still are a wide range of tariffs on all kinds of goods. Even in so called free trade agreements there are still tariffs and exceptions to key industries and services. Another issue not appreciated is that the vast majority of world trade value is in discretionary goods or, depending on one’s judgment, luxury items. Think of BMW’s going from Europe to the U.S. and vice versa. Those who deride expanded trade with China as devastating developed world manufacturing jobs have a point when they ask ""So a set of cheap steak knives at Wal-Mart goes from $ 14.99 to $ 21.99 or a big flat screen T V goes from $2,500 to $3,200? The world economy is not going to grind to a halt. Trump got elected because of the long simmering resentment by Middle American’s that the developing world was stealing their jobs and taking advantage of open markets that they don’t allow. The real truth is that large multinational companies (the same one that closed their local factory in 2002) pushed for a system where they could move manufacturing to Thailand or Mexico or China and make more money. China and the rest of the developing world were simply taking advantage of the relentless push of world capitalism. As for lack of access, tariffs and non trade barriers, how many Cadillac’s or Harley Davidson’s are the Chinese and Japanese going to buy anyways? As our hard core technical analyst of the stock market will tell you"" what the pundits and talking heads attribute to the daily ups and downs in the market are rubbish! ""What are they supposed to say: Today the NASDAQ went down because there was more selling than buying? Taking any news and attributing it to explain the daily vagaries of the stock market is the original Fake News and always will be. Unfortunately it has a self fulfilling aspect that shades the truth. Today the real concern here is too much debt in China and too much U.S. dollar debt by governments and companies in the developing world. If there is a slowdown in the world economy it will be because of the unwinding of these issues.  Trump trade policies don’t help but they won’t be the cause. Fabio Braga, Director of Research,"
4,Does Cardonio Really Have Experience in Blockchain Projects?,finance," Starting any project is truly tough, either for an individual or a company. A person, for instance, needs to have the funds to build sailboat, which is a sizeable undertaking that not many people can think of accomplishing. Aside from that, one would have to have the skills and knowhow to complete the job. Moreover, it would really be to one’s advantage to have the actual experience of building a sailboat or somewhat similar, at least. All those are necessary, certainly. But here is the important issue: Do you really need to do everything by yourself? If you have the funds, can somebody else who is qualified do it for you or help you do it? This is a no-brainer actually. We have all heard of outsourcing. They used to simply call it ""hiring"" someone to help or to do something which you might easily do by yourself but prefer not to in order to free your time for other important things. How do you think George Westinghouse put up his giant power company, Westinghouse Electric? By studying and knowing how to generate electricity and teaching his people to do it? No, he hired Nikola Tesla who had invented alternating current. And the rest is history. Utilizing the same principle, Cardonio works along with industry experts who provide its core team with the skills needed to launch the company at the same time that new recruits and talents in the blockchain field are being hired to complete the organization. In the next year or two, Cardonio will grow even more in capability and in experience and will be able to make the market feel its presence and resilience. A child does not have to know everything an older person does in order for it to enjoy the pleasures of life; for it is self-contained at its own level of existence. In the same way, a new company need not have to have everything a big company has in order to make a difference in the business world. Cardonio is not into rocket science or power generation. It simply aims to provide excellent financial service to its customers in the most straightforward and fundamental level, while allowing them to reap the benefits they would not get anywhere else. This is how Cardonio builds its company and also how it hopes to gain the trust of the financial community."
5,Gold Investor,finance," Gold Investor Update: September 12, 2018 So far this year Gold has not been the place to be unless you bought it in mid December 2017 and sold it in late January for a roughly ten percent gain. Since a high of $1,362 per ounce on January 25 gold has been in fairly steady decline that has recently seen it bouncing around the $1,190 mark. In the short term it looks to be going lower. As any experienced investor knows, it is when something is out of favor with little positive sentiment; it is the time to start looking at it closely. As most investors know the most important medium term determinant in the price of Gold is the strength of the U. S. dollar against other currencies. In this regard the medium term price of Gold chart is an almost perfect inverse mirror of USD Index chart both in direction and percentage terms. There are of course some important longer term factors that will come into play that determine the relative percentage movements and these must not be forgotten but predicting the price of gold in the short and medium term largely involves predicting the strength of the U S dollar. Major geo-political events can certainly create large upside movements but are usually short lived and almost impossible to predict. Experienced gold traders will sell into these events. So to the U S dollar. It has been beating up world currencies for some time now with no immediate signs of stopping. For anyone expecting a big turnaround in Gold, a good look at the 20 year chart of the USD Index, is a reminder that the bottom may be a long time coming. What becomes obvious is roughly a six to eight year pattern that more or less coincides with the general business cycle. Now depending on how one interprets the chart, the latest upward wave began in 2014 and will not reverse until 2020 at the earliest. Again, subject to technical interpretation, we could see a cycle completion in 2020 with the USD Index in the 115 to 120 range. This would represent a 20 or so percent increase from the current trading range of 95.If the price of gold price does the normal historical correlation we may see the price drop to as low as $950 an ounce. For the average investor it is important to keep the above logic in mind.  Much of what is written about Gold is produced by what are called ""Gold Bugs"". These are people who either because of genuine belief or vested interest see all things pointing to scenarios where Gold goes to $5,000 or even $10,000 an ounce. Some of their arguments are quite compelling particularly when talking about massive government debts, bank failures and other financial catastrophes. History does repeat itself and there will be another melt down. We just don’t see it happening for two or three years. In any event we recommend that all investors keep a minimum of three percent of their total portfolio value in actual physical Gold in small denominations just in case the Gold Bugs are right.

6,Life Settlements: The Option of Selling Unwanted Life Insurance,finance," A life settlement consists of selling a life insurance policy to a company or agency other than your original insurance provider. When you sell your life insurance package, you usually receive more money than you would if you canceled or surrendered your policy. However, you also typically receive less than the policy’s agreed death benefit amount. Regardless life settlements are something to look into if you are interested in selling unwanted life insurance. Content Suggestions:	Life Settlements: The Option of Selling Unwanted Life Insurance A life settlement consists of selling a life insurance policy to a company or agency other than your original insurance provider. When you sell your life insurance package, you usually receive more money than you would if you canceled or surrendered your policy. However, you also typically receive less than the policy’s agreed death benefit amount. Regardless life settlements are something to look into if you are interested in selling unwanted life insurance. How Settlements and Selling Life Insurance Works Life settlements are an option if you are interested in selling your life insurance policy. The best way to go about doing so is to shop your policy by talking to a life-settlement broker or provider in order to find out what it’s worth. You will need to have copies of your insurance policy and medical records prior to beginning your discussions. Once you meet with a life-settlement broker, they will make you an offer based on certain criteria. Age, health, premiums, type of insurance package, and death benefits are all things they will take into consideration before making you an offer. If you chose to accept the offer, you will receive the agreed upon amount from your life-settlement broker and they will assume the responsibility of the policy. The new provider will be accountable for paying all premiums and eventually will receive the benefits upon death. Other Considerations It’s smart to take all things into consideration before deciding to sell your life insurance policy. One aspect to be cautious of is the possibility of incurring tax penalties when selling a life insurance policy. Furthermore, one of the most challenging aspects of selling a life insurance policy is making sure you are getting a fair price for your policy. Be smart, as most of the life-settlement industry works off commission from policies. Make sure to only use sites and agencies that you trust, as you don’t want your personal health care information shared during application processes. Another consideration when selling life insurance is that it might be harder to get another life insurance policy later in life. Every person has a maximum amount for which they can be insured for. Selling your life insurance policy might make it more expensive to purchase a policy later in life as your age and health changes. Be sure selling your policy is the right choice for you and your future. There’re many things to consider when thinking about life settlements and selling your life insurance policy.

7,Should We Trade With Brokers With Lowest Spreads?,finance," In the forex market, spread is considered the transaction fee to traders and profit to forex brokers. Therefore, all traders love the lowest spread brokers while to some of brokers, they want to raise it as much as possible. CLICK HERE FOR THE BEST ACCOUNT FOR BEGINNERS Today, I have shortened from the list of many brokers in forex market at the moment to top 5 who provide the least spread. The five are: Exness.com Hotforex.com FBS.com XM.com FxPro.com Maybe you know some others with even lower spread. But I did not choose any of them without reasons. Only scalpers need low spread. Scalpers are trader who trade with an account for a short time and soon close it. Unlike long term investors, they do not have to pay swap but pay in spread or commission. They can only earn some pips per order and the less spread is, the more they could keep for themselves. If you are about to invest for long time, no need to look at the list. You had better find the most reliable and the best in this list to trade with. In forex, there are many brokers which are divided into 3 types: Market maker, STP and ECN brokers. Among these, the final doesn’t charge clients by spread. Bank’s quotes to Market maker and STP brokers will be added up a bit (or Mash Up) and offered to traders. The difference of original quotes and final quotes is profited by those traders. Besides, they won’t charge you other transaction fee. ECN would give you the original quotes which they get from the bank, therefore, their spreads are usually low, sometimes zero. However, those brokers will charge you commission for trading you made. CLICK HERE FOR THE 5 BEST ECN BROKERS There’s a truth that you should have known. You cannot trade well with a distanced broker. My advice for my friend or any people who just came to the game is trading with local brokers. Forex is like business and you trade with risk of loss and liars. Local brokers are regulated and licensed by local authorities, they will protect you the best. For example, if you are Chinese, you should trade with Exness instead of XM. Exness has website and 24/7 live support in Chinese, you have their assistance any time. Moreover, Exness uses regulations of CySEC, it’s all trustworthy system and able to protect you from expected loss. On the other hand, XM in general offer higher spreads but XM is regulated by one of the most reliable system on earth, the FCA (UK). XM targets at European people so it lays offices and a perfect payment system there. We should know that paying for regulation cost a lot and some European policy do not allow high leverage, thus, these brokers quoted higher spreads. You can read more about XM spread review here. Other spreads for your reference: Broker Name	EUR/USD spread	Regulation Exness	0.7 Pip (Classic account)	CySEC, FCA Hotforex	1.1 Pip (Premium account)	Vincent FBS	1.1 Pip (Standard account)	Belize XM	1.7 Pips (Zero account)	FCA (UK) FXTM	1.7 Pips (Standard account)	Belize Forex.com	1.8 Pips 	NFA (US) FxPro	1.7 Pips 	FCA (UK) In my opinion, you can sum it up as following: Exness is the best for Asian scalpers due to its lowest spreads among the non-ECN brokers and it policy for new traders are more supportive than other brokers. XM and FxPro are the best choice for Africa traders because of the FCA regulations. It’s also good for Europeans, so does Exness. To US traders, I would like to recommend nothing than the Forex.com, even its spreads is the highest of the list, but for US regulated brokers, it’s still the least. For many brokers, they do not trade by an only way. In fact, a broker can charge commission or spreads or both, and for spreads, they also offer different types of spreads (such as fixed spread, variable spread,) so customers can choose the best way to do the business. They are all the best brokers all around the world that I recommended you to trade with, instead of the other. There are more reasons to choose a broker such as: reputation, scam reports, customer services, payment systems, trading types… and spread is just one of those. For example, Exness and XM have been established for almost ten years with network all over the world. There’s no scam reports you can find about them. So even you are long term investors or a new man just want to five forex a try, Exness or XM is still suitable. They even have a program for anyone who want to practice trading. In summary, it’s not difficult to list top lowest spread brokers. You might just need to go on their website or do some orders. However, not every of them is the best to trade with. Everything to brokers matters to your profit and rights. No matter how long you trade, a trustworthy broker should be selected. CLICK HERE FOR THE 5 BEST FOREX BROKERS"
8,5 Lowest Spread Forex Brokers Review,finance," Recently, I have received a lot of emails asking information about the lowest spread forex brokers. Obviously, it’s quite easy for me to make a list of 5 lowest spread brokers. However, those emailing me may not know what they want and what they should do with the list. Understanding that, I write this article to show the aspects of the lowest spread forex brokers. CLICK HERE FOR THE 5 BEST FOREX BROKERS Many of you may know that spread is the difference between the Bid and the Ask prices. Or in other words, it is the transaction fee you have to pay for brokers or banks. Most traders want to trade with the lowest spread brokers as their transaction costs are lower. In this article, I will focus on four aspects of top 5 lowest spread brokers which are differentiating between spread and commission, reasons making US and UK brokers’ spread higher, type of traders needing low spread brokers, and ways to choose a good low-spread broker. Forex brokers consist of three types: Market Maker, STP and ECN. The main income of Market Maker and STP brokers are spread. Also, when getting quotes from liquidity providers, they will add the transaction fee (spread) to those quotes (Mash Up process). As a result, their spreads are higher in comparison to that of ECN brokers. On the other hand, ECN brokers offer the exact quotes provided by liquidity providers. They hence will charge commission as it’s their main income. From what analyzed, I conclude that spread and commission are differentiated by three things. First, spread is the main income of Market Maker and STP brokers. Second, commission is the main income of ECN brokers. Third, you are charged both spread and commission for ECN accounts, but the spread is nearly zero. So you just have to pay commission. Following is the list of top 5 lowest spread non-ECN brokers for your reference as the question is about low spread brokers. Exness.com Hotforex.com FBS.com XM.com FxPro.com CLICK HERE FOR THE 5 BEST ECN BROKERS Though US and UK are the two largest international forex markets, their brokers are not as competitive as others in terms of transaction fee. Usually, their spread and commission are higher than that of Australian and CySEC ones. For more consideration, look at the table below. Broker’s name	EUR/USD spread	Regulation Exness	0.7 pip (classic account)	CySEC, FCA Hotforex	1.1 pips (premium account)	Vincent FBS	1.1 pips (standard account)	Belize XM	1.7 pips (zero account)	FCA (UK) FXTM	1.7 pips (standard account)	Belize Forex.com	1.8 pips	NFA (US) FxPro	1.7 pips	FCA (UK) The table shows that the lowest spread is offered by Exness brokers. The highest one is offered by US and UK brokers, which is double that of Exness ones. Now I will explain why US and UK brokers’ spread is higher: Being controlled by US and UK regulations, those brokers cannot offer high leverage. Besides, they have to pay regulation fee. Therefore, they have no choice but charging more spread and commission. Here, I have some advice which you can consult. ●	If you are Asian traders, Exness is the best broker for scalpers. ●	If you are African traders, XM and FxPro are the best. ●	If you are US traders, Forex.com is the number one. ●	If you are European traders, XM, FxPro and Exness are perfect choices for you. Traders include two types: scalpers and long-term investors. Scalpers open and close many positions within short time, and usually, they keep those positions less than a moth. Long-term investors keep their positions over a month. For scalpers, spread and commission are their main transaction costs. They just earn some pips for each order, so they tend to choose low-spread brokers. For long-term investors, they can earn hundreds of pips for each order, so they don’t care much about spread and commission. However, they have to pay swap which is sometimes up to 90% of their profit. Thus, they prefer brokers with low swap. Below are the conditions for choosing good low-spread brokers. Regulated brokers Brokers with local payment system Low spread and commission Good regional supporters. This is the end of my article. Though it cannot bring you all information you need, I hope it can help you get more awareness of top 5 lowest spread brokers. From that, you can select a suitable broker to trade with.

9,Bill gate Explains Change of Economy,finance," Bill gate has concluded that the system of Demand and Supply are changing fast  and the people as well as the government are not adapting quickly. He says that we live in a world with more intangible products like Software and other programs. These intangible products differ from how our own basic economy was built upon, now let's take an example. A person develops a piece of software and all they need to do is to make as many copies as the market demands and apparently making those copies Cost nothing at all not even a Penny. But if it's a car, the copies demands more materials to produce more of it. Bill gate reviewed his distinction as seen in his post about a book titled Capitalism without Capital. He says; ""What the book reinforced for me is that lawmakers need to adjust their economic policy making to reflect these new realities,"" Gates writes. ""For example, the tools many countries use to measure intangible assets are behind the times, so they're getting an incomplete picture of the economy."" It was also made vivid by Gates that The United State didn't Count Softwares as been part of the economy's GDP(Gross domestic Products). According the Haskel and Westlake, the the number of ""intangible"" products contributing to the economy began rising upward around 1994, a trend that has accelerated in the 21st century. ""Even today, GDP doesn't count investment in things like market research, branding, and training–intangible assets that companies are spending huge amounts of money on,"" Gates adds. But a huge question is how can we accurately measure the Economy, Gates suggest that we should switch the way we have been thinking traditionally: Here are some questions to consider: Should intangible products be patented and trademarked using a different set of rules than physical products? Should they be taxed differently? Should competition be defined differently in markets for intangible products? Although this is not a new topic but Gate's hypothesis is that the government should move faster to regulate economies where intangible goods are dominant."
10,Do Stock Market Numbers Really Matter?,finance," The last ""all time high"" in the S & P 500 (2,873) was struck just over six months ago, on January 26th. Since then, it has been down roughly 10% on three different occasions, with no shortage of ""volatility"", and an abundance of expert explanations for this nagging weakness in the face of incredibly strong economic numbers. • GDP is up, unemployment down; income tax rates lower, unfilled job numbers rising... The economy is so strong that, since April, it has become stable to upward in the very face of higher interest rates and an imminent trade war. Go figure! But what impact does this pattern have on you, particularly if you are a retiree or a ""soon-to-be""? Does a flat or lower stock market mean that you will be able to grow your portfolio income or that you will have to sell assets to maintain your current draw from your investment accounts? For almost all of you, unfortunately, it's the latter. I've read that 4%, after inflation, is considered a ""safe"" portfolio withdrawal rate for most retirees. Most retirement portfolios produce less than 2% of actual spendable income, however, so at least some security liquidation is required every year to keep the power on... But if the market goes up an average of 5% every year, as it has since 2000, everything is just fine, right? Sorry. The market just doesn't work that way, and as a result, there is absolutely no doubt that most of you are not prepared for a scenario even half as bleak as several of the realities packed inside the past twenty years. (Note that it took the NASDAQ composite index approximately sixteen years to rise above its 1999 highest level...even with the mighty ""FANG"". All of its 60%+ gain has occurred in the past three years, much the same as in the 1998 to 2000 ""no value"" rally.) • The NASDAQ has risen just 3% annually over the past 20 years including the production of less than 1% in spending money. • In spite of the dot.com rally from 1997 thru 1999, the S & P 500 lost 4% (including dividends) from year end 1997 to year end 2002. This translates into a nearly 5% per year asset drain or a total loss of capital around 28%. So your million dollar portfolio became $720k, and was still yielding less than 2% per year of actual spending money. • The ten year scenario (1997 through 2007) saw a modest 6% gain in the S & P, or growth of just .6% percent per year, including dividends. This scenario produces a 3.4% annual asset reduction, or a loss of 34%... your million was reduced to $660K, and we haven't gotten to the great recession yet. • The 6 years from 2007 to 2013 (including the ""great recession"") produced a net gain of roughly 1%, or a growth rate of about .17% per year. This 3.83% annual reduction  brought the $660k down another 25% leaving a nest egg of just $495k. • The S & P 500, gained roughly 5% from the end of 2013 through the end of 2015, another 5% draw, bringing ""the egg"" down to roughly $470k. • So, even though the S & P has gained an average 8% per year since 1998, it has failed to cover a modest 4% withdrawal rate nearly all of the time. ... i.e., in almost all but the past 2.5 years. • Since January 2016, the S & P has gained roughly 48% bringing the 'ole nest egg back up to about $695k... about 30% below where it was 20 years earlier... with a ""safe"", 4% draw. So what if the market performs as well (yes, sarcasm) over the next 20 years, and you choose to retire sometime during that period? And what if the 4% per year withdrawal rate is a less than realistic barometer of what the average retiree wants to (or has to) spend per year? What if a new car is needed, or there are health problems/family emergencies... or you get the urge to see what the rest of the world is like? These realities blow a major hole in the 4% per year strategy, particularly if any of them have the audacity to occur when the market is in a correction, as it has been nearly 30% of the time during this 20 year Bull Market. We won't even go into the very real possibility of bad investment decisions, particularly in the end stages of rallies... and corrections. • The market value growth, total return focused (Modern Portfolio Theory) approach just doesn't cut it for developing a retirement income ready investment portfolio... a portfolio that actually grows the income and the working investment capital regardless of the gyrations of the stock market. • In fact, the natural volatility of the stock market should actually help produce both income and capital growth. So, in my opinion, and I've been implementing an alternative strategy both personally and professionally for nearly 50 years, the 4% drawdown strategy is pretty much a ""crock""... of Wall Street misinformation. There is no direct relationship between the market value growth of your portfolio and your spending requirements in retirement, nadda. Retirement planning must be income planning first and growth objective investing maybe. Growth purpose investing (the stock market, no matter how it is hidden from view by the packaging) is always more speculative and less income productive than income investing. This is precisely why Wall Street likes to use ""total return"" analysis instead of plain vanilla ""yield on invested capital"". Let's say, for example, that you invested the 1998, retirement-in-sight, million dollar nest egg I was referring to above, in what I call a ""Market Cycle Investment Management"" (MCIM) portfolio. The equity portion of an MCIM portfolio includes: • Dividend paying individual equities rated B+ or better by S & P (so less speculative) and traded on the NYSE. These are called ""investment grade value stocks"", and they are traded regularly for 10% or lower profits and reinvested in similar securities that are down at least 20% from one year highs. • Additionally, especially when equity prices are bubbly, equity Closed End Funds (CEFs) provide diverse equity exposure and spending money yield levels typically above 6%. • The equity portion of such a portfolio generally yields in excess of 4%. The income portion of the MCIM portfolio, will be the larger investment ""bucket"" and it will contain: • A diverse assortment of income purpose CEFs containing corporate and government bonds, notes, and loans; mortgage and other real estate based securities, preferred stocks, senior loans, floating rate securities, etc. The funds, on average, have income payment track records that span decades. • They are also traded regularly for reasonable profits, and never held beyond the point where a year's interest in advance can be realized. When bank CD rates are less than 2% per year as they are now, a 4% short term gain (reinvested at between 7% and 9%) is not something to sneeze at. The MCIM portfolio is asset allocated and managed so that the 4% drawdown (and a short term contingency reserve) consumes just 70% or so of the total income . That's the ""stuff"" required to pay the bills, fund the vacations, celebrate life's important milestones, and protect and care for the loved ones. You just don't want to sell assets to take care of either essentials or emergencies, and here's a fact of investment life that Wall Street does not want you to know about: • The gyrations of the stock market (and interest rate changes) generally have absolutely no impact on the income paid by securities you already own and, falling market values always provide the opportunity to add to positions... • Thus reducing their per share cost basis and increasing your yield on invested capital. Falling bond prices are an opportunity of far greater importance than similar corrections in stock prices. A 40% equity, 60% income asset allocation (assuming 4% income from the equity side and 7.5% from the income side) would have produced no less than 6.1% in real spending money, in spite of two major market meltdowns that rocked the world during those twenty years. And that would have: • eliminated all annual draw downs, and • produced nearly $2,000 a month for reinvestment After 20 years, that million dollar, 1998, nest egg would have become roughly $1.515 million and would be generating at least $92,000 in spending money per year... note that these figures include no net capital gains from trading and no reinvestment at rates better than 6.1%. So this is, perhaps, a worst case scenario. So stop chasing that higher market value ""Holy Grail"" that your financial advisors want you to worship with every emotional and physical fiber of your financial consciousness. Break free from the restraints on your earning capabilities. When you leave you final employment, you should be making nearly as much in ""base income"" (interest and dividends) from your investment portfolios as you were in salary... Somehow, income production is just not an issue in today's retirement planning scenarios. 401k plans are not required to provide it; IRA accounts are generally invested in Wall Street products that are not structured for income production; financial advisors focus on total return and market value numbers. Just ask them to assess your current income generation and count the ""ums"", ""ahs"", and ""buts"". You don't have to accept this, and you will not become retirement ready with either a market value or a total return focus. Higher market values fuel the ego; higher income levels fuel the yacht.  What's in your wallet?"
11,The Questions Surrounding Filing Bankruptcy in New Jersey,finance," Bankruptcy can be an extremely scary yet very liberating process that one may realize is a positive alternative worth pursuing in their lives. No one sets out on a path to declare bankruptcy someday, but it can be reassuring to know that there are definite benefits one can receive if this ends up being the route that they end up taking. From stopping calls from creditors to possibly stopping the repossession of your home or car, to even being able to eliminate a certain percentage of your debt there can be many upsides to what many people consider to be an unfortunate state of affairs to be in. Obviously, there will have to be some hardships and inconveniences that need to be faced as well, which is why it will ultimately be up to the individual on whether or not this particular option is one that will benefit them in the end. Nonetheless, it is important to have knowledge about all of one’s options in this type of event in order to make the best decision you can going forward. There are many different reasons why a person can decide to declare bankruptcy, the main being that it offers someone a chance to get a fresh start financially. It can also be a solution that can seem like a miracle to those people that had no other way to catch up with all of their bills or money owed. Just how much debt is forgiven and how big of a hit your credit score will take are items that will depend on your exact financial situation, and while bankruptcy can help people get a clean slate it is not a process that people are allowed to do repeatedly except under very specific circumstances. Regardless, sometimes after a few big mistakes, all someone needs to be able to start their life over in a productive way is to be able to file bankruptcy in order to do so. Elimination of any percentage of your debt can be extremely helpful but it is not the only reason why someone would need to take advantage of this process. In addition to eliminating debt it also allows the person failing to pay their child support arrears over a period of time, it may restore their driver’s license if the only reason they were not able to carry one was because of surcharges that were owed and it also may eliminate a certain percentage of any debt that is owed because of income tax. The varying degrees in which all of this is possible again depends on everyone’s unique financial situation, so it is impossible to just list all of the outcomes that would definitely apply to you here. However, it will definitely benefit you to know all the avenues that are available to you when filing for bankruptcy. There is also the aspect on whether or not filing for bankruptcy will affect your credit, something that stops many people from even entertaining the idea. The truth is that bankruptcy will affect your credit in a negative way, just how negative depends on your circumstances. The other truth of the matter is that you may already have a low credit score which may be an added benefit of filing for bankruptcy in order to wipe the slate clean. This is because once a person finds their debt erased by bankruptcy, they will have more money to try and repair their credit over time as they are no longer burdened by the blanket of debt that had been covering them for so long. So while it may, in fact, affect your credit in the short term, as long as you are diligent about staying current with the new payments you will have going forward it is very possible that you will a chance to get your credit score to be the highest it has ever been one day. If and when you decide that bankruptcy is the correct option for you, there is also the decision on which type of bankruptcy to file: Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Chapter 7 is known as a liquidation bankruptcy because any assets that you own that are not protected under bankruptcy laws can be sold to repay your creditors. Since most people in this situation do not have more assets than they can protect you can very likely eliminate all of your unsecured debt such as credit card debt or medical bills without losing any of your possessions, an aspect that many people find very attractive. This can be a truly fresh start for people and depending on your income level, it may be the right choice for you. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is more of a repayment process, one where you can keep all of your assets as long as you fulfill the 3 to 5-year repayment plan on a certain percentage of your debt that is decided on by the courts. This can be beneficial for those who have the means to afford it. Since bankruptcy normally deals with those who are having a hard time coming by funds, it is easy to see why this is not the more typical route. Regardless of which type of bankruptcy you file it is important to note that not every type of debt can be eliminated through the process. Any student loans, payments for child or spousal support, or any money owed for violating the law are all types of debt that bankruptcy will not be able to help you with. There are many different scenarios that bankruptcy could possibly help you take care of, but these are all classified as the kind of debt that cannot be removed in any way in this fashion. The courts will help you get out of numerous agreements that you originally intended to keep but these type of responsibilities are obligations that you will not be able to get out of no matter what type of bankruptcy you file."
12,Income Investing Paradox: High Dividend Equity ETFs and Mutual Funds,finance," Several years ago, while fielding questions at an AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) meeting in Northeast NJ, a comparison was made between a professionally directed ""Market Cycle Investment Management"" (MCIM) portfolio and any of several ""High Dividend Select"" equity ETFs. • My response was: what's better for retirement readiness, 8% in-your-pocket income or 3%? Today's' response would be 7.85% or 1.85%... and, of course, there is not one molecule of similarity between MCIM portfolios and either ETFs or Mutual Funds. I just took a (closer-than-I-normally-would-bother-to) ""google"" at four of the ""best"" high dividend ETFs and a, similarly described, group of high dividend Mutual Funds. The ETFs are ""marked-to"" an index such as the ""Dividend Achievers Select Index"", and are comprised of mostly large capitalization US companies with a history of regular dividend increases. The Mutual Fund managers are tasked with maintaining a high dividend investment vehicle, and are expected to trade as market conditions warrant; the ETF owns every security in its underlying index, all of the time, regardless of market conditions. According to their own published numbers: • The four ""2018's best"" high dividend ETFs have an average dividend yield (i.e., in your checkbook spending money) of... pause to catch  your breath, 1.75%. Check out: DGRW, DGRO, RDVY, and VIG. • Equally income unspectacular, the ""best"" Mutual Funds, even after slightly higher management fees, produce a whopping 2.0%. Take a look at these: LBSAX, FDGFX, VHDYX, and FSDIX. Now really, how could anyone hope to live on this level of income production with less than a five or so million dollar portfolio. It just can't be done without selling securities, and unless the ETFs and funds go up in market value every month, dipping into principal just has to happen on a regular basis. What if there is a prolonged market down turn? The funds described may be best in a ""total return"" sense, but not from the income they produce, and I've yet to determine how either total return, or market value for that matter, can be used to pay your bills.... without selling the securities. Much as I love high quality dividend producing equities (Investment Grade Value Stocks are all dividend payers), they are just not the answer for retirement income ""readiness"". There is a better, income focused, alternative to these equity income production ""dogs""; and with significantly less financial risk. • Note that ""financial"" risk (the chance that the issuing company will default on its payments) is much different from ""market"" risk (the chance that market value may move below the purchase price). For an apples-to-apples comparison, I selected four equity focused Closed End Funds (CEFs) from a much larger universe that I have been watching fairly closely since the 1980s. They (BME, USA, RVT, and CSQ) have an average yield of 7.85%, and a payment history stretching back an average 23 years. There are dozens of others that produce more income than any of the ETFs or Mutual Funds mentioned in the ""best of class"" google results. Although I am a firm believer in investing only in dividend paying equities, high dividend stocks are still ""growth purpose"" investments and they just can't be expected to generate the kind of income that can be relied upon from their ""income purpose"" cousins. But equity based CEFs come very close. • When you combine these equity income monsters with similarly managed income purpose CEFs, you have a portfolio that can bring you to ""retirement income readiness""... and this is about two thirds the content of a managed MCIM portfolio. When it comes to income production, bonds, preferred stocks, notes, loans, mortgages, income real estate, etc. are naturally safer and higher yielding than stocks... as intended by the investment gods, if not by the ""Wizards of Wall Street"". They've been telling you for nearly ten years now that yields around two or three percent are the best they have to offer. They're lying through their teeth. Here's an example, as reported in a recent Forbes Magazine article by Michael Foster entitled ""14 Funds that Crush Vanguard and Yield up to 11.9%"" The article compares both yield and total return, pointing out pretty clearly that total return is meaningless when the competition is generating 5 or 6 times more annual income. Foster compares seven Vanguard mutual funds with 14 Closed End Funds.... and the underdogs win in every category: Total Stock Market, Small-Cap, Mid-Cap, Large-Cap, Dividend Appreciation, US Growth, and US Value. His conclusion: • "" When it comes to yields and one-year returns, none of the Vanguard funds win. Despite their popularity, despite the passive-indexing craze and despite the feel-good story many want to believe is true—Vanguard is a laggard."" Hello! Time to get your retirement readiness income program into high gear and stop worrying about total returns and market value changes. Time to put your portfolio into a position where you can make this statement, unequivocally, without hesitation, and with full confidence: ""Neither stock market volatility nor rising interest rates are likely to have a negative impact on my retirement income; in fact, I am in a perfect position to take advantage of all market and interest rate movements of any magnitude, at any time... without ever invading principal except for unforeseen emergencies."" *Note: no mention of any security in this article should be considered a recommendation of any kind, for any specific action: buy, sell"
13,Bad credit small business loans for small businesses,finance," There are numerous small businesses who are looking for small business loans, without good credit scores. We provide small businesses small business loans for poor credit without a hitch, our process is simple practical and quick. Banks on the other hand do have some hang-ups when it comes to providing small businesses with funding, and this is because small businesses are considered to be high risk investments. Due to this reason over 90% of all small business loan applications that banks receive are rejected. We provide small businesses with the loans they require, and our qualification criteria are completely different from those of the banks. Our criteria are simple, practical, and reasonable and as a result of this, almost all small businesses who require the funding also qualify for it. Mentioned below here are the basic criteria that we have, and based on these criteria a small business owner will be able to tell if they qualify for the small business line of credit bad credit or not. The owner of the business should not be in any form of active bankruptcy at the time of the loan application. The business should be at least 12 months old and a running business throughout and also running at the time of the loan application. The gross monthly income of the business needs to be at least $10 thousand or over that amount to qualify for the funding. These are the simple and easy criteria that we have, and as a result of these criteria most small businesses are able to qualify. However, there are yet more features associated with the funding that we provide that go on to make the entire process a quick and hassle free experience for the customer. The processing time frames that we have to provide small businesses with small business loans no credit checks is very quick. We can get the funding to you as quickly as 48 to 72 hours from the time of the loan application. At the latest we will provide you with the funding you require within a week to ten days, not over that period of time. Again, here banks are in no hurry to provide small businesses with the funding they require, and as a result the least amount of time that a bank will take is at least a couple of months or over that period of time. The credit scores of the applicants business do not impact the loan, as a a result we work with many small businesses whose credit scores are in the low to mid 500s, and we do provide them with small business loans no credit. This is not something that any one should expect from the banks also, banks do require high credit scores and would prefer to see credit scores that are above average, and also in the 700s range if possible. We also do not ask small businesses for collateral and security to provide us with the funding they require. This is a very big advantage for small businesses, as many of them do not have the necessary collateral required. Banks on the other hand do require collateral and security from small businesses, and the value of that needs to be double the value of the funding always. For more information related to the bad credit small business loans that we provide, contact us. Our funding team will provide you with the information you require, and also assist you with the application for the loan as well. If you would prefer to fill in the application online, simply click on the ‘get started’ tab and fill in the application form yourself."
14,Tron Acquires Bittorrent: TRX Price Goes Up,finance," The recent news of Tron's acquisition of BitTorrent has gotten people very interested in the company, and the price of TRX (which is the cryptocurrency associated with Tron) has been increasing ever since the news was let out. Tron launched a Main-net at the end of last month, and by all accounts, it was very successful.  For those of you who aren’t sure what a Main-net is, we can tell you that blockchains usually have a Main-net, which is the one that transfers their cryptocurrency, and a Test-net.  As the name implies, this is only for initially testing the blockchain. We are now waiting to see the token movement from the ERC 20 to the new blockchain protocol.  While this was going on the news came down that Tron bought out BitTorrent for the sum of $140 million.  This has been in talks for a while, but the recent report of the buyout has been published. While there are still details yet to iron out, and the shareholders are still yet to set this in stone, it is highly unlikely that this acquisition will not go through at this point. Starting on the 21st of this month, the token migration will begin from the ERC 20 to the new Odyssey blockchain. This is a massive boost in confidence for Tron investors, and anyone else looking to invest their money into this company.  It is probably also a good thing for the market as a whole because it will introduce some more hype into the market that is now down under $400 Billion as of this writing.  The hope is that soon cryptocurrency will soon stabilize and bounce back up. What we don’t know is how Tron expects to use this partnership, and exactly what plans it has for its growth.  Tron recently was heard to say that they plan to use this technology to ""legitimize"" its business. Many people initially thought that Tron was just a scam because its white paper didn’t inspire a lot of confidence in the company as some of its partnerships seemed to be fake. This is probably all about Tron trying to prove themselves to the world and show that they mean business when it comes to the cryptocurrency space. BitTorrent can boast 170 million users across their suite of products, which is rooted in the entertainment industry as a peer to peer communication protocol (P2P). Their products allowing people to transfer files over the internet, and usually used for transferring things like TV shows, movies, music, etc.  P2P is collectively able to claim some 43 to 70 percent (as of 2009) of all internet traffic worldwide, and Tron, it seems, wants to have an entertainment powerhouse cryptocurrency dominating that network. So, for the investors in Tron, this is huge news that shows their investments may soon pay off richly."
15,Best Financial Investment Companies Overview,finance," Five top rated financial investment firms that are growing faster than their peers are FXCATCHER, Schwab, Ally Invest, Scottrade, and TD Ameritrade. This article will make a detailed analysis of each company and try to determine what exactly investors like about these companies that cause them to expand.

Founded in California in 1971, the company went public as The Charles Schwab Corporation in 1987. In 1997, the company had a million online accounts, and just one year later, it had double that amount. In 2003, the company launched an FDIC-insured bank, and by 2012, it had more than $2 trillion in client assets. Today, it has offices around the world and services around 10 million accounts.

An on-line chat function is available on the broker's website, and Chinese speakers can reach an associate over the phone who speak Mandarin or Cantonese. Ally Invest A third brokerage firm that is showing signs of strong growth is Ally Invest (also known as TradeKing). Founded in 2005, the company has steadily grown in size. In 2012, the company merged with low-cost broker Zecco.com. This was followed in 2014 by the creation of TradeKing Advisors, an on-line portfolio management firm. It was announced that Ally Financial, a company with more than $150 billion in client assets, has agreed to acquire the TradeKing Group. In its eleven-year history, Ally Invest has grown from an unknown broker to one with 260,000 accounts. Remarkably, it has done this with little advertising. It currently has $4.5 billion in customer assets. What has attracted so many investors to Ally Invest is the broker's emphasis on low fees and commissions. Charging just $4.95 for stock and ETF trades, the brokerage house is one of the lowest-cost firms in the business. Ally has said it has no plans to change the Ally Invest commission schedule. This includes option contracts at just 65¢ each. While the firm does not offer mutual funds that are both no load and no transaction fee, it does offer all loads funds free to trade, while no-load funds cost just $9.95 per transaction. Scottrade Scottrade recently has been acquired by TD Ameritrade - read about it in the next section. Scottrade has also been expanding its footprint in the securities world in recent years.

Within ten years, the company had 15 locations across the country. In 1994, Inc. magazine named the firm one of the fastest growing private companies in the United States. In 2000, the company changed its name to Scottrade, and by 2007, it had reached over 300 brick-and-mortar locations. In 2008, Scottrade hired nearly 1,000 financial advisors and opened Scottrade Bank. Today, the company has more than 500 offices throughout the country, an investment advisory division, and over a $1 billion in annual revenue. TD Ameritrade Scottrade's growth did not go unnoticed, which is probably why TD Ameritrade purchased it last year. Without Scottrade, TD Ameritrade today has more than $600 billion in client assets, with customers placing around 400,000 trades per day. The company began in Omaha, Nebraska in 1975 with much smaller operations. Starting in the early 2000's, the firm began buying other companies, fueling its growth. In 2009, TD Ameritrade purchased thinkorswim, which at that time was the fastest growing broker. The recent acquisition of Scottrade will give TD Ameritrade almost overnight a much larger presence in the brokerage world. Assuming regulators approve the sale, the new TD Ameritrade will have more than 600 brick-and-mortar locations across the United States. This network will be the largest of any on-line discount broker. Wrapping Up While some top financial investment firms are shrinking in size, these five have expanded, sometimes from nothing. The fact that investors trust them with enormous sums of money is a good sign that these companies have excellent financial services."

17,Bitcoin Electricity Consumption – Part 2,finance," The debate rages on as bitcoin electricity consumption increases… Earlier this year, we published an article on bitcoin electricity consumption, reporting how Iceland has become one of the top locations for cryptocurrency servers, which now exceed the consumption of private energy users. Now, the criticism amongst ecological circles and the debates around bitcoin electricity consumption have been fuelled by a paper by Alex de Vries of PwC’s Experience Center in Amsterdam. His paper, Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem, concludes that bitcoin’s electricity consumption could soon be heading above a consumption rate of 8 gigawatts (GW) per year. The paper’s findings: At the moment, the bitcoin network consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity – as high as the annual energy consumption of Ireland. This could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future – close to the energy consumption of the entire nation of Austria (8.2 GW). By the end of 2018, the mining of bitcoin could be using as much as 0.005% of the entire world’s energy use. The reality is that bitcoin uses a massive amount of energy. Author Alex de Vries says: ""The bitcoin development community is experimenting with solutions such as the Lightning Network to improve the throughput of the network, which may alleviate the situation. For now, however, bitcoin has a big problem and it is growing fast."" Why does bitcoin mining require so much energy? The bitcoin mining process uses computers with software that can solve complex mathematical problems. A new block is added to the blockchain every time a new problem is solved, rewarding the miner with bitcoins. This process requires a lot of energy because the computers need to ledger all the transactions so that the same coins aren’t spent twice – this takes time and consumes a lot of electricity. How can bitcoin electricity consumption become sustainable? De Vries’ research reveals that if the price of bitcoin continues to go down, and the amount of energy needed to mine it continues to rise, bitcoin investment could become inefficient. One of the ways this can be avoided is if the world shifts to 100% renewable energy in the years ahead. With renewables, the environmental and efficiency concerns around bitcoin energy usage would be negated. But is it possible to go 100% green? New research from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews journal found that a shift to total renewable energy using contemporary technology is both possible and affordable. Co-author of the research, Brian Vad Mathiesen of Aalborg University says: ""There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible. Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let’s get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose."" If we were to eliminate fossil fuel usage, this would eliminate the environmental and efficiency challenges caused by energy-intensive bitcoin mining. It’s not impossible to imagine a world in which bitcoin is used exclusively, backed by green energy. If there’s one thing we’ve learnt over time, it’s to ‘never say never’…"
18,Real Estate Outlook May 2018,finance," LOS ANGELES, CA. Recently, we have seen a cyclone of economic and political news and developments that has affected the real estate industry. Overall, these developments have created somewhat higher downside risks.  Growth and inflation data over the last month have not come up to our forecasts. In our view, the mixed data suggests a temporary pause in growth. Lower inflation data could indeed imply slightly higher labor costs and perhaps the continuation of a Pollyanna outcome. The Federal Government is moving ahead with monetary tightening. Several risks are rising, in our view. First, the risk of an escalation in trade tensions, with the investigation into Chinese intellectual property practices. Second, risks in the Middle East are rising again. Third, rising tensions with European countries could hinder an already-difficult reform process. In addition, there is a flattening in the US Treasury yields. Currently, we do not think that these developments have a major significance for the real estate markets. However, if there is a return to a situation of rising risk in the US dollar, this upset could cause prices to become volatile again. Although Treasury yields have flattened again, they are close to the recent lows. At this point, we think there is no major cause for concern yet. In the US, the downward revision of the first quarter 2018 is partly offset by some upward revision for fourth quarter 2017, and employment remained strong. . Overall, growth in the first quarter still appears to be at a 3% pace, and is expected to pick up later in the year, because of the effects of the US fiscal stimulus. Because of robust growth and subdued inflation, we believe that this has supported valuations of the industry over the last few years. Keep in mind, there are questions during the period of moderate financial market volatility. The most recent data suggest that the Pollyanna effect may persist for a little longer. Therefore, we are staying with our belief of economic growth. However, it is still too early to jump to a conclusion as to the end of the current upswing, despite ongoing trade tensions. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that institutional investors bought more single-family rental homes in 2017 than in previous years, the first increase since 2013, according to data compiled by Amherst Holdings. Wall Street firms such as Blackstone Group and Tom Barrack’s Colony Capital Inc. rushed into the single-family rental business when U.S. housing markets were reeling from the foreclosure crisis and homes were available and cheap. The feeding frenzy was short-lived. By 2014, big landlords were already paring back their purchases as foreclosures dried up and they tackled the challenge of managing widespread homes. Now they’re buying again, at a time when single-family landlords are raising rents faster than apartment owners are. While multifamily landlords face pricing pressure from new supply, very few single-family homes are built specifically for leasing. Demand for rental houses ""feels like it’s insatiable,"" Gary Berman, chief executive of Tricon Capital Group Inc., said in an interview. Tricon, the third-largest publicly traded owner of U.S. rental houses behind Invitation Homes Inc. and American Homes 4 Rent, bought about 850 homes last year, said Amherst, which analyzed data from CoreLogic Inc. The biggest purchaser was Cerberus Capital Management, with an estimated 5,100 houses. Amherst itself bought almost 4,900 homes through its Main Street Renewal subsidiary. There’s another factor driving Wall Street’s renewed acquisitiveness. Now with their businesses well established, the large landlords are having an easier time financing purchases, said Greg Rand, CEO of OwnAmerica, an online platform for buying and selling rental houses. Rental properties should remain well ahead of other major property types because they are generally more stable. Three important factors account for this stability: They are less dependent on business cycles for occupancy than any      other types of real estate investments. It does not matter if interest rates and home prices are high or low, rental properties are generally more affordable. Rental properties have shorter leases; thereby offering greater protection from inflation than the long-term leases associated with other properties. That is, rents can be negotiated more frequently. The pool of tenants is much greater for rental properties than other types of 	properties. This ensures a more consistent occupancy than industrial and commercial properties, which usually have only a few tenants from which to 	 choose."
19,"The Art of Investing: A New Wall Street ""Line Dance""",finance," It matters not what lines, numbers, indices, or gurus you worship, you just can't know where the stock market is going or when it will change direction. Too much analytical effort is wasted trying to predict course corrections… even more is squandered comparing changes in portfolio ""market value"" with unrelated indices and averages. If we reconcile in our minds that we can't predict the future (or change the past), we can move through the uncertainty more productively. Let's simplify portfolio performance evaluation by using information that we don't have to speculate about, and which is related to our own personal investment programs. Why has it become vogue to think of investment portfolios as sprinters in a twelve-month race with an  array of indices and averages?  Because an unhappy investor is Wall Street's best friend, and by emphasizing short-term results in a superbowlesque environment, the vast majority of investors will be unhappy about something, all of the time. To personalize your performance evaluation protocol, you just need to focus your attention on two, longer-range, objectives: • Growing your productive ""working capital"", and • Increasing your ""base income"". Neither objective is directly related to market averages, interest rate movements, market values, or the calendar year. But with this focus, investors can protect themselves from the short-term thinking associated with daily events and ""expert"" analyses. Objective based performance analysis is less frantic, less competitive, and more constructive than conventional methods... so let's define our terms. Briefly, ""working capital"" is the total cost basis of the securities and cash in the portfolio, and ""base income"" is the total of dividends and interest that the portfolio produces. Deposits and withdrawals, capital gains and losses, directly impact the working capital number, and indirectly, the base income. Securities become non-productive when they are no longer Investment Grade Value Stocks (IGVS), or no longer income producing. Good sense management can minimize these unpleasant experiences. Let's develop an ""all you need to know"" chart that will help you manage your way to goal achievement in a low failure rate, unemotional, environment. The chart will have four data lines, and your portfolio management objective will be to keep three of them moving ever upward through time. Note that a separate record of deposits and withdrawals (the only downward moving line on the chart) should be maintained. If you are paying fees or commissions separately from your transactions, consider them withdrawals of ""working capital"". If you don't have specific selection criteria and profit taking guidelines, you need to develop them. Line One charts your ""working capital"", and an average annual growth rate between 5% and 10% would be a reasonable target, depending on asset allocation. (An average cannot be determined until after the second full year, and a longer period is recommended to allow for compounding.) Note that the working capital line should be an upward only line (Did that raise an eyebrow?) It is increased by dividends, interest, deposits, and realized capital gains and decreased by withdrawals and realized losses. • There are two basic truths at the bottom of this: You just can't make too much money, and there's no such thing as a bad profit. Don't pay a CPA who recommends loss taking on high quality securities; explain that you are helping him reduce his own tax burden. Link to ""line dance"" chart in resource box. Line Two reports ""Base Income"", and it too will always move upward if you are managing your asset allocation properly. The only exception could be a 70% (or higher) equity allocation, where the emphasis is on a more variable source of income… the dividends on a constantly changing stock portfolio. • This ""expert"" suggests a maximum 60% equity allocation as a key to eventually achieving retirement income readiness. Line Three is labeled: Cumulative Net Realized Capital Gains. This total is most important during the early years of portfolio building and it will directly reflect both the security selection criteria you use, and the profit taking rules you employ... look inward if this line is not growing in all market environments. If you build a portfolio of IGVSs, and apply a maximum 5% of cost basis diversification rule, you will rarely have a downturn in this monitor of both your selection criteria and your profit taking discipline. Unless your selection criteria is too conservative, there will always be something out there worth buying with the proceeds. • Three 8% singles will produce a larger number than one 25% home run, and which is easier to obtain? The growth in Line Three should accelerate in rising markets. Base income just keeps growing because asset allocation is based on the cost basis of each security class… get it? At least 40% of every income dollar is reallocated to income purpose securities. One other important detail: no matter how conservative your selection criteria, a security or two is bound to become a loser. Don't judge this by Wall Street popularity standards, tea leaves, or analyst opinions. Let the fundamentals (profits, S & P rating, dividend action, etc) send up the red flags. This brings us to Line Four, the change in Total Portfolio Market Value over the course of time. This line will follow an erratic path, constantly staying below your Working Capital. If you study the chart after a market cycle or two, you will see that lines one through three move steadily upward regardless of what line four is doing. BUT, you will also notice that the lows of line four begin to occur above earlier highs. Line four will rarely be above line one, but when it begins to close the gap, a greater movement upward in Line three (Net Realized Capital Gains) should be expected. In 100% income purpose portfolios, it is possible for market value to exceed working capital by a slight margin, but it is much more likely that you are ignoring some profit taking opportunities. • Don't let this happen. Studies show that far too many unrealized gains are brought to the Schedule D as realized losses... and this includes potential profits on income securities. If you can ""net"" a year's interest in advance (or 5%) on an income purpose security, reel it in without hesitation. • When your portfolio hits a new ""market value"" high, look around for a growth purpose security that no longer boasts IGVS status and bite that bullet. What's different about this approach, and why isn't it more high tech? Why is there no mention of the popular market indices, or comparison with anything except your very own, personal, reasonable, goals? This method gets you where you want to be without any hype or non-productive transactions. It provides a valid use for portfolio market value, as both an expectation clarifier and an action indicator for the portfolio manager (i.e., you)... and your ""light bulb"" should be on. Most investors will focus on line four because they have been brainwashed into thinking that lower market values are always bad and higher ones always good. You need to get outside of the ""market value vs. everything else"" box if you hope to achieve your long term retirement readiness goals. Cycles rarely fit the January to December mindset, and here's a chance to make the market value line a valuable tool. If it rises above working capital, you are missing profit opportunities. If it falls, start looking for buying opportunities. If your base income line falls, so has: the quality of your holdings or your asset allocation. So it really is OK if your market value falls in a falling IGVS market or in the face of higher interest rates. The important thing is to understand why. If it's a surprise, then you don't really have a feel for what's inside your portfolio. You may also have to find a better way to gauge what is going on in your markets. Neither media talking heads nor the popular averages are the answer. You need to stick with IGVS equities no matter what is generally popular; you need to diversify properly using working capital as the definitive element; you need to set and apply reasonable target profits on absolutely every security in your portfolio. This disciplined ""line dance"" may not be as exciting day-to-day, but when it's time to think about ""hangin' em up"", your retirement ready income portfolio will give you the broadest smile (and the highest yield on invested capital) on the tee box."

1,Things you didn't realise contributed to a bad credit rating,finance," Your credit rating can dictate every part of your future plans, from buying a house to paying for your next holiday. Here are the top things you may not realise affect your credit rating. When applying for a loan, the lender looks at your credit card limit, not the amount you owe on your card. Even if you only use $1000 of a $50,000 limit, the lender will still treat you as though you regularly borrow $50,000. A smaller limit will help keep your credit rating higher. Your credit score is calculated against your debts using a debt-to-credit ratio or debt utilisation ratio. Rather than looking at how often you pay off your debts, credit raters also look at the amount of available credit you are currently using. If you’re using more than 10-30% of your available credit limit, your credit rating will likely be impacted. Any overdue payment larger than $150, paid later than 60 days counts overdue, which is listed on your credit score for five years. Even small amounts matter. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)’s report on your credit doesn’t reveal the amount on your missed payment; only that you missed the payment. This is an obvious one; but if you’re trying to escape fees on your credit card by moving the balance to a different bank, your rating will become lower. Every time you apply for a line of credit including a credit card, your credit rating is impacted. Even if you don’t even go ahead with the credit card and you never even use it, just applying affects your rating. ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’ doesn’t apply when it comes to loans. Every time you apply for a loan, even if you don’t go ahead with it, your credit rating is reduced. If you’ve been involved in any financial court judgements, as well as insolvency or bankruptcy, your credit score will be reduced. If you and your partner have joint bank accounts or a mortgage in both your names, you’ll want to ensure you submit your repayments correctly and on time. Even if your partner isn’t listed on the loan, their repayment history will influence your credit score. If you have a pristine credit history and change your name without letting lenders know, your credit history will be lost. A perfect credit history is one of the best ways to ensure an ongoing high credit rating. Use it or lose it to keep a good credit rating. The OAIC shows if you’ve missed just one payment in your monthly stack of bills, your credit history will still show you’ve not met your obligations for the entire month. Don’t let small mistakes lower your credit rating. Stay on top of your obligations so when you need a loan, you can get it."
2,Harnessing Stock Market Volatility,finance," If you were to Google ""stock market volatility"", you would find a wide range of observations, conversations, reports, analyses, recipes, critiques, predictions, alarms, and causal confusion. Books have been written; indices and measuring tools have been created; rationales and conclusions have been proffered. Yet, the volatility remains. Statisticians, economists, regulators, politicians, and Wall Street gurus have addressed the volatility issue in one manner or another. In fact, each day's gyrations are explained, reported upon, recorded for later expert analysis, and head scratched about. The only question I continue to have about all this comical hubbub is why don't y'all just relax and enjoy it? If you own only high quality income generating securities, diversify properly, and adopt a disciplined profit-taking routine, you can make stock market volatility your very best friend (VBF). Decades ago, a nameless statistics professor brought me out of a semi-comatose state with an observation about statisticians, politicians, and economists. ""In the real world"", he said, ""there are liars, damn liars, and any member of the groups just mentioned"". An economist or a politician, armed with a battery of statistics, is an ominous force indeed. Well, now, all economists and statisticians have high powered computers and the ability to analyze volatility with the same degree of certainty (or is it arrogance) that they have developed with regard to individual-stock risk analysis, economic and geographical sector correlation dynamics, and future prediction in general. • But the volatility (and the uncertainty it either causes or results from, depending upon the expert you listen to) persists. Modern computers are so powerful, in fact, that economists and statisticians can now calculate the investment prospects of just about anything. So rich in statistics are these masters of probabilities, alphas, betas, correlation coefficients, and standard deviations, that the financial world itself has become, mundane, boring, and easy to deal with. Yeah, sure it has. Since they can predict the future with such a high degree of probability, and hedge against any uncertainty with yet another high degree of probability, why then is the financial world in such a chronic state of upheaval? And why-o-why does the volatility, and the uncertainty, continue? I expect that you are expecting an opinion (yet another opinion) on why the volatility is as pronounced as it seems to be compared with years past. Frankly, Scarlett, I can't really make myself give a damn. The uncertainty that we are asked to believe is caused by volatility just simply is not. Uncertainty is the regulation playing field of the investment game... and of life, actually. The more you invest in higher risk securities, the more you speculate on future directional change, the more you ignore growing income, and focus only on market value, the more uncertain your investment environment becomes. So risk, speculation, poor diversification, low income generation, and up only market value expectations combine to exacerbate uncertainty, but nothing can eliminate it... only that is certain. Volatility, on the other hand is simply a force of nature, one that needs to be embraced and dealt with constructively if one is to succeed as an investor. But this machine driven, hyper-volatility that we have been experiencing recently, has been magnified by the darkest forces of the ""dismal science"" and the changes that it has encouraged in the way financial professionals view the makeup of the modern investment portfolio. On the bright side, enhanced market volatility actually enhances the power of the equity and income security trading disciplines and strategies within the Market Cycle Investment Management (MCIM) methodology... an approach to market reality that embraces market turbulence, and harnesses market volatility for results that leave most professionals either speechless or in denial. • MCIM focuses on the highest quality equity securities and well diversified income security portfolios, creating a lower than normal risk environment where price fluctuations can be dealt with productively, without panic. Higher prices generate profit taking transactions; lower prices invite additional investment. The underlying quality, diversification, and income generation create a more tolerable ""uncertainty quotient"" than other methodologies. But, with no statistical data necessary (or available) to support the following opinion, consider this simplistic rationale for the hyper-volatility of today's stock market. Volatility is a function of supply and demand for the common stock of a finite number of dirty, evil, greedy, polluting, congress corrupting, job creating, product and service providing, innovation and wealth developing, foundation supporting, gift giving, tax-collecting corporations. Those of us who trade common stocks in general, Investment Grade Value Stocks in particular, owe a debt of gratitude to the real volatility creators: the hundreds of thousands of derivative products that bring an entirely speculative kind of indirect supply and demand to the securities markets. Generally speaking, the fundamental, emotional, political, economic, global, environmental, and psychological forces that impact stock market prices have not changed significantly, if at all. Short term market movements are just as unpredictable as they have ever been. They continue to cause the uncertainty you need to deal with, by using proven risk minimization techniques like asset allocation, diversification, and profit taking. The key change agents, the new kids on the block, are the derivative betting mechanisms (Index ETFs, for example) and their impact on the finite number of shares available for trading. Every day on the stock exchange, thousands of equities are traded, a billion shares change hands. The average share is ""held"" for mere minutes. No one seems to seek out analysts who spin tales of ""fundamental"" brilliance, profitability, or income production. On top of derivative trading in real things such as sectors, countries, companies, commodities, and industries, we have a myriad of index betting devices, short-long parlor games, option strategies, etc. What's a simple common share of Exxon to do? I've heard financial talk show hosts warn listeners to never, not ever, buy an individual equity! • Is today's movement in any individual equity the result of demand for the company shares themselves, or demand for the multiple funds, indices, and other derivatives that track or include the company in their ""model""? How many derivative owners have a clue what's inside their ETF? We are in an environment where investors feel smarter dealing in sectors than in companies; where 401k ""retirement"" plans (they really are not retirement plans, you know) are banned by regulators from offering even reasonably high yielding investment opportunities, and where government fiscal policies have forced millions of actual retirement savings accounts to seek refuge in the shark infested waters around Wall Street. Market volatility is here to stay, at least until multi-level and multi-directional derivatives are relocated to the Las Vegas casinos where they belong, until regulators realize that 7% after higher expenses is better than 2% after minimal expenses, and until interest rates are allowed to return to somewhat normal levels... and this is what feels to some like an elevated level of uncertainty. For the discernible future, we'll need to find a way, a methodology, that makes both of them our VBFs."

4,Why is the income tax so high in UK?,finance," Taxes are one of the major sources of revenue to the government. In fact, not a single government has its own money. In order to fund security, education, health, and infrastructural projects, the UK government depends on a number of sources, including individual income taxes, social insurance taxes, corporate income taxes, estate, excise, and gift taxes. Do you think the UK income tax is so high? Not really.  However, it is not easy to directly compare taxation between countries due to varying tax credit circumstances. In the UK for instance, income tax is progressive. This implies that the amount of tax you pay increases with increase in the taxable income. In addition, the total income tax an individual is required to remit annually depends on: •	How much personal income exceeds personal allowance •	How much of the personal income falls in various tax bands The current rates according to each tax band for the fiscal year 2018/2019 for individuals who are entitled to the standard personal allowance of up to £11,850 are as follows: Those who earn between £11,851 and £46,350 fall in the basic tax rate category. They are required to pay 20 percent of their taxable income. Individuals earning between £46,351 and £150,000 fall in the higher rate tax category. Their income tax rate is 40 percent of the total taxable income. Taxpayers who earn over £150,000 are classified in the additional rate band.  These fellows remit 45 percent of their taxable income as income tax. It is, however, important to note that you are not eligible for personal allowance if your taxable exceeds £123,700. Reduced Income Tax There are a number of circumstances under which UK residents are entitled to lesser income tax. These circumstances allow you to claim income tax relief from HMRC, only if you are eligible. A good example is when you are married or you’ve entered into a civil partnership and your income is below the standard personal allowance. Here, you are eligible to claim Marriage Allowance. If you choose not to claim Marriage Allowance and either of you was born before 6 April 1935, you are eligible for Married Couple’s Allowance. Personal Tax in the UK Compared To Other Advanced Countries Do you really want to know whether Britons pay more compared to other developed countries? Of course, you do. In order to make it clear, let’s look at the Guardian Money’s report on income taxes paid by UK residents earning £25,000, £40,000 and £100,000 compared to Australia, other European countries, and the US. According to their survey, Britons earning £25,000 and £40,000 are subjected to the lowest tax rates comparatively. In addition, the UK residents who earn £100,000 have less of their total income channeled to tax than the rest of European countries. The Guardian Money report further explains that after personal allowances, national insurance, and income tax are considered, Britons earning £100,000 contribute 34.3 percent of the amount to HMRC. The percentage, according to the survey, is almost the same with that in Australia, Spain, and the US. However, the figure is far much behind that of Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and France at 38%, 41%, 45%, and 59% respectively. Generally, low-income earners in the UK benefit from a tax-free personal allowance that is higher than that of many countries. Income taxes for higher earners are at par with that of Australia, US, and Spain But much less to that of Ireland, Sweden, and France. Are you or your business struggling with matters of taxation?

5,Investment Strategy: The Investor's Creed Revisited,finance," Fascinating, aren't they, these security markets of ours, with their unpredictability, promise, and unscripted daily drama. But individual investors themselves are even more interesting. We've become the product of a media driven culture that must have reasons, predictability, blame, scapegoats, and even that ""four-letter"" word, certainty. We are becoming a culture of speculators, where hindsight is replacing the reality-based foresight that once was flowing in our now real-time veins. Still, the markets have always been dynamic places where investors can consistently make reasonable returns on their capital. If one complies with the basic principles of the endeavor and doesn't measure progress too frequently with irrelevant measuring devices, growth in working capital, market value, and spendable income are quite likely to happen... without undue risk taking. The classic investment strategy is so simple and so trite that most investors dismiss it routinely and move on in their search for the holy investment grail(s): a stock market that only rises and a bond market capable of paying higher interest rates at stable or higher prices. This is mythology, not investing. Investors who grasp the realities of these wonderful (speculation driven) marketplaces recognize the opportunities and relish them with an understanding that goes beyond the media hype and side show ""performance enhancement"" barkers. They have no problem with the ""uncertainty""; they embrace it. Simply put, in rising markets: •	When investment grade equity securities approach the ""reasonable"" target prices you have set for them, realize your profits, because that's the ""growth"" purpose of investing in the stock market. •	When your income purpose securities rise in market value the equivalent of one-year's-interest-in-advance, take your profits and reinvest it in similar securities; because compound interest is the safest and most powerful weapon we investors have in our arsenals. On the flip side, and there has always been a flip side (more commonly dreaded as a ""correction""), replenish your equity portfolio with now lower priced investment grade securities. Yes, even some that you may have just sold weeks or even months ago. And, if the correction is occurring in the income purpose allocation of your portfolio, take advantage of the opportunity by adding to positions, increasing yield and reducing cost basis in one magical transaction. •	Some of you may not know how to add to those somewhat illiquid bond, mortgage, loan, and preferred stock portfolios quite so easily. It's time you learned about closed end funds (CEFs), the great ""liquidators"" of the bond market. Many high quality CEFs have 20 year dividend histories for you to salivate over. This is much more than a ""buy low, sell high"" oversimplification. It is a long-term strategy that succeeds... cycle, after cycle, after cycle. Do you wonder why Wall Street doesn't spend more time pushing its managed tax free income, taxable income, and equity CEFs? •	Unlike mutual funds, CEFs are actually separate investment companies with a fixed number of shares traded on the stock exchanges. The stock can trade (real time) above or below the net asset value of the fund. Both the fees and the net/net dividends are higher than any comparable mutual fund, but your advisor will probably tell you they are more risky due to ""leverage"". •	The leverage is short term borrowing and is absolutely not the same as a margin loan on the portfolio. It's more like a business line of credit or a receivables financing tool.  A full explanation can be found here: https://www.cefconnect.com/closed-end-funds-what-is-leverage I'm sure that most of you understand why your portfolio market values rise and fall throughout time... the very nature of the securities markets. The day to day volatility will vary, but is generally most noticeable surrounding changes in the longer term direction of either market, income purpose or growth purpose. •	Neither your ""working capital"" nor your realized income need be affected by the gyrations of your market value; if they are, you are not building a ""retirement ready"" portfolio. So rather than rejoicing through each new stock market rally or lamenting each inevitable correction, you should be taking actions that enhance both your working capital and its income productivity, while at the same time, pushing you forward toward long term goals and objectives. Through the application of a few easy to assimilate processes, you can plot a course to an investment portfolio that regularly achieves higher market value highs and (much more importantly), higher market value lows while consistently growing both working capital and income... regardless of what is happening in the financial markets. Left to its own devices, an unmanaged portfolio (think NASDAQ, DJIA, or  S & P 500) is likely to have long periods of unproductive sideways motion. You can ill afford to travel eleven years at a break even pace (the Dow, from December 1999 through November 2010, for example), and it is foolish, even irresponsible, to expect any unmanaged approach to be in sync with your personal financial objectives. The Investor's Creed NOTE: The original ""Investor's Creed"" was written at a time when money market funds were paying above 4%, so holding uninvested equity bucket ""smart cash"" was, in effect, a compounding of profits while waiting for lower equity prices. Income bucket cash is always reinvested ASAP. Since money market rates have become minimal, equity ""smart cash"" has been placed in tradeable equity CEFs with yields averaging over 6% as a replacement... not as safe, but the compounding makes up for the increased risk over money funds. The ""Investor's Creed"" sums up several basic asset allocation, investment strategy, and investment psychology principles into a fairly clear, personal portfolio management direction statement: •	My intention is to be fully invested in accordance with my planned equity/fixed income, cost based, asset allocation. •	Every security I own is for sale at a reasonable target price, while generating some form of cash flow for reinvestment. •	I am pleased when my equity bucket cash position is low, signaling that my assets are working hard to meet my objectives. •	I am more pleased when my equity bucket cash is growing steadily, showing that I’ve been capitalizing all reasonable profits. •	I am confident that I'm always in position to take advantage of new equity opportunities that fit my disciplined selection criteria. If you're managing your portfolio properly, your cash + equity CEF position (the ""smart cash"") should be rising during rallies, as you take profits on the securities you confidently purchased when prices were falling. And, you could be chock full of this ""smart cash"" well before the investment gods blow the whistle on the stock market advance. Yes, if you are going about the investment process with an understanding of market cycles, you will be building liquidity while Wall Street is encouraging higher equity weightings, while numerous IPOs are taking advantage of euphoric speculative greed, and while morning drive radio hosts and personal friends are boasting about their ETF and Mutual Fund successes. While they grow their hat sizes, you will be growing your income production by holding your income purpose allocation on target and salting away the growth purpose portion of your profits, dividends, and interest in an equity based alternative to ""de minimis"" money fund rates. This ""smart cash"", comprised of realized profits, interest, and dividends, is just taking a breather on the bench after a scoring drive. As the gains compound at equity CEF rates, the disciplined coach looks for sure signs of investor greed in the market place: •	Fixed income prices falling as speculators abandon their long term goals and reach for the new investment stars that are sure to propel equity prices forever higher. •	Boring investment grade equities falling in price as well because it is now clear that the market will never fall sharply again… particularly NASDAQ, simply  ignoring the fact that it is still less than 25% above where it was nearly twenty years ago (FANG included). And the beat goes on, cycle after cycle, generation after generation. Will today's managers and gurus be any smarter than those of the late nineties? Will they ever learn that it is the very strength of rising markets that, eventually, proves to be their greatest weakness. Isn't it great to be able to say: ""Frankly Scarlett, I just don't care about market directional changes. My working capital and income will continue to grow regardless, possibly even better when income purpose security prices are falling."""
6,The Reverse Mortgage Loan Process,finance," When a person applies for a reverse mortgage, he or she can expect the process to take from 4-6 weeks. There are a handful of steps involved, but the one which takes up the greatest amount of time involves educating one’s self on the process and making the decision to pursue it. Applicants typically take up to six full months to research reverse mortgage loans. They search for information online and then seek out local resources and meet with specialists. During this time, the home owner takes the time to review all documents and estimates pertaining to their choices. Once the decision to pursue has been made, the application and approval process begins. 5 Steps to receiving a Reverse Mortgage Once a homeowner has applied for a reverse mortgage loan, the loan institution will have legal permission to start processing it. There will be be any charges applied on the initial process. The borrower’s application will clearly reveal all fees that are involved, as well as the amount loaned and the interest rates on the loan. This second step has necessary fees. Borrowers are required to receive counseling from an agency that is approved by HUD. The agency will then provide an HECM certificate of completion. Most areas allow borrowers to receive the counseling before they apply or after they have begun an application. Before approving a reverse mortgage, the lender must know the legal value of the applicant’s property. In order to determine the legal value of the involved property, a full appraisal must be done. Applicants must be sure to use an appraiser that is FHA approved. The appraisal will follow the formatting set in place by FHA. Appraisals from those who have not been approved by the FHA and have not followed the correct formatting for reverse mortgages are not accepted. All property must be appraised using the FHA guidelines. The underwriting process involves establishing the property’s legal ownership, working through any liens, bankruptcy, trouble with trusts, and similar issues. To determine the applicant’s legal ownership, the reverse mortgage lender will perform a title search and then purchase insurance for the title. All financial issues will be addressed and solutions will be resolved during this time. When the underwriting and loan approval is done, the application status will be cleared and the applicant will be given a date for the closing. Once a closing date has been discussed and decided, the applicant meets with an attorney or official notary. Upon the homeowner’s review and acknowledgements, the applicant will sign the application. Although the applicant has agreed and signed for the reverse mortgage, there will be a waiting period of three days. The right of rescission time allows applicants to change their minds and cancel on a reverse mortgage. When the right of rescission period is done, the applicant will receive full payment from the title company. If the homeowner has a current mortgage, this will be paid off and the money that is left will be sent to the applicant. The payment process is fast and the money is paid out within a few days."
7,Should I do my own tax return?,finance," To quote the famous satirist, Dorothy Parker ""We hate doing our taxes, but we love having done our taxes"". Especially if there’s a refund coming. It’s also natural to hate paying for things that you believe you can do yourself and tax is one of those things. When you look at a simple tax return, it seems just that, simple. So why should we pay for someone to do it? Well, the truth is, if you have the option to pay someone to do it, it’s probably worth it for one or more of these reasons: It will cost you money but it’ll save you time Unless you are a tax law guru (or tax accountant), in order to get the best return you’ll have to have an understanding of tax laws. What you can or can’t claim for. What you need to declare. Then there’s hunting down and keeping track of it all. If you’re a details person or a numbers person, great. But if you’re not, the money spent on a tax accountant will probably far outweigh the stress of not doing it. The more you know you can claim, the better your tax return A tax accountant is someone who spends their time studying and dealing with tax law. Getting them to help you with your tax return can improve it. They’ll be able to make suggestions, perhaps they’re aware of deductions you’re eligible for which you may have missed. Of course, you may be all over it and if that’s the case, probably more than capable of doing it yourself. But if you aren’t, you may feel more comfortable with the help of a professional. When your situation isn’t black and white If you have a simple situation, great. You’re employed and don’t have any side incomes, then doing your own tax return will probably be quite simple. However, there are areas which can make things a little more complicated and move you into the grey area. This could be that your hobby has now turned into a little side business. Perhaps your self-employed or you have two jobs, you could have even operated at a loss last year. The fact is, there are some situations which will make your tax return a little more complicated. These are the situations that you should definitely put money towards getting the right help and advice. You have more than just an income If you have shares or property, or both, you should definitely consider using an accountant. Especially to navigate such things as Capital Gains Tax and Negative Gearing. They can offer you guidance on how best to navigate tax gain from your assets or how to negative gear your tax. Your personal situation as changed Perhaps you got married. Or divorced. Or had a child. Maybe you lost a spouse? If anything like this happened to you this year, you may need help finding the best filing status. Also, as your children get older, tax credits and deductions might expire. This is all age dependent and using someone who understands all the options can prove beneficial. The bottom line is, it’s completely up to you. It really depends on what you’re comfortable with and how confident you are navigating this stuff on your own. But in the event that you aren’t completely confident, having a trustworthy tax profession working for you can make all the difference."
8,Investment Opportunity Times Two...Or Is It Four,finance," As of March 23, 2018, the S & P 500 (at $2,588.26) was down roughly 10% from its January 26, 2018 all time high of $2,872.87, and down about 3.2% for the year, presumably in anticipation of an imminent trade war. Additionally, interest rate sensitive securities were trading near 52 week low levels as bond and other fixed income speculators shed inventory in anticipation of at least three 2018 interest rate hikes. Obviously, a market scenario like this is challenging for: • Major market participants (institutional investors) whose bond inventories are shrinking in price. • Stock market speculators in much too high PE and low or no dividend equities. • Income focused investors (retirees and ""soontobes"") who hold positions in illiquid individual fixed income securities. • 401k savings account holders whose pooled investment portfolios are, by design, much too heavily invested in equities. But, it is a perfect storm of opportunity for Market Cycle Investment Management (MCIM)  portfolios. The MCIM process focuses only on fundamentally sound, S & P B+ or better ranked equities of profitable, dividend paying, companies (Investment Grade Value Stocks). No individual stocks are purchased until they are trading 20% below their 52 week highs. MCIM portfolios are diversified in several ways, and every security pays either dividends or interest. New issues, NASDAQ companies, and Mutual Funds have no place in MCIM portfolios, which also have strict profit taking disciplines that eliminate the pain of watching major profits slip away during corrections. Additionally, ""cost based"" asset allocation precludes the need for portfolio ""re-balancing"" while assuring annual income growth with a 40% or higher income purpose asset allocation. While markets climb to record high levels, the lack of individual equity investment opportunities is ameliorated with the use of equity Closed End Funds (CEFs). These are managed, classically diversified, ""real time"" tradeable, portfolios covering most market sectors while providing much higher than normal (after expenses) income. In the income purpose ""bucket"", well diversified income CEFs (both taxable and tax-free) are used to assure higher than normal income from all types of generally illiquid securities... securities which (in CEFs form) magically become available in totally liquid form. How have IGVS equities and CEFs fared in the three major meltdowns of our lifetimes? • In 1987, IGVS equities were the first to recover, and there were no company failures or dividend cuts; few CEFs existed at the time and they were not a major portfolio holding, but individual interest rate sensitive securities rallied as interest rates were lowered. • In 1999, IGVS equities and most CEFs did not ""bubble"" along with the NASDAQ, and rallied strongly during the flight to quality that followed the dot-com disaster. ""No NASDAQ, no new issues, no Mutual Funds"" was a winning credo then, as it should be in the next significant correction. • In 2008, everything tanked and two or three financial services IGVS companies were crushed in the government witch hunt. Overall, there were few dividend cuts in equities, as IGVS companies rallied from the bottom at a slightly faster pace than the S & P 500 through 2014. Income CEFs, however, outperformed the entire stock market from 2007 through late 2012, while maintaining their dividends until 2016 or so, when tax free CEF yields began to fall. Thus, while some managed portfolios may have inherent quality, diversification, and income concerns during corrections, MCIM portfolios have new investment opportunities. While some investment portfolios must deplete capital to pay monthly income to retirees, the vast majority of MCIM portfolios have excess income that is used to grow capital in any market scenario. Four varieties of investment opportunity exist as this is being written: • The number of IGVS equities falling 20% below 52 week high levels is growing. • There are approximately forty primarily equity CEFs, representing a wide variety of market sectors, with current yields between 7% and 9% after all internal fees and expenses. • There are no less than sixty-one taxable income CEFs, representing a wide variety of security types, with current yields between 7.5% and 9.5% after all internal fees and expenses. •	There are at lease thirty-one federally tax free income CEFs paying between 6% and 6.6%, after all internal fees and expenses. For your long term portfolio health, make sure that you take advantage of them.... this time. It's been ten years since the last significant market correction, and it just makes sense to use an investment medium that provides the necessary fuel to add to positions at lower prices. The clock is ticking. The ""add to at lower prices"" approach is particularly effective with CEFs, where every addition: • Reduces your cost basis, speeding the return of profit taking opportunities. • Increases your dividend yield on the security, and. • Increase your annual portfolio income. What's that old Boy Scout motto? Right...."
9,Real Estate Investment Outlook,finance," LOS ANGELES, CA. Last month saw the first huge correction in the stock market since early 2016.  US Congress agreed on an expansionary spending path for 2018-19 and long-term interest rates increased to multi-year highs and are expected to increase this year. How will this play out in the real estate market? Although it appears to have been mainly technical factors that triggered the correction in the stock market, inflation concerns have been the major cause for plummeting stock market prices. We have outlined such a scenario of inflation and its impact on real estate investments. Indeed, the difference between current and trend economic growth is moving close to zero, rising labor demand is putting upward pressure on wages and salaries, but it is still far from a strong acceleration in inflation rates. Meanwhile, the recommendation by the US Department of Commerce in its investigation to restrict aluminum and steel imports on national security grounds is a reminder that the risk of escalating trade tension has a significant impact on real estate investments. We are not suggesting that the probabilities of risks have risen substantially in light of these events. However, we argue that higher volatility combined with uncertainties about the future  uncertain outlook for US trade policy is not an environment where we should risk everything on one endeavor, but rather seek  returns by pursuing opportunities in the real estate market. It would be more than natural that unjustified price appreciations will be corrected over time. Some observers believe that rising inflation may have played a prominent role in the recent stock market sell-off. However, higher inflation points to an overheating economy and rising wages could lower profit margins. Neither case obviously applies at the current time. However, historical evidence shows that periods when inflation begins to rise often create volatility in real estate markets and, on average, returns are meager. Finally yet importantly, higher interest rates could hit real estate prices if they reflect rising risk. Higher interest rates should be less relevant if they result from higher growth. For now, we expect the implications of rising interest rates on the real estate outlook to be limited. A more persistent significant decline in real estate prices could, however, be associated with somewhat slower growth, either because the economy anticipates a slowdown, or because economic decline itself dampens growth. The impact of rising interest rates on growth also depends on the factors that pushed up interest rates. The rise in interest rates could be the consequence of stronger growth momentum, in which case the economic fallout is understandably limited. However, if higher interest rates reflect rising risks, for instance, then growth may well suffer more significantly. Financial conditions remain very loose and interest rates relatively low. This should continue to support economic growth. Therefore, we are keeping our scenario of sustained economic growth: (1) higher world economic activity, (2) rising fixed capital formation, (3) a very gradual adjustment of monetary policy in the US. We acknowledge the risks from higher protectionism, as recent announcements are a reminder that trade frictions could escalate significantly. At this point, it remains to be seen what action the US will take and how other countries may respond. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008, most have averted the specter of deflation by deploying conventional and – even more importantly – unconventional measures of monetary policy. Inflation in the US averaged around 1.5%, with a dispersion of -2% in mid 2009 to approximately 3.8% in late 2011. Currently, US consumer price inflation stands at 2.1%. In the US, the government is embarking on a path of fiscal stimulus, and more trade tariffs and trade friction may push inflation higher. However, several factors are keeping underlying inflationary pressure contained for now, including still-cautious wage bargaining behavior by households, price setting by firms and compositional changes in the labor market. In addition, the recent readings have likely overstated current price trends,( the surprising weakness in inflation in 2017). Outside  the US, wage and price trends have not changed much in recent months. Against this backdrop, we do not foresee any surprises over the course of 2018. The Fed is expected to gradually lift rates with caution depending on the tightness of the US labor market, the evidence of accelerating wage dynamics and the potential impact of higher financial market volatility on economic growth. In addition, a tax policy that fosters the competitiveness of Corporate America and attracts direct foreign investments, helping to raise the potential growth rate of US, should also be supportive for the greenback. At the same time, there are as many factors pointing to a glorious future for real estate markets According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the current probability of recession for the US economy stands at around 4%, moving to approximately 10% at the end of 2018. In our view, the gradual tightening of monetary policy, limited inflation expectations and cautious investment demand, will keep real interest rates relatively low.  Therefore, we prefer real estate investments in 2018."
10,The Strategies from the Genus’ of Investing: Investing style is a mater of finding your personality type and risk tolerance,finance," Warren Buffett's’ strategies on investing are to find companies that you trust, believe in and understand the business model. If not walk away now. One must learn to be patient, to wait for these stock prices to fall to value prices, and then hold on the stock for the long term at least 10 years, if not 20 years or even 30 years. Buffet shares the view the best way to avoid capital gains taxes is to hold them on the stocks for an extremely long time if not indefinite. What if you don't know of any of these companies, what do you do then? Well, Warren Buffet openly releases his investment choices each year which companies that his company Berkshire Hathaway invests into. This will make the financial news, the local business section of your newspaper. If you can’t think like a Warren Buffet just follows his choices. Or according to Buffet, it is better to have 10 quality ""Great"" stocks, and they have hundreds of average stocks. Now if you are not the personality or skills to truly buy low and sell high, what should you do? Warren Buffet states you are best to buy a passive fund or Index fund rather. Still in the dark here are some recommend books on Warren Buffet: The Tao of Warren Buffet Mary Buffet and David Clark. Warren Buffet and the interpretation of financial statements Mary Buffet and David Clark. Buffettology Mary Buffet & David Clark. It sounds simple enough, but most people are not programmed to buy stock low and sell high. The reason is emotional investing theory most of the population is hardwired to sell low, and buy high this is due to human evaluation and our ability to survive. The same goes for fund managers; they often have to follow the majority of other investors, and often feel the need to always being in the market. Be careful there are many salespeople going by the tiles of the adviser, insurances agents are mostly and not always what I like to call mutual fund salespeople. I would recommend you to become your own expert and follow the advice of other experts that state that even an average investor can outpace the S&P 500. The easy way to meet the S&P 500 is to buy in a low-cost passive fund the mirrors the S&P 500. The easiest way to use cost averaging which simply means buying into a mutual fund(s), every pay period, one a month, or once a quarter. The idea behind these strategies is that you will be placed in an automatic system that will buy mutual funds at the peek and the bottom of the market to avoid emotional buying or selling. How do you out peace the S&P 500? Is not to purchase high cost managed mutual funds, and second follow the advice of Joel Greenblatt which is a Professor at Columbia University and former fund manager, he states in his book The Big Secret for the Small Investor: The Shortest Route to Long-Term Investment Success that most of the top funds manager at one time was at the bottom. And there is no way to predict who will be the next Warren Buffet. He has developed a system of value index mutual funds based on the S&P 500 that are value based and are a better way to buy low and sell high. He states that the problem with the S&P 500 is how the system to purchases based on capitalization. Meaning that the top stock will have the highest weight, and the one ranked second will have the next highest value and so on and so on. Until one will get to the 500Th position will be a very small part of the fund. Joel Greenblatt believes that is created and buy high and sell low buy strategies. Joel Greenblatt believes that a buying 1/500 of each stock would be a better system or one based on dividends or gross sales would be a better system then what we have today. And can produced 1-2% better than the S&P 500 and even better than some fund managers. On his website, he gives the mutual funds symbols that he recommends at http://www.valueweightedindex.com/ The next strategy is to have the greatest diversification of your US stocks, bonds, and international stock markets. Not just investing in the top 500 US stocks, but in the larger cap, mid cap and small cap stocks in Wilshire 5000 in encompasses the entire US stock market. This was developed by Burton Gordon Malkiel a Princeton professor in his book The Random Walk Guide to Investing: ten rules for financial success states this is the way to the greatest return. All these strategies are a complete contradiction, with each other, but each one can be used for different personality styles and risk tolerances. The question one needs to ask is what ideology fits me the best? Am I willing to send a lot of time, some time, or no time reaching mutual funds, stock, and balance sheets? It is clear the Warren Buffet is the riskiest and the one that will gain the best returns. Joel is little less complex, and invest value will give you better returns over aggressive growth, over the longer term, and Burton Gordon. Malkiel will give you a chance to go autopilot and invest the most passive method. The risk is diversified, over the largest amount of stock or bonds. Burton Gordon. Malkiel ran simulations, showing it is a smart investment style. In his book Burton Gordon Malkiel The Random Walk Guide to Investing: ten rules for financial success states this is the way to the greatest return. States the mutual fund symbols and helpful list of allocation tables for different age groups. I personally see myself investing in all of these models when the market is down, I invest like Warren Buffet. When the market is flat or not producing great returns I am applying a value-based investing with great diversity. I do hold rather large low-risk fund(s), based on my age, waiting for the market to crash. I can’t tell you when the market will crash, but I am sure it will sooner or later. I still have a portion of my investment actually in stocks, mutual funds, bonds, & treasury inflation protected securities (TIF’s) . When the market gets too high I rebalance my trading account and the same is true when I see weakness in the market I rebalance once again. I am always looking for an opportunity to make a good return. No, one knows when the market will be at the top or at the bottom. But one knows when the market is priced fairly or slightly overvalued and when the market is undervalued. This is when a smart person makes their move. When the market is high move some of your investment to safe, and likewise when the market is weak move some of your investment to risk."
11,Health Insurance A Must For Everyone,finance," Health Insurance is a device that insures an individual against financial risks of care in case of illness, as well as a minimal income when the condition deprives the person of work. In the U.S and some other Western countries, much of the health insurance is provided by the state. It is, moreover, one of the fundamental components of social security, and a duty of the State according to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A public health insurance system can be managed by a state agency, delegated to private organizations, or perhaps be mixed. The very operation, akin to every insurance, is based on the pooling of risk: each person contributes, in exchange for which it is reimbursed according to a fixed scale. Concerning a public health insurance system, the insurance premium paid by the insured does not necessarily follow the rules of pure insurance, that is to say, that it is not based solely on the risk. Indeed, the public system fulfills both a pure insurance function and a distribution function in which the better-off pay the insurance of the most. History Of Health Insurance Until the eighteenth century, protections against the risks of life are provided by personal wealth, local solidarity (family, village) or professional (guilds), and charity. In the nineteenth century, the industrial revolution concentrated populations in cities where local solidarity can no longer play while the number of accidents at work increases. Besides, an intellectual and scientific movement is developing which promotes individual foresight (at the origin of private insurance). The mutual insurance companies that provide collective insurance, and the notion of sacred debt brought by the country revolution of which declaration of the rights of Man, and the Citizen recognizes for every national the right to social assistance and social protection, giving rise to social security. These new concepts are applied now, wishing a strong state, developed the first system of compulsory social insurance with the draft laws on insurance against industrial accidents and social health insurance adopted in 1883 and 1884 Types Of Health Insurance Healthcare Insurance Without Co-Payment Health insurance Sanitary Assistance; the medical insurance that includes the complete coverage to take care of the family! This medical insurance is a product without co-payments for the use of medical services. Healthcare Insurance With Co-Payment It is the insurance that includes the complete coverage to take care of the family and with a special co-payment adjusted to the use of medical services made by the insured, which guarantees a lower premium than what would correspond in another type of insurance. Healthcare Insurance With The Reduced Copayment It is the insurance that offers the complete coverage for the whole family, paying a reduced copayment. It allows contracting guarantees independently or jointly, according to the needs of each family unit. Health Care Insurance Choice The insurance that includes all the guarantees of the Primary Care and coverage through the Medical Board by presenting the health card and with the best dental coverage! It also facilitates access to the most qualified doctors of all specialties at special prices. Medical Expenses Reimbursement Insurance The insurance that allows you to freely choose a doctor or hospital anywhere in the world or, if you prefer, go to the services of any Medical Board without having to make any financial outlay. Compensation It is the insurance that compensates the income that would be left to obtain for total temporary disability during the time in which the insured could not exercise their usual work due to illness or accident. There is a daily compensation previously contracted. The option of Compensation according to Scale can also be contracted (compensation up to the number of days fixed in a scale when the insured suffers a loss for any of the illnesses or injuries included in it). Essential Compensation The Essential Compensation insurance guarantees the payment of compensation in case of illness or accident. It covers any profession, including unpaid ones. The policy is also indicated for housewives, as an economic complement in case of not being able to face daily tasks due to illness or accident. Growth In Health And Insurance Costs In The United States Nearly all workers with health insurance provided by the company face additional costs when using the healthcare insurance services out there! Eighty-five percent of the covered workers in our nation truly have a general yearly deductible which must be truly met before insurance services are reimbursed by their very own health insurance plan. Even workers without annual deductibles often face other types of cost-sharing when they use services, such as co-payments or co-insurance for office visits and hospitalizations, which can reach thousands of dollars from their clients. Recently, the very average yearly premiums for the employer-sponsored medical health insurance were specifically $ 6,251 for the single coverage as well as $ 17,545 for the family health insurance coverage. Each rose by 4 percent over the last years average premiums. Over the very same time or maybe period, workers' wages increased by 1.9 percent as well as inflation fell by 0.2 percent. Premiums in the year 2017 also increased by 8 percent on average. This very trend shows no signs of reversal. Health care is truly expensive, and then patients are going to cover lots more of the costs themselves. The Emergence Of Deductible Health Plans Much has actually been proclaimed recently about rising franchises under the great Affordable Care Act, which is also known as the (Obamacare). The (HDHP) plans are merely the health insurance arrangement or plan with a bit lower premiums as well as higher deductibles compared to the conventional health plan. HDPH was conventionally considered as well as used as a form of calamitous or maybe tragic coverage that was projected to cover the very high level of costs connected with tragic diseases. By choosing a PSDH rather than the traditional or conventional health insurance coverage, there exists a negotiation for the health insurance buyer: the lower cost health insurance premium from one month to the next, but a higher deductible and an increased financial burden. In exchange for a comparatively low yearly or maybe monthly premium compared to the traditional health care plan, insurance benefits are only paid when the consumer has reached his annual deductible, much higher than the traditional health plan, sometimes greater than $ 10,000. Conclusion Patients are now becoming more sensitive to health care costs because a lot of the costs come from their pockets. Notwithstanding, the industry has not admittedly changed to present patients with financial transparency so that a patient can appraise treatments as well as assess relative costs and benefits."
12,How do I know if I have bad credit?,finance," The best way to find out where your credit rating sits is to check your credit score. There's three main credit reporting agencies in Australia, and under government legislation, you are entitled to one free credit report each year. Credit Reporting Agencies in Australia Equifax (formerly Veda) Experian Dun and BradStreet To get your credit report you'll need to provide your name, date of birth, proof of identity - this is usually your drivers licence number, and your address. One you get your credit score, and your credit report, the next step is to find out what it means. What Should I Aim For? The maximum credit score in Australia is 1200. Here's how lenders rate your credit score: 833-1200 Excellent 726-832 Very Good 622-832 Good 510 - 621 Avereage 0-509 Below Average If your score is good or higher, you are in a better position to secure finance, including car loans, a mortgage, or a business loan. Other things will affect your ability to obtain finance, such as your income and any existing liabilities or assets that you have. What Affects My Credit Score? Your credit rating is affected by your financial habits. If you consistently save, you pay bills on time, and you avoid applying for new credit cards and loans then your credit score will be stronger. It also helps to keep your credit balance low, and avoid being rejected for any loans that you apply for. If you take out a balance transfer credit card or debt consolidation loan, make sure that you do pay out the balance within the loan terms or the balance time frame. How To Gain An Excellent Credit Rating To avoid a poor credit rating you should avoid any defaults on your bills and loans, and don't spend more than you earn. Getting an excellent credit rating is a little more challenging. People with an excellent credit rating have planned ahead to put their finances in order. They will usually own a home with more than 20% equity and have a middle to high income. Some steps you can take towards an excellent credit rating include: Don't apply for credit too often. Review terms and conditions of your loan or balance transfer offer to ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements. If you aren't sure about where to apply for your loan, consider using a broker who can make a full assessment of your financial profile and match you to the lender with the best available product. Pay on time. Either set up direct debits, or keep a calendar that you stick to with your payments that fall due. Ensure there's money in your account for your credit contract bills by setting up a personal spending allowance for yourself each week. Avoid making purchases that you don't really need. Plan for the future. Set a long-term goal to save a first home deposit, pay down your mortgage, or boost your superannuation and investments. Once you take control of your financial situation, you'll find that paying bills on time is easier. Finding out your credit score is just the first step in a healthy financial future."
13,Get More Money Back on Your Tax Return with help from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,finance," Are you expecting a tax refund for your business this year? Check this out. There’s a way to get an even bigger refund, no matter the size of your business. This year the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) goes into effect, a law that might offer huge tax benefits for individuals with Qualified Business Income (QBI) through a partnership, S Corporation, LLC or sole proprietorship. Here’s how to qualify your business for the new tax deduction under the Tax Cuts and Job Act. What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? The biggest highlight of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is that individuals may be able to deduct up to 20% of their QBI when filing their taxes. We define QBI as the net amount of gains, losses, sources of income and deductions in respect to your trade or business. This deduction takes place ‘below the line.’ What this means is it reduces your taxable income, but not your adjusted gross income. As such, you may only deduct no more than 20% of your taxable income over net capital gain. If your QBI is negative, treat it as a business loss and use it to offset income in years following. You can take advantage of the TCJA regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or itemize your expenses. Tax Deduction Restrictions Now, there are restrictions surrounding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. To qualify, you must conduct your business in the United States. Certain investments don’t apply. This includes capital gains or losses, dividends, trade or business as an employee and interest on income (unless the interest is on money allocated to your business). Lastly, your QBI doesn’t adjust for compensation received from an S Corporation or a payment guarantee through a partnership in exchange for partner services. Additionally, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has ‘thresholds’, which discourages high-income business owners from exploiting this tax deduction by converting their wages or other personal compensations into taxable income. If your taxable income is $50,000 over a threshold ($100,000 for joint filers), all the net income from a specific service, trade or business may be be excluded from your QBI. These exclusions include healthcare, law, consulting, athletics and financial services, or where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of the business and its employees. The highest threshold is $157,500 for individuals, $315,000 for joint filers. This exclusion may phase-in for taxable incomes between the threshold amounts and the maximum exceeding amount. For taxpayers making more than the highest threshold, there exists another limitation on the size of their deduction. Your deduction based on QBI cannot exceed the greater of (1) 50% of your allocable share of W-2 wages paid immediate to your trade or business, or (2) the sum of 25% of such wages and 2.5% of the unadjusted basis immediately after the acquisition of tangible depreciable property purposed for your trade or business (including commercial property).  A phase-in of this limitation applies to people whose taxable incomes are between the threshold and the maximum overage amount. There are further limitations that may apply in unique situations, including taxpayers with qualified cooperative dividends, real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends, or income from publicly traded partnerships."
14,Why people fail in trading,finance," There are few reasons why traders fail in trading and never become full time traders.

All you have to do is take action, be proactive and do the work – master your strategy, patterns you trade and what’s the most important – psychology. Once you decide which instrument you want to trade and choose the right timeframe that fits your time, price action patterns you like, stop loss and take profit sizes, risk 1 or maximally 2% per trade, write down your trading plan and someone even its check list – you can start. And here is the hitch. Lots of beginners even do not build their trading system and trading plan. They just read few articles about trading, study some price or candlestick patterns and hurry to beat the market without backtesting system and writing down the trading plan. Then they have some winning trades which make them feel like professionals. It usually does not take much time to lose whole capital due to oversizing and overtrading. What does that mean? They risk more than 2% per trade and entry in every move market does. The next reason is having unrealistic expectations and missing patience. Once trader starts to trade and its results are not getting better, he struggles and starts being afraid of next entry due to high probability of another stop loss hit. That’s why I highly recommend writing trades into trading journal, just to see certain behavior and habits which you repeat unconsciously over again and it keeps you on the same place without any move forward. After few loses traders change trading method, add indicators, google for the best trading system and starts again from the zero. It repeats itself so many times that trader definitely loses patience and motivation from the beginning so now trader wants to forget about trading. Heck, what happened with your dreams and vision? Why did you give up so easily without any fight? Why the hell people stay more than 40 years at job they hate instead of investing few years into hard self education and some time for changing their mindset into winners one. Why everyone wants everything right here right now without any work or spent time on learning? It makes no sense. They rather stay the whole life in boring job they hate because it’s more comfortable than studying and learning basics, aspects, technical analysis and other things successful trader needs. Damn, listen to me. Would you rather invest few years into yourself to fulfill of all your dreams or do not you want it enough to do uncomfortable things, work hard? It’s your life, not mine. Waking up and looking into mirror and knowing you gave up your dream is like killing yourself. Hold on and never ever quit. Rewards are actually on the way to you. Just hold on. Nobody said it’s going to be easy. More than 90% people give up due to bad expectations so be honest to yourself. Set realistic goals and work daily on filling each tasks which follows your vision. Don’t be the same as others people. Successful people do things that others don’t do. We all know those phases in different life categories. You are trying, then you stop, you can not move forward for long time and you start be demotivated. Then you quit. Only 5-10% of people don’t stop and struggle further until they reach it. Patience and being confident allow them to wait until the work is done or until the problem is solved. Weaker individuals just give up.. Choose your side. I already did. You are next. Conclusion Wrong expectations and rush traders are killers on way to profitable trading. Be aware it Takes time to be living from trading. What to do Set a clear goal and then divide it into smaller parts Write To-Do plan to fill up each task"
15,Everything you should know about short-term business loans in the UK,finance," A short-term business loan can be a quick fix solution for funding your business operations which could be going through a temporary downturn. In the UK, this type of loan can be obtained for few months or years, depending on terms of your lender. You normally pay a weekly or monthly interest until maturity when the entire principal amount must be paid back in full. Since the liquidity crisis in 2008, lenders across the UK have been cautious to lend money to struggling businesses who also have an adverse credit score. However, the situation has improved dramatically in recent years as the government has partnered with major banks and institutions across the nation outpouring funding to small medium enterprises (SME). There has also been a surge in number of online lenders offering unsecured loans with minimum requirements to qualify for them. Where Can You Get a Short-Term Business Loan? In the UK, you can get a short-term business loan through banks, credit unions, and online lenders. The process is usually cumbersome with banks, as they typically have strict conditions that need to be fulfilled regarding your operating history and performance. They also have long application processes and would also require you to place some sort of collateral. There are banks like Yorkshire Bank & Natwest Bank that can offer you short-term loans of to a fixed amount. The major advantages of selecting them would be that they are well reputed and there is transparency with their terms. Then there are online lenders that provide unsecured business loans on a short-term basis. The approval takes only a few hours in some cases, and you can get funds transferred to your account immediately. The conditions required to qualify are also less stringent than banks, as they would only require you to have about a few months of constant revenue. There are plenty of online lenders out there like Funding Circle and Fleximize where you can borrow large amounts if you have favourable revenue stream. It is also possible for businesses with bad credit history to get a short-term loan from online lenders as the requirements are not that strict. Know Your Risks The risks of your short-term loan depend on whether it is secured through collateral or not. If you obtain an unsecured loan, you will typically pay a relatively higher interest rate as compensation to risk faced by lenders. Normally, these types of loans would also entail strict penalties for loan default. Further, if you miss a deadline for repayment, the situation can become more complicated, depending on the terms of the lender on extending the repayment deadline. You could be forced to pay higher interest on accumulated debt which could risk your business spiraling into bankruptcy. It is also not easy to judge the reputation of lenders when borrowing a short-term loan, as most of online lenders are relatively new on the market. How Should You Spend Your Short-Term Loan? You should always have a detailed plan on how you will spend the money in your business and how it will be repaid. There are many ways you can use a short-term loan, but here is a list of the five most important ways it can be used for: Meeting payroll expenses Meeting future expenses to buy inventory Covering working capital needs Resolving gaps in cash flows Ensuring liquidity for unforeseen events in the short-term If you are a small business that needs urgent funding to cover gaps in capital or stock up inventory before an important selling period, then a short-term business loan could be exactly what you need if you take all risks into account."
16,Student finance tips,finance," To meet the challenge of staying afloat financially as a student, you need to pick the right bank account, work out a realistic budget and stick to it, and always be on the lookout for discounts and ways of saving money. University usually represents the first time young people have been responsible for their own finances. Significant tuition fees are charged in many countries, including fees of up to £9,000 per annum in the United Kingdom, but based on the UK system at least, worrying about how to repay these can be left until after graduation. Whilst at university there is the not inconsiderable challenge of successfully managing what income you have. This article gives students some tips on staying on top of their affairs. What to consider before choosing a student bank account It is strongly recommended that you open a dedicated student bank account at the start of your course, as these accounts are designed with the needs and concerns of students in mind. It is best to open your student account before you arrive for your first term, so you can avoid the queues at your local branch of students trying to open an account. Important things to look for before opening a student account include: Which banks have a branch on or near your campus The level of interest free overdraft The interest payable on positive balances Whether a particular bank has dedicated student money advisers Introductory gifts offered – items such as railcards offered as incentives may be particularly useful Basics of budgeting Work out what income you can expect while at university, this may include: Family contributions, if you are lucky enough to receive these Employment income, whether this is during term time, during the holidays or a combination of both. You can enhance your chances of getting employment by doing a fact-finding mission several weeks before the university year starts, so you can get a head start and avoid competing with large numbers of other students for these posts. But please ensure you do not take on so much employment that your studies are affected. Student grants, if these are available to you Bursaries or scholarships Student loans You then need to work out what your fixed expenditure will be each month, and how much is left for non-essentials like a rich and fulfilling social life! Once you have made a budget, stick to it. Essential expenditure items may include: Food Accommodation rent Books Internet and phone contracts Taxation As Benjamin Franklin once said: ""There are only two certainties in life – death and taxes"". But as a student, perhaps you can avoid taxation. If your income is below the threshold at which tax starts to be paid (GBP 10,000 in the UK for the 2014/15 tax year), yet you think some of your income has been taxed, apply to the tax authorities for a refund. Ways to save money Interest free overdrafts Obtaining an interest-free overdraft of this size after graduation may be almost impossible, but most student bank accounts in the UK allow interest-free overdrafts of GBP 1,000 and more. Insurance Before going away, check carefully whether your parents’ household insurance provides the level of cover you will require when at university. If not, seek out one of the policies specifically designed for students. Suffering significant loss due to theft or damage and needing to pay to replace lost goods is the last thing you need when at university. Discounts Keep an eye out for any retailers offering special promotions – your student union will probably highlight a number of these deals, while others can be found by keeping your eyes and ears open. Near to the university, you are sure to find many outlets that offer discounts to students. Theatres, nightclubs and cinemas may offer special deals for students on certain nights of the week. Passes giving discounted travel on public transport are also widely available to students. Bookmark websites such as Student Money Saver, Student Beans and Money Saving Expert. Ensure you carry as many forms of identification that evidence you are a student as possible, as you will need to produce ID in many cases in order to benefit from these discounts. Cheaper shops Hunt down a bargain in charity shops, local markets or your campus shops. Textbooks Check out websites that offer cheap university textbooks, or try and buy from last year’s students, who will regularly advertise books and other items for sale on notice boards around campus. Also consider how feasible it is to use a reference copy of a textbook in your university library. This may work out substantially cheaper than buying a new copy of every textbook on your course list from the university bookshop. And of course, once you have completed a year’s study, you can try and raise money by selling your textbooks to the students in the year below. Cycling and transport Consider whether it is feasible to cycle for short journeys, such as to and from lectures, or trips into town. You may find that the cost of buying a bike is swiftly recouped by the savings on transport fares. Some students bring a car to university, but this can prove very expensive, so before you do this, ask if it is really necessary. Student towns usually have frequent public transport services between the main student sites and the town centre. Energy costs Don’t use more energy than you need. Keep the heating turned down until it gets really cold, and turn off unused appliances. Food Try buying a cheaper brand, at least on a trial basis. It might surprise you! If you get into trouble If you feel you are struggling to stay on top of your finances, seek advice at the earliest opportunity, whether this is from your parents, your bank or one of the university’s student counsellors."
17,Managing The Retirement Income Portfolio: The Plan,finance," The reason people assume the risks of investing in the first place is the prospect of achieving a higher ""realized"" rate of return than is attainable in a risk free environment…i.e., an FDIC insured bank account featuring compound interest. •	Over the past ten years, such risk free saving has been unable to compete with riskier mediums because of artificially low interest rates, forcing traditional ""savers"" into the mutual fund and ETF market place. •	 (Funds and ETFs have become the ""new"" stock market, a place where individual equity prices have become invisible, questions about company fundamentals meet with blank stares, and media talking heads tell us that individuals are no longer in the stock market). Risk comes in various forms, but the average income investor’s primary concerns are ""financial"" and, when investing for income without the proper mindset, ""market"" risk. •	Financial risk involves the ability of corporations, government entities, and even individuals, to honor their financial commitments. •	Market risk refers to the absolute certainty that all marketable securities will experience fluctuation in market value... sometimes more so than others, but this ""reality"" needs to be planned for and dealt with, never feared. •	Question: Is it the demand for individual stocks that push up funds and ETF prices, or vice versa? We can minimize financial risk by selecting only high quality (investment grade) securities, by diversifying properly, and by understanding that market value change is actually ""income harmless"". By having a plan of action for dealing with ""market risk"", we can actually turn it into investment opportunity. •	What do banks do to get the amount of interest they guarantee to depositors? They invest in securities that pay a fixed rate of income regardless of changes in market value. You don’t have to be a professional investment manager to manage your investment portfolio professionally. But, you do need to have a long term plan and know something about asset allocation… an often misused and misunderstood portfolio planning/organization tool. •	For example, annual portfolio ""rebalancing"" is a symptom of dysfunctional asset allocation. Asset allocation needs to control every investment decision throughout the year, every year, regardless of changes in market value. It is important to recognize, as well, that you do not need hi tech computer programs, economic scenario simulators, inflation estimators, or stock market projections to get yourself lined up properly with your retirement income target. What you do need is common sense, reasonable expectations, patience, discipline, soft hands, and an oversized driver. The ""KISS principle"" should be the foundation of your investment plan; compound earnings the epoxy that keeps the structure safe and secure over the developmental period. Additionally, an emphasis on ""working capital"" (as opposed to market value) will help you through all four basic portfolio management processes. (Business majors, remember PLOC?) Finally, a chance to use something you learned in college! Planning for Retirement The retirement income portfolio (nearly all investment portfolios become retirement portfolios eventually) is the financial hero that appears on the scene just in time to fill the income gap between what you need for retirement and the guaranteed payments you will receive from Uncle and/or past employers. How potent the force of the super hero, however, does not depend on the size of the market value number; from a retirement perspective, it's the income produced inside the costume that shields us from financial villains. Which of these heroes do you want in your wallet? •	A million dollar VTINX portfolio that produces about $19,200 per year in spending money. •	A million dollar, well diversified, income CEF portfolio that generates more than $70,000 annually... even with the same equity allocation as the Vanguard fund (just under 30%). •	A million dollar portfolio of GOOG, NFLX, and FB that produces no spending money at all. I've heard said that a 4% draw from a retirement income portfolio is about normal, but what if that's not enough to fill your ""income gap"" and/or more than the amount produced by the portfolio. If both of these ""what ifs"" prove true... well, it's not a pretty picture. And it becomes uglier rather quickly when you look inside your actual 401k, IRA, TIAA CREF, ROTH, etc. portfolio and realize that it is not producing even close to 4% in actual spendable income. Total return, yes. Realized spendable income, 'fraid not. •	Sure your portfolio has been ""growing"" in market value over the past ten years, but it is likely that no effort has been made to increase the annual income it produces. The financial markets live on market value analytics, and so long as the market goes up every year, we're told that everything is fine. •	So what if your ""income gap"" is more than 4% of your portfolio; what if your portfolio is producing less than 2% like the Vanguard Retirement Income Fund; or what if the market stops growing by more than 4% per year ... while you are still depleting capital at a 5%, 6% or even a 7% clip??? The less popular (available only in individual portfolios) Closed End Income Fund approach has been around for decades, and has all of the ""what ifs"" covered. They, in combination with Investment Grade Value Stocks (IGVS), have the unique ability to take advantage of market value fluctuations in either direction, increasing portfolio income production with every monthly reinvestment procedure. •	Monthly reinvestment must never become a DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) approach, please. Monthly income must be pooled for selective reinvestment where the most ""bang for the buck"" can be achieved. The objective is to reduce cost basis per share and increase position yield... with one click of the mouse. A retirement income program that is focused only on market value growth is doomed from the getgo, even in IGVS. All portfolio plans need an  income focused asset allocation of at least 30%, oftentimes more, but never less. All individual security purchase decision-making needs to  support the operative ""growth purpose vs. income purpose"" asset allocation plan. •	The ""Working Capital Model"" is a 40+ years tested auto pilot asset allocation system that pretty much guarantees annual income growth when used properly with a minimum 40% income purpose allocation. The following bullet points apply to the asset allocation plan running individual taxable and tax deferred portfolios... not 401k plans because they typically can't produce adequate  income. Such plans should be allocated to maximum possible safety within six years of retirement, and rolled over to a personally directed IRA as soon as physically possible. •	The ""income purpose"" asset allocation begins at 30% of working capital, regardless of portfolio size, investor age, or amount of liquid assets available for investment. •	Start up portfolios (under $30,000) should have no equity component, and no more than 50% until six figures are reached. From $100k (until age 45), as little as 30% to income is acceptable, but not particularly income productive. •	At age 45, or $250k, move to 40% income purpose; 50% at age 50; 60% at age 55, and 70% income purpose securities from age 65 or retirement, whichever comes first. •	The income purpose side of the portfolio should be kept as fully invested as possible, and all asset allocation determinations must be based on working capital (i.e., portfolio cost basis); cash is considered part of the equity, or ""growth purpose"" allocation •	Equity investments are limited to seven year experienced equity CEFs and/or ""investment grade value stocks"" (as defined in the ""Brainwashing"" book). Even if you are young, you need to stop smoking heavily and to develop a growing stream of income. If you keep the income growing, the market value growth (that you are expected to worship) will take care of itself. Remember, higher market value may increase hat size, but it doesn’t pay the bills. So this is the plan. Determine your retirement income needs; start your investment program with an income focus; add equities as you age and your portfolio becomes more significant; when retirement looms, or portfolio size becomes serious, make your income purpose allocation serious as well. Don’t worry about inflation, the markets, or the economy... your asset allocation will keep you moving in the right direction while it focuses on growing your income every year. •	This is the key point of the whole ""retirement income readiness"" scenario. Every dollar added to the portfolio (or earned by the portfolio) is reallocated according to ""working capital"" asset allocation. When the income allocation is above 40%, you will see the income rising magically every quarter... regardless of what's going on in the financial markets. •	Note that all IGVS pay dividends that are also divvied up according to the asset allocation. If you are within ten years of retirement age, a growing income stream is precisely what you want to see. Applying the same approach to your IRAs (including the 401k rollover) , will produce enough income to pay the RMD (required mandatory distribution) and put you in a position to say, without reservation: •	Neither a stock market correction nor rising interest rates will have a negative impact on my retirement income; in fact, I'll be able to grow my income even better in either environment."
18,How To Break Into Forex Trading And Trade Like A Pro,finance," Have you ever wondered what separates successful forex traders from those that don’t survive in the forex market? After careful analysis, we have outlined 5 strategies that successful forex traders use to achieve greater success in their trading. When you follow these strategies, you too will stand a much greater chance of having more profitable and successful trades. Be Patient. Successful forex traders are very patient. They wait until time is on their side and won’t make a rash trade decision based on their emotions. In other words, they won’t trade unless they receive green-light signals from their trading software. Many websites like ours provide high-end professional software that sends the signals to let you know exactly when to buy and when to sell. When trading in the forex market, every second counts and that’s why having the right software program to provide buy and sell signals is so important. Without applying sophisticated mathematical calculations, it is impossible to know if any currency is going to go up or down.  Professional trading software programs like what you will find on www.Formulas4Forex.com take all the guesswork out of the equations. Successful traders rely on software when doing 9 out of 10 trades. Practice Risk Management. Successful traders aren’t afraid to lose money on occasion on a trade. It’s important not to prove yourself right by waiting too long to sell at a stop loss in the event that your currency investment begins losing its value. Professional traders continue to manage risk without taking account the series of losing or winning trades and they set stop losses accordingly. The end results is seen as a numbers game. You will win some of the time and lose some of the time, but if the right strategies are in place, you will come out ahead more often than not. The best trading strategies have a success rate of around 30 to 50%. They are mostly profitable thanks to their risk/return ratio. Take Smaller Profits - Avoid Making Decisions Based On Greed. Successful traders are in and out of buying and selling much faster than those that don’t have a lot of experience. They buy when prices are down and sell when others are on a buying streak. They often sell during the bull market faster than others because they know what goes up must also come down. This allows them to take profit when there is an opportunity without waiting for things to turn down rather quickly and losing their gains. It is important to take smaller profits than wait for larger ones which can often return in a decline on the market while one is waiting for more. Keep Your Emotions In Check – One of the most important traits that separates professional traders from unexperienced ones is their ability to stay disciplined and manage their emotions. Successful traders put strategies above emotions. They don’t punish themselves if a trade doesn’t work out as planned and they don’t plan on how they will spend their millions when experiencing a bull-run. Instead, they wait for the market to match their pre-planned strategy. They simply will not trade if there are no signals, unlike others who rush into a trade simply because the market seems to be in an upward swing, believing they can predict when the next run will happen. Successful traders understand a market’s volatility and they proceed with caution by keeping emotions like fear and greed out of their decision making. The best way to keep emotions in check is to never invest more than you can afford to lose. If you are worried about every penny, then it means you are investing too much and you need to adjust the amount you are investing so it is more comfortable to you. Don’t Invest More Than You Can Afford To Lose - Professional Traders Don’t Trade On Any Expectations -  Successful traders do not have any expectation about whether or not a particular trade is going to be a winner or a loser. Even if you have a trading strategy in place that you know has a specific win rate, you still do not know when any given instance of your edge will result in a winning trade or a losing trade."
19,Don’t Fall Victim to these 3 Tax Scams in 2018,finance," We’re only a couple of weeks into the 2018 Tax Season, and already the IRS has put out an alarm concerning multiple tax scams. The IRS says they’ve received numerous fake tax returns complete with names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank information. Many of these false returns originate from the Equifax breach in September 2017, when hackers stole personal data for over 145.5 million people in the United States. Since then, many actions have rolled into place, minimizing the effects of the breach. The best way to handle the Equifax breach is to file early. Filing as soon as you have your W-2 and other tax documents in place will lock out any fraudsters from filing as you. However, the Equifax breach isn’t the only thing you need to worry about this tax season. Make sure that you are on guard, and that you protect your taxpayer information from getting into the wrong hands. Here are 3 of the biggest tax scams that are floating around this time of year. Phishing We live in a day and age where everything happens online, and all our information is somewhere on a computer. Even if your computer and all your accounts are password protected, one misclick can pop open all your personal information on a hacker’s screen. Phishing comes as a link, but they can disguise as anything – a website URL, image file, downloadable content, etc. Do not click on any link without first being sure they’re a reputable source and have no prior phishing incidents. Understand the IRS is old-fashion. Don’t ever initiate contact with anyone claiming to be from the IRS over email. They will first contact you only by mail, then by phone or in person. Fake Debt Collectors It’s scary how tax scammers come up with new ways to get away with your tax refund. Recently, there’s been reports of bogus refunds sent directly to a taxpayer’s bank account. Then the tax scammer poses as a debt collector and contacts the taxpayer, claiming an error in the refund and that the amount is really what they owed. From here they’ll collect your taxpayer information and try to file with the IRS under your name. That’s why it’s important to file as soon as you can once you have your tax documents in order. This limits the timeframe tax scammers have to trick you, and you’ll know for certain how much your refund is without anyone else telling you otherwise. Seasonal Tax Preparers Suddenly there seems to be a lot more tax preparation services around you since tax season started. However, not all of them are genuine. Some of these unscrupulous tax preparers set up shop for a couple of months inside an inexpensive office, exploiting walk-ins by taking their identity and perpetrating refund fraud. If you plan on filing your taxes in person with a tax professional, be sure that they are credible. Use online resources such as the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to see if the tax preparer is really who they make out to be. -- We warn you about all these scams now, in hopes you don’t fall victim to these cons. Tax scams have a way of burgeoning overnight, fueled by success. Digging yourself out of tax fraud is a rough task, even harder than if you lost your credit card accounts."
20,"Understanding ""Income Purpose"" Investing",finance," After 45 years of investing, I've come to the conclusion that the equity (or growth purpose) market is a far easier medium for investors to understand than the far safer, and generally less volatile, income purpose securities market. As counter intuitive as this sounds, experience supports the premise. ""Understanding"" boils down to the development of reasonable expectations: just how do you expect the market value of your income purpose securities to react to varying market, interest rate, economic, political, atmospheric, and ""other"" conditions""... and, does it really matter? Few investors grow to love volatility as I do, but most expect it in the market value of their equity positions. When dealing with ""income purpose"" securities, however, neither they, their guru/advisors, nor market commentators are comfortable with any downward movement whatsoever. •	Not to make excuses for them, but most professional and media folk think in terms of the individual bonds and other debt securities that Wall Street markets to brokerage firms and other large investment entities. Bond traders hate to discount their inventory due to higher interest rates... it's bad for year end bonuses. But their bond market disaster is the individual investor's opportunity to buy the same amount of income at a lower price. Most investors are also more receptive to loss taking advice on income securities than they are with respect to equities... always the affect of a ""market value"" rather than an ""income production"" focus... and a well kept Wall Street secret. The list below describes some important characteristics and concepts involved with investing in income purpose securities. Familiarization with these will aid in the development of valid ""performance"" expectations. Doing so will also help develop an appreciation of this important (and somehow not too often mentioned) relationship:  changing market values (in either direction) rarely have any impact on the income being generated by the security. •	Confucius say: keep your eye on the ball, you can't buy groceries with market value or total return, only income pays the bills... without depleting sacred capital General attributes of income purpose securities: •	They generate a predictable stream of interest, dividend, rent, royalty or other income. •	They pay income in specific amounts on specified dates. •	Their risk of financial loss varies dependent upon security type, issuer quality, and maturity, BUT, all normal income securities are considered far less risky (financially) than the common stock of their respective issuing entities. State government paper is less risky; federal government issues carry no financial risk at all. •	The purpose of the income asset allocation of an investment portfolio is the production of  income in an amount large enough to assure: annual growth of income producing capital and annual growth of income production. •	High dividend common stocks (utilities, etc.) are not included within the income purpose security definition, although they may be less risky than other equities. •	Bonds, loans, and other interest bearing securities are issued by both corporations and government entities and have maturity dates upon which the principal is returned to investors. •	Income securities that are guaranteed as to principal and interest, or protected by ""safety mechanisms"" of any kind always bear a lower yield than otherwise similar securities. •	Generally, fluctuations in market value have nothing to do with the financial viability of the security issuer. Most often, they are the result of anticipated changes in the direction of interest rates, or the tax code. •	Any form of either market value or total return performance analysis in a predominantly income purpose investment portfolio is counterproductive, at best... particularly when compared with any form of equity index. •	Bonds, mortgages, notes, and other ""debt"" instruments are generally illiquid securities with wide price ""spreads"", and difficult to either sell at ""statement"" prices or add to from the marketplace; income closed end fund portfolios are liquid containers for illiquid securities, thus eliminating the major drawbacks of owning individual bonds, mortgages, loans, etc. •	Higher interest rates (lower prices) are good for income  investors because they produce higher yields from new (and existing) securities that are available for purchase. •	Lower interest rates (higher prices) are good for income investors because they can provide ""reasonable"" profit opportunities on securities already owned. •	A reasonable trading profit on an income purpose security is anything in the neighborhood of ""one year's interest in advance"", keeping in mind that three 7s always beat two 10s. Theoretically, income purpose securities should be the ultimate ""buy and hold"" security blanket within retirement income portfolios. But if you examine the average retirement portfolio, especially 401k portfolios, you would find a remarkable low ""income purpose"" asset allocation. This seemingly nonsensical behavior is as much the result of government regulation as Wall Street manipulation. For example: •	The Vanguard Retirement Income Fund (VTINX), with nearly $17 billion in assets, is one of the most popular and well respected of all funds in retirement income portfolios, particularly 401ks. The five individual funds inside yield just 1.75% in actual spending money to investors... but they are dirt cheap. •	A diversified portfolio of income purpose Closed End Funds (CEFs), with payment histories stretching back more than twenty years, would yield well in excess of 7.00% after somewhat higher expenses. CEFs are never found in 401k plans and rarely appear in IRA and other retirement portfolios created by investment professionals; please let me know if you know why. •	Confucius say: if you buy cheap, you get what you pay for The focus of an income purpose portfolio needs to be: the amount of realized, spendable, income produced irrespective of market value fluctuations. The operative investment management objectives need to be: growing both the productive working capital and the spendable ""base income"" within the portfolio. Wall Street has you believing that lower market values are always bad and that higher prices are always good. This is the conventional wisdom we've all had thrust upon us for decades. But price volatility is the very nature of securities markets, the very reality that creates both buying and profit taking opportunities, particularly in income purpose securities. •	Higher income purpose security prices mean lower yields, but also increased realized profit potential; lower income purpose security prices mean higher yields and buying opportunities. I see no bad or good; just the opportunity created by either scenario. (The same is true, incidentally, with Investment Grade Value Stocks.) •	It is the inherent safety (i.e., lower risk of financial loss) of income purpose securities that creates this almost perfect relationship. Price volatility is always good. ""It's OK, it's natural, every market value fluctuation is satisfactual"" is what I've been singing for decades... particularly since the creation of income CEFs. Rarely, even in the three major meltdowns of the past 40 years did any high quality company or government entity default, regardless of tremendous price fluctuations in all securities. Each time, the vast majority of CEF income payments kept rolling in, unscathed by the surrounding chaos."

1,Why Investing In Gold.Gold v paper money: Which should we trust more?,finance," A popular solution to the financial crisis has been to print more money, but is there another way to change our economy? Would the financial system be more stable if every pound, dollar or euro in our pocket were still backed by gold? Brian from Manchester has lost confidence in the money. After selling his house, he decided to turn his money into something he says he can trust: gold. ""I started in 2005 and now I have a value of £ 200,000, about half of what I have, in gold. ""If I kept all my money in the bank, the value of my work would decrease in the long term or be erased."" Brian fears that inflation will undermine the value of his savings over time or, worse, that banks and weak governments can not protect them in another financial crisis. And he is not alone in these fears. Frances, who lives in London, sold her apartment in 2008 and invested £ 40,000 in gold profits, which she bought over the Internet and kept in a safe in Switzerland. ""I'm not afraid of a financial Armageddon,"" she says in Radio 4's analysis, ""but I'm worried that governments, in their desperate search for wealth, are constantly printing more money to deal with the debt people like me ""Then I have to protect myself."" Both Frances and Brian have dedicated their fortunes directly to the value of gold. You've been put in a gold standard, if you like. Some economists and politicians say that currencies have to do the same, that we have to redraw the link between money and something tangible. How central banks around the world print billions of pounds, euros and dollars through measures such as quantitative easing, which makes more sense: believe in money from the air or believe in a yellow metal that does not have Can you spend your tank or even eat in stores? This is an argument that reveals deep divisions among economists. In the green corner are those who print more money to free us from trouble and in the corner of the gold are people who are sometimes denigrated as ""golden insects"" who believe we are in control of the monetary reality. Detlev Schlichter, a former banker and author of Paper Money Collapse, says the current system is badly flawed. ""The problem is that what we use as money can be created and produced by privileged money producers, the central bank, and the banking system. ""They can produce as much money as they want, so providing that kind of money is totally elastic, it's totally flexible."" Detlev Schlichter believes that in the end it will make people lose confidence in our current system of elastic money and resort to something that does not get long, like gold. He advocates a system of radical market economy in which there are no central banks and where currencies, which are no longer linked to national states, compete for credibility. He believes that in such a system, the money that can be exchanged in the bank for something of value, such as gold, would be more attractive than a 10-pound note that can only be exchanged for two $ 5 bills. books. For centuries money made or supported by gold was the norm. The United States was still under the gold standard until President Richard Nixon left in 1971 because foreign governments began to trade the dollars they had for gold and the United States began to run out of bullion. And that, the dominant thought says, is the problem. If the power to create more money is limited, prices may fall as the economy grows and produces more goods and services. You may think it sounds good, but opponents of standard gold argue that there is a problem. Why buy something today if you know it's probably cheaper tomorrow? Consumers stop investing and the economy stagnates, which is why most economists fear deflation. DeAnne Julius, from Chatham House think tank, was a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, the body that decides how much money is in the system. She said that if the money in the system were limited by being linked to gold, it would limit economic growth, which is the last thing we need now. ""I think it's very stupid to trust gold as the basis of a country's monetary system,"" says Dr. Julius. You can not force a government to keep gold, so gold has no credibility Lord Lawson, former Chancellor of the chessboard And not only because it would limit growth, but because it would be almost a waste. ""We currently have less than one percent of our GDP that the Bank of England gold reserves, that would be the kind of multiplier you need to create book notes, which were closely related to gold something of the order of four, five hundred times "", Explain. ""Every time the price of gold moves, you will find that the value of this money jumps in your pocket: an extremely unstable and volatile way of managing an economy."" This volatility in gold prices means that it is risky for investors like Brian and Frances who have amassed a large part of their personal savings in gold investments: 40,000 pounds of gold could be worth less in a year. According to central bankers, the benefits of the current system are that they can take corrective action in difficult times by lowering interest rates that encourage people to spend rather than saving, which in turn stimulates economic activity. Detlev Schlichter says giving this kind of power to the monetary authorities is part of the problem as it only delays a financial crisis: ""The current system is a political instrument: it allows the central bank, and more broadly, the state to manage the economic booms, created in the short term but paid off with a big cat from the end of the boom."" If we had stayed at the gold standard, it would probably be true that we were not in the mess that we are today. Yes, our economies would be much smaller, but perhaps their fundamentals would be stronger if the only currency in circulation were money tied to something tangible like gold. But would the return to the gold standard work in a world where monetary systems are controlled by central banks and governments? ""You can not force a government to keep gold, so gold has no credibility,"" says Lord Lawson, Treasury director in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher. ""Because [the abandonment of the gold standard] has happened several times in economic history, gold is no longer practicing this discipline."" The countries gave up gold when it became difficult in the 1930s and 1970s. So, when the parts returned to the gold standard, could address so-called ""gold bugs"" who have lost faith in paper money, but could also represent a new wave of skeptics who trust the ring gold and broken Listen to the full report on Analysis on BBC Radio 4 on Monday, July 2nd at 8:00 pm and Sunday, July 8th at 9:30 pm.

2,Market Numbers Through 2017... Not Quite as Impressive as You  Think,finance," No one would deny that 2017 was a banner year for the markets...at year end, all the equity indices were close to their all time highs. Even the WSMSI (Working Capital Model Select Income Index) had a capital growth number approaching 12%. But, lets step around Wall Street's promotional pennants, and look at the numbers over the long term, say this century so far... You'll recall that the period from 1999 through 2009 was dubbed ""The Dismal Decade"" by a Wall Street that just couldn't cope with the idea that the ""shock market"" (collectively) could actually go backwards over such a long period of time. Has the ""bull market"" that evolved from the dismal decade really produced the type of gains you've been hearing about? •	From 1999 through 2009, the NASDAQ  (home of ""FANG"" type companies since forever) shrunk by a whopping 34%. From 1999 through 2017, it was the worst performing of all the indices, rising just 71%, or an average of less than 3% compounded, per year. So even the spectacular 160% market value gain since 2009 hasn't produced spectacular long term performance. •	From 1999 through 2009, the S & P 500 (although less speculative than the NASDAQ overall) lost a scary 39% of its value. Recovering more quickly than the NASDAQ, the S & P has gained  approximately 94% in market value over the past 18 years, or an average of less than 4% compounded, annually. So not so much to celebrate in the S & P either... for the long term investor. •	From 1999 through 2017, the higher quality content DJIA suffered less than the other indices through the dismal decade, losing less than 1% per year, on average. But its 18 year, overall performance, of 115% market value growth was an average of less than 5% per year . Reflective of higher quality content, yes, but really not so impressive overall. So what about an income purpose investing approach during the same two time periods? •	From 1999 through 2017, a $100,000 portfolio of income Closed End Funds (CEFs) paying roughly 7% per year, compounded annually, would have grown the invested capital to roughly $340,000 by the end of 2017... a 240% gain in Working Capital, and nearly three times the average long term gain of the three equity averages! •	During the dismal decade itself, a $100,000 portfolio of income CEFs paying 7%, and compounded annually, would have grown the investment capital by  roughly 111% (10% annually). •	Note that the average annual gain of roughly 13% is based on annual rather than monthly reinvestment of earnings.... so it would actually be even higher. Hmmm, kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it? Now some what ifs: •	What if you were living on the income or growth of your portfolio at any time before mid-2010? •	What if you were living on 4% of your portfolio ""growth"" or ""total return"" prior to the end of 1999, how much did you have left when the rally began in 2010? •	What if we don't get enough more years of double digit market growth for the equity markets to catch up with the income illustration above? •	What if the market doesn't produce ""total return"" greater than your expenditure needs forever? •	What if your portfolio contained enough income purpose securities to provide for your expenditures, combined with equity securities of a quality superior to those contained in the Dow? •	What if the stock market corrects again this year?"
3,Re-thinking IRA Fees and Tax Free Income In The New Tax Code Environment,finance," Just when we thought we had handled the DOL mandated changes to our IRA fee payment arrangements, a new tax code comes along and changes everything... literally. Read this ""fine print"" first: I am not an accountant and cannot give tax advice; please consult with your tax professional before making any changes to how you deal with fees in your investment portfolios. The information provided below is offered strictly from a portfolio management perspective. My understanding is that investment management fees of any kind are no longer tax deductible, IRA or otherwise. Here's an article that speaks to this issue: •	https://wtop.com/business-finance/2018/01/what-the-new-tax-law-means-for-your-2018-taxes Additionally, the establishment of a whole new set of lower tax brackets (both individual and corporate) seems to have many investors thinking that tax free municipal bond income is less attractive than taxable income. In some cases, it just may be. It is this not so ""black or white"" sentiment, ironically, that is making closed end fund municipal bond investments more productive... as they move slightly lower in price. Here's the tax free vs. taxable mathematics, plus some additional important information: •	A Tax Free Yield of 5% = 7.7% taxable, in a 35% bracket; 6.9% in a 28% bracket; 6.67% in a 25% bracket; but just 5.56% in a marginal 10% bracket. (Note: there are many taxable CEFs yielding more than 7.7%, so in any bracket, some strategic thought is necessary. •	There are still dozens of tax free muni bond closed end funds (CEFs) yielding over 5%, and many that are paying between 5.5% and 6.3%. My feeling is that the latter group is still very attractive, emotionally (the safety of principal element), as well as mathematically. •	Examine the chart on the page linked to below, to determine if tax free or taxable is better for you, bearing in mind that nearly all tax free CEFs (in my opinion) are less risky than nearly all taxable varietals. All are less risky than equities, including all forms of equity ETFs... but you knew that, right. •	https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/munis-vs-taxables-how-to-determine-the-taxable-equivalent-yield.touch There seems to be at least three issues that investors need to deal with, after speaking to their trusted tax professional: •	Does tax free income above 5% make as much financial sense for you now as it did before you moved into a lower marginal tax bracket? •	Should I, once again, start paying my IRA management/transaction fees from my IRA, since they are (probably) not deductible anyway, and seem to be a ""no tax, no penalty"", disbursement? •	Since a ROTH IRA is a tax free growth and income portfolio, wouldn't it be better to pay ROTH investment fees from some other checking or investment account? ...and one issue where income tax advice is far less critical: •	In two of past three major stock market corrections (and there will be another stock market correction eventually), investors, particularly late arrivals to the party, swarmed into income focused investments as they threw their overpriced equities out their virtual Window's windows. My personal approach to all four issues has been: •	To shift my tax free holdings exclusively into above 5% CEFs while adding a small percentages of taxable CEFs and 5% or better yielding equity CEFs to both my corporate and personal portfolios... slowly replacing the under 5% municipals. Note that my non IRA accounts are strictly ""income purpose"" portfolios. •	My IRA fees are, once again, being taken as (presumably) non-taxable deductions from my IRA accounts. •	I have no ROTH accounts, where all earnings from all sources are forever tax free, but my feeling is that all ""management/transaction fees"" (where possible) should be taken from other sources. This allows the compound earnings power of the ROTH vehicle to continue as long as possible. •	All of my equity (and income, yeah, really) security profits are taken at lower than normal levels to assure abundant ""just in case"" liquidity. Most equity investments are in the form of managed CEF portfolios, because they can be added to safely (and at even higher yields) when the markets start to cycle downward. The little known "" Market Cycle Investment Management"" process has successfully navigated all three major market meltdowns since the 1970's. The ""Brainwashing of the American Investor: The book that Wall Street does not want you to read"" will prepare you for the inevitable."
4,Find Out If 72(T) Penalty Free Income Is a Solution for You,finance," Over my 30+ years in business, my team and I have helped many families to get financially organized and to make better investment decisions with their money. We have counseled individuals and families about how to save money and accumulate wealth. We've been a big believer and teacher of wealth building and believe the only way to do this for most people is to systematically save money each month as an automatic deduction from their checking account of and transferred to a separate investment account. This ""pay yourself first"" mentality has been why most our clients have accumulated substantial wealth over time. This ""pay yourself first"" system is the exact reason so many people have accumulated significant wealth in their 401(k) and/or other Retirement Account (the equity in your home is a similar analogy since making monthly payments over 15 or 30 years plus appreciation also accumulates significant wealth). Contributing for many years to your 401(k) has allowed many people to accumulate what is the largest liquid some of money they will have in their e. am also a big believer in dollar cost averaging. Adding money every (2) weeks or every month to your entire 401(k) allows you to buy more shares when the price of shares is lower and less shares when the prices are high. This is dollar cost averaging. Many of our clients are under the age of 59 ½ and were looking to access their IRA, 401(k), TSP, TSA, pension/retirement funds without being assessed the 10% early distribution penalty. If this is something you want or need to do, by taking substantially equal periodic payments (SEPP) or 72(t) payments you can take early distributions from your IRA and avoid the penalty. Keep in mind that there are many rules and considerations that must be taken into account. Remember, it takes no skill to spend money; the hard part is to make it and save it. I have always believed that ""you get what you pay for."" In my life, I've always believed ""it pays to get advice"". Once of my favorite sayings is, ""Common see people who have made common sense investment sense is NOT that common"". Every day in my practice mistakes that have cost them thousands or tens of thousands of dollars that could have been avoided by getting proper advice and counsel from a competent financial professional. Often, people make financial decisions and then ask, ""Did I make the right decision?"". We hope people will consult with us before they make a 72(t) early retirement decision because the costs and penalties for mistakes are significant. I agree that there are some areas of personal finance that you can do yourself without the help of an advisor. For example, setting up a checking or savings account at a local bank or credit union. when it comes to investment planning, asset management, income planning, life and disability insurance, required minimum distribution strategies as well as 72 hiring a professional is a smart decision. Calling one of the (800) numbers at a well-known Investment Company and asking them to help you with 72(t) planning is a problem waiting to happen. Why? These companies are not in the advice business. They really don't want to advise on these 72(t) strategies; they simply want you to invest money at their company. Because we are affiliated with an independent broker-dealer, we do not have any proprietary products to push. We are truly an independent advisory firm and have many solution (""risk based"" and ""safe money options"") that we can offer to help our clients and prospects carry out their stated goals and goals. If you are thinking that the 72(t) strategy may be for you, it is essential that you consult with a 72(t) specialist. Again, this is not a do-it-yourself project. Committing to these 72(t) payments is a big decision. There are ten 72(t) rules that are used as a guideline, and are realistically just the tip of the iceberg for what is actually involved. 72(t) planning is complex and the penalties for mistakes are significant. Why would people want to access their money prior to 59 ½? Lots of reasons. Everyone has a different story, and everyone has different dreams and goals, circumstances and situations. As a financial advisor helping individuals, families, business owners and entrepreneurs to get financially organized and to make better decisions with their money, I realized that there was an area of financial planning that not many advisors specialized in. This area of specialization is 72(t) IRA ""pre 59 ½"" retirement distribution planning. Ten 72(t) Rules you need to know before you get started: The payments must continue for at least five (5) years or until you are age 59 ½, whichever period is longer The payments must be substantially equal and generally may not be changed or stopped during the payment term, unless you become disabled or die You must take the payments at least annually. The 72(t) payment plan is only applicable to the IRA or IRAs from which you calculated your first payment. Before setting up a 72(t) payment plan, you can split your IRA into two IRAs if that best meets your needs. You can use one IRA to calculate and take your 72(t) payments, while the other can remain available for future non-72(t) use. The IRS has approved three methods for calculating 72(t) payments. Those methods are the required minimum distribution (RMD) method, the amortization method, and the annuity factor method. The RMD method will produce smaller payments than the other two methods to start out. While other methods of calculating the payments are not prohibited, it would be extremely risky to use some other method that is not officially ""blessed"" by the IRS You can switch to the RMD method from either the amortization or the annuity factor method. This is a one-time irrevocable switch and you must use the RMD method for the remainder of the schedule If you do not stick to your 72(t) payment plan, or if you change the payments, they will no longer qualify for the exemption from the 10% penalty. The bad news: the 10% penalty tax will be reinstated retroactively to all the distributions you have taken before age 59 ½. An extra withdrawal is considered a modification of the payment schedule. Any change I the account balance other than by regular gains and losses or 72(t) distributions, will be also considered a modification and the 10% penalty will be triggered. This means that you cannot add funds to your IRA either through rollovers or contributions. You can decide to start taking 72(t) payments from your IRA at any age. You may not roll over or convert your 72(t) payments. We suggest that people get competent specialized and personalized advice and counsel, 72(t) is not for everyone and many times there are other ideas that we have shared with our clients to help them figure out the financial challenges they are trying to accomplish."
5,Investing In Gold Smart Strategy,finance," Why Investing In Gold Why should gold be the product that has this unique property? Most likely it is because of its history as the first form of money, and later as the basis of the gold standard that sets the value of all money. Because of this, gold confers familiarity. Create a sense of security as a source of money that always has value, no matter what. The properties of gold also explain why it does not correlate with other assets. These include stocks, bonds and oil. The gold price does not rise when other asset classes do. It does not even have an inverse relationship because stocks and bonds are mutually exclusive. REASONS TO OWN GOLD 1.History of Holding Its Value Unlike paper money, coins or other assets, gold has maintained its value over the centuries. People see gold as a means to transmit and maintain their wealth from one generation to another.time 2.Inflation Historically, gold has been an excellent protection against inflation, because its price tends to increase when the cost of living increases. Over the past 50 years, investors have seen gold prices soar and the stock market plummet during the years of high inflation. Deflation is the period during which prices fall, economic activity slows down and the economy is overwhelmed by an excess of debt and has not been seen worldwide. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the relative purchasing power of gold increased while other prices fell sharply. 4.Geopolitical Fears/Factors Gold retains its value not only in times of financial uncertainty but also in times of geopolitical uncertainty. It is also often referred to as ""crisis commodity"" because people flee to their relative safety as global tensions increase. During these times gold outperforms any other investment. Why Including Gold In Your Portfolio Gold should be an important part of a diversified investment portfolio as prices rise in response to events that weigh on the value of paper assets, such as stocks and bonds. Although the price of gold may be volatile in the short term, it has always maintained its long-term value. Gold gives security to the investor, its price can zigzag crazily, but it will not creep, and it may be worth it. It offers a good opportunity for diversification To be successful in your long-term investment, you must diversify. Many people always jump quickly in actions and actions. But given the financial collapse in 2008, it would not be prudent to have some form of investment. THE HISTORY OF GOLD AND CURRENCIES The Bretton Wood Agreement of; the measurement of currency here was gold All world currencies are backed up by precious metals. One of these being gold playing the major role is support the value of all the currencies of the world. The bottom line is Gold is money and currencies are just papers that can wake up valueless because governments have the overruling power  to decide on the value of any country’s currency. The Future Of Currencies We Are At The Tipping Point WHY SMART INVESTORS ARE INVESTING IN GOLD? -The markets are now much more volatile after the Brexit and Trump elections. Defying all odds, the United States chose Donald Trump as its new president and no one can predict what the next four years will be. As commander-in-chief, Trump now has the power to declare a nuclear war and no one can legally stop him. Britain has left the EU and other European countries want to do the same. Wherever you are in the Western world, uncertainty is in the air like never before. -The government of the United States is monitoring the provision of retirement. In 2010, Portugal confiscated assets from the retirement account to cover public deficits and debts. Ireland and France acted in the same way in 2011 as Poland did in 2013. The US government. He has observed. Since 2011, the Ministry of Finance has taken four times money from the pension funds of government employees to compensate for budget deficits. The legend of multimillionaire investor Jim Rogers believes that private accounts will continue as government attacks. -The top 5 US banks are now larger than before the crisis. They have heard about the five largest banks in the United States and their systemic importance since the current financial crisis threatens to break them. Lawmakers and regulators promised that they would solve this problem as soon as the crisis was contained. More than five years after the end of the crisis, the five largest banks are even more important and critical to the system than before the crisis. The government has aggravated the problem by forcing some of these so-called ""oversized banks to fail"" to absorb the breaches. Any of these sponsors would fail now, it would be absolutely catastrophic. -The danger of derivatives now threatens banks more than in 2007/2008. The derivatives that collapsed the banks in 2008 did not disappear as promised by the regulators. Today, the derivatives exposure of the five largest US banks is 45% higher than before the economic collapse of 2008. The inferred bubble exceeded $ 273 billion, compared to $ 187 billion in 2008. -US interest rates are already at an abnormal level, leaving the Fed with little room to cut interest rates. Even after an annual increase in the interest rate, the key interest rate remains between ¼ and ½ percent. Keep in mind that before the crisis that broke out in August 2007, interest rates on federal funds were 5.25%. In the next crisis, the Fed will have less than half a percentage point, can cut interest rates to boost the economy. -US banks are not the safest place for your money. Global Finance magazine publishes an annual list of the world’s 50 safest banks. Only 5 of them are based in the United States.The first position of a US bank order is only # 39. -The Fed’s overall balance sheet deficit is still rising relative to the 2008 financial crisis: the US Federal Reserve still has about $ 1.8 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities in its 2008 financial crisis, more than double the $ 1 trillion US dollar. I had before the crisis started. When mortgage-backed securities become bad again, the Federal Reserve has much less leeway to absorb the bad assets than before. -The FDIC recognizes that it has no reserves to cover another banking crisis. The most recent annual report of the FDIC shows that they will not have enough reserves to adequately insure the country’s bank deposits for at least another five years. This amazing revelation admits that they can cover only 1.01% of bank deposits in the United States, or from $ 1 to $ 100 of their bank deposits. -Long-term unemployment is even higher than before the Great Recession. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in early 2007 before the start of the last crisis. Finally, while the unemployment rate reached the level of 4.7% observed when the financial crisis began to destroy the US economy, long-term unemployment remains high and participation in the labor market is significantly reduced five years after its end. the previous crisis. Unemployment could be much higher as a result of the coming crisis. -US companies fail at a record pace. At the beginning of 2016, Jim Clifton, CEO of Gallup, announced that the commercial failures of the United States are larger than the start-ups that began for the first time in more than three decades. The shortage of medium and small companies has a great impact on an economy that for a long time has been driven by the private sector. The larger companies are not immune to the problems either. Even heavyweights in the US economy such as Microsoft (which has reduced 18,000 jobs) and McDonald’s (which shut down 700 stores during the year) are suffering this terrible trend.

6,20 Things You Should Know About The New Tax Laws,finance," The Tax Laws have quite a few recent changes, here are 20 thing you should know. 2017 Taxes:  The new laws will be applied to 2018 taxes. Property taxes: The max total that can be written off is $10,000 for the combination of property taxes + income & sales tax Mortgage Interest Write-Off: The deduction has been lowered, now you can only deduct the first $750,000 of your mortgage interest. Home Equity Line mortgage interest will no longer be tax deductible on a primary residence unless the funds are used for renovations. Capital Gains:  This exclusion will remain the same at $250,000 for single & $500,000 for married couples.  You have to live in the property for two of the last five years as your primary residence Standard Deduction: this deduction has nearly doubled. •	Single Filers: the new standard deduction has risen to $12,000. •	Married Joint Filers: the new standard deduction has risen to $24,000. Investor Business Assets:  Business assets purchased new or used after September 9th 2017 such as equipment, furniture, fixtures, appliances, computer and so on for real estate activities have a 100% bonus depreciation deduction as an immediate write-off of the expense rather then having to depreciate it over time. Business entertainment:  These expenses are no longer tax deductible. Estate Tax:  The Estate Tax is applied to the transfer of property after someone dies.  The amount exempt from the tax has been doubled from the $5.49M for individuals & $10.98M for married couples Health Insurance: The penalization for not having health insurance has been eliminated.  The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that as a result, 13 million fewer people will have insurance coverage by 2027, and premiums will go up by about 10% most years. Personal Exemption:  This deduction is now gone.  Previously you could claim a personal exemption of $4,050 for: yourself; your spouse and each of your dependents which would lower your taxable income. The Child Tax Credit:  This credit has been increased to $2,000 for children under 17.  The entire credit can now be claimed by a single parent who makes up to $200,000 & married couples who make up to $400,000. Non-Child Dependents:  This can apply to a number of people adults support, such as children over age 17, elderly parents or adult children with a disability for a $500 temporary credit. Medical Expenses:  You can deduct medical expenses that add up to more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. Alimony Payments:  The person that writes the checks cannot deduct their alimony payments if the Divorce or Separation paperwork is dated after 12/31/2018 Student loan interest: The $2,500 annual deduction for student loan interest will remain. 529 Savings Accounts:  These qualified tuition plans aren’t taxed but could previously only be used towards college expenses.  Now annually $10,000 can be distributed to cover the cost of sending a child to a Public, Private or Religious elementary or secondary school. Deficit:  The net number crunched by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that the Tax Reform will likely increase deficits by $1.46 trillion over the next decade. Corporate Tax:  Their rate is coming down to 21% from the previous 35%. The alternative minimum tax for corporations has been thrown out as well. Tax Preparation Deduction:  The deduction for having your taxes prepared by a professional or for accounting software has been eliminated. Fewer Local Accountants:  The increase of Standard Deductions will likely result in more people preparing their own personal tax returns. On the campaign trail Trump has said ""I want to put H&R Block out of business"".  Over time there will likely be less local professional accountants along with their advice, the community will likely suffer from this loss."
7,The Importance of Financial Planning,finance," For the majority of us, managing finances and the proper management of these finances for our future and our family's future are a top priority. However, many of us aren't sure where to start. In the back of our heads, we assume there will be more time or that we will begin in a few years, but the truth of the matter is, a few years may just be around the corner. It is crucial to be aware that when saving for your future the earlier you start, the better off you will be in setting and reaching realistic financial goals. It’s time we realize; there is more to planning than just saving money. When we think financial planning, we think well of well-off individuals being able to hire someone to handle their bills.

9,The Role of a Conveyancing Lawyer during the Home Loan Process,finance," Purchasing a new home often is an overwhelming process with many hurdles and legalities that the ordinary Aussie individual may not be familiar with. It is widely accepted as practical knowledge that a conveyancing lawyer is critical throughout the purchasing process with engagements relating to advice on the terms of the contract, conducting land searches, making legal applications, and all other work relating to documentation. So long as there is documentation involved, you can safely assume that a conveyancing lawyer acting on your behalf will have the responsibility and obligation to advise you on the best form of action in your interests. When it comes to the home loan process, many individuals aren’t aware that conveyancing lawyers too have a role to play. Acting for the Buyer Often times it is assumed that the mortgage journey either involves the buyer and a lender or the buyer and a mortgage broker (who then communicates with the banks on behalf of the buyer). Although it is not common for conveyancers to be part of the financial arrangements between you and lending institutions, their obligation to act as your legal representative in the property buying process is enough to engage them in some respect. As a result, consultation with a conveyancer can be made with regards to any home loan documentation between the buyer and the banks. These documents can include any arrangement of the settlement with the bank, facilitation of the home loan process through ensuring that the bank receives all the necessary documentation such as the land title as well as assisting in the preparation of mortgage documents. This can prove to be extremely useful especially if you aren’t savvy with legal terminology or aren’t accustomed to perusing a bundle of home loan documentation from a bank. After all, it is the duty of conveyancing lawyers, and a role of the profession, to diligently review relevant paperwork to ensure that their client’s interests are preserved. A conveyancing lawyer can also assist in providing the bank with the vendor’s cheque details and help in sorting out any discrepancies between adjustments made before settlement to ensure that you only need to pay the price due from the settlement date. Even if you are engaging with a mortgage broker, you can still seek assistance from your conveyancing lawyer with regard to the home loan documentation received from the lender. Your mortgage broker will still require you to review documents before signing them which gives you ample opportunity to seek the advice of your conveyancer to ensure that the home loan acts in your best interest. Acting for the Seller When it comes to the financing aspect of a sale of property, a conveyancing lawyer who is acting on behalf of the seller will be responsible for arranging for the discharge of the seller’s mortgage with the banks upon the sale of a property. This discharge includes the arrangement and review of all relevant documentation to ensure that the title to the land is clear from encumbrances."
10,Trend Determiner for MetaTrader,finance," Finding the trend on a chart can be subjective. The trend determiner indicator examines the graph for you and reveals what the current trend is, based on objective criteria. Using the trend determiner, you can quickly tell if you are trading with the trend or against it. It also identifies those times when the market is not trending. Theoretically, you could buy with the pattern when the bias is obvious and fade the trend when the market is range-bound. For your reference, a comment appears in the top left corner of the chart detailing the current trend. This indicator has three trend types bullish, bearish, and sideways.  It also qualifies trends as being confirmed or suspect. With a ConfirmedBullish trend, you can expect the price to go higher. When the direction is SuspectBullish price may go higher or lower this indicates the market is considered to be range-bound. Sideways trends are always range-bound, and they can also be confirmed or suspect. With a ConfirmedBearish trend you can expect the price to go lower and if the pattern is SuspectBearish price may go lower or higher, but the market is range-bound. In general, the market is only trending 15 to 30 percent of the time. This indicator also, allows you to set alerts, you can set alarms to activate when the trend type you wish initiates; you could also be alerted to any trend change. The indicator also has a verbose mode, which prints out details in the journal tab, such as the price and volume of the fractal bar, along with the test bar. How does it work? Trend Determiner uses fractals as goal post to determine the trend. The fractal indicator is included in every version of meta trader. When a fractal appears the indicator remembers the value of that fractal. If price surpasses the value of a fractal it runs a test. If a bar tests a fractal point and closes on the other side of the fractal, then the test is considered passed. The indicator then checks the volume of the bar that surpassed the fractal value, if the volume on the bar that passed the fractal value is greater than the value of the volume on the fractal the trend is considered confirmed.  Logically, it is confirmed because the traders showed more interest at the point where it passed the fractal value than at the point where the fractal was created. To determine the trend the indicator looks at the value of the prior trend and adjusts it according to the results of the test see tables below. For example, if the current trend is SuspectSideways and a bullish fractal prints at 1.0678 with a volume of 7333 and a few bars later a bar opens below at 1.0669 and closes at 1.0695 with a volume of 9501, this bar would initiate a trend test. Since the bar closed higher than the up fractal, the trend would turn bullish and since its volume was greater than the volume of the fractal bar the trend would be confirmed. The result would be a trend transition from SuspectSideways to ConfirmedBullish. Modifying the above example, if the volume on the bullish bar were less than the volume on the fractal bar say 6500, then the trend would still transition to bullish. However, it would be suspect since the volume on the bullish bar did not exceed the volume on the fractal that the test ran on.  This behavior shows that there is some possible affinity with lower prices since the volume was higher at a lower price, so proceed with caution when opening up a buy in this position. Thanks for reading and good luck out there."

12,How Payday Loans can Help in a Tight Financial Situation,finance," When money is tight, you can’t always wait for your next paycheck. An unforeseen car or appliance repair causes serious problems when you don’t have money in the bank, and your next paycheck isn’t coming in for two weeks. Payday loans give you quick access to cash when you can’t wait for your next paycheck. Applying for a payday loan takes only minutes and can be in person, online or over the phone. To qualify for a payday loan, you must provide identification, have an active checking account, and be able to show proof of income. Unlike other loans, your credit score is not taken into consideration for approval. Once completed, your application will be verified and approved that day. Having approval allows you to borrow between $50 and $1000 which you can take as cash or have deposited directly into your bank account. All loans must be repaid, and payday loans are no exception. Typically, when you borrow money through a payday loan, you must provide the lender access to your bank account or give them a check for the amount owed. Regardless of the amount you borrow, you are given 14 days to repay a payday loan. Unlike other types of loans, payday loans can’t be repaid in installments. Instead, the full amount of a payday loan, plus any interest, must be repaid in one lump sum. If you haven’t repaid the loan at the end of the 14 days, the lender either cashes the check you provided with your application or withdraws the money from your bank account. If you know that you can’t repay the full amount of a payday loan within 14 days, you still have options. For an added cost, many lenders will allow you to renew the loan for another 14 days. In some states, payday loan renewal isn't allowed. If that’s the case, the loan can effectively be renewed by taking out a second loan to repay the original. Though loan renewal is available, it’s recommended that you only take out a payday loan if you’re confident that you can repay it within 14 days. When you’re in a pinch, payday loans are the source of the cash you need. With payday loans, you can afford to make your next rent payment or pay for car repairs. For life’s unexpected events, you can get the money you need when you need it with payday loans."

14,The Role of Checks in Today's Financial World,finance," With the incredible advancements in technology, the way we spend and receive money has changed drastically. Credit cards have made it unnecessary to carry cash or checks. Direct deposits into your bank account from your employer have made getting paid easier than ever. In this day and age, our money is handled almost entirely electronically. However, there are still many businesses that prefer to pay their employees with checks. You may also receive a check when selling high-value items such as cars. Unlike cash or a card, checks can’t be used until they’ve been cashed or deposited at a bank. Depositing checks isn’t always convenient. Typical business hours for banks are weekdays, likely the same time that you’re at work. If a bank is open on the weekend, it’s probably only on Saturday and for just a few hours. With banks’ limited hours and your busy schedule, it can be difficult to deposit your checks. Other services are available that can quickly get you cash for your checks. Check cashing services give you fast cash for all types of checks and the process is simple. When you bring in a check, written out to you, you just endorse it, verify your identification and get paid. Being a business, check cashers have to make money as well. When cashing a check, you’ll be charged a small processing fee plus a small percentage of your check. The exact amount deducted from your check depends on what type it is but all fees are minimal allowing you to get the most money from your check. Longer business hours and multiple locations frequently make check cashers more convenient than banks. For people who don’t have an open bank account, check cashing becomes the only way to get money from your checks. Another benefit of using a check cashing service is the fact that you don’t have to wait for checks to clear. When depositing checks at a bank, you may have to wait between two and ten days before the funds become available. So long as your check is valid, check cashers will pay you in as little as thirty minutes. You shouldn’t have to wait to use your hard earned money. When you need money quickly and getting to your bank isn’t possible, check cashers are the solution. The convenience and simplicity of check cashing services make them ideal for receiving money for your checks."
15,Long Term Investing,finance," Long Term Investing:    Introduction to Crispr Technology       November 2017 Pronounced ""Crisp-per"", CRISPRE Cas-9 refers to a revolutionary Gene Editing technique that allows for the removal or altering of a Human DNA sequence. It is versatile, precise and relatively inexpensive. It also has enormous potential in all other aspects of applied genetics. This would include pharmacological and agricultural applications. Accordingly, it has the medical, scientific and investment community very excited. The key question for Investors is: What are the time frames in terms of commercial application? And: What are the best strategies and companies to follow? It seems that no major discovery or invention in the last 150 years has occurred without a significant lawsuit about origin and ownership. The CISPRE story is no exception. While the initial discovery has been attributed to Jennifer Doudna of the U.S. and Emmanuelle Charpentier of France an initial patent dispute with the Broad Institute and Feng Zhang has favored the Broad Institute as it applies to specific applications in humans. Since the science is extremely complex and the applications far reaching in medicine, pharmacology and agricultural engineering the legal issues will likely linger for years. Trying to predict outcomes is difficult but it appears that with respect to human applications, Feng Zhang is in a better position. What is probable, are a series of complex Shared Settlement Agreements that will allow business and research to proceed. Under such arrangements, large biomed/ pharma companies will pay royalties or licensing fees to both parties in an often still unsettled legal dispute. Although there are now many publically traded companies involved in this field it is best, as an introduction, to focus on the three most prominent companies. Following these three companies gives the best guidance as to direction on both commercial and legal issues. Editas Medicine Inc. (NASDAQ-EDIT) is the Boston based company associated with Feng Zhang and the Broad Institute. One of their principle efforts have been on curing certain inherited retinal degenerative disorders. They have a research and development agreements with Allergan Pharmaceuticals and Juno Therapeutics. Bill Gates is an investor, hoping that gene altering techniques will destroy malaria carrying mosquitoes. Intellia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ-NTLA) is another Massachusetts based company. This one carries the prestige of Jennifer Doudna and the intellectual property of UC Berkeley. With significant development agreements with Regeneron and Novartis it is more drug development oriented. Their main efforts presently target hepatitis B and liver disease. Crispr Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ-CRSP) is the Swiss based company associated with Emmanuelle Charpentier. They have long term development agreements with Bayer AG and Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Their main focus is on muscular dystrophy, sickle cell diseases and blood disorders including hemophilia. All of these companies are well funded and their deals with major companies are significant. They are also all, at best, a few years away from making money. Their share prices are volatile being subject to the whims of changing future expectations, possible dilution due to cash needs and legal issues. Anyone of them could, however, carry a $ 50 Billion Market Cap in five years. With present Market Cap values of between $ 750 million and $ 1 Billion there are potential windfall profits to be made. They are all worth the risk for long term investors. Lance Reed, Research Analyst, Kingston Trading"
16,The Benefits of Payday Loans in Emergency Situations,finance," Imagine that you’ve just been in a car accident, your washing machine died, or your kid put a baseball through the neighbor’s window. Events like these typically aren’t ones that we prepare for, especially financially. Unfortunately, during these unexpected situations, we too often find ourselves in need of money to cover costs. Because so many of us are living paycheck to paycheck and aren’t prepared for unanticipated expenses, we may not have money readily available. Payday loans are a quick and easy way to borrow money when confronted with unexpected costs. Qualifying for these small and short-term loans is straightforward. As a borrower, all you need is an active bank account, a regular source of income and identification. It doesn’t matter if you have a low credit score as lenders won’t check it when determining your eligibility for a payday loan. When taking out a payday loan, as the borrower you write a check to the lender for the full amount of the loan plus the charge for the loan. If by the end of the term, typically two weeks, you haven’t repaid the loan, the lender deposits the check. You can prevent this by either repaying the loan amount in full or rolling it over for another two weeks at an additional charge. With loan amounts between $50 and $1,000, payday loans are great when a small amount of money is needed right now. Say your washing machine dies, you just spent your last paycheck remodeling your bathroom, and you won’t have money for a new washing machine until you get your next paycheck. Payday loans are designed to cover unforeseen costs that can’t be covered between paydays, hence their name. Once you’ve applied for a payday loan, you can be approved within as little as 30 minutes. This means that you can immediately afford to buy a new washing machine. Then once your next paycheck comes in, you repay the loan and avoid paying outrageous amounts of interest. The best part is, you don’t have to wear dirty clothes for two weeks because you’re able to afford a new washing machine right now. When used correctly, payday loans are great for getting through some of life’s sudden financial challenges. With payday loans, up to $1,000 can be borrowed in as little as half an hour. Having few requirements, it’s a simple process to qualify for payday loans."
17,Should You Take a Personal Loan for Your Business?,finance," Are you wondering as to why you should take a personal loan for your business when almost all leading banks and financial institutions in Singapore offer business loans? The truth of the matter is that getting a business loan can get complicated. Your business will have to meet all the eligibility criteria to be eligible for the loan. Also, it may not always be the most feasible to apply for a business loan. Find below the best circumstances under which a personal loan is ideal for your business: Starting off of your business One of the most important eligibility criteria to take a business loan is that your business should be operational (it is performing). Banks are less likely to approve a business loan on the basis of an idea (your application is not looking so good if your business is still in the ideation stage). No matter how promising your business idea and innovation is, there is no proof of performance. If you are just starting off your business, taking a personal loan instead of a business loan is your best bet. You do not have a collateral/security/guarantor to offer More often than not, banks require you to offer a collateral or security against your business loan application. And if you do not have one or if you are in the service sector, you may be required to provide a guarantor. If you cannot satisfy this requirement, your business loan application stands a great chance of being rejected. On the other hand personal loans are largely unsecured and do not have the requirement to provide any form of collateral or security. You do not want a large loan amount Business loans are extensively meant for large loan quantum. And since the amount is large, the loan process will also take a longer time to be completed. Personal loans can be used for really substantial amount if that is what you need. You will need to submit lesser number of documents and get rid of your loan much faster and concentrate on running your business. You do not have a set utilisation plan for the borrowed amount for your business Any bank will require you to provide a detailed plan for how you intend to use the loan amount for furthering your business. If you intend to use the money for various different facets of your business or as and when you require it or if your plan does not meet their expectations, your business loan application can get rejected. However, if you are applying for a personal loan, the bank does not require you to explain the purpose. You have the freedom to use the loan for any purpose (legal of course). Although there is no dearth of business loans in Singapore, you will need to determine if a business loan is ideal for your business requirement. For the above mentioned situations, a personal loan will work better for your business when compared to business loan."
18,What is Cryptocurrency and Do I Have to Claim it on My Taxes?,finance," It’s important to know before reading this article what cryptocurrencies are. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that exist only online and is a complex system that’s decentralized and isn’t controlled by any authority. Computer processors are used to solve complex algorithms which generate coins. All coin transactions are chained to each other, adding a block for each transaction making it impossible to erase or alter any information without breaking the entire chain. Crypto markets are the most secure for services and trade without the risk of fraud or chargebacks. One of the biggest market explosions for cryptocurrencies in 2017 is Bitcoin. In 2017 alone, prices for one bitcoin has skyrocketed from $800 to a whopping $7,300! Rewind to 2013, the price for one was less than $10! There’s a huge profit margin with Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Ethereum are slowing making a name for themselves as well. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies still are taxable, and the IRS still wants its share of the exponentially rising market. In 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21, which gave them the power to impose taxes on virtual currencies. Last year in 2016, the IRS gave Coinbase – one of the largest coin exchanges globally – a ""John Doe"" summons to report everyone that’s used their exchange dating back to 2013, and recognized less than 900 of all investors have reported capital gains or losses. That’s something for all of us invested in digital currency to worry about, as this year the IRS hired Chainalysis – a company capable of identifying owners of digital wallets – and they’re ready to crack down on those profiting off the digital market. How to Report Your Digital Coin Wallet So how are you to report your taxes on digital currency? It’s important to know your coin exchange service won’t help much with tax reporting. Blockchains which chronologically record all cryptocurrency transactions aren’t so great at generating online tax reports. In addition, digital currencies don’t fall under ""covered security"" in the tax code, so you can’t use a Form 1099-B like you would with traditional stock trades. Presently, there are trade accounting solutions that are entirely about cryptocurrency. Bitcoin.Tax and CoinTracking.Info are making it easy for coin users to report their gains and losses to the IRS. Most digital coin markets, such as Coinbase, make it possible to export all transactions into a readable solution such as a spreadsheet or PDF which you and your tax accountant can use to fill out Form 8949. Submit this form, along with all other tax documents, when tax season rolls around at the beginning of next year. Here’s a few more things to keep in mind when reporting cryptocurrencies to the IRS for the upcoming tax season. The dollar value of your digital coins at the time of you filling out your tax forms is what the IRS will accept as fair market value. If you’re a ‘miner’ of Bitcoin or other digital currencies and sell them on a coin market, it’s constituted as a trade or business and the IRS will subject you to self-employment tax. If this year is the first year that you are reporting your digital currency transactions, you may want to amend past year’s tax returns to keep up with the IRS and avoid civil penalties in the future."

20,Forex Arbitrage Strategies,finance," The modern Internet is full of tempting offers about easy earnings in the Forex market - it is enough just to guess correctly the direction of the market movement and comfortable existence is provided. However, statistics is also well known, which suggests that more than 80% of Forex traders lose their money. This is due to the fact that, contrary to advertising promises, financial markets are almost impossible to predict. But not everything is so sad, there are trading strategies that are not based on predicting the direction of future market movements, but on other principles. An example of such strategies are forex arbitrage strategies based on the extraction of profit from the price difference for the same financial instruments presented on different exchanges. As a result, these strategies allow you to earn in any market movement and do not require the trader ungrateful work on guessing the direction of the movements of financial instruments. Let's discuss in more detail what the essence of arbitration is. The main idea of these strategies is to take two (or more) identical or linked assets traded on different sites, and when the price on one exchange becomes more than another, then make an arbitration deal: to sell the asset where it is more expensive, And buy where it is cheaper. When the prices on the stock exchanges are equal, then it is necessary to perform a reverse operation and close the positions. As a result, each arbitrage transaction will yield a guaranteed profit, independent of the market movement. The strategy described is known as the classical two-legged arbitration. But in some cases, particularly forex, it is more advantageous to use one-legged arbitrage, in which transactions are carried out only on the side of one broker, which is ""led"" in relation to the second broker. In those cases when the quotes of one of the brokers are late relative to the second, the profit from the arbitrage deals will accumulate on the side of the lagging one, so there is no point in opening the opposite transactions on the second broker. Consider what options exist for implementing arbitrage strategies on Forex. First, the most famous option is arbitrage of exchange rates. In this case, usually only one-legged arbitration is used, because the situation when the quotes of one broker is late relative to another is not uncommon in forex trading. Secondly, a wide range of options is provided by the option of arbitration between CFD-contracts traded in Forex and stock exchange instruments. In particular, you can use quotes from the stock exchange as a leading source and trade only CFD-contracts. Thirdly, it is possible to arrange arbitration between futures, for example, from the CME futures market, and CFD-contracts for the underlying assets underlying these futures traded in Forex. In conclusion, we note that modern trading is characterized by the highest degree of competition among bidders. The trader who has not only the best trading strategy, but the best software wins. Arbitrage trade is a high-tech way of earning, which requires a special program - a trading robot capable of performing simultaneous operations on various trading floors. As an example of such a robot can lead Megatrader, which works with forex as well as with the stock market and can implement almost any arbitrage strategy."

3,Tax Tips for Teachers 2018,finance," To our teachers and school administrators, we appreciate everything you do to curate an awesome and enticing curriculum for the next generation. Now it’s our turn to educate you on one matter…taxes. One thing is clear, it’s never too early to start planning for the upcoming tax season! Check out the following tips to help you as an educator stay on top of your taxes and get the biggest breaks and tax deductions ever! Tax Benefits as an Educator Did you know, as an educator you can catch a break and significantly reduce what you pay in taxes? Yes, the IRS has 3 exclusive work-related tax benefits for teachers that helps reduce the amount of taxes you forego. This includes out of pocket expenses (books, supplies, travel, etc.), further education or vocation, and special tax credits. Below is a breakdown of these tax benefits. Get a Tax Break for Classroom Supplies In many school districts throughout the United States, teachers themselves must supply their classroom with certain amenities – books, writing supplies, and more. We understand how tight a budget that can be, especially when you need to replenish missing pencils and notebook paper on an everyday basis. That’s where a tax break comes in. There’s two that you can choose from – the educator expense deduction and itemizing deductions (using Schedule A). The educator expense deduction is good up to $250 ($500 if you’re filing jointly and your spouse is also an educator) for unreimbursed education expenses. Eligibility is easy for most educators. To be eligible, you must be a certified teacher or administrator working in a state approved elementary or secondary education, with at least 900 hours clocked per school year.  To claim this deduction, you’d need to fill in Line 23 on Tax Form 1040 (if you’re amending your taxes Line 16 on Tax Form 1040A). The deduction covers the costs of books, supplies, equipment and supplemental materials purchased throughout the school year. Do you feel like you’ve spent more than $250 on your classroom in the past school year? That’s where planning ahead comes into play. It’s only the beginning of the school year, so keeping track of your classroom expenses should be relatively easy. We and the IRS encourage you to record all your classroom expenses and total it up as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A when filing your Tax Form 1040 or Tax Form 1040NR. You can include in this deduction other work-related expenses, such as union dues, educational subscriptions, licenses and more.  This deduction does have a 2% limit as outlined by Publication 529. You must subtract 2% of your adjusted gross income from your qualifying miscellaneous deduction amount. Learn what Tax Credits to take Advantage of As an educator, you get exclusive access to various educational tax benefits. The most notable is the Lifetime Learning Credit and in some instances, the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) is for both students and teachers alike. This credit covers tuition and related educational expenses. To qualify you must be a student or teacher at an approved educational institution and have purposed educational expenses. The maximum return for this credit is $2000. Unlike other credits, the LLC can be claimed every year you’re teaching. Typically, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is for qualified educational expenses by a student enrolled in a higher education. So, if you’re a teacher pursuing a higher degree while teaching you too can take advantage of this credit. The AOTC is 100% good up to the first $2000 you have in educational expenses and 25% of the remaining balance from thereafter. If this credit marks down the amount of tax you owe to zero, you’ll get a refund up to 40% (maximum $1000) of the remaining amount of credit. Staying Organized Helps a Lot Do you hate tax season, knowing your lack of organ0000000000ization beforehand really takes its toll? Stay on top of your taxes and expenses now!

4,10 guidelines for preparing Terms and Conditions for Your Invoices,finance," 10 guidelines for preparing Terms and Conditions for Your Invoices Powerful conditions and terms for your invoices are exceptionally significant for your business. If your invoices are challenging to understand or confusing to read, you may do some serious damages to your cash flow. How Come? Because if the client can’t comprehend your invoice they’re not going just pay. Your client would like to be sure that they’re being charged the accurate amount for the goods or services that they requested. The first thing that you should do before writing down your terms and conditions is to list the various potential legal obstacles or scenarios that could happen. For example: What strategies will you take if the client does not pay the invoice? What will happen if you are past due on delivering your product or service to the client? What will you do if the customer is dissatisfied with your goods and services? What will take place if the product is damaged when being provided by your client’s delivery service? Are there any incentives if your clients pay in advance? What type of rate of interest would you charge for late payments? What if the client is interested to renegotiate the contract after both parties agree to the terms and conditions? Can your client ask for a refund? In this case, what conditions would allow for this? What takes place if the scope of the project expands? If there is a misestimate on a budget or quote, who will pay for it? Who is to blame if a product breaks after being purchased? What course of action will you take it the contract or contract is terminated? It may take a little time to think of and establish this list, but once you have got all of this on paper you will be confident enough to formulate future conditions and terms quickly with the other customers that you will add to your client list. Understand that, providing the most appropriate terms and conditions for your firm will assure that you get paid and protect your business if legal action is ever taken. Generating the all-important elements of an invoice isn't going to only boost the payment process, it will also answer any sort of questions that the client has concerning the goods or services that you provided for them. When generating invoices, ensure that that you feature: Invoice number Your logo Your contact information Your client’s contact information The due date The products or services you provided and their costs The forms of payment that you accept Early payment invoice discounts or enforce late fees Prior to sending out the invoice,  check that all information is correct and that it’s being sent to the right person. Any mistakes can slow-up the payment process and make you seem less professional. This is arguably the most crucial part of the terms and conditions on your invoice. Why? Because it explains what actually the client is paying you for. Like for example, if you were hired to create a site for a client and it’s more than the client has predicted, having a explanation on the time period and expenses it cost you to finalize job answers any sort of questions or problems relating to the final amount of the invoice. This should be {is kind of} obvious, but when you give clients a lot of time to make a transaction, the longer it takes for you to get compensated, which in turns induces a slower cash flow. So if you have a client forty five days to pay an invoice, as for instance, and that customer paid you two weeks late, that means you’ve waited two whole months to receive a payment. A payment term of 30 days or even less is the usual when it comes to invoicing simply because it’s helpful in keeping the cash flowing. Nonetheless, review your industry’s invoice standards and consult the client when their pay cycle runs. These factors will help you establish your payment terms. It’s not unusual for any company that sells products and services too often offer guarantees and warranties. It makes them appear more legit and trustworthy and gives the client reassurance. If you do offer a guarantee or warranty, be sure that is noticeably mentioned in your terms and conditions. Never forget to address topics such as circumstances where the client/customer seems to lose their guarantee or warranty. Truth be told there will be times when customers don’t pay invoices on time. Instead of being passive, you will need to be persistent by tracking down those late payments. Always keep a record of your clients' payment due dates and interact with them by telephone, email, or mail if they have not paid you by the due date and include late-fee terms on your invoices, like charging interest on late payments – which a good cloud-based invoice manager will do for you automatically. If it turns out you can not get a hold of the late-paying client, or they're not responsive to follow-ups, you may perhaps have to send a collection letter, hire a collection agency, or take them to court. Make all of this information crystal-clear from the beginning. Be sure that your terms are specially written for your business. Remember, your business does not have the identical needs, resources, and clients that another businesses have. This means that you can not just copy and paste the terms and conditions from a commonly used template or another business because they might not address your specific needs. A template is always good for starting and guiding you in the right directions, but in the end you have to write terms and conditions that best match your business and clientele. Being respectful will surely have a positive affect on your business. Simply just incorporating a sentence like kindly pay your invoice within 21 days"" or ""thank you for your business"" could actually increase the amount of invoices getting paid by more than five percent! This may not seem like much, but this could equal thousands of us dollars per year into your banking account. Other than helping you get paid faster, being well mannered might make improvements to your brand’s image. Remember to keep the language in your conditions and terms straight forward and intuitive. Put yourself in the shoes of your clients’ customers and perceive that they’re not all familiar with industry jargon and even bookkeeping terms, like for example ""net 30."" Additionally, don’t attempt to hide every single thing on one page by using a small font so that your clients are not able to read the fine print. It will feel sly to your client and will ruin your reputation (despite the fact that there is nothing sly on your invoice). When everything else fails, or you wind up in a sophisticated or specialized situation, don’t hesitate to seek assistance from your mentor, fellow business owners, or your attorney. These are individuals which have experience in writing terms and conditions and are more acquainted with laws then you are."

15,Tax Extensions in 2017,finance," It’s important to file your taxes on time, but sometimes there isn’t enough time to get your financial records in order. In this case, the IRS allows for a six-month extension period to file your taxes, given that you complete and submit Form 4868 (for individuals) or Form 7004 (for businesses) before the April 15 deadline of each year. There’s no penalty for acquiring a tax extension! However, proving to be lackadaisical will do more harm than good. Here’s what you need to know about tax extensions, and why it’s important if you haven’t already to file your taxes before October hits. Filing a Tax Extension is a Good Thing An obvious benefit to requesting a tax extension is you now have an extra six months to prepare your tax documents and get them ready to report them to the IRS. It’s best to request an extension on your filing period than to file late without one. While this remains true, it’s pertinent that you understand the benefits of a tax extension. By requesting a tax extension and filing your taxes prior to October 16, 2017 you will avoid the late filing penalty. The IRS late filing penalty is equal to 5% per month for any outstanding tax payments. Paying on time will help you avoid a deferral on your taxes once the deadline hits. A tax extension allows you to improve the accuracy of your tax return, and get all the deduction and tax credits you’re eligible for. You’ll be able to go in-depth and make important decisions on your tax return, such as utilizing carrybacks and carryforwards for business losses, or reporting depreciate equipment versus taking a Section 179 deduction. Furthermore, with this extra time you can go in-depth with your accountant and make sure everything is complete and you aren’t missing anything before submitting to the IRS. There are even more benefits for filing a tax extension. With one, you have extra time to fund a retirement plan, whether it’s a 401(k), SEP-IRA, or SIMPLE-IRA for self-employed persons only. You’re even given the chance to recharacterize your IRA from a traditional one to a Roth IRA contribution, or vice versa, depending on your eligibility for one IRA or the other. What Not to Forget About Your Tax Extension Filing for a tax extension isn’t the same as filing for extra time to pay outstanding taxes. The IRS still expects you to pay your income tax in full by April 15 each year. While a tax extension can limit the amount of penalties that come up, there remains a monthly half percent late payment penalty on any outstanding balance. In addition, tax extensions don’t allot further funding of an IRA. Any contributions must be in by the initial tax deadline annually. An extra item to consider for married couples is the status of your tax returns. If you wish to switch from a joint tax return to separate ones, you must amend your tax returns by April 15. As an added bonus, a tax extension doesn’t give you extra time for mark-to-market elections for professional traders. These may be important to you, and if you were thinking of doing one these during your tax extension, you’re out of luck. Fortunately, you’ll be ready to prepare these items in time for the upcoming tax season at the beginning of next year."
16,Remortgaging- is it the best option?,finance," Before we ask ourselves if we should remortgage, we should be familiar as to what remortgaging is. Remortgaging is the process when a homeowner, such as yourself, gets a mortgage, and the mortgage is on the property which the owner already owns. There are many reasons as to why homeowners remortgage and one of the reasons is to replace the mortgage which had already existed on the property. So why would people want to replace the existing mortgage on the property? One of the reasons is because the homeowners may want a better rate. If so, the first mortgage deal which you were already in, may force you to pay an early repayment charge, which can either be huge or little, but in some cases can be very huge. From sources, it is said to be between 2-5% of the outstanding loan. In addition to this, there is also an admin fee of sorts, and this is customary to any mortgage when you are changing, and this is usually experienced when the homeowner repays the mortgage. However, this can still prove to be beneficial due to the savings having the chance to be high, and this in itself can show to benefit homeowners with significant amounts of mortgage debt. Before taking such decisions, gain advice from mortgage brokers if this is the best choice for you, and for such a situation Expert Mortgage Brokers will be happy to help. It is because if you take the wrong turn when remortgaging, it can also act negatively towards you, and have the possibilities of ruining your credit score. Another favourite reason is that the homeowner may want to borrow more money. It can be due to the lender disagreeing on lending you more money, and you may need the extra finance urgently. When you choose to remortgage, you will apparently meet your new lender, and depending on who the lender is, you have the chance to have low rates, and this can allow you to raise the money at a discount or cheaply. However, with individual lenders, the additional fees may add up to be more expensive than your previous lender, and so you should compare with the other types of borrowing and see which one is the most efficient method is for you. Most lenders taking on new clients will ask you what the money you borrow from them is for, and most of the time for business purposes. It may act negatively towards the lender and can discourage them into lending to you, as opposed to borrowing money to pay for a car, and this can affect the lender, allowing them to lend to you with ease. It is all to do with the risks associated with lending to business. For homeowners such as yourself, you may remortgage to raise money for home improvements, and this is a more plausible reason for lenders, and if you do go on with the mortgage, be sure to keep all forms of evidence if you do in fact borrow a large sum of money. Why you shouldn’t remortgage One of the most basic reasons as to why you shouldn’t remortgage is because of their financial position at the moment of time. Or it may not be the financial situation, but it can range from the change in jobs, or your place in the company, and even if you have children. This has a particular effect on the lender as they now assume that you either earn lesser, or you may spend more on children related factors, and these circumstances can often discourage the lender into actually not lending you any money. Another reason could be that the current rate you are on, may be better than the rate in which you hope to get with the remortgage. But this can also be beneficial, as the current rate you are on may prove to work against you, due to the possible change in financial position, and this ‘great’ rate will not be high anymore. So what Expert Mortgage Brokers would recommend, is not to be too comfortable on the current price, as it can flip on you instantly, and you must be ready to remortgage if that is the step you must take. So now we went through the pros and cons of remortgaging, we will now be going through various steps to find the best mortgage for you! The first step is rather self-explanatory, and you should try and find all mortgages that suit your current position financially, with all the mortgages you found, filter them for the cheapest ones. If you’re unsure how to check these mortgage deals, there are various websites which compare them, but I would advise you use particular site with good deals. You can use deals available to mortgage brokers, but we also recommend you look at right only deals as well. When going through your mortgage, be sure you note down all the fees mandatory to you. And factor them into the total cost, and this will help you to stay above and be aware of all the payments, and it will overall keep you more organised as you know how much you need to pay. Another reason is affordability checks. This may seem weird for such a topic, but the fact is, affordability checks are also used for remortgaging, so be sure to look at your expenses and find ways to reduce them. One typical example is sky boxes. If you do have an sky box and you’re not using it, be sure to cancel your subscription as that is one step closer to passing the affordability checks, and if you cancel wasted expenses that you’re not using, you can both save money and get the mortgage. These are just a few actions, but there are much more ways to get better deals, and by contacting us. Expert Mortgage Brokers, we are happy to help you for you to get the best mortgage deals, as well as discussing further pros and cons and concluding if remortgaging is the best option for you."
17,Find Low Risk Investment Online,finance," So you do want to invest but you don’t know where to start. Investing in stocks is a highly risky affair, specifically, if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Bonds A bond is a documented type of share in a company. The investor buys this share in exchange of an agreement that the company will share the investor back the face value of that share plus a stipulated amount, generally deemed as interest. Bonds are amongst the low stake investments and are highly suggested as part of the portfolio for first time investors. CDs Another type of low stake investment is the certificate of deposit (CD). Each has its own term as a percentage rate and various months or years where the invested principle is locked and the interest is earned and compounded on a regular basis. Therefore, the money is available to the investor until the maturity date of the startup investment offerings. Withdrawal or closing the account early is a subject to a considerable penalty as mentioned in the agreement. It is generally offered by credit unions, banks or other major financial institutions. Gold With the passage of time, gold has steadily grown in price. It has been known to stay stable in value, even during rough financial times. This commodity can be bought as jewelry in the necklaces or rings of the jeweler. Similarly, you can make an investment in gold by purchasing the shares of a company that manufactures or deals with gold related products. Capital ensured Funds Just like CD, capital ensured funds assure protection to avoid the investor from losing their capital. Nonetheless, the rate of return is low, completely safe, and fixed over a precise period of time. It is also restricted if this investment type should admire. By doing this, financial institutions can afford to render these investments. Low risk investments are perfect for novices and passive investors. Though their rate of return is low with respect to stocks, they are quite safer investments. The more principle invested and the longer the tenure of the investment, the higher the interest rate and maturity value is assured. Even for the active investors, low-risk small business investment work as an incredible source of backup funds."
18,Bad Credit Auto Loans and a No-Frills Car Purchase,finance," There is nothing more frustrating than falling in love with a car at a dealership only to be told that you don’t qualify for financing because your credit score is not good enough. However, for many people across the country, public transit isn’t an option, and a personal automobile is their only means of transportation between home and work. Several professionals require personal transportation as a part of their job duties. For them, a car can be the difference between making money and having no money at all. In such cases, a bad credit auto loan becomes absolutely necessary. Like everything else, ""bad"" is a matter of opinion and degree. Bad credit history doesn’t mean you cannot buy a car or you cannot get an auto loan. It is possible to get financing for a car. But bad credit history will affect the way a bank or lender sees you. If a person has bad credit score, they need to walk into the financing process knowing that they are going to pay a higher rate than others. There are auto loans for people with bad credit. But, you need to be careful when shopping for one to make sure the lender doesn’t overcharge you. Let’s break down the art of getting bad credit auto loans. Bad Credit Auto Loans: Make Adjustments to get approved A bad credit auto loan, sometimes called a second chance car loan is simply a regular auto loan with some adjustments based on your credit score. Usually, the major adjustment between a traditional auto loan and a bad credit auto loan is the interest rate. As your credit score decreases, lenders tend to charge a higher interest rate for auto loans. Lenders use credit scores as predictors of the likelihood of a person making their payments on time. Since lenders take greater risk of lending money to people with lower credit scores, it makes sense that they charge more money to cover the risk of nonpayment. A history of late payments, high debt, bankruptcy, or repossession is a sign to the lender that you’re at risk of evading your loan payments. With bad credit history, it's important to understand that your options are limited; there are no attractive solutions, but there might be acceptable solutions. Buying a Car with Bad Credit: Lower your Expectations If you have bad credit history, it’s important to be prepared. Preparation and knowledge can save you money. Following are the strategies to help you find the best bad credit auto loan: A No-Frills Car Because you can expect to pay a much higher APR with a bad credit auto loan, you don’t want to purchase an automobile that is either larger or includes more amenities than is absolutely necessary for your day-to-day travel. Determining the exact nature of the car before you head to the dealership will ensure that you aren’t pressured into a purchase that will only worsen your financial situation. A budget should be at the forefront of your planning when making any large purchase, especially one involving long-term financing and monthly payments. It’s a good idea to get an insurance price quote as a part of your vehicle budget. Remember that anything more than what you were planning to pay could end up costing a lot in the long term. A No-Frills Purchase It can seem like an intimidating proposition to some, but if you do research, you should know both what a car is worth and what you’re going to pay. If the vehicle is out of your price range, do what you can do to make it affordable. If it’s already in your range, try to get it for a lower price. Because of your bad credit score, you most likely won’t be able to negotiate the terms of your auto loan, but you can always try to negotiate the purchase price. Also, do not spend additional money on accessories that you do not need. The salesman may try to lure with extended warranties and dealer add-ons. Any money that you can save now will help you in the long run. Make a Smart Car Buying Decision You know your financial situation and your needs better than anyone. Conduct thorough research of different car options and auto loan programs. If you are unsure, ask questions. And if you don’t feel comfortable for any reason, don’t sign the contract. If you are okay with everything, make sure that you have a copy before leaving the dealership. It is far easier to get a decent auto loan with bad credit than mortgages. It is because the cost of a car is smaller than the cost of a home. But, you have to remain cautious and avoid making an expensive purchase. Do not give into the temptation of buying an expensive car model. Remember that research, prudence and a no-frills car purchase will make your life simple."
19,What to Do After Filing a Tax Extension,finance," Not everyone is ready for tax season, some years can be rougher than others. That’s why tax extensions exist, and they are a great move by you if done right. It’s easy to extend your filing period, simply send in a completed Form 4868 – Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File. This year if you filed an extension prior to April 18, 2017, you now have until October 16, 2017.  The deadline may still seem far off, but time flies by fast and sooner than later that deadline will come up. If you haven’t gotten started on your tax returns yet, here’s a few tips to push you to file your tax returns. Get Help with Filing Your Taxes Filing your taxes can be stressful, especially when you don’t have everything ready. This includes not having all the documents required to complete a tax return. If so, use your extension time wisely to contact your employers throughout last year and other entities that owe you information. Keep in mind that failure-to-file penalty is more than failure-to-pay penalty. Filing on time will help reduce the amount of interest and penalties that will stack, and will help you find payment options in time before the deadline hits. If you haven’t already, seek out a tax professional to help you with your return. Note – If you don’t owe taxes, usually there are no penalties for filing late. That is because penalties derive from the amount you owe. The only hit you take is that you won’t get your coming refund until you file. What to Do with Your Tax Extension Finish Up As Soon as Possible Understand that a tax extension extends only the amount of time you have to file your taxes, it does not extend the time you have to pay. This makes it all the more important to get your tax return done as soon as possible. While you may be waiting for potential tax deductions to pop up, they’re reasons to not hold out on filing after getting a tax extension.

If you are able to afford paying off your taxes, here’s what you can do: Direct Bank Transfers – Set up a one-time online payment from your bank account directly to the IRS. Pay with a Debit or Credit Card – You can pay online with either your debit or credit card, noting that there is a ""convenience"" fee for the transaction. Mail-in or Money Order – If you file online, you can send in a check or money order with a Form 1040-V payment voucher in the mail. Make out your payment to the ""United States Treasury"" and include with it your Social Security Number, Phone Number, Tax Year and Tax Return Form Number on File. The correct addresses to connect with the IRS are here. If you cannot afford to pay off your taxes in one go, here’s some options available: Short Term Extension of Time to Pay – If you know you can pay off your owed amount within 120 days, you can argue with the IRS for a short-term extension of time to pay. Although you may be approved, the amount will still accrue interest and/or penalties until it’s fully paid off. Installments – An agreement can be made with the IRS to pay off your taxes through installments. The IRS recommends this solution as this plan is a low-cost, hassle free way to pay off your debt, and is automated so you don’t have to worry about missed payments. This option is only open to those who owe less than $50,000 for the year. Offer in Compromise – This option is a way to lower the amount of tax debt owed. As a last resort if you are not in a position to pay off your taxes as it would cause financial hardship, you can offer in compromise with the IRS. The IRS will only ever accept this option if they believe they can get the full amount out of you. Don’t push back your tax returns to tomorrow, get it done as soon as you can to avoid interest on your amount owed. If you find something later, you can always file a Form 1040x amended tax return."

Use of cold hard cash becomes increasingly less common as technology advances. Today we receive and spend money without ever actually seeing it; in fact, the majority of money exists electronically as 1s and 0s. With money being saved on computer hard drives, what does that mean for us? Paying employees, or being paid as an employee, is widely done through direct deposit. Automatically transferring money from a company’s bank account to that of an employee has several benefits for both parties. For more employers, direct deposit means checks don’t have to be printed which saves both time and money. Direct deposit also allows employers to pay their employees from anywhere. Employees also benefit from the many advantages of direct deposit. Foremost, direct deposit means earnings are available on pay day. Being paid electronically also means that employees don’t have to bother with checks. Checks are easy to lose or damage, not to mention that they have to be taken to a bank which isn’t always convenient. While direct deposit makes it convenient to be paid, debit and prepaid cards make it easy to spend money. With debit cards being linked to bank accounts, there’s no need to carry cash. If lost or stolen, cards can be deactivated to prevent unauthorized use. Unlike physical cash, debit cards are accepted worldwide making them easy and convenient to use. Prepaid debit cards function similarly to standard debit cards, with a few notable differences. Unlike traditional debit cards, prepaid cards have a fixed amount of money loaded onto them. The fixed amount of a prepaid card means that you can’t overdraw from a bank account. Money can be added or reloaded to prepaid cards through direct deposits, ATMs, and online transactions. One disadvantage of prepaid debit cards vs. traditional debit cards is the lack of protection. Standard debit cards are protected by federal laws against fraudulent use, but prepaid cards are not. However, with common sense and awareness, prepaid cards are still safe and convenient to use. Whether through direct deposits or debit and prepaid cards, the way we receive and spend money has changed. Though cash is still usable and accepted, it comes with many risks not found through electronic means. Cash also lacks the many conveniences of direct deposits and prepaid debit cards."
2,How Can Investors Get Funding for Major Real Estate Investment Properties?,finance," Real estate investment can be very rewarding but also very challenging. By forming a group of investors, you will be able to get over the hurdles of real estate a lot easier. A group of investors will help each other achieve success over major money players.

4,4 Mistakes You Should Avoid When Listing With An Agent In San Jose,finance," Selling your San Jose house through an agent? Make sure you read this blog post that reveals 4 mistakes you should avoid when listing when an agent in San Jose… If you’re looking to sell your San Jose house, or if you’re an agent who is selling houses in San Jose then here are 4 mistakes you should avoid when listing when an agent in San Jose… First, Don’t Assume That You Can Sell Right Away The market varies and can even shift from one day to the next, depending on a number of factors. So make sure you set realistic timelines about how long it will take to sell. If you are a seller, assume it will take months for the sales process to be completed – from fixing up the house to showing buyers to negotiating to setting a closing date to moving out. If you are an agent, be careful not to over-promise a timeline to your sellers – set their expectations. Second, Don’t Assume That The Asking Price Will Be The Selling Price Mistakes you should avoid when listing with an agent. The asking price is the starting point in the sales process – it establishes what a seller wants to sell for. If you are a seller, realize that the actual selling price might be different than the asking price. If you’re an agent, make sure you explain this to your sellers. Third, Don’t Assume All The Money Goes Right Into Your Pocket Some people make the mistake of assuming that the selling price (minus anything they owe on their mortgage) is pure profit. But this is not true. If you are a seller, make sure you know that there will be agent commissions, closing costs, and other fees you’ll have to pay. If you’re a real estate agent, make sure you explain to your customers. Fourth, Don’t Assume That The First Offer Will Go Through Buyers often make offers and then discover that they can’t get financing for some reason. If you are a seller, be prepared to have one or two buyers fall through before a buyer can be found. If you’re a real estate agent, prepare your sellers ahead of time by explaining this so they can be ready in case it happens. Summary Whether you’re a property owner looking to sell, or you’re a real estate agent who is representing sellers, these are 4 common mistakes that can happen during the sales process – so make sure you’re aware of them. Are you thinking about selling? Are you an agent who is representing sellers?

5,Why Retirement Planning Is Important,finance," People are living longer lives these days. They need a way to support themselves as they get older. One way is to continue working every day until the end. The other method is to plan for retirement while young so they can enjoy a leisurely retirement in their later years. Which one would work best for you? We spoke with Steven A. Suib over at Preservation Wealth Management for some advice on why you should take retirement planning seriously. Here are several reasons why you need to make retirement planning a priority: The uncertainty of government benefits. The population of the U.S. is aging rapidly as the Baby Boomer generation goes into retirement. That leaves fewer workers paying into the Social Security system with each year. This is already putting a strain on the SS system. What will Social Security be like when you reach retirement? Will it even still be around? The uncertainty of pension benefits. Private pension plans are not a certainty. Those who manage these plans often put funds into risky investments to keep the benefits at expected levels. If those risky investments collapse, the pension funds are gone. For example, when Enron collapsed over a decade ago, dozens of pension plans were lost in the aftermath. The increasing risk of health problems. As people age, they begin to experience more medical problems and increased health care costs. While Medicare covers many conditions, there are still costs that you must bear. One major illness can potentially wipe out any savings you have. What would you do if you had an accident or unforeseen illness that had long-lasting effects on your ability to work? The flexibility to deal with the curveballs of life. Life takes unexpected turns. The loss of a spouse due to death or divorce. An unforeseen accident. The need to support a dependent child. All of these unexpected events are easier to deal with if you have a retirement nest egg on which to draw. The ability to enjoy life after retirement. People do not want to stop living when they go into retirement. In fact, many retirees want to enjoy and live life in new ways. Travel, hobbies, and new life experiences are often among their retirement dreams. Without a solid retirement plan, however, those dreams won't happen. The ability to remain independent longer. As a person grows older, it can become more difficult to live independently. With a retirement plan in place, you can afford to bring in a housekeeper or aide to help with the day-to-day activities that you can no longer handle. This allows you to live in your own home as long as possible. Take Into Consideration Both Your Personal and Financial Plans What do you want to do once you retire? The answers you have to that question will help determine the financial planning you will need to do. If you want to sell your home and cruise around the world, you need to plan for it. If you want to downsize into a condo close to where your children and grandchildren live, you need a plan in place. If you want to spend your spare time volunteering in a third-world country, a plan is still a necessity. Once you know the kind of life you want to have after retirement, you can start your financial planning to make it happen. That is when you need to talk to a professional. A financial planner can help you set up your assets so you receive a safe, reasonable rate of return to get you through your golden years. Annuities, life insurance, and tax minimization are some of the strategies to consider. Talk to one of our experts today. For more advice like this, please contact Steven A.

6,4 Reasons You Need Public Liability Insurance,finance," When you’ve worked hard to establish your business and encourage its growth, it makes good sense to ensure that it is protected. However, some business owners overlook the importance of public liability insurance. Perth business owners unsure about whether they need it, need to check out these four important reasons. Protection Against Malpractice, Negligence, and Professional Misconduct Claims: Business services carry an expectation for professionalism, and if something does go wrong, you could find yourself being held liable. If you have provided ineffective or incorrect advice, there is the possibility of a claim being lodged against you for negligence or misconduct. Many public liability insurance packages can be tailored to include professional indemnity protection to cover your financial loss for any legal action or damages awarded against you. Protection From Property Damage and 3rd Party Injury: If you have people around your business activities or you work at a client’s home, you need protection against accidental injuries or property damage. Public liability insurance can protect you from the risk of legal action and any claims made against you. Whether you are found responsible or not, this type of coverage protects you against any compensation awarded and your legal defence costs. Even something as minor as a client tripping on a piece of your equipment could lead to a legal bill adding up to thousands of dollars. A more significant incident could leave you in such financial liability that your business, home, and other assets are put at risk. Membership Requirements: If you are a member of an organisation such as the NHAA, you may be required to hold specialist insurance. Many organisations have membership requirements that include professional indemnity and public liability insurance. Generally, your membership will be invalidated if you cannot provide proof of insurance such as a certificate or copy of your policy. Protect Your Reputation and Maintain Professional Standards: Finally, you need to consider your business image. The image portrayed is a message to our clients and can make or break a business. Holding the proper insurance not only provides you with protection but can showcase your professional standards and enhance your reputation. A good insurance package will help you to pursue legal avenues to defend your reputation and your business standards. It will also showcase your commitment to service to any potential customers. Regardless of the type of business activities you engage in, the proper insurance will help you to stand apart from unprofessional companies and service providers. If you are interested in a public liability quote or any other business insurance, you should speak to us. GSK Insurance specialises in offering public liability and other business insurance packages. Our team would be delighted to discuss your specific requirements and help you to ensure that your business is protected."
7,Do You Need Investment Property Insurance?,finance," Life can be unpredictable, and while many property owners ensure that their home is protected, they overlook the need for investment property insurance. Perth property owners can easily find their asset compromised by something as simple as a burst pipe or other property damage. Even a minor incident could leave you with a frustrating problem that impacts your finances. What is Covered by Investment Property Insurance? While home insurance is usually quite self explanatory, many property owners remain a little uncertain about the coverage offered by investment property insurance. Typical coverage includes protection against most unexpected events such as fire, flooding, storm damage or theft. Your policy may even be tailored to provide additional coverage for incidents such as malicious damage, damage caused by tenant structural modifications or loss of rent. The Differences Between Investment Property Insurance and Home Insurance: Property owners may be tempted to simply purchase home insurance, but this is usually a mistake. You may find that your coverage is invalidated since you are not using the property as your home. Additionally, investment property insurance generally protects both the investment building and your contents. You may even be offered additional protection that is unique to property owners such as a loss of rent should your tenant be unable to use the building due to damage caused by claimable events. Cutting corners by buying standard home insurance coverage could not only leave you out of pocket in the event of a claim, but you could be putting yourself at risk of financial implications. Some insurance companies may consider your policy fraudulent since you are not living in the property as your home. You may also fail to comply with mandatory regulations for investment property protection, such as public liability insurance The Tools For Researching Your Options: If you are struggling to determine the insurance protection available for your circumstances, there are tools available. There are budget planners to help you to determine your expenses and investment property insurance online quotations. However, the best way to research your options is to speak to a professional specialist. Specialist insurance brokers can help you to assess your options and determine the insurance package best suited to your needs. This can involve creating a tailored package that is adapted to suit the unique circumstances of your investment property. If you are interested in knowing more about investment property insurance, Perth property owners should speak to us. GSK Insurance is a specialist insurance broker, offering access to a myriad of insurance options including investment property insurance. Our team of advisors would be happy to discuss your specific requirements and help you with a tailored solution to ensure that your assets are protected. We would also be delighted to address any queries or concerns you may have."
8,"Four Questions About Business Insurance, Australia Business Owners, Should Ask",finance," Whether you are establishing a new business or your insurance requirements have changed, there are a few questions about business insurance, Perth business owners need to ask before making a purchase decision. This will help you to have confidence that your business has adequate protection without it impacting your bottom line. What Are the Business Risks? In order to ensure that you have the right level of business insurance, Australia business owners need to assess their business activities and the associated risks. You need to think about whether you have physical premises, if customers visit you and what people you rely on such as contractors, suppliers or staff. It is also worth considering what resources are vital for running your business. This information will help you to obtain a clear picture for your business. You can then get a little pessimistic and think about worst case scenarios and what could go wrong. Think about if something happens to your business premises or equipment, the liabilities you are exposed to and other circumstances that could impact your business operations.  Theft, negligence, weather damage and even loss of income all need to be considered when you are assessing a business insurance online quote. What Types of Insurance Are Needed? Now you have a good idea of your risks, and what you will need to protect, you need to consider what types of insurance you require. You may also need to consider if there are industry, membership or legislative requirements for your business insurance. Perth business owners may need to consider all types of insurance from public liability to theft and damage cover as part of their insurance package deal. How Much Insurance is Needed? This is a much more complex topic as there is no fixed or correct answer. Every business is unique, so you need insurance cover that is tailored to your requirements. You will not only need to comply with any legal requirements for basic coverage but also protect your business activities and assets. To assess your insurance needs, you will need to consider the potential costs of claims made against you or replacing your business assets. What’s Contained in the Small Print? Finally, you need to familiarise yourself with the terms and conditions of any business insurance online quote. Every company is different, so you need to check the exclusions and terms for the policy before making a purchase decision. You need to ensure that the exclusions have not compromised your policy coverage. Standard exclusions include loss due to terrorism, war or other intentional acts, but this can vary from policy to policy.

We can not only provide a business insurance online quote, but also specialist advice and guidance.

9,"Advice From Insurance Brokers, Perth Business Owners Can Use to Avoid Common Claims",finance," For small business owners, when things don’t go to plan, it can have a devastating impact on your bottom line. Although you may have planned out protection with your insurance agents, the disruption from a claim can still affect your business. Fortunately, here is some professional advice you can use to avoid common claims. Theft: This is one of the most common issues according to insurance brokers. Perth small business owners can struggle with the devastating effects of theft. The easiest access can be through a glass window or door, but it is also possible for thieves to access your business premises through the ceiling. Although many small business owners can’t afford the high security measures employed by a bug company, there are some steps to minimise theft. Firstly, you should make sure that you have adequate lighting in and around your building, particularly after business hours. This can be an excellent deterrent against break ins. Additionally, using suitable locks and heavier duty screens can help to more thoroughly secure your premises. To minimise losses, you should also consider using a store safe to hold cash or valuables when you close each day. Damage From Storms: Property damage from storms can be frequent, particularly in the turbulent weather in Australia. You may find that you have stock damage, a leaking roof, and other water damage. Additionally, electrical storms can cause power surges that damage electrical equipment and machinery. To reduce the risk of a storm damage claim, you should ensure that your property is regularly maintained. Drain pipes should be cleaned, and your roof and ceiling should be checked and repaired. Additionally, you should be storm aware. If there is a forecast for a storm, you can alleviate the risk by turning off your equipment and computers at your main power source. Accidental Computer Damage: These days, most businesses need their computers to maintain even basic business activities. This means that accidental damage to your business computers can have a devastating effect. Unfortunately, computers are vulnerable to power surges, theft, spills and even falls. Something as simple as a laptop being knocked off a counter can prompt a claim and interrupted business. Fortunately, there are simple precautions to minimise your risk. Computer locks cost very little but can be used to anchor your computer to the surface. Additionally, you may want to invest in sleeves or covers to protect against spill damage. If you have particularly sensitive computer equipment, you may wish to institute a no food or drink rule in its vicinity. If you are concerned about your coverage and need advice from business insurance brokers, Perth business owners should speak to us. GSK Insurance is a specialist insurance brokers Perth businesses can rely on. We would be delighted to help you ensure that your business is protected."
10,Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD),finance," Research May 26, 2017: GILEAD SCIENCES INC. (GILD) Established Pharmaceutical companies are known for tremendous profit margins and precipitous stock price drops when key drugs lose their monopoly or patent protection. When this happens the essential question is ""What is in the pipeline to replace it?"" At first glance at the share price performance of GILD this past year one might think their most important drugs were coming off of patent protection or facing imminent competition. This is not exactly the case. What has happened is an interesting story. One that, arguably, presents a tremendous buying opportunity. This is a company that had a net profit of $ 18 billion on revenue of $ 32 billion. At a present share price of $ 65 it carries a ridiculously low P/E of 6.5 while the industry average is above 25. Closely scrutinized companies like this don’t drop from $ 120 a share 20 months ago to where it is now for no reason so what are the analysts thinking? The main reason the stock is down are concerns about the declining sales of the blockbuster HVC drugs Ledipasvir and Sofosbavir. Together they account for about 55 percent of total revenue. Ledipasvir alone is a $ 14 Billion drug. These two drugs don’t just treat Hepatitis C , they cure it. Since it is a very expensive drug (up to $90,000 for a 12 week subscription) there was always going to price pressure, not only from competitors but from health insurance providers. There is also the issue of the drugs being a cure for a disease not a lifelong treatment like present HIV drugs. Once infected patients with the best health care coverage have been treated, discounting is required, to meet the demands of public and private insurers.  This is particularly true in Europe where public insurance is the norm. Another issue that has had a negative impact is a patent infringement case with Merck Pharmaceuticals. This is an ongoing issue that may cost Gilead a bit of money but it is only a small Infringement case and will not jeopardize the HVC franchise. We believe that the market has been overly harsh on the stock price and that GILD will provide tremendous returns in both the short and long term. Cash Rich Gilead is a cash generating machine. This allows for a huge R and D budget, dividend payments, share buybacks and, most importantly, acquisitions. Gilead will spend over $ 4 Billion on R and D this year. This is not only important for the ""Drug Pipeline "". It creates long term value. Share buybacks totaled over $ 12 Billion in 2016 or over ten percent of the present market capitalization of the company. This is a huge stock price stabilizing program. The dividend yield is about 3.2 percent. As of May Gilead had over $34 Billion in cash. This is important as the company has a phenomenal track record of adding value through acquisitions. The takeover of Phamasset for $ 11 Billion in 2011 led to the HVC franchise and has added about $ 50 Billion in value to the company. Gilead is also potential takeover target itself. Merck and Pfizer are frequently mentioned in this discussion. Pipeline As stated, the expected continuous decline in the HVC drug revenue is the main reason for the stock being unbelievably cheap on a valuation basis. The key question is by what amount their sales will continue to fall and what is in the pipeline that can reasonably be expected to replace it? We expect sales of the two HVC drugs to continue to decline by between $ 1.5 and $ 2 billion per year for the next five years. This is a particularly pessimistic view but one that realistically is reflected in the current stock price. While the prospect for HIV drugs replacing these declines is not realistic there is plenty of long term potential to argue the stock is undervalued.

11,Investing in Driverless Vehicle Technology,finance," Investing in Driverless Vehicle Technology: Part 1 General Introduction Many of our clients have been asking what is the best investment vehicle (pun intended) to profit from this revolutionary societal change. And, make no mistake, it will be a major change in the way we live our lives. We believe that when the technology is viable in operational and economic terms the change will happen very quickly. Commercial vehicles (taxis, delivery services, trucks and buses) will lead the way but the real push will come from the Insurance Industry. Once it becomes indisputable (and it will) that it is a safer way to move goods and people around, the cost reductions for Insurance will be the major force. Government regulations will evolve rapidly. As with all things related to investing: timing is everything. What time frames are we looking at here? What makes this issue so compelling is that the key technology already exists. We are not dependent on some probable scientific breakthrough. LIDAR is short for Light Detection and Ranging. These sensors use near infrared light to determine the shape and distances of all objects around them. It is the same technology used in the aviation industry for mapping and police forces for speed detection. Tens of $ Billions are being spent to get these sensors smaller and into a solid state for mass production. Once the cost gets down to less than $ 500 per sensor (with the assumption that a vehicle will use 4 to 6 of this type of sensor) then mass production and implementation will proceed. We believe it is only 5 years away. This list of companies involved in this race is extensive. Think about all auto producers, all major auto parts producers not to mention the likes of Alphabet(Google), Uber,Amazon, Apple and a wide range other large industrial and technology companies. Patent disputes, claims of industrial espionage and all sorts of indecipherable technology news await us. In fact it has already started with a major case between Google and Uber underway. All of this begs the question for investors ""Is there a pure play?"" In other words is there a company where the revenue generated will be a significant enough portion of overall sales to make it a true investment in this sector. The quick answer is yes and no. Obviously for companies like Ford and Amazon there will be potential bottom line improvements but not on a percentage scale we are looking for. There are start ups of varying credibility and there will be takeovers like the recent Intel/Mobileye takeover but to prospective investors there are two ways to participate. Identify established companies where the revenue in this sector alone will be large enough to move the stock price significantly enough over the longer term. Identify the credible start ups or early stage companies that will win the battle or at least be taken over. In part two of this report we will try and identify some of these companies. Devon Winters, Director of Technology Research, International Trading"
12,Florida Online Deed Sales - 2017,finance," The Florida tax lien sales are done for the year. Most of them are over by June 1. But did you know that there are plenty of Florida deed sales online all year long? Unlike other states where deed sales only happen once a year, some counties in Florida have tax deed sales as often as once a week! And some of these counties conduct their tax sales online. The reason that there are so many tax deed sales throughout the year in Florida, instead of just one county tax sale each year, is that Florida is really a tax lien state. Their tax lien sales are held only once a year in May. What’s different about Florida tax liens is that you do not get to foreclose on the property if the lien doesn’t redeem. Instead, you apply for the property to go into a tax deed sale. The property is sold at the tax deed auction, and the tax lien is satisfied. There are pros and cons to this system, both for the tax lien holder and the tax deed investor. Pros and Cons for the Tax Lien Investor As long as you do your due diligence on the tax sale properties and only bid on good properties, you won’t have to worry about getting the property. You can be confident that someone will bid on the property at the tax sale and your lien will be paid. You do have to pay an application fee (which varies with each county) and you will have to redeem any other outstanding tax liens and pay any subsequent taxes. The bright side to this is that everything you pay from this point on will earn 18% interest until the property is sold at the tax sale, or is redeemed. The property can still be redeemed until it is actually purchased at the tax deed auction. Pros and Cons for Tax Deed Investors Since there is a continual feed of properties into the tax deed sales from tax lien investors, there are multiple tax sales a year, perhaps even each month. The drawback to this is that unlike the big county sales in other states there are a limited amount of properties in each sale. Competition can be intense, especially if the tax sales are online.

13,Budget 2017: How it affects you,finance," The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Phillip Hammond, has announced his first budget, saying he is ""building the foundations of a stronger, fairer, more global Britain"". This is how your life will be affected. Personal taxation Currently, the self-employed may have to pay both Class 4 and Class 2 NICs: Class 4 NICs at 9% are paid on profits between £8,060 and £43,000 Class 2 NICs are paid on profits of £5,965 or more From 2018, Class 2 NICs will be abolished. In the spring budget, Philip Hammond  initially announced that Class 4 NICs would rise to 10% in April 2018 and to 11% in April 2019. However, on March 15, the chancellor abandoned plans to raise national insurance for the self-employed by 2 percent. Personal tax-free allowance to rise as planned to £11,500 this year and to £12,500 by 2020 Dividend allowance Tax-free dividend allowance will be reduced from £5,000 to £2,000 from April 2018. VAT threshold From 1 April 2017 the VAT registration threshold will increase to £85,000 from £83,000 and the deregistration threshold will rise from £81,000 to £83,000 Making Tax Digital (MTD) The Chancellor has delayed the introduction of Making Tax Digital for sole traders, landlords and the self employed operating under the new £85,000 VAT threshold. The Chancellor's announcement means that sole traders, the self employed and buy-to-let landlords with income of less than the current £83,000 VAT threshold will not have to start quarterly reporting until 2019, a one-year deferral from the planned April 2018 introduction date originally set out in the recent consultation feedback documents issued by HMRC at the end of January. Under MTD, businesses will use digital software to keep tax records and update HMRC quarterly. Evaluation of Employment Practices An ongoing review of employment practices has been conducted by Matthew Taylor. The chancellor has suggested that this will discuss the tax regime for flexible workers and the report is expected over the summer. Should you have any questions about how those changes will affect you, please feel free to get in touch with us. 14 Tax saving tips: Self Employment •	Ensure the personal circumstances and present situation of your subcontractors actually qualify as self employed and not employed. It may well do in your eyes but would it do so in the eyes of the HMRC tax inspector. Does your self employed workers qualify within the ""six badges of trade"". Likewise, if you have any ""subcontractors"" working for you can it be shown that a contract for services exists. Warning : It could be very costly if HMRC deems these are not subcontractors due to your business having total control, no financial risk to the ""subcontractor"", no capital involved or equipment, no work performance or correction of work financial penalties to the subcontractors. You have exclusivity over the workers, you pay when not at work. Do not claim back travel or other expenses if you operate under an ""umbrella scheme"" through an employment agency. If you incorporate your Limited company you must ensure you have more than one client during the tax year. As HMRC could deem that the arrangement is an employed arrangement and you may be subject to paye. It may be more beneficial to claim motor expenses using a mileage basis than a receipt basis. Any disallowed expenditure shown must be added back to the profits. These may be personal expenses taken out of the business for example GOODS FOR OWN USE. An owner of a café could take food home or a garage mechanic cannot claim for parts used on his personal vehicle which he did not use for his business. A suit used for business would be disallowable or items such as glasses. These are qualified as disallowable as they are classed as personal. Cases of wine given to customers are a gift and disallowable. Self-Employment losses incurred in first year trading may be offset against tax paid during employment in that tax year. This is known as side-ways relief and the net result could be a tax repayment. Losses made in relation to rental property must be carried forward against the first available rental profits and cannot be against any other income. If a trading loss is incurred in the final year of trading, the loss incurred in the last 12 months of trading is to be set against the trading profits ( if any ) of the tax year in which the cessation occurs and the three previous tax years. This is known in tax law as Terminal Trade Loss Relief. A personal pension plan is an excellent way of reducing a tax liability as it increases the basic rate limit. Always ensure that statutory documents are filed on time as penalties for late submission of CT600’s, company accounts and personal tax returns SA100 can be severe. Daily penalties will arise in the event of a non-filing of a tax return. HMRC will impose late penalty fines on any tax which is not paid on time. If a partner, husband or spouse does not use up all their personal allowance an election may be made to transfer part of that allowance subject to certain conditions. This may result in a tax saving for the partner, husband or spouse who is the tax payer. Dividends are taxed from 6th April 2016 for basic rate taxpayers ( after an allowance of £5000 ). If the partner, husband or spouse has an active part in the business it may be beneficial to Introduce them as a shareholder and thus use up their tax free allowance. In addition by sharing the split of the dividends it may result in less of the dividends being charged at a higher rate. •	In certain circumstances trading losses may be set against the capital gains and therefore reducing capital gains tax."
14,Solo Travel: At least Once!,finance," There are all kinds of people in the world. Some love traveling on their own, while some prefer being with family/friends. With technological advancements and increased ease of travel, solo travel i.e. traveling alone has become a trend. But still, to most of us, especially the first-timers, venturing off alone can be a scary thought. But little we know the great things that come out of this wanderlust. Here are 5 beautiful reasons for traveling solo, at least once (we are sure, this once will not remain just ‘once’): Each time, a new YOU!: Every time a person ventures out alone, he is changed, and it’s a positive change. It changes energy and confidence levels and, perspective of the world. He is more strong, fearless and a go-getter in solving his own problems/struggles. Traveling solo brings a new ‘you’. Leaving the comfort zone is therapeutic: Traveling solo may not always be comforting. A person would be scared, nervous or unfamiliar to the language. He may be lost and would not even know how to ask for the right path (may be due to different language). But this is not bad as it sounds. Yes, leaving your comfort zone is therapeutic. It’s an opportunity to embrace all that comes your way and make your way through it, leaving an enriching and amazing experience to cherish. Learning Roller Coaster: Traveling is one big learning roller coaster. It may have ups and downs, fun and excitement along with nervousness, but it teaches so many things besides, making you calm, confident, respectful and graceful. Discovering yourself better: Spending time with your own self allows you to introspect and understand yourself. Traveling alone teaches you things about yourself, possibly you never knew or if you knew, not well enough. Yes, traveling solo also surprises you of your strength. It’s a fact of life that you never know what you are capable of unless you set out to do something. Traveling solo you learn a lot about yourself. Changed perspective: Traveling, especially on your own, will let you understand in it’s aura, various aspects of travel, like traditions, rituals, mannerisms of a certain place. May be when you are traveling in a group, your perspective is clouded or result of what others feel and experience too. Traveling can be an addiction to many of us. But the freedom and beauty of traveling solo is something different. This can only be felt by traveling solo. As obvious, it’s uncomfortable and often nerve wracking and therefore, there are certain things solo travelers must always remember: It’s all about you: Decide your own places where you want to go and when. It’s not a race and a competition where you have to prove how much you traveled. Go at your pace and feel the essence. Be careful, not scared: In unfamiliar places stay alert but do not be scared. Look and act confident to avoid any unwanted attention and undesirable event. Stay in touch with family: Use Whatsapp, messaging, Skype, Emails etc., whatever to keep updating your family/friends about your whereabouts. Remember, this is not about feeling scared but being prepared to act efficiently when things go wrong. Pack light: Pack the basics you need and do not fill your suitcase with your ‘wants’. It’s about enjoying your solo company sans your material possessions. Get insured: Visitor insurance is a must while traveling, solo or with friends/in a group. It equips you with coverage necessary to have in times of medical emergencies. Visitor insurance offers benefits in times of undesirable medical events, specially when healthcare costs, in countries like the USA can be very high. It is highly recommended to purchase visitor insurance plan from an authorized, experienced and helpful agent like MultiChoice Insurance Services."
15,How to Create Marketable Commercial Mortgage Notes,finance," Many commercial investors and business owners have become aware of the benefits of selling their properties quicker through owner-financing and still get to a cash position. Investors often call us to get advice and suggestions about how to create and structure the deal so that they can: create a marketable, saleable note minimize the discount on the new note off of the balance owed be able to exit the servicing of the newly-created note as soon as possible. There are a number of Note factors a commercial note buyer, including ourselves, will consider when looking to purchase a commercial note: Use of the Property – One of the first things we will want to know is the current use of the property. The term ""commercial loans"" can mean anything from multi-family properties (5 plus units), office buildings, retail centers, industrial and warehouse space, specialty-use properties such as gas stations, schools, churches, etc., or single tenant buildings. New Sale or Seasoned Note? - A newly-created Note where there is no established payment history carries an added element of risk. One or more months of documentable payments on the Note can help counteract some of the uncertainty or risk associated with a new Note. Buyer’s Down Payment – The larger the down payment of a buyer’s hard-earned dollars, the greater stability this creates for a buyer. They are more likely to wrestle their way out of a problem before jeopardizing the initial down payment they have made into a property. For most Note buyers, a minimum of 15% down is required (20-25% is preferable) on commercial properties. This down payment must be clearly documented. Buyer’s Financial Stability - A commercial borrower needs to have strong financials and credit history. However, greater weight is placed on the property’s ability to sustain the loan over that of the borrower’s personal situation. Cash Flow from Property - A commercial note buyer will look at the condition of the property and its ability to service the loan out of the cash flow from its day to day operations. Copies of current leases (rent roll) are reviewed and 1-2 years of the borrowers operating history. Recent capital improvements, internal and external photos of the property, and lien and title searches will also be reviewed, while paying attention to not only the property in question but also the surrounding area and the trends in the marketplace. Repayment Terms of the Note - After carefully considering the above details, a note buyer should have a good feel for the candidate’s risk factor. Candidates with less risk can typically be financed at a higher starting loan-to-value (LTV) threshold in the 75% LTV range to perhaps as high as 85% LTV range, as opposed to the riskier candidates who may be financed somewhere in the 70% to 80% LTV range. The same is true with the actual note interest rate or ""coupon"" rate. Higher risk means a higher interest rate, typically in the 8% -10% range. Lower risk can allow for a lower note coupon rate perhaps in the 6% - 8% range. Occupancy - Generally, owner-occupied properties are better kept, and the property owner may be more compelled to pay timely on a Note than an investor-owner who may be struggling to collect rents, keep up with repairs, or other bills, etc. Also, a note with an investor-owner as the payer will be subject to a greater discount on the note. Summary It is the correlation of all of these Note factors that will dictate how you can adjust the proposed structure of a deal so that it will allow you to maximize the amount of cash you can realize along with minimizing the note discount."
16,Secrets for Your First Real Estate Investment,finance," Decide your strategy First, you will need to determine what your strategy will be in real estate investing. Do you want to buy a property, fix it up, sell it quickly with seller-financing and later sell the new seller-financed Note to a note buyer for cash? Or, do you want to buy a property, hold it and wait for the market value to increase? Do you want to deal with renters? All of these questions are ones that you need to answer before you invest in any piece of real estate. If you’re buying with the strategy of renovating and then selling, then it is time to start your renovations. On the other hand, if you’re buying with the strategy of renting the property, it is time to start looking for tenants. You see, the point of having a strategy for profiting from the purchase of any piece of real estate must be your first decision, because everything that comes after that is dependent upon it. Do your home work You will need to learn how to investigate the value of properties yourself. There are several online sites that are helpful in determining the real value of real estate. DO NOT rely on tax values - they are not reliable nor accurate. Find three mortgage brokers and learn what interest rates and closing costs each one charges. (Check out your local bank or credit union as well). Take copies of your three credit reports and choose a sample property for each broker to run hard numbers on. Location, location, location You can roll all of the various factors for determining whether a location is good or bad into one simple word: desirability. Keep in mind the ‘visibility’ factor. If a neighborhood or an area has become famous or even infamous, property values rise regardless of the location. Convenience is another factor when considering the desirability of the location of a piece of property. People do like to live close to where they work and where their children attend school. You need to find the ""hot"" markets when buying investment property, and in a nutshell, the hot market is where the people are GOING. Determining where people are going is the trick. Business can also cause real estate prices to go up and can create hot properties for investment purposes. Your first investment Now you are ready to actually make your first investment. The objective is to buy low and sell high, and that means that you have to make a guess (an EDUCATED guess) as to what is going to happen tomorrow or next week or next year or ten years from now. You want to choose the lowest price house in the best possible neighborhood to put a contract on. Let's say the cheapest two-bedroom house in the best neighborhood in Fort Worth costs $100,000 and the next cheapest, comparable home is listed for $140,000. If you buy the home that is priced at $100,000, you can raise your price to $130,000 and make a nice profit. Real estate investing is not an exact science. You always have to weigh the risk against the potential reward. But when choosing what properties to invest in, this should be made strictly upon solid facts. Closing the deal Show the seller your pre-qualification letter from your lender. Then get the required inspections for termites and get your appraisal. Once you have all of your ‘ducks in a row’ so to speak, it can take about 30 days to make the final close."
17,Here’s How Debt Consolidation Can Help You,finance," Falling into the trap of unmanageable debt is a very common situation nowadays. It is a proven fact that more than 45% of people in the US spend more than what they earn. Climbing out of the trap of debt could be a very complicated process without using any proper procedure. A debt consolidation plan is the real savior, because it can actually bring you out of the situation and help you pay off/clear your multiple loans at the same time. What Is Debt Consolidation Generally, you can find there are two types of debts but each of them has different sub types included. The objective is to secure a loan with a fixed interest rate or lesser interest rate to pay them off. Following are several types of loans. Traditional Loans Personal Loan - This type of loan is offered for a specific amount of money. A personal loan is given for a declared and undeclared usage. This type of loan is processed through a bank or another financial lending institute. Secured loans are given to anyone against property or a guarantor, but unsecured loans are only provided to the consumers with a high credit rating. Mortgage Loan - It is a long term loan issued specifically for purchasing personal or commercial property. As a customer, here you might negotiate to lower the monthly payment. Educational Loan - This type of loan is particularly designed for educational purposes only, for paying educational bills, meal plans, tuition fees and other living expenses for college or university. This type of loan is paid after completing the course. With this type of loan you can ask for an additional grace period. These are the typical traditional loans and the second type of debt is revolving credit. Revolving Credit Unlike traditional loans, revolving credit allows you to borrow the same amount of money again after paying the loan amount. There are mainly two types of revolving credit you can find in the market:  Credit Card and Line of Credit. Credit Card - Today we all use plastic money. The credit card has become the most common form of personal debt. According to latest surveys, it is said that almost each American has more than five credit cards on average. Line of Credit - Generally, a line of credit is issued by banks and other financial organizations. It provides a reusable source of funds, and you can withdraw it by check or cash. As we mentioned here earlier, one of the most practical ways to pay off insurmountable debt is nothing but debt consolidation. Usually there are two types of debt consolidation but it comes in one of two forms- Home Equity Loan and Negotiated Debt Settlement Forms of Debt Consolidation Home Equity Loan - This is one of the most effective debt consolidation solutions for mortgage customers, because it allows a customer to refinance their mortgage. The customer can use the equity amount that he built up as a loan guarantee and use it to pay off the higher interest loans and credit card loans. With the help of this home equity loan, homeowners pay one single payment per month which is less than the total combined monthly loan amount of all the outstanding loans. Negotiated Debt Settlement - This type includes the involvement of a third party service which is specialized in debt consolidation. Usually the third party will contact each of the creditors personally on your behalf and will negotiate an amount you have to pay every month. The advantage of this sort of settlement is that the negotiated amount will always be less than the actual loan amount. All you do is pay the money to the third party and they will make the payment to each of the creditors. Getting into an appropriate debt consolidation plan will benefit the consumer in a big way, but a bad consolidation plan can lead to total disaster. It is essential to gain good knowledge about what a debt consolidation plan has to offer. As a consumer you may not be so sure about the guidelines of a good debt consolidation plan, so seeking professional advice can help in a major way."
18,Gold Notes Investing,finance," GOLD NOTES: May 25, 2017 Every investment portfolio should, at all times, have a minimum of 10 percent in gold assets. This is basically a universal principal of prudent, save and responsible money management. There are many reasons for this. In uncertain times, however, the amount of gold in every portfolio should increase to be 15 or even 20 percent of total assets. With the Trump presidency now upon us we are certainly dealing with uncertainty both in economic and geo political terms. Now lets step back a minute and look at what happened to gold and gold mining shares in the past 18 months or so. In early December 2015 gold was trading at $ 1070 per ounce. In July of last year it hit a high of $ 1365 per ounce. It was no coincidence that this coincided with the uncertainty around the BREXIT. So roughly speaking we saw a 30 percent increase in seven months. Not a bad return, but if you look at what happened to blue chip gold mining shares in the same time period, it is not that impressive. Shares in the worlds largest gold producers increased by between 250 and 350 percent in the same time period. We are not talking about junior exploration companies that made a big discovery. We are talking about established multibillion dollar mature companies. Understanding some basics of mining economics explains why this happens. For the big producers their cost of production does not change much in the medium term. Here we are talking about transportation, electrical power, labor and taxes. These are largely fixed. They don’t change rapidly. Now let’s say a large gold mining company has an average cost of production of $ 1,100 per ounce and gold is selling at $ 1,200 per ounce. They make $ 100 per ounce of production. When gold moves up to $ 1,300 they make $ 200. At $ 1,400 they make $ 300 an ounce. So what happens to the stock price of any company in any industry when their profit doubles or triples?  They skyrocket. The same thing that happened last year is unlikely to happen again because gold was at lower levels but an increase of just 20 percent in the price of gold could easily cause Gold mining shares to increase by 60 to 80 percent. This could, of course happen quite quickly. SPDR Gold Shares (symbol GDX) is a $ 40 billion exchange traded fund that mirrors the price movement of gold almost exactly. This is the most convenient and conservative way to get exposure in this sector. Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) is the largest gold producer in the world. It produced 5.5 million ounces in 2016. Cost cutting, divestiture and restructuring have reduced the cost of production from $ 830 to $ 730 per ounce. Among the giant producers it has the lowest cost. Newmont (NEM) is $ 912 per ounce of production while AngloGold Ashanti (AU) has risen to $ 986. Klondex Mines (KLDX) is an impressive and rapidly expanding gold producer with operating mines in Canada and the United States. The management team are considered the best in the industry. Huge upside potential on this one. Grant Oliver. Mining Analyst."
19,Financing Your Investments - Creative Ideas,finance," For many years, the way to finance real estate was to make a 20% down payment, and get a loan for the remaining 80%. Of course you could make a higher down payment, but 20% was typically the minimum. Luckily, this standard has changed. There are now several finance options available to the real estate investor, including seller-financing. Another popular way to finance your purchase is to have a second mortgage. The buyer makes a 5% down payment, and borrows the remaining 15%, usually at a higher interest rate, on a different loan. Even though it’s nice to invest less on a property, the higher interest rate isn’t the only drawback. Usually, if the buyer does not meet the 20% minimum, they are required to get costly private mortgage insurance (PMI). For creative investors, other financing sources exist. Manufacturers of homes in planned developments are often willing to provide financing to early buyers. Another risky and somewhat complicated way of financing a property is called ‘sub2’, which stands for ‘subject-to’. This type of deal is when the seller gives you the deed to the property, the loan stays in place, but the buyer never legally takes over the loan, just the payments. There are many different versions of this kind of transaction. Because of the complexity and risk, this method of funding an investment is not recommended for beginners. You can also consider forming a limited partnership (LP) to finance your real estate investment. There are many different arrangements for this method. Some types involve each person in the partnership contributing in a portion of the cost, usually 50% each. However, sometimes the profit is distributed relative to the original amount invested. Another arrangement is that one half of the partnership contributes the capital, and the other half provides the needed services, such as repairs on a home that needs to be fixed. There are many different variations of this method. Government loans are available to low income investors, or buyers who have served in the military. These programs are usually only available for primary residences. Did you ever think about buying a home on a credit card? This is another method of financing your real estate purchase, although it’s usually not recommended. Obviously, the interest rates on most credit cards are substantially higher than loan rates. Another drawback is that lenders determine your creditworthiness based on your outstanding debt, and if you use credit card cash advances to cover the 5-20% down payment that you need, you’ll probably get turned down for a loan. Have you considered asking the seller to become your lender? This method has many benefits, mainly more flexibility in the structure and terms of the loan and in the FICO scores accepted. There are companies who are in the business of buying these private loans at a discount."
20,Stock Market Today,finance," Stock Market Today The stock market today is different in many ways from previous years, yet in the most basic ways, it is the same as it’s been for many decades. The exciting part is that with the advent of the internet, it is now very easy to access critical data to help you make hopefully smart, efficient, and profitable decisions with regard to your stock investments. You can do your own research on public companies right online, anytime, day or night. You have access to all of a company’s data, to help you perform fundamental analysis, as well as technical analysis. Fundamental analysis includes evaluating a company’s financial information, such as earnings, debt, profits, revenues, and the like. Technical analysis is the study of price charts. Technical analysis is a perspective of a company based on charts. Most charts are based on the stock price, and can be as specific as minute by minute charts, and as general as a chart showing the last 20 years or more of stock prices. There are literally hundreds of different criteria on companies that is analyzed by both professionals in the business, as well as private investors looking to make money in the market. There is software that combines much of this criteria, and shows signals for buying, and selling when this combination of predetermined, specific criteria is met. Also, you have the ability to purchase stock much more quickly, and for greatly discounted commissions compared to what was available even a few decades ago. No longer is it necessary to hold paper stock certificates, or is it needed to bother with excruciatingly slow snail mail to fill out forms, and transmit payments to buy stock,  and provide other paperwork. There are some exceptions to this rule, but if so, it is usually only for the initial paperwork, and transactions, and then the subsequent communications can be done over the internet. The Basics A company must offer a portion of it’s company to the public in order to be traded, or have stock bought or sold on it.  This is called going public.  It is initiated by an Initial Public Offering, otherwise known as an IPO. An Initial Public Offering is also known as an IPO. Why would a company want to do this? Companies go public in order to raise capital or funds. They use these funds for various purposes, such as to pay down debt, to make capital improvements, buy equipment, or to expand operations. Going public is also another avenue for making money for the principals or management of the company.  By owning stock in their own company, they can participate in it’s success when the price of the stock goes up. They are also, of course, subject to losing money if the stock price dips. Other reasons to offer stock might include,  to increase research and development, to hire employees, to start or increase an online presence, or any of many different reasons that are determined to improve the firm in one way or another. The stock buyer, as a result,  gets to participate in the goings on of the company. The more stock a person holds in a given company, the more influence that stock holder has in the company decisions. Stock holder meetings are held about once a year. Stock holder meetings are held annually by most companies, and stock holders can attend and become involved in various changes, and proposals of the company’s business by voting on the various proposals. It is also possible for stock holders to participate by proxy without being present at the stock holder meetings. Stock Prices How is a company’s stock price determined?   There are many factors that make up a company’s stock price.  Initially, for the IPO or Initial Public Offering, the price will be set by the public’s opinion of the business prospects or business outlook of the company. 300x250 Investing Edge What business is this company in?  Does it have in demand products? Do they fill a need? What is it’s business plan?  Who are the competitors? Are the owners/management of the company known to be competent in their field? Are they well financed?  Is the legal landscape smooth, or are there potential liability issues with the company’s business? Many factors determine stock prices. Is this IPO well advertised? Does the public know about it? Will the demand for it push the stock price up, or lack of it force it to a low level? All of these factors, and many more will set the beginning price of a stock. Once the first price is set, and the stock takes it’s place on one of the various stock exchanges, more factors come into play that will affect the price of the stock. Some of these factors are: What business sector is this company in? How is the sector performing? What is the state of the economy that the company is in? Is it a healthy economy, or is it less healthy, or is it in a status quo economic range? What are the company’s prospects for growth? Can it or does it benefit from it’s website, and online business? Does it have potential to reach other country’s markets? Will it be profitable enough to declare a dividend? If so, how much of a dividend will it pay out?  How quickly will it have strong earnings? Will the earnings exceed the price of the stock? What is the Federal Reserve Bank doing?  Are they raising interest rates? Are they easing interest rates? Are they making it more difficult for banks to borrow money from them? Are they adding money to the supply? The political climate of the country can affect stock prices. What is the political climate of the country that the company is headquartered in?  Is there unrest? Is it war time or peace time? Are the leaders of the country respected?  How is the country perceived by the rest of the world? How much market share does the company enjoy?  What are it’s prospects to gain market share?  What is the opinion of stock brokers, and other market pros about the company, it’s financial outlook, and it’s stock? Are they recommending it, and fueling it’s growth, or are they telling their customers, and the public to stay away from it, or do they taking a neutral stance towards it? Dividend Stocks Dividend stocks allow for growth, and profit. I love dividend stocks. If you are in the stock market, and you don’t own dividend stocks, you need to take another look. What are dividend stocks? These are stocks that whose company has declared a dividend or a periodic payout of profits to stockholders of record. The payout percentage of the stock price ranges normally from 1% to about 15% yearly. The dividends are usually paid quarterly, and if you own enough shares, can be quite significant. These dividends can fluctuate, depending on the company.  Generally speaking however, the dividends of most companies increase or decrease gradually. Click Here! DRIP Stocks The best dividend stocks to own for the long term, in my humble opinion, are DRIP stocks. DRIP stands for dividend reinvestment plan. Many companies allow for the dividends of their stocks to be reinvested automatically.  This reinvestment purchases more shares of the companies stock based on the amount of the dividend reinvestment. You will rest easier with DRIP stocks. Most companies allow for the entire dividend to be reinvested, or a portion or percentage of it. If you take a partial payout, and leave the rest to be reinvested, you can realize an income stream, and theoretically at least, continue to grow your position in the stock. And, oh by the way, when you retire, you will need an income stream. As you probably know, Social Security does not typically provide much income for retirement. DRIP stocks give you an opportunity to increase the amount of income for your retirement. Many companies also allow for very little if any fees to be charged for this dividend reinvestment, leaving a larger amount of money to buy more shares. A small number of companies also allow for their shares to be purchased at a discount, normally 3%-5% of the current stock price. I am sure that you know people that own stocks that are constantly agonizing over the wild price swings in their stocks. One day the stock is up, and they are happy.  The next day the stock is down, and they are unhappy. If they have large positions in these stocks, they may not even be able to sleep at night.  What a miserable way to invest your money, and live your life! DRIP stocks can help you get more enjoyment from retirement. With DRIP stocks, since the dividends are automatically reinvested for you, you will always increase the amount of shares of stock you own in the company, as long as you don’t sell any of the stock. You won’t need to concern yourself as much with the price of the stock, since you will have more shares regardless of the share price.  This compounding effect can greatly increase your wealth over a period of many years. You can also add additional investments to buy more stock in the DRIP to increase your position further. The are only a few negatives to the DRIP way of investing in stocks. If, for instance, you want to liquidate your position, that is to sell your stock, it may take many days or weeks before you will see your proceeds. By the time your order to sell is actually done, the price of the stock may have changed, either up or down. Some companies or the stock transfer companies they utilize for their DRIP programs, will buy and sell their stock at predetermined dates. Depending on when you place your order, this could be days, or weeks before it is accomplished. Sometimes also, a company will decrease or eliminate their dividend. If this happens, it is time to consider selling your position, and buying in another position in a different company that offers a DRIP. It is a good idea to monitor the stock activity, and the company’s financials, just in case.  The stress level of owning DRIP stocks is far less than owning shares of most other stocks in almost every case. You will certainly be able to sleep better at night, knowing that your DRIP stocks will be increasing your position without your having to do anything for it. The dividends are taxable when they are paid out, regardless of whether you reinvest them, or take them as income. Time is of the essence when investing for the long term. The longer time horizon you have for investing, the more attractive the DRIP strategy can be. If, for instance, you are a young person in your 20’s, 30’s, or 40’s, if you start investing in DRIPs, use the full reinvestment option, and don’t take any money out along the way, by the time you are ready to retire, you should have a nice large nest egg built up. At this point, you can take the entire dividend as an income stream, or part of the dividend as an income stream, and keep some of the dividend buying more stock, and continue to increase your principal. Even if you are in your 50’s or 60’s, if you start investing in DRIPs, add to them periodically, you can have a nice amount of stock income to draw from when you retire. If you don’t need the income when you retire, you of course could opt to continue to reinvest the entire dividend, and grow your positions. I believe DRIP stocks to be the safest, most effective way to invest in the stock market, especially if you have a long term time horizon. If you are a person that lives for the high blood pressure, exciting world of wild price swings, and quick gains and losses, DRIP investing may not be for you. Might I suggest commodity/futures investing. But, if you want a relatively safe and reliable way to grow your retirement nest egg.  And, if you want to be able to turn that nest egg into a significant income stream come retirement age, while still maintaining the principal, then I strongly suggest you take a serious look at DRIP investing. The stock market today offers many opportunities safe, effective investing.  It can also be a minefield of disaster, if you attempt to negotiate it without knowledge, and a trustworthy broker. By concentrating on dividend stocks, and with DRIPs, dividend reinvestment plans, you can greatly increase your odds of success, and, at the same time, minimize your chances of losing money."

The differences between a contract worker and an employee are pretty easy to identify.

2,A Guide to Securing Financing for Commercial Projects,finance," Investing your money plays a critical role in achieving financial security, especially for your life after retirement. People don’t always agree on the best place to invest money, but one thing they can agree on is to start investing early. The earlier in life you invest, the more time you have to earn a profit. One place to invest that has a potential for yielding a worthwhile profit is rental properties. When you buy a property to rent, whether you choose to buy a house, duplex or apartment building, it’s going to cost money upfront. Fortunately, it’s possible to obtain loans specifically for purchasing investment properties. When looking to take out a commercial loan, the most important factor is your credit score. Having a very good credit score, 740 and above, will increase your likelihood of obtaining a loan. Anything less than a 740 credit score, will increase your monthly payments and interest rates or even prevent you from being approved. Debt is another aspect to take in consideration. If you have financial debt, it’s best to take care of it before seeking a loan. Having a lot of debt makes it difficult if not impossible to be approved for a loan. If you’re in a good position to obtain a loan, you need to decide who your lender is going to be. Large national banks are a viable option; however, they don’t have much room for flexibility. National banks want to be certain that they get their money back. As such, they won’t approve loans for properties that they deem risky and, they usually require large down payments. An alternative option to taking out a loan directly from a large bank is to go through a private broker. The biggest benefit of using a broker is having the flexibility not offered by national banks. Brokers are more willing to work with you to create a plan that suits your circumstances. Larger brokers offer loans ranging from $1,000,000 to $50,000,000. Private lenders have more options for fixed rates ranging from 3 to 35 years. Working with a commercial loan broker opens up more opportunities for you to put your money into investment real estate properties. They have the knowledge and experience to help you take out a loan that’s right for you. Getting approved for a loan and purchasing a rental property today will assist you in your journey of obtaining financial security."
3,What to expect from G20 Compact with Africa,finance," Economic Condition In the upcoming Hamburg Summit in July this year, Africa is eager to strengthen its ties with Germany for the sake of economic development. The Africa compact is eyeing to develop the entire continent’s economic growth and sustainability. Political instability is also a serious issue that the African people face today. The African compact is set to diminish political corruption for the entire plan of the G20 for Africa’s economic growth to be effective. Africa is also facing an employment crisis with most of their fresh graduates and professionals. Most individuals are looking for better job opportunities with higher salaries in European countries. G20’s Targets The G20 states that the counter-measures will focus on enhancing renewable energy, infrastructure, private investment, agriculture, industrial development and the decrease of illicit financial outflows. All of these components are to be tackled as the means of Africa’s economic recovery. Instead of country specific or bilateral, the Compact will take a multilateral approach. The threat of terrorism and heinous crimes requires the commitment of many leaders. Almost $50 billion is lost annually because of illicit financial outflows. All G20 members agreed to fortify and design stronger rules for tax disclosure requirements in Africa. The food production in Africa is taking a beating because the sector is underfunded. The members of G20 are encouraged to support Africa’s agriculture, agribusiness, fisheries and generally, food production. Most Africans’ source of food comes from fishing and agriculture. Africa is hoping for an energy financing gap of an estimated $55 billion yearly through 2030. Africa will rely on renewable energy and restrict carbon intensive growth. It is certain that the development of renewable energy will boost Africa’s economy, affecting the Africans and in the future, everyone in the world. At this stage of the G20 proposal is being negotiated, first countries to enter the negotiations include Morocco, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Rwanda, and Tunisia. A particular goal is at hand - to forge the economy of rich and poor countries as one strong economy for the entire continent of Africa while reducing the wealth gap and inequality. Bridging the economy of each African country will cause a decline in the rapid population growth that has plagued the continent with diseases. Africa on the Right Track It was agreed upon that Africa has already established the best framework for economic growth. However, the process of implementation for each country isn’t efficient enough for broad development. Some countries are moving upwards while some are left behind. The Compact with Africa is already in motion and the latest reports will be distributed in the Hamburg Summit this year. Every member is hoping for productive results, especially with renewable energy and the battle against money laundering. A Stronger Africa Africa, along with the other members of the G20, including Germany, the United States, United Kingdom, and others are all passionate in the success of these compacts. Financial security for the entire continent will surely arise. The promotion of international investment in crucial infrastructural projects including agriculture and energy projects would affect both GDP and trade balance of the countries on the continent, likely influencing their currencies. As exchange rates shift, new opportunities will arise in the currency markets. Individuals interested in using these opportunities to their advantage are advised to educate themselves in the field of currency trading, starting with a forex trading tutorial from a renowned broker. With the economy rising, employment will also prosper. More and more Africans are going to stay in their country to build their career. Every member is aware of managing risks with the Compact with Africa, especially in terms of political instability. But if everything goes according to plan, especially with all the leaders doing their part with integrity, Africa-North, South, East and West-will be stronger."
4,Understanding Solar Loan Rates,finance," There has never been a better time for homeowners to go solar. But with solar tax credits set to expire, that opportunity could slip away. Fortunately, most solar companies offer an array of purchasing options for homeowners regardless of their budget or credit history. These include: easy cash purchases, solar leases, PACE (property assessed clean energy), solar loans at competitive rates. Cash purchases deliver the greatest long-term savings and best return on the homeowner's investment. Tax incentives alone allow homeowners to recover 30% of their system costs, and the energy saving will pay for the rest of the system in just a few short years with decades of free electricity on top of that. For added flexibility, cash doesn't necessarily have to come out of savings, it can also take the form of a home equity loan that can be tax deductible. On the other end of the spectrum, solar leases can offer all the energy-saving benefits of a cash purchase, with the difference being that the solar company owns the system on the homeowner's roof. The homeowner simply pays a small monthly amount to ""rent"" their system. With easy 20-year financing terms are available, and a 20-year system guarantee this is an excellent option for those who want to keep their out-of-pocket costs to zero. Plus, when it's time to sell, the solar lease can be assigned to the new homeowner - making the property that much more attractive. PACE programs offer another smart option for those looking for solar with no upfront costs. The solar system is financed through the homeowner's property taxes. It works like a loan, and still qualifies for the 30% tax credit. With terms up to 230 years, and a 30-year product warranty guarantee, no credit score requirement, and a loan that is transferrable to the new owner, the low monthly payments and immediate savings make this a very attractive option, quick and painless. With a well established solar companies solar panel loan there are no out-of-pockets costs, financing terms up to 25 years, and generous tax incentives, it adds to a package well worth considering. Homeowners not only get to own their system and the tax incentives that come with it, they're protected by a 25-year product warranty and production guarantee. Couple that with immediate savings and low monthly payments and taking out a solar loan is one of the brighter financial moves a homeowner can make."
5,How to Roll Your 401(k) into a Self-Directed IRA,finance," Many people struggle to keep all their retirement planning and financial information straight. From IRAs to 401(k)s and all points in between, it can get confusing at tax time or any other time of the year. That’s why it’s wise to consider - once you become fully vested in your employer 401(k), that is - the potential benefits of rolling the funds from your 401(k) program into a self-directed IRA (SD-IRA). Why Would You Want to Make the Switch? There are quite a few reasons to consider moving funds from your 401(k) retirement account into a self-directed IRA – especially if your IRA is what you would consider a checkbook control account or self-directed IRA LLC. These are just a few of the highlights. More control – You make the choices with a SD-IRA LLC and do not need the oversight of an account trustee or custodian. Wider range of investment options – You’re not limited to paper investments. In fact, you can make brick and mortar investments in real estate and businesses with your SDIRA. Easier diversification – Once again, you’re the one in the driver’s seat. You can make your SDIRA as homogenous or diverse as you’d like. Consolidates retirement investments – This makes for easier record keeping and allows you to have a better handle on your financial situation at any given time. Lowers fees – Administrative fees on 401(k) accounts can be lethal. SDIRAs, especially those where you have checkbook control, do not require the same degree of administration and, as a result, have fewer fees. Stability – When it comes to 401(k) plans, trustees and fees change at the blink of an eye and with little advance warning. This isn’t the case with SDIRAs. There’s a little more stability with the way things are done, reporting is required, etc. so you don’t have to worry about sudden, unexplained, or unexpected changes. Simplifies record keeping – Keeping accurate records is important, not only to help keep your own financial affairs in order, but also for the purpose of tax keeping and recording. Reducing the number of accounts you’re working with is usually a good thing if your goal is simplification. Eliminates penalties – There are penalties involved in cashing out altogether. However, rolling your 401(k) into an IRA doesn’t have the same penalties, making the money more immediately useful to you as an investment without the crippling penalties involved if you decided to take the money out and invest on your own. Now that you know all the reasons why, you’ll be glad to know that the process is fairly simple. If you want to roll funds from your 401(k) into your self-directed IRA, the direct transfer method is the only way to go - in order to avoid risking a 20 percent loss of 401(k) funds, taxes on the 20 percent lost, and early withdrawal penalties of 10 percent if you’re under the age of 59.5. All you need to do is notify the financial institution that holds your SDIRA account and the 401(k) plan custodian of your wishes to transfer the money into the IRA account, because the money is transferred directly to the retirement account. Not only is this a more efficient method of but it also eliminates the possible penalties of transferring funds through the withdrawal process. Now you can sit back, relax, and wait for the transfer to take place (the process generally takes about a month). Once the money is live in your account, you can begin making active investments."

7,Re-Claiming PPI for a Deceased Loved One,finance," Nobody ever seems to talk about the financial journey that immediately faces those who lose a loved one. Culturally, the focus is on the emotional elements of the passing of a loved one, of death, of grief. Suddenly there's a space where before, there just wasn't. You can't say things to the space, and you can't lean against a space, and the space has no warmth or smell. Meanwhile, life moves on towards the next season at the same speed it always did, it doesn't wait. Look outside; the clouds are moving across the window pane, and the sun will soon set like it always has... ... and life continues to revolve around finances and specifics linked to finances. But - in the UK anyway - it's as though it's unseemly to address money and financial issues outside of the lawyer's office. However, money is a practical item that can help immensely. And clear advice and discussion is far more helpful, than mutters under the breath. There's no good or evil to money, it's simply a thing. Any emotion connected to money belongs to whoever brings the emotion. Money has no emotion, it's neutral. What isn't neutral is that your loved one would not want you to leave money in a bank where it does not belong - they would want you to access it. I'm going to show you; Why you should do this. How to do it. How little YOU will actually have to do Common support advice. Common immediate advice covers emotive support areas, and it's invaluable to address these areas. They focus heavily on mental and emotional health, like express and release feelings; and don't pretend that it's OK when it's not. There's also much on how everyone deals with death differently; give yourself time to heal; know that it's OK to be messed up. Slightly more practical aspects include; join in rituals like Memorial services; preserve memories by planting a tree or do a charity run; join a support group; put down the drink. There are 3 things you must do in the first few days after someone dies; Get a medical certificate from a GP or hospital doctor. You'll need this to register the death. Register the Death within 5 days (8 days in Scotland). You'll then get the documents you need for the funeral. You can use a funeral director or arrange it yourself. After this there are a number of things to do, with lots of wearying detail, including telling the Government, and dealing with tax and benefits. The checklist grows further to include notifying banks and insurance companies; credit companies to prevent identity theft and such; any employer (and there may be an employer sponsored insurance plan too); utility and service providers. The Financial level BENEATH the Financial level. And now to where a surprising level of potential sums can lie - in your loved one's existing or old accounts. I'm talking about PPI and Investments. This is very important; is NOT a waste of time; and most of all is easy because the detailed work can be done for you. In short what we would need to be able to help you:- Your part is simple. It's as easy as calling or emailing ONCE, to start the process. VERY important; which is, that any PPI claim done NOW is worth so much MORE (hint; it's in the interest elements!) because of the time elapsed. Now, assuming most loved ones were older when they passed away, that means there is potential real and high value in these claims. 4 and 5 figure sums are not unusual, this includes when an investment is compensated. And finally regarding investments. Now, to be clear, what I'm NOT addressing about is accessing or 'cashing in' your loved one's investments - that will happen as part of the process of chasing through all aspects that form the Estate. What I AM addressing is when the investments have not been releasing what they should have (and don't worry, that's up to US to find out, not you). There can be STUNNING claims in this area. Obviously dependent on the circumstances, but tens and hundreds of £thousands are not unusual. If your loved one had ANY investments AT ALL, we want to hear about them. So there it is then. ONE call or email, and you can release sums that may be there, in your loved one's existing or old accounts and which, with interest added over the time elapsed, can be very valuable indeed. Your loved one would want YOU - NOT the bank - to receive those. LET'S GET THEM BACK!!!"
8,How to Become Rich with Online Work?,finance," People who lost money due to their own ignorance often tell others about the ‘dark side’ of Forex. But these things are not truthful at all, and the reality can argue with false myths. Still, some impressive newbies believe everything they hear. In this article, Justforex team will reveal all secrets and myths about Forex to you and tell whether they are true or false. ‘Forex is scam/gambling/pyramid’. We bet this myth won’t die even if one more hundred of years will pass. If you are a newbie, you’ll hear that Forex is like a big casino for approximately a million of times. In fact, trading on Forex is more serious than gambling. It’s just a market like any other one, food or property market. At the same time, many scammers came here to cheat people, that’s why this myth appeared. It’s not a pyramid either, because pyramids don’t require any logic and experience. In Forex these things have paramount importance and you just won’t be able to make money without them. ‘Choose: Forex or your job’. Many people consider that you’ll have to be glued to your monitor waiting for a signal to open a trade. Fortunately, it’s just a myth, and you can easily combine your job and trading on the Forex market. This legend appeared because of short-term trading. It really requires maximum concentration of a trader. But deals usually are too short, up to 10 minutes. If you are a long-term trader, you’ll need just 5-10 minutes for checking your transactions. Remember that it’s no guarantee that 24-hours trading will make you profitable. Statistics says that 90% of traders combine their work and Forex successfully. ‘Any broker wants to deceive a client’. Though there are really some scam brokers on the market, not all companies want to deceive a client to have some little one-time profit. The benefits of such an approach are unpleasant and small. If you have some issue, you can send a complaint to the regulatory authority. Here is a short list of regulators: Belize - International Financial Services Commission (IFSC) China	- China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Hong Kong - Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) India - Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Indonesia - Commodity Futures Trade Regulatory Agency (CoFTRA) Latvia	- The Financial and Capital Market Commission (FKTK) Malaysia - Securities Commission (SC) Russia - National Association Of Securities Market Participants (NAUFOR) Switzerland - Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) The UK - Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), National Futures Association (NFA) Note that obtaining a license is not cheap ($20 million without clients’ deposits). It’s unlikely that any broker wants to lose these money and the whole business. Moreover, profitable traders bring profit to the broker (they are commissions and spreads). That’s why many licensed companies try to develop long and high-quality partnership with their clients."
9,5 Tips On How to Avoid Scammers This Upcoming Tax Season,finance," Tax season is right around the corner, and many Americans don’t exactly look forward to this time of year.

Routinely change the passwords for all Internet accounts. Be able to spot scams Often times, criminals will try and impersonate banks, credit card companies, even the IRS to steal personal data. Learn to recognize and avoid fake emails and texts. It’s important to know that the IRS will not call threatening an individual with a lawsuit, arrest or to demand an immediate tax payment. The normal correspondence will be a letter in the mail. Be aware of threatening phone calls from the IRS. Get an IP PIN An IP PIN is a unique six-digit number that is often used when filing a tax return online. This number is used to ensure the safety and protection of individuals who file returns. It is a number that should never be given out freely and only used when prompted by the IRS. Each year, the IRS should send a letter in the mail with a new IP PIN. File taxes early and know tax filling merchants Filing taxes sooner than later is a simple way to prevent scammers from filing under the applicant’s name. Not to mention, a refund (if there is one) will be received faster! When filing through a third party, ensure that business is an Authorized IRS e-File Provider. If filing through the web, check the web address. If the web address contains https, the site is secure to use. Report suspicious activity If there is any indication of an individual or business that is committing tax fraud, it is possible to report it. Visit IRS.gov and follow the instructions on ""How to Report Suspected Tax Fraud Activity."
10,Home Loan Programs: How Recent Medical School Graduates Can Qualify,finance," Graduation is an exciting time for any college graduate, but for those graduating medical school, the excitement is an understatement. For recent medical school graduates who are getting ready for new employment, the idea of looking for a home isn’t exactly easy. But with the help of loan programs specific for medical school graduates, the process becomes a little easier. In Utah, there are lenders ready to help medical school graduates in the country get the financing they need to purchase a home. Available Options Today there are mortgage programs tailored specifically for medical school graduates and physicians to meet the needs of doctors who are just starting out in their career.  A physician home loan is an excellent option for graduates to obtain a home mortgage. This program typically presents itself with a low down payment of 10 percent or less, with no private mortgage insurance required and 100 percent financing on certain loan amounts. Generally, physician home loans are offered with a 30-year fixed rate, or a five- or seven-year adjustable rate. Other options for physicians wanting to receive a home loan include: FHA loans, VA loans and conventional mortgages with different down payment rates. A conventional loan with 20 percent down may be a better alternative for home buyers as it offers more options and flexibility, though requires a large sum of money to be put down. Requirements Typically, a borrower will be required to provide an employment contract from your practice instead of pay stubs. This can be helpful to doctors who are relocating for their first job after graduation and want to be moved in prior to starting work. Some banks may also a borrower to set up a savings/checking account with their institution prior to creating the loan. One important aspect to remember about these loans is although they offer many advantages to medical school graduates, they also typically involve a higher interest rate, fees or points. Should I apply for a home loan during residency? It is advised to a student in a residency program to wait until the medical student’s program is finished before applying for a home loan because many residents will end up relocating after three to five years when their program finishes, leaving a significant amount of debt to be paid and a home to sell, if needed. As a medical school graduate, consider the several financing options available prior to purchasing a home of your own for you and your family."
11,VA Home Loan Programs: How Veterans in Need Can Benefit,finance," Whether serving or retired, many veterans struggle to find living situations for themselves and his or her family. But with the help of a lender, many of these veterans can benefit from the VA Loan program which provides veterans and his or her family the opportunity to purchase a home with little difficulty. These government-backed loans provide significant benefits and open the doors of homeownership to veterans who may be struggling to obtain the right financing. Here are some of the perks and benefits a VA home loan can provide: Now doesn’t that sound great? One of the biggest benefits a veteran can look forward to with a VA home loan is the fact he or she is not required to put down a down payment. Saving money and building credit can be a difficult task for anyone, especially to service men and women who are constantly moving. With the loan program, qualified borrowers can finance 100 percent of the home without putting down a down payment. Many lenders require those with a loan to purchase insurance that protects the lender in case of borrower default. This is known as private mortgage insurance (PMI) and is not required for those applying for a VA home loan. This is because the government finances and protects all VA home loans and assumes all of the risks on behalf of the military service man or woman in the event of borrower default. This is an added benefit for homeowners of the VA home loan program because this will allow him or her to build equity in the home, effectively saving thousands of dollars. The interest rates on VA home loans are strictly based on the fact the risk assumed by the bank to finance the loan. These financial institutions face less risk and offer interest rates that are generally less than 1 percent than conventional home loan interest rates. This is because the VA backs each home loan, guaranteed. For example, if a military family qualified for a reduction of 1% and qualified for a $350,000 loan, the average savings would near $34,000. With just a few of these benefits listed, many veterans don’t have to worry about constantly making payments. If a veteran has the money necessary to pay the home off faster, he or she won’t have to worry about being charged penalties or fees. Borrowers are free to then consider future home purchases and refinancing options."

Another benefit of financing is the fact that a payment schedule will be flexible. This can be a relief to business owners who are working to replace old equipment and still need to run the business. And depending on the loan, many lenders will offer options ranging from monthly to biannual payments. Remember, it is vital to speak and work with the lender on the equipment loan to find out what will work best for the business needs."
13,How to get the most out of your credit card,finance," Credit cards – they’re convenient and they’re safer than carrying a lot of cash around. Even better, when used the right way, they can save you time and money or get you out of a tight spot in an emergency. Of course, we’ve all heard the horror stories too – people buying things they don’t need and getting buried in a pile of debt, and fraudsters that cheat you out of all your money – but with a bit of care, you can stay safe and still benefit from credit and deals. Try these easy ways to get the most out of your card. Choose carefully When you pick a card, select the one that gives you the best offers for your lifestyle. Most providers will offer more than one card, so check out the limits and the features of each before you settle for one. Always, always read the fine print. It can be boring, but it tells you everything you need to know about your card. Compare fees, interest rates, warranties, purchase protection, insurance, travel insurance, and so on, before you commit, and never be afraid to ask questions.  Even after you make your choice, don’t forget to stay informed and keep an eye on your interest rate. You might have chosen a card with an awesome introductory offer, but that doesn’t mean it’ll always stay that way. Switch to a new card if the one you have doesn’t give you the best deals and features or fit your lifestyle. Spend smart Get to know your card even better than you know your favourite lines from movies. Figure out all the offers and fees and make note of your interest-free period and billing cycle so you don’t spend unnecessarily. If you buy things closer to the beginning of the cycle, then you’re making the best use of it, because you have a longer period till you have to pay. If you need to make an immediate payment that can be claimed through insurance later, for example, manage timing, and you could essentially not be paying anything. Make sure you pay your bill fully and on time, rather than paying the minimum charges. It’s easy to put it off, and paying as little as you can is tempting, but then you have to pay interest, which can add up faster than you’d think. The best way to pay on time is by setting up a standing order so it gets paid without you thinking too much about it. Make use of credit card promotions -  that’s what they’re there for. Sometimes this could mean choosing to shop at a place that gives you better deals. Or becoming eligible for discounts by planning your buying so that you buy more at once rather than smaller amounts more frequently. This is where your early research comes in handy - be sure to pick a card that offers discounts that suit you. Check your subscriptions regularly too, to make sure you’re not paying for things you don’t use. Say no to cash withdrawals Watch out for interest on cash withdrawals. Depending on your terms, unlike for purchases, it may be charged immediately. There may also be a fee associated. Don’t forget to check what counts as withdrawals. E.g. buying traveller’s cheques and sometimes even electronic fund transfers. Guard your card Keep your visa card safe and use trusted sites for purchases. Keep an eye on your bill, either through internet banking or SMS alerts. It’s not just fraud that you should check for, but sometimes genuine errors too. Speak to your credit card provider and the shop if it seems like you’ve been charged extra. Protect your credit rating Missed payments and defaults affect your credit rating. Keep in mind that a good credit history means you can borrow more if you need it. Even with a credit card, plan your spending, because it can’t fix everything. If it looks like you aren’t going to be able to pay, speak to your bank or credit card company before it becomes a problem, and they will help you work things out. After all, when you use your credit card better, it’s better for everyone."
14,How To Get Your Solar Energy Tax Credit,finance," There are a lot of good reasons to go solar for your home or business. Many Bay Area homeowners have a solar system installed to protect themselves and their families against rising energy rates. While it is difficult to forecast exactly how much electricity costs will rise, or how quickly, one thing is certain - they will continue to go up. Conversely, an investment in solar for your home or business not only decreases or even entirely eliminate monthly electricity costs, it can also increase the property value of a home and lower the operating costs of a business. A third and very important financial incentive is the federal government's generous solar energy tax credit. The solar energy tax credit allows a homeowner to reduce the amount of income tax that they would otherwise have to pay the federal government. This credit is good for 30 percent of homeowner's investment in their solar system, including solar panels, a charge converter, battery, and inverter, but only for the next three years. The credit will drop to 26 percent in 2020, and 22 percent in 2021. After 2021, the solar energy tax credit for residential customers will be eliminated entirely. While there is a chance the credit could be extended, many homeowners considering solar are planning to install their systems within the next few years to take advantage of the credit. For commercial businesses looking to go more green, they can qualify for up to 70% off with solar tax incentives. Not only will you qualify for a 30% Federal Tax Credit but you can accelerate the depreciation of your solar system over 5 short years. These tax incentives are equivalent to 60%-70% of the system cost, leaving you needing only 3-4 years of energy savings to recover your entire investment. In addition to the financial benefits of the solar energy tax credit, many people choose to go solar because they feel solar energy is a more environmentally responsible solution. Solar energy is both sustainable and renewable. Solar energy provides a zero-emission way to power buildings, and appliances, heat water, and refuel electric vehicles. The more popular and widespread that rooftop or carport solar panels become, the more they reduce the load on coal-burning power plants. With buildings accounting for 38 percent of all carbon emissions in the U.S., going solar can significantly decrease our carbon footprint. A typical residential solar panel system will eliminate three to four tons of carbon emissions each year-the equivalent of planting over 100 trees annually. Going solar is not only a great way to go green, but taking advantage of the solar energy tax credit - before it expires - is a great way to save some green."
15,An Overview of Seller Financing,finance," An Overview of Seller Financing Author: Al Fialkovich, Managing Director of Transworld Business Advisors Published: March 15th, 2017 Almost 90% of business owners have never sold a business before. So if you are at the start of your research on how to sell your business and haven’t got a clue where to start, likely you are not alone. One of the many terms thrown around in discussions surrounding business acquisitions or business sales is seller financing. This term is one that almost immediately solicits a negative reaction from most sellers, but it should not be feared! It should be learned and understood as a tool to help sell your business. The majority of businesses that sell today include some percentage of owner financing. With a rejection rate of about 80%, the SBA application process is often not an option for many businesses and buyers. Businesses that advertise seller financing along with their sale generate significantly more inquiries as well as a 15% higher sale price (estimation provided by Bizbuysell.com). There are many benefits, as well as some risk, to seller financing, so it is important that both the buyer and seller feel comfortable in the transaction. In the following discussion, I will address common questions related to the subject of seller financing in hopes of opening up the discussion for future sellers and their buyers. What is Seller Financing? Seller financing is a loan provided by the current owner of a business to the new owner of said business. Why Seller Financing? Buyers negotiate seller financing for a number of reasons. First, they may be unable to afford the business at the full asking price. Second, the business transaction, as is, will not qualify for a traditional loan. Finally, there may be a level of uncertainty that the business will continue to be successful without the previous owner at its helm. So an owner’s willingness to finance a portion of the sale often gives that business an edge over the competition, by removing some of the buyer’s uncertainty. How is the Seller Protected? It is important for a seller financed transaction to be handled by professionals who can offer advice and construct documents that protect both the buyer’s and seller’s interests. Typically, a promissory note is drawn up that illustrates the details of the agreement. This note includes the recourse that the seller can take if a buyer defaults on the note. In the sale of a small business, the most likely scenario is that the seller would have the right to take their previously owned business back into their possession. Additional recourse avenues could be using the assets of the business as collateral or using a personal guarantee from the buyer. Utilizing a professional advisor to construct the terms of the promissory note will ensure that recourse actions are well structured. What Other Terms Are Outlined in the Promissory Note? The terms of the note are constructed in order to give the buyer adequate time to repay the note. Payments must be in an amount that the buyer can afford from the business income while continuing to run the business at an optimal level. The last thing either party wants is for the loan terms to constrict the buyer and eventually put them out of business. For this reason, the term length of seller financing varies depending on factors including: size of the loan, revenue of the business and the capital investment of the buyer. The interest rate charged on a seller financing note is typically in line with current banking rates.

17,The Southbourne Tax Group: 10 Ways to Identify Accounts Payable Fraud,finance," When Sarbanes-Oxley was passed in 2002, many companies were forced to take an in-depth look at internal Accounts Payable controls. Implementing internal controls takes time, but may prove to be a very cost-effective measure if any fraud or leakages are found. Here are a few approaches you can try to tighten up your A/P audit. They require some degree of data mining and programming capability but are fairly straightforward to implement. Duplicate payments in most cases may not be fraud-related, but continue to be a significant A/P leakage that is both preventable and recoverable. Mark Van Holsbeck, Director of Enterprise Network Security for Avery-Dennison, estimates that corporations make duplicate payments at the rate of 2%. Two percent may not sound like much, but if your company’s A/P invoices total $75 million, duplicate payments may account for $1.5 million. Take a look at the statistics: Medicare - The Dept of Health & Human Services’ Inspector General estimated that Medicare made $89 million of duplicate payments in 1998. Cingular - We have once again discovered that payments made online as an Electronic funds payment for TDMA accounts, have been deducted twice from the customer's checking account. Medicaid - We identified at least $9.7 million in such duplicate payments during our two-year audit period, and estimated that as much as $31.1 million in additional duplicate payments may have been made."" In a rush to find the overpayments, many companies have emerged: A/P Recap, Automated Auditors, AP Recovery, ACL, Cost Recovery Solutions, and more. That these companies are thriving is a testament to the fact that duplicate payments still occur at an alarming rate. Many software packages have some controls over duplicate invoices but it usually takes some in-depth querying to find them all. For example, many accounting packages do a duplicate invoice check and prevent you from keying in a duplicate invoice number for the same vendor. But just add an ""A"" to the invoice number or change a penny and you are on your way to a duplicate payment. Another common mistake is found in vendor files; duplicate vendor numbers for the same vendor is the number one cause of duplicate payments. A programmer in your IT department will be able to help you with the SQL code for these joins.  The SQL code will look something like this to create the first report ""EEEE"": CREATE TABLE DUPES_EEEE AS SELECT A.* FROM   INVOICES A, INVOICES B WHERE  A.VENDORID=B.VENDORID AND A.INVOICENUM=B.INVOICENUM AND A.INVOICEDATE=B.INVOICEDATE AND A.INVOICEAMT=B.INVOICEAMT AND A.ID  B.ID The ID field should be a unique record identifier to distinguish one record from another.  In Microsoft Access, these fields are usually created by using the data type ""AutoNumber"".  In open code, a field such as this can be easily created using a counter and incrementing it by 1 for every record (COUNTER = COUNTER + 1). Implementing ""similar"" fuzzy-matching instead of exact matching is what makes this approach more accurate and powerful than many.  We define ""similar"" to mean the following: Invoice numbers are considered similar if they are exact after stripping out any zeros and any alphabetic characters as well as punctuation characters. Invoice dates are considered similar if the difference between the dates is less than a designated amount such as 7 days.  For example, if you entered ""7"" days for the date tolerance, then all invoices with a date different of 7 or less would be considered similar.  We generally set the date tolerance to 21 days to catch duplicate payments made 3 weeks apart; this often eliminates catching legitimate rent payments. Amounts are considered similar if they meet one of three criteria: the amounts are 5% +/- the other amount one amount is exactly twice as much as the other, i.e.  $220.15 and $440.30 the amounts start with the same first 4 digits, i.e. $123.45 and $1,234.55 Try using similar matching on the invoice number, date, and amount fields when you conduct your next duplicate payment audit – your reports will be shorter and more accurate! What is it? Benford's Law (which was first mentioned in 1881 by the astronomer Simon Newcomb) states that if we randomly select a number from a table of physical constants or statistical data, the probability that the first digit will be a ""1"" is about 0.301, rather than 0.1 as we might expect if all digits were equally likely. In general, the ""law"" says that the probability of the first digit being a ""d"" is Where ln refers to the natural log (base e).  This numerical phenomenon was published by Newcomb in a paper entitled ""Note on the Frequency of Use of the Different Digits in Natural Numbers"", which appeared in The American Journal of Mathematics (1881) 4, 39-40. It was re-discovered by Benford in 1938, and he published an article called ""The Law of Anomalous Numbers"" in Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc 78, pp 551-72. [1] You can actually re-create this function in Excel quite easily.  In one column, type 1, 2, 3, through 9, making 9 rows in cells A1 through A9.  In the second column, cell B1, type the function ""=ln(1 + 1/A1) / ln(10)"" and copy this function for cells B2 through B9 and it will create the probabilities. How is it used to identify fraud? If we know the normal frequency of digits, then we can identify digit frequencies that violate that normal behavior.  For example, Benford concluded that, out of a group of numbers, the first digit will be ""1"" about 30% of the time.  Similarly, using the same function, we can expect the first digit to be ""8"" about 5.1% of the time.  Expected frequencies for each first-digit of the invoice amount are shown in the graph below: If we review Accounts Payable invoices and determine the first digit of the invoices is ""8"" 50% of the time, then we may have either many legitimate payments that start with ""8""; or we may have fictitious invoice amounts.  Fraudsters will often create an amount that starts with a higher number, like 8 or 9, not knowing that auditors are now equipped to identify these abnormal payments. People who commit fraud often create invoices with rounded amounts, which are invoices without pennies.  Yes, you would think the fraudster would have ""cents"" enough to do otherwise.  An easy way to identify rounded-amount invoices is to use the MOD function in Excel.  Suppose your invoice amount is $150.17; then MOD(150.17,1) gives you the remainder of dividing 150.17 by 1, which is .17.  So, using the MOD function with a divisor of 1 on a no-pennies amount would leave us a remainder of 0.  Additionally, try to rank your vendors by those with a high percentage of rounded-amount invoices.  To do this, just calculate each vendors’ number of rounded-amount invoices and divide it by the total number of invoices for that vendor, obtaining the percentage.  Then rank by descending percentage to review the most suspicious vendors first. People who commit fraud are not always the ""sharpest knife in the drawer.""  Suppose an A/P clerk knows the different dollar thresholds for management approval.  For example, a supervisor may only be allowed to approve invoices of $3,000 or less, while a manager may be allowed to approve invoices of $10,000 or less, and so on.  Suppose this A/P clerk and a manager decide to skim off some extra dollars together.  What is the easiest way to get the most money?  Create an invoice just below the approval level of that manager:  $9,998 when the approval level is $10,000; or $2,978 when the approval level is $3,000. To identify these potentially fraudulent invoices, try this:  identify invoices that are 3% (or less) LESS THAN the approval amount.  For example, if your approval amount is $3,000, then any invoice that is between $2,910 and $2,999 would be flagged as suspicious. Most Accounts Payable departments conduct a reconciliation of Accounts Payable with the monthly Bank Statement to identify any discrepancies between the two.  This process can also be instrumental in identifying check fraud.  One simple way to spot potential check fraud is to identify missing check numbers or gaps in reconciled checks numbers.  This is usually indicated on the bank statement with a ‘*"" or ‘#’ to indicate the check number is not sequential. Another more advanced way is to conduct a reverse Positive Pay electronically.  By merging your check register, A/P file, and bank statements together, you have the power to identify stolen checks.  Better yet, if your bank has OCR (Optical Character Recognition) abilities, then you can identify the actual payee on the check. Speaking in technological terms, you have 3 different data bases describing 1 activity.  Use the 3 data sources to find any discrepancies in the 1 payment.  If your check numbers are unique, try merging all 3 data sources by the check number and compare each of the following fields: -payee -check amount -check date Using SQL code or another programming language, identify all of the checks that are in one data base and not the other.  In addition, identify all of the checks that are in all 3 data sources but have different payee names or different amounts and dates. Monitoring vendor invoice volume is one way to alert you to abnormal behavior.  Rapid invoice volume increases may indicate a legitimate increase in business, but also may indicate that a fraudster has become more confident in stealing money.  Either way, the increase may warrant further investigation.  Suppose a vendor has 2 invoices one month and 70 the next – you may want to know why even if the reason is not a fraudulent one. To calculate the percent increase in invoice volume from month to next month, find the difference in number of invoices and then divide by the number of invoices in the first month.  In our example, going from 2 invoices to 70, the difference (68) divided by the number of invoices in the first month (2) represents a 3,400% increase.  Setting the threshold percentage is the key here; when doing audits, we like to set the threshold percentage at 300% or higher.  Setting the threshold at 300% will catch increases from 3 to 13, which may not be interesting, so you may also want to set a minimum number of records that you are interested in, such as 50 as your second month’s number of invoices.  Setting the threshold at 300% will also catch more interesting increases, such as 50 to 220. Cancelled and returned checks do occur in the course of a normal Accounts Payable month.  What is more uncommon is a vendor with many cancelled checks or a regular pattern of cancelled checks.  Cancelled checks are usually legitimate transactions; however, a cancelled check can be returned to the wrong hands and re-written to the fraudster.  Below is a true story of how a clerk turned a returned check into a fraudulent one: ""An uncashed disbursement check was returned to an accounts payable clerk for disposition because she originated the invoice entry. The clerk put the check in her desk and forgot about it for several months. Upon cleaning her desk, she discovered the returned check. When she checked the paid history, she realized the supplier had returned the check when it was determined to be a duplicate payment of an invoice. She also noticed that the payee name had been printed slightly below ""Payee"" on the check. With a bit of effort she managed to align the check and insert her name above the original payee in a print similar to the original, along with an ""or"" designation following her name. The fraud was caught by an accounts payable auditor searching for duplicate payments and who was asked by the supplier to furnish proof of duplicate payments by providing copies of both cancelled checks. "" This algorithm is easy to implement.  Calculate the number of cancelled or returned checks for each vendor and divide by the total number of checks for that vendor.  Then, sort this list by descending percent so that your most suspicious vendors are at the top of the report This algorithm identifies invoices that are way above average for a particular vendor.  Suppose a vendor normally has invoices ranging from $1,000 to $3,000; suddenly an invoice shows up for $25,000.  You may want to investigate this abnormality and can do so using this alert pattern. This algorithm is also easy to implement:  For each vendor, calculate the average and standard deviation of the invoice amount.  Then, calculate a z-score for each invoice amount z-score  = (invoice amount – average amount) / standard deviation Then, flag all vendors with a z-score above 2.5, indicating the payment is more than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean.  If your report is still too large, try increasing the z-score threshold to 3.0 or higher. Using this algorithm alone, we were able to catch employee fraud occurring in a mid-size health manufacturing company.  The fraudulent employee was receiving a paycheck every other week in the amount of $500 to $1,000 when, all of the sudden, 3 invoices for $40,000 each appeared.  Because $40,000 was significantly greater than this employee’s average payment, the payments were flagged for further research.  What made the invoices even more suspect was that they occurred on or near the same date and had no invoice number.  After alerting the new controller of the suspect payments, the new controller was aware that an employee had left in a legal ""scuffle"" but was not aware of the $40,000 checks that were stolen. ""Trust but verify"".  Most employees are generally trustworthy!  But it does not hurt to conduct some data mining to make sure they are.  Here is a simple approach to cross-check your vendor and employee files to see if perhaps an employee has set up a fictitious vendor. Try merging your vendor file and employee file by the following variables: Address Tax ID Number Phone Number Bank Routing Number If you have a good programmer, try doing some fuzzy-matching on these fields as well.  For address, try extracting JUST THE NUMBERS in the street plus the zip code, and then compare these numbers.  This eliminates matching on noise words such as ""Drive"" and ""Suite"". Also, try doing some fuzzy-matching on tax ID number as well, just in case there was a typo in the data entry.  If you specify that the tax IDs are equal if they are even 1 digit off, you may catch a vendor/employee ring! This algorithm made it possible to detect a real employee (""Kathy"") whose SSN was the same as a company EIN (tax ID number).  The company name, which we will call ""ABC Inc"", happened to be on the same street, city, and state as a person with the same last name as the employee (presumably her spouse).  Without this pattern, the employee fraud may have gone undetected. This algorithm compares vendor addresses with mail-box drop address such as ""Mail Boxes, Etc"".  Some fraudsters will use mail drops as their address instead of a P.O. Box, to hide their fraudulent activity.  Not all of the vendors appearing on this list will be fraudulent, because a vendor may in fact be right next to a Mail Boxes, Etc.  However, the list provides a unique approach to reviewing vendors who also may show up on another alert list. (To obtain a copy of the mail-drop table, contact the author of this document).  Or, if you have time, you can also search for Mail Boxes, Etc. on www.411.com and put the addresses in a database and then conduct your address matching accordingly. Summary Occupational fraud is a growing problem.  In fact, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) estimates that 5% of all revenue is lost to occupational fraud every year.  Fraud is not 100%preventable but there ARE steps you can take to both prevent and detect fraud on an ongoing basis.  At a minimum, scan for duplicate payments every 6 months, and perform an annual cross-check between your vendor file and employee file.  With these two steps alone, you may be able to pinpoint leakages that otherwise may go unnoticed. About the Author Christine L.

18,The Southbourne Tax Group: 20 Ways You Can Detect Fraud,finance," Here is a list of items to help you detect fraud in your company or a client's company. The perpetrator will often display unusual behavior, that when taken as a whole is a strong indicator of fraud. The fraudster may not ever take a vacation or call in sick in fear of being caught. He or she may not assign out work even when overloaded. Other symptoms may be changes in behavior such as increased drinking, smoking, defensiveness, and unusual irritability and suspiciousness. Frequently tips or complaints will be received which indicate that a fraudulent action is going on. Complaints have been known to be some of the best sources of fraud and should be taken seriously. Although all too often, the motives of the complainant may be suspect, the allegations usually have merit that warrant further investigation. In bank reconciliations, deposits or checks not included in the reconciliation could be indicative of theft. Missing deposits could mean the perpetrator absconded with the funds; missing checks could indicate one made out to a bogus payee. Voided sales slips could mean that the sale was rung up, the payment diverted to the use of the perpetrator, and the sales slip subsequently voided to cover the theft. Documents which are unable to be located can be a red flag for fraud. Although it is expected that some documents will be misplaced, the auditor should look for explanations as to why the documents are missing, and what steps were taken to locate the requested items. All too often, the auditors will select an alternate item or allow the auditee to select an alternate without determining whether or not a problem exists. Similar to excessive voids, this technique can be used to cover the theft of cash. A credit memo to a phony customer is written out, and the cash is taken to make total cash balance. Sales employees frequently make bogus refunds to customers for merchandise. The address shown for the refund is then made to the employee's address, or to the address of a friend or co-worker. Stolen deposits, or bogus checks written, are frequently not removed, or covered, from the reconciliation. Hence, over a period of time, the reconciling items tend to increase. When funds, merchandise, or assets are stolen and not covered by a fictitious entry, the general ledger will be out of balance. An inventory of the merchandise or cash is needed to confirm the existence of the missing assets. In cases where customer payments are misappropriated, adjustments to receivables can be made to cover the shortage. Where payables are adjusted, the perpetrator can use a phony billing scheme to convert cash to his or her own use. Excess purchases can be used to cover fraud in two ways: Fictitious payees are used to convert funds. Excessive purchases may indicate a possible payoff of purchasing agent. Duplicate payments are sometimes converted to the use of an employee. The employee may notice the duplicate payment, then he or she may prepare a phony endorsement of the check. Ghost employee schemes are frequently uncovered when an auditor, fraud examiner, or other individual distributes paychecks to employees. Missing or otherwise unaccounted for employees could indicate the existence of a ghost employee scheme. Employees frequently conceal fraud in their individual expense account reimbursements. These reimbursements should be scrutinized for reasonableness and trends, especially in the area of cash transactions on the expense account. Normal shrinkage over a period of time can be computed through historical analysis. Excessive shrinkage could explain a host of fraudulent activity, from embezzlement to theft of inventory. In the manufacturing process, an increased amount of scrap could indicate a scheme to steal and resell this material. Scrap is a favorite target of embezzlers because it is usually subject to less scrutiny than regular inventory. Excessively large payments to individuals may indicate instances of fraudulent disbursements. Employees being paid for overtime hours not worked by altering time sheets before or after management approval. Comparing the write-off of receivables by customers may lead to information indicating that the employee has absconded with customer payments. In instances where merchandise is shipped to a post office box, this may indicate that an employee is shipping to a bogus purchaser."

The premise of thumb is that you should invest only extra money or small amounts that do not affect your daily economy. Financially, it is not advisable to risk more than you are willing to lose. How to start investing? If you have enough money in your savings account cash to cover you for six months, then you can invest long term and larger - scale objectives. Instead, when you generate a lower savings it is necessary that you evaluate how willing are you to lose part of it. The goals will be less ambitious so as not to lose the stability of your savings. The return or return is directly linked to the level of risk involved in an investment. If you aim to get a high return, then the risk will be higher than if you decide to start small. The choice will depend on the goal you want to achieve. Is different investing money to pay your studies to invest to afford a trip. As a result of your goal, you can take more or less risk. Make sure you narrow your target to see how much you might lose. The investment involves an expense because it requires time. The banks and savings plans charge fees for the provision of services, like any other company. Should find out which costs the system implies that selected to invest, so you ensure that a flaw in the plan does not end with the return you were going to receive. Take advice about the different plans and your bank accounts offered to establish what fits your goals but mainly, your economic reality. Remember that the investment starts from extra money, not from a need. Usually an instant access cash account does not involve big changes in your economy and you can withdraw the money when you want it, so it is considered a safe investment if you have the perseverance necessary. Study your salary in relation to your daily expenses to analyze if you are able to set aside a small sum each month. For example, analyzes whether to save 3% of your salary implies economic obstacles in your day to day. Being consequent you will get a snowball in a few months - small proportions that become a considerable sum - and perhaps you have managed a better administration that allows you to increase some percentage point of savings. Of course, the higher your income, the higher the percentage you can invest. Where investments give the expected results, even in small amounts, it is generated the temptation to withdraw money from the system in which it was placed to achieve profitability. Be firm with your decision and avoid using the invested money for other purposes, at least for a considerable time to not affect the growth we are experiencing. The lack of immediate results frustrates first -time investors who want to see its evolution in the short term. The investments require a long time to achieve significant consequences and also a great deal of perseverance. So do not incursions into the world of financial profitability if you lack patience and perseverance. It make contributions with a set frequency, it will help you achieve the consistency needed to accumulate money slowly. In addition, it is essential to follow the direction of your initial goals. Maintaining sound decisions instead of permanently changing your goals is the key to ensuring your resources increase as much as possible. Using money that you do not physically own to start your investment can generate the opposite effect. And the potential increase in your resources will become a debt. Any investment has an element of uncertainty, so study your resources and find out the available mechanisms. Distributed among different products and asset classes money you want to invest. In this way, if an investment does not yield the expected results you will always have a plan B. "
20,Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identify Levels of Overbought and Oversold Market Conditions,finance," The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a platform based trading indicator that looks at both volume and price momentum when gauging the velocity of a financial instrument.  Regardless of being oversold or overbought, any market condition can be analyzed using the Relative Strength Index.  This is accomplished by calculating a financial instrument’s momentum of losses and gains during a predetermined period of time (typically 14 days). Overbought Relative Strength Index Level The Relative Strength Index level used most frequently on trading platforms to decide on an action based on an overbought reading is 70. •	If a Relative Strength Index reading of 70 or greater occurs, you may want to consider selling the financial instrument in the near future as trader interest might be too great to stay in the trade •	Additionally, if a Relative Strength Index reading of 70 or greater occurs, you may want to consider setting a sell stop order on your online trading platform to either leave a position or enter a short position Oversold Relative Strength Index Level The Relative Strength Index level used most frequently on trading platforms to decide on an action based on an oversold reading is 30. •	If a Relative Strength Index reading of 30 or less occurs, you may want to consider buying the financial instrument in the near future as it may be under bought •	If a Relative Strength Index reading of 30 or less occurs, you may want to consider setting an automated trading buy order so that your trading platform can automatically enter you into the position The Relative Strength Index may be used along other trading indicators.  The use of another day trading indicator with the RSI provides traders with an additional layer of clarification that a trade setup may be about to occur.  One example of this potential trade setup might be the RSI breaking the 30 threshold along with the financial instrument’s price action trend line breaching the lower Bollinger Band."

For instance, SIFs are able to invest in transferable securities, real estate, hedge funds or venture capital. A Special Investment Fund also benefits from a lighter supervision from authorities. Nevertheless, they are expected to set up a system dedicated to monitor and manage risks, to diversify their investments and to be structured in a way that prevents conflict of interest.

3,Winning Bidding Strategies – From The Tax Lien Lady,finance," Recently I went to a tax sale in New Jersey. It was a very small tax sale in a small rural borough. There were only 7 properties in the tax sale and I was able to get 2 liens at 10 and 12 percent. That’s not bad at all in today’s competitive tax sale environment in New Jersey. Usually at a tax sale like this I come away empty handed because I’m not willing to pay premium for small tax liens. Most of the liens in this sale (all but one) were under $600. In some states, local governments sell utility liens at the tax sale right along with the taxes. Anything that is paid to the local municipality can be sold as a tax lien at these tax sales. Most of these liens were for either water or sewer delinquencies. Only one lien included taxes along with delinquent sewer amounts and was just over $1700. All of the others were for either water or sewer amounts or both. The trend in the last couple of years in New Jersey has been to bid premium on these small utility liens. Investors are willing to pay premium on these liens in order to pay the subsequent taxes. But on small utility liens, you usually do not get to pay the subsequent tax payments, but only the subsequent sewer or water amounts which are much smaller than the tax amounts. Keep in mind that in New Jersey, the interest on the lien is first bid down to 0% before premium is bid. Although you do get your premium back if the lien is redeemed in 5 years, you do not get interest on the premium amount bid or on the lien amount. You do get a small penalty on the lien amount and the statutory interest rate (18% once the tax payer is $1500 delinquent and 8% on anything before that). What some tax lien funds have been willing to pay to get these small utility liens has gotten a little out of hand. In the last year I have seen them pay up to $1500 premium to get a small $200 or $300 lien. What that really amounts to is that they are making such a small blended return on their investment that it’s really not worth it at all; especially for the individual investor. So how was I able to buy 2 small liens at decent interest rates at the last tax sale I attended? First I went to a small sale that had only 15 liens on the original tax sale list and there were only 7 properties left on the list on the day of the sale. Secondly, there were no really big liens in this sale; the largest one was under $2000. Large liens bring out all the competition. Third, you’ve got to know when to stop bidding. I actually was a little lucky at this sale as there was only one other bidder representing a tax lien investing fund company. I bid on every lien except one, but I didn’t bid him down too far. If you don’t get greedy and insist on bidding every lien to your bottom line, then the other bidders might not bid every single lien down to their bottom line. The forth thing is that I was happy to get the crumbs from this sale. What I mean is that the 2 properties that I got liens on were the worst properties in the sale. One was bank owned and falling apart. It hadn’t been taken care of in years. You can see a picture of it on the cover of this issue. You can’t see it from the picture, but it also had junk piled up in the driveway and backyard and a dilapidated, falling down shed in the back. The other house was vacant and about to be foreclosed by the bank. It was also a very small house with no garage, in need of some TLC and a lot of updating. If I had decided not to bid on these properties because of their condition, I would have missed out on a couple of good liens, and the only liens that I would have been able to get. You have to be willing to take what the big boys don’t want or are willing to let go. These properties might be vacant and in terrible shape but they are still good liens. The bank is going to redeem them at some point, but probably not until they sell them which could take a long, long time. That will give me time to pay subsequent utility payments (remember these were small utility liens, add to my investment and make more interest!"
4,How To Tell If A Penny Stock Is Legit,finance," There’s no question about it penny stocks can bring home some of the biggest gains despite being in the gutter of Wall Street. But those tiny companies can also bring along quite a bit of risk. you’re investing in a business with serious profit potential or a scamster’s shell game. One of the biggest questions asked at on stock forums is: ""Can you tell me if XYZ Corp. is legit?"" And while we can’t give out personalized investment advice, we can give you the tools to determine whether you’re investing in a business with serious profit potential or a scamster’s shell game. For many investors, the idea that a stock could be representing itself incorrectly is unthinkable. After all, we’ve got the SEC, the exchanges – like NYSE and NASDAQ – and independent auditors taking a look at every filing that a company puts out to shareholders. But in the world of micro-cap stocks, many of those same protections just aren’t there. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission was created there have been countless scandals over the last couple of years have shown us that they simply doesn’t have the resources to make sure that the smallest companies are reporting accurately. Serious listing requirements for penny stocks ensure that shares trading on major exchanges are legitimate businesses, but for stocks that trade OTC or on the Pink Sheets, the requirements to get shares trading are slim to none. And while most investors think of audited financials as a safeguard that keeps a company’s financials accurate, many companies also aren’t required to get their books audited because of their size. If you’re thinking about investing in a penny stock that’s exempt from registering with the SEC might still be looking at a perfectly good investment… but you have to do your homework. Verify the Business The first step to determining whether a penny share is legitimate is to verify that the business exists and does what you think it does. You can start off by entering the stock’s ticker on a major financial site – like Google Finance – and checking out the description of the company. Those descriptions come from filings, so you can generally trust what they say since thanks to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it’s a felony for management to lie on company filings. Also, log onto the SEC’s website and look for company filings to get the full look at a company’s operations. And don’t forget to look at its ticker… an ""E"" at the end means that the company is delinquent in providing its regulatory filings – a very big red flag. For companies small enough to not report their financials, ask your broker for a copy of the company’s ""Rule 15c2-11 file"". In it, you’ll find a slew of information that the company was required to provide to prove their exempt status. Check the Auditor When you’re reading a company’s financials, look for the audit opinion (generally near the end of a 10-K annual report filing). It’s a statement from the independent auditors that explains the steps an auditor took to verify a company’s financials as well as whether the financials are accurate in their opinion. Checking who the auditor is makes a big difference too. Bernie Madoff’s ""independent"" auditor was neither – he trusted Madoff too, blindly signing off on the scamster’s financials and losing millions of his own in the process. Checking into the accountant’s CPA firm would have showed that it was a tiny storefront with only one CPA and without the manpower to audit a multi-billion dollar financial firm. Getting audited by one of the ""big four"" accounting firms – PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG, and Ernst & Young – is generally the domain of big blue chips that can afford to have prestigious accounting firms handle the audit, so don’t stress if the auditor’s name doesn’t look familiar. Take the time to research who the auditor is, though, and whether they’re qualified to handle a company audit. A quick Google search should solve that. Give Them a Call Hard-to-find contact information is another red flag that should be watched out for. Since most companies are constantly on the lookout for new business, their sales team should at least be easily accessible. If you have concerns about whether or not the company is legit, go ahead and call the phone number on their website. If you can’t find a number or address, check back on the SEC website – companies have to include their corporate contact information on the cover of all 10-K and 10-Q filings. New technology has also made it much easier to verify a business’s contact information. Just type in a company’s address into Google Maps, and select ""Street View"", and you can actually see the building where its offices are located. If the offices for a publicly traded stock are showing up as someone’s home or a mailbox rental store, be very wary of going forward. Follow the Money If you really want to know about a company, you have to follow the money – its customers… For any company that markets its products to consumers, a quick web search should give you an idea of how well – or poorly – the company is treating the people who use its services. Reading customer experiences will also give you an idea of whether or not people are jibing with the company’s offerings. Googling your way to customer experiences isn’t always an option, especially when a company caters to enterprise or government clients. In these cases, where more money is generally involved, lawsuits are more likely as a result of business disputes. Check an online legal database – like the U.S. PACER System – to see whether your potential microcap investment is being sued by customers. Check for Promotions It’s possible for a company to be legitimate while the news that ""independent parties"" are touting isn’t. These so called ""stock promoters"" are publishing faux research reports and stock recommendations in hopes that investors will catch on to the penny stocks they’re selling. They do this through websites and newsletters that seem legitimate on the surface, but are essentially nothing more than schemes to get people to buy these stocks. While we’ve never accepted money to write about any stock here at the Sleuth, some in the industry do… And believe it or not, it’s completely legal as far as the SEC is concerned. There are a few ways that you can tell whether a stock’s being pumped by a promoter. For starters, go to the horse’s mouth – check out StockPromoters.com – the site features a listing of which stocks are paying for which promoters, as well as what the promoters are getting in return. Promoters aren’t ashamed about what they do – they want companies to know how good they are at their jobs…that’s why they’re so easy to spot. More Homework, More Profits To be sure, doing the research is tough and time consuming. But it’s also the only way to be completely sure that the next penny stock play you’re putting your hard earned money on the line for is legit. Small stocks have some of the greatest gain potential out there – and if you know what to look for, you can make sure that you don’t get burned in the process of pursuing profits."

6,Diversification can Kill your Returns,finance," Diversification Can Cripple Your Returns Summary A method never talked about. Over trading now is an enemy. This method teaches control. You seldom ever hear this approach being discussed in the media. Why doesn't the media talk about a concentrated portfolio approach? The answer seems obvious. A portfolio made up of only a handful of equities doesn't promote trading. Brokerage firms are one of the largest advertisers within financial news networks. These are the folks that make trading for a living look so easy. The want you to trade trade trade! So it seems obvious why they wouldn't promote such a strategy that doesn't involve churn. Finance websites need clicks and advertising dollars to stay alive. The cost per click for terms related to stocks, brokers, and trading are very expensive. Terms such as ""best online stock broker"" are some of the most expensive searches on Google costing anywhere from $3.00 to $50.00 per click. So they have an interest in promoting active trading. So it should be no surprise this strategy gets no respect and even ridiculed by the media? The strategy I am speaking of has worked for many including our members. The only regret is not giving it a name long ago. We gave it a tagline called the ""12 Trades per Year Portfolio"". In hindsight maybe it should have been called 7 trades per year or 9 trades per year. You get the drift that we are having a hard time making it to 12 trades. What this is not. I am speaking of the elimination of over-trading. Over-Trading is an easy mistake to make. We have all been guilty. Boredom sometimes make us put on a trade we shouldn't. A financial guru talking about option activity in a stock is off the chart and a buyout could be in the works can cause a trade that shouldn't have been. The thing is you can fix this starting now. Just don't do it. Simple as that. Stop it and stop it now. If you do nothing else and stop this bad habit now you will see an immediate payoff. This isn't rocket science, it is basic self-control. Don't enter a trade without the full confidence risk reward on your side. Even then you will have your losers so don't compound it any longer by making too many trades. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously stated that diversification""is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing."" He is basically saying diversification is for the average. How to carry out this strategy. Stay in touch with the news flow. Keep yourself informed and wait. You are waiting for an event. What event? We don't know what we are waiting on but we know one is coming sooner or later. While you are waiting, exercise your throwing arm by making notes about stocks you think will rise or fall. For instance, if the news of the week is ""Gold is going to rise"", make a note of what you think will happen in the next week, month or year. Make notes of stocks and sectors you think are overvalued and undervalued. Try to find upcoming trends and what the media might be talking about in the next 3-6 months like we did with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). We were writing about it in March when it was trading at $32.00. This will start getting your throwing arm ready. Like in sports you are training. The more you do this the stronger you become. Without proper training, you are doomed to fail. Also, surround yourself with like-minded thinkers. Seek them out. You will eventually become a product of the people who surround you. Do this and when the ""event"" presents itself you will have the confidence to act. You will not be afraid to go into a position with size. The ""market"" is a big crybaby. I hate it when pundits treat the market like a person. The ""market"" wants this or that. The ""market"" wants rates to stay the same or wants a rate hike. Are you kidding me? These statements are coming from educated people! I want you to take notice how many times you hear someone in the financial media make a statement about the ""market"" as if it is a person. They speak of it as though the market is an all-knowing being. You listen to them enough and you would think the ""market"" is a 5-year-old child crying over candy! The ""market"" is made up of people. Guess what? People are driven by 2 main emotions.Fear and greed. Once you realize that fear and greed are the main drivers of this whole game, only then can you begin to see mispriced stocks due to these emotions. Once you get some time exercising under your belt you may then start the actual process of implementing this strategy. This is where the rubber meets the road. Proponents of efficient market hypothesis say that any new information relevant to a company's value is quickly priced by the market. This is the biggest load of bull dung ever sold to the investing public. If this is true how did I and a handful of friends make a small fortune by buying HealthSouth at .19-.40 cents and sell it not long afterwards for $6.00? Talking about a prime example of fear and greed! This was a classic case. Even though I did make the highest percentage return of my career on this play, I look back and think of how I should have bet bigger. I still get an occasional phone call from people who I shared the HealthSouth trade with say ""I wished I had followed you"" or ""I would have made a fortune had I listened"". That's the thing with investing, trading, speculating or whatever name you choose, you can almost always look back and see where you could have done better. The same holds true with life in general. Don't let those once in a lifetime events leave you on the sideline. Warning:This method can be boring. This is where it can get very boring. We wait. We wait and we wait more. We start thinking this should be called ""No Trades per Year"" because it is boring. We think the opportunity will never come. We wait more. But sooner or later it comes. A few recent examples. Sometimes it comes slow and gentle like the Oil trade alert on February 12, 2016. This play felt like it was in slow motion. Almost every talking head was saying $20.00 Oil was coming. To listen to the media that week the oil producers were going to start paying us to fill our vehicles because it cost too much for them to store it, and stupid low prices are here forever and there was nothing anyone could do. I will never forget thinking of the old simplistic saying ""Be buying when they crying and be selling when they yelling"". It just seemed so obvious. So United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA:USO) was the vehicle that was chosen to trade at $7.81. USO traded near $12.00 towards the end of May. It felt so easy. The United Rentals (NYSE:URI) buy in January at $46.60 didn't feel as obvious as the oil play when thinking about it in hindsight. United Rentals wasn't a media stock darling and seldom gets a mention. The alert went out while the conference call was taking place. The stock closed at $55.84 the day before and was down more than $10.00 on the earnings miss. This felt like a big overreaction. We knew there was no danger of a bankruptcy or any real liquidity issues. It was the classic case of a stock getting punished over a quarter to quarter miss. United Rentals traded at $49.46 only two sessions later and hit $51.08 five days afterward. Those that did sell around those price levels have nothing to be ashamed as it retreated to $43.34 on February 11. But those that stayed with URI are looking like a stock picking Rainman as $82.12 was the closing number on August 23. But guess what? We closed the position for the member alerts portfolio on April 27 at a price of $68.07 causing the portfolio to miss out on the next $14.00 of profit. Do you see how you can always look back and see how you could have done better? You can't get too caught up in what you missed but you can learn from the event. A ride with just 1000 shares turned $43,000 into $68,000. A percentage that is seldom achieved in a ultra-diversified portfolio. Holy Grail? This is not the Holy Grail. Is this method bullet proof? No. Is the risk higher? Depends on which academic pundit answers. I can say I like the chances of picking 5 stocks over a 12-24 month period than say picking 20-50 stocks. I like the odds better as I can control my risk even more by only entering stocks I feel confident. The risk level is up to the individual. You must have a mental disaster plan in place. In a highly focused portfolio, one should always have a proper escape plan. This can be accomplished with stops and/or by taking insurance on your play via options. Most common method is adding puts equal to the amount of shares you own. This gives you a known risk amount. Others may choose not buy insurance if the confidence level is high. It boils down to risk tolerance and personal preference. This method isn't for everyone. A person could choose to do this with only a small portion of their portfolio. But once you realize the ""market"" isn't an all-knowing entity and ""Fear and Greed"" plays a huge role in the ""markets"", you then become a better investor."

8,US Commercial Property vs other asset classes. Investable?,finance," With the world still coming to terms with a major reformulation of the political order in Europe, and preparing for what promise to be unpredictable electoral contests in Germany and the US – investors currently face an uncertain world. Increasingly frequent terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere are fuelling a rise in right-wing populism and protectionism that threatens to destabilise the global economic order. The confirmation of real estate mogul Donald Trump as candidate for the Republican Party in the US is a case in point, with Trump threatening to pull the US out of the World Trade Organisation in order to protect jobs in the US from the forces of globalisation. In Europe also, protectionist instincts will need to challenged as new trading arrangements are determined with the UK and negotiations continue around the troubled Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the US. The picture is not clear then, and there are many moving parts which look set to disrupt markets over the medium term. So where should investors looking to hedge against current uncertainty turn? Building confidence While there is much uncertainty, and while stock markets globally took a hit following Brexit and are watching developments nervously, recent data from leading investment house MSCI could give pause for thought for those who think the days of double-digit returns are over. A report issued by MSCI in February revealed that US commercial property funds in 2015 grew a staggering 15.6% according to the PREA/IPD US Quarterly Property Fund Index1. Even more remarkably, investments in US commercial property have seen a cumulative return of 129% over the past six years. In fact, US commercial property has outperformed other asset classes, including US bonds (up 4.39% over the period 2011 to 2015), stocks (up 13.45%), corporate bonds (up 4.72%) and commodities (down 10.93%)2. Simon Fairchild, an Executive Director at MSCI puts it like this; ""U.S. real estate open-end funds have produced double-digit returns for six straight years. This period encompasses the remarkable recovery from the doldrums of 2008/2009."" But Brexit happened, a Trump Presidency looks far less unlikely than it did at the beginning of the year and growth continues to slow in China – surely these themes will change the dynamic? A key skill for any investor is being able to recognise opportunity – even in times of uncertainty. Market watchers should note of recent announcements from Juwai – China’s biggest international property portal – which is reporting interest in UK property having climbed 40% since the Brexit vote. So, what is driving growth and interest, even against a backdrop of such uncertainty? Market fundamentals While uncertainty abounds, savvy investors realise that market fundamentals don’t change on the back of a single political development. And as in the UK, the fundamental forces at work in the US’ commercial property market create a sound environment for investors. Global pressures and uncertainty are likely to keep interest rates in the US low over the medium term, ensuring a steady flow of foreign money into the US economy. This in turn will continue to drive demand, and ensure good returns for those willing to invest in supplying this dynamic. One opportunity to do so are the investments from the Rycal Group, offering entry to the Carlton James Group who have an investment portfolio focused on the hospitality sector in the US. Carlton James been investing in this market for a while now, delivering returns averaging 17% for the last five years. With a strategy based upon wide-ranging geographical intelligence, Carlton James look also for additional Revenue Generators – for example taking into account a development’s proximity to highways, malls and economic infrastructure – as well as local economics. Simon Calton, CEO of the Carlton James Sky Watch Inn Group and Rycal Group, says: ""Geopolitical upheaval and changes of government have an immediate impact on share prices and investor confidence and can lead to rapid and unnerving market fluctuations. We saw this in the immediate aftermath of Brexit and we should expect more as November’s Presidential elections in the US draw nearer. ""What we have also seen in the subsequent weeks however, is these fluctuations correcting themselves as they adapt to the new reality. The lesson is that investors should keep an eye on the longer-term, and the market fundamentals. ""The US economy remains buoyant and, with the world unsure as to the status of relations between the UK and the EU, is likely to benefit from investors looking for a greater degree of certainty than is currently available in Europe. ""Rycal have a strong track record of making our investments work by developing detailed exit strategies, a diverse portfolio of properties and deep investment intelligence, and we expect Carlton James  to be a real source of growth over coming years."""
9,Insolvency law trends in Slovakia,finance," SECTION 1: PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES 1.1 What reorganisation and bankruptcy processes are available for financially troubled debtors? (How is the process commenced? Is insolvency necessary? Who controls the process and/or administers the estate (e.g. the debtor/existing management, the creditors, the court, a specially appointed mediator or supervisor)? What is its purpose?) The Slovak law provides for 2 particular processes available for the debtors in financial difficulties: bankruptcy and restructuring. Both proceedings are initiated solely upon the petition (proposal) and are dived into 2 phases. Bankruptcy is commenced upon declaration of bankruptcy by the court and is being preceded by so called bankruptcy proceeding (initial phase) where property of debtor ascertainment is carried out by trustee (in Slovak Republic: the administrator). On the other hand, restructuring is commenced upon its permit by the court and is being preceded by so called restructuring proceeding (initial phase) where evaluation of all prerequisites is executed by court. Should the debtor file a petition to bankruptcy declaration, its insolvency is presumed. A creditor is entitled to initiate a bankruptcy proceeding only should the debtor is insolvent, i.e. the debtor is unable to fulfil at least two monetary obligations to more than one creditor 30 days after their due date. Unlike in the bankruptcy where insolvency of the debtor is prerequisite, the process of restructuring may be carried out even if insolvency of the debtor is impending provided the process is recommended in a restructuring opinion and the maintenance of at least a substantial part of the operation of the debtor’s enterprise and higher degree of creditors satisfaction rather than in the bankruptcy may be reasonably expected. However, a creditor is authorized to initiate the restructuring only after debtor’s endorsement. The bankruptcy process is generally supervised by the bodies of creditors and the competent court while the estate of the debtor is administered by the trustee appointed by the court. On the other hand, within the restructuring, the administration of the debtor’s property is entrusted to existing management and control of the process is executed by the trustee through endorsement process subjected to supervision of the court. Conversion of all residual property of the debtor and its liquidation in order to ensure the highest possible satisfaction of the creditors is the main feature of bankruptcy. That is to say, bankruptcy is general collective execution (liquidation) of a debtor’s property. In contrast to bankruptcy, the maintenance of at least a considerable part of the operation of the debtor’s enterprise, the enforcement protection of the debtor, the prolongation of maturity of respective parts of debtor’s obligations and chiefly, the larger extent of the creditor satisfaction rather than in bankruptcy, are main aims of restructuring process. 1.2 Is a stay on creditor enforcement action available? (Are additional filings necessary? What does the stay prevent? Are there carve-outs, e.g. for financial collateral? How is the stay lifted? When does it expire?) Each and every already initiated enforcement proceeding towards property of the debtor is ex lege (by operation of law) terminated upon declaration of bankruptcy; therefore no additional filings are needed. There are no exceptions regarding aforesaid ban of enforcement. However, within initial phase of bankruptcy, i.e. within bankruptcy proceeding, are enforcement actions only suspended as opposed to bankruptcy where enforcement proceeding are terminated. This will equally apply to restructuring, where enforcement proceedings are only suspended and after permit of restructuring terminated. Should the bankruptcy is not declared or the restructuring is not permitted, already initiated enforcement proceedings are being resumed. A stay on creditor enforcement cannot be lifted and it expires upon termination of bankruptcy or restructuring. 1.3 What are the key features of a reorganisation plan and how is it approved? (Who proposes the plan? Is there a period of exclusivity? What are the voting requirements? Are creditors put into classes?) In general, a reorganization plan (in Slovak Republic: the restructuring plan) includes 2 main sections: the descriptive part and the binding part. It can be concluded that binding part of the restructuring plan is crucial, as it contains specification of all rights and obligations to be constituted, altered or expired with respect to participants of the restructuring plan (such as prolongation of maturity, partial expiration of the obligations, installments schedule). However, right of the creditor to contest legal acts curtailing creditor’s ascertained receivable is not affected. In the event that restructuring is initiated by a creditor, the trustee draws up and proposes the restructuring plan. If process initiated by the debtor, it is responsible for the restructuring plan submission. No period of exclusivity shall apply in Slovak law environment. In order to adopt the restructuring plan, certain voting requirements have to be met. A participant in the plan possess one vote for each euro of the ascertained receivable and the voting requirements stipulates whether votes per capita or votes counted according to the ascertained receivable are needed. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires that (1) each group for secured receivables votes for the plan adoption, (2) in each group for unsecured receivables, an absolute majority of voting creditors supported the plan (per capita) and concurrently their votes exceed a majority of votes of the voting creditors (per ascertained receivable), (3) in each group for proprietary rights of shareholders votes of an absolute majority (per ascertained receivable) vote for the plan approval, (4) an absolute majority of votes of present creditors (per ascertained receivable) votes for the plan adoption. The consent of debtor is required only if the debtor is natural person and restructuring plan is proposed by the trustee. The restructuring plan adopted by creditors on the approval meeting is furthermore subject to the court’s confirmation having possibility to either reject the plan on the grounds stipulated by law or confirm the plan and complete a formal process of the restructuring. The unregistered receivables subjected to restructuring or denied claims become unenforceable upon the court’s confirmation of plan. 1.4 Can a creditor or a class of creditor be ""crammed-down""? (Are there any creditor protections?) Restructuring: If the voting requirements for the plan adoption are not met, the submitter of the plan may demand substitution of approval within respective groups (classes) through decision of the court. However, there are few conditions to be fulfilled in order to demand aforesaid substitution of approval prescribed by law. The substitution of approval of an unsecured receivables group may not be awarded if creditors of the group obtain fulfillment in a period exceeding five years; this will not apply to so-called subordinated claims. All in all, even if a group (class) of creditor is ""crammed-down"" or outvoted, the plan may be confirmed by the court through substitution of its consent. Further, 50% of the ascertained claims will not cease to exist and the remaining part converts to other proprietary right. The debtor may not distribute profit between its members until receivables of unsecured creditors are not satisfied to the extent of 50% of their ascertained amount; this will not apply in relation to subordinated claims. Infringement of the debtor’s duty under previous sentence establishes inefficacy of the plan towards affected unsecured groups (classes). Bankruptcy: Unsecured receivables of related person, unsecured claim consisting of contractual penalty and receivables connected with the obligation of subordination are deemed as subordinated claims and are being satisfied from proceeds remaining after the full settlement of other unsecured receivables. 1.5 Is there a process for facilitating the sale of a distressed debtor’s assets or business? (Are credit-bidding or stalking horse bids allowed?) Within bankruptcy, the trustee usually draws up a sales plan of the debtor’s property. Moreover, any sale is subjected to authorization of the creditor body or the court; real estate may be realized only by auction and after expert opinion on its value is submitted. Credit-bidding or stalking horse bids are not allowed. Within framework of bankruptcy, a forfeiture of pledged property and blocking of other offers to buy property of the debtor are not allowed and the trustee is not bound by any contractual pre-emption rights. 1.6 What are the duties of directors of a company in financial difficulty? (Is special regard to be had to the creditors?) First of all, the debtor is obliged to prevent its insolvency and systematically monitor its financial situation as well as the status of its assets and obligations. If the insolvency is impending, the debtor is obliged to take appropriate measures to avert it without undue delay. The insolvent debtor is obliged to file petition on a bankruptcy declaration within 30 days of the day of ascertainment of its heavy indebtedness; otherwise statutory representatives of the debtor are obliged to pay in favour of a bankruptcy mass a sum in the amount of the debtor’s registered capital, but not exceeding double the minimum amount of a company’s registered capital stipulated by law. When assessing heavy indebtedness, so-called going concern value is taken into account and obligations are reduced by subordinated claims. 1.7 What priority claims are there and is protection available for post-petition credit? Receivables against assets (such as costs of property realisation, remuneration of the trustee, wages of employees, and expenses connected with proceeding) are priority claims within bankruptcy. Claims arisen during restructuring proceeding, labour receivables to which entitlement arose in month in which restructuring process was initiated, remuneration of the trustee and non-monetary receivables are priority claims within restructuring, not being affected by effects of restructuring proceeding. Aforesaid claims are claimable in full extent and not included in the restructuring plan, unless creditors grant consent thereto. The post-petition credit is not affected by the restructuring plan, if provided to the debtor after commencement of the restructuring proceeding. 1.8 Is there a different regime for banks and other financial institutions? No different regime is being applied for banks and other financial institution, if they are in position of unsecured creditor. SECTION 2: INTERNATIONAL/CROSS BORDER ISSUES 2.1 Can bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings be opened in respect of a foreign debtor? (Is there a particular test to determine jurisdiction?) EU perspective: Insolvency proceeding, i.e. bankruptcy or restructuring, may be opened in territory of Slovak Republic under the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (""Regulation""). If a center of main interests (""COMI"") of the debtor is situated in Slovak Republic, the main insolvency proceeding may be opened in Slovak Republic and is governed by Slovak law (lex fori concursus). Aforesaid main insolvency proceedings has extraterritorial effects and affects entire property of the debtor across the European Union (""EU""). The secondary insolvency proceeding may be opened in parallel with main insolvency proceeding provided such proceeding is initiated after commencement of the main proceeding and establishment of the debtor is situated in Slovak Republic. The secondary insolvency proceeding is governed by laws of Slovak Republic and its effects are limited only to the assets located in Slovak Republic. This shall not apply to restructuring which cannot be opened as the secondary insolvency proceeding. International perspective: With respect to recognition of insolvency proceeding with foreign element (out of EU) is applied reciprocity principle, unless international treaty stipulates otherwise. The competence of the Slovak court is given if the debtor has property in the territory of Slovak Republic regardless its amount. Bankruptcy declared by the Slovak court affects property of the debtor situated abroad, if legal regulations of respective State permit it. 2.2 Can recognition and assistance be given to foreign bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings? (Is there particular legislation governing cross-border insolvency? What key conditions need to be satisfied?) EU perspective: According to the Regulation, all decisions of the Member States court in relation to insolvency proceedings are recognized in other Member States without any further formal requirements; therefore the trustee is entitled to exercise all powers and competencies stemming from the law of the State of the opening of insolvency proceeding in other Member State. International perspective: Foreign bankruptcy shall be recognized by the Slovak court upon petition of a foreign trustee provided (1) there is given reciprocity principle, (2) the foreign trustee proves its appointment, initiation of foreign bankruptcy and legal interest of such recognition; unless international treaty stipulates otherwise. SECTION 3: OTHER MATERIAL CONSIDERATIONS 3.1 What other major stakeholders (e.g. governmental or regulatory institutions) could have a material impact on the outcome of the reorganisation? (Are there special protections for employees? How are pension liabilities treated? Tax Office and Social Insurance Company have a specific status within the framework of restructuring as providers of state aid. For this reason, they are considered creditors not consenting with the plan having possibility to substitute their approval (see 1.4). Protection of employees is ensured through guarantee insurance, which is mandatory for any employer operating in Slovak Republic. If an employer is unable to settle claims of employees due to its insolvency, such claims are satisfied through guarantee insurance benefits. Pension liabilities are covered by guarantee insurance benefits, which can be disbursed for three months provided the employment lasted for the 18 months preceding the employer’s insolvency. Moreover, labour claims of employees arisen after bankruptcy declaration are receivables against assets and have the priority claim status being satisfied prior to unsecured receivables. SECTION 4: CURRENT TRENDS 4.1 In no more than 200 words, outline any current bankruptcy and reorganisation trends specific to your jurisdiction. A significant amendment of insolvency law became effective on 29 April 2015 through Act n. 87/2015 Coll. Aforesaid act strengthens a legal position and increases possibilities of satisfaction of unsecured creditors in restructuring as well as establishes a register of disqualified statutory bodies due to breach of their statutory duties. The amendment prevents a merger, an amalgamation and a split-up of a company during bankruptcy or restructuring, which are ways the debtor and its statutory bodies may avoid their liabilities. Moreover, it tightens up obligations of statutory members of insolvent companies or companies facing impending insolvency as to diversion of insolvency and ban on drawback of fulfillment substituting company’s own resources."
10,The Best Place For Tax Lien Investing,finance," Here’s an excerpt from the  2016 book ""Tax Lien Investing Secrets: How You Can Get 8%-36% Return on Your Money Without the Typical Risk of Real Estate Investing or the Uncertainty of the Stock Market."" This section is from Chapter 3: Finding the Best Place to Invest The Six Things You Need To Know There are 6 things that you need to know about tax lien or tax deed investing before you get started. The statutory interest rate – this is the rate that the county charges delinquent tax payers and the rate that investors get on their money when it is not bid down at the tax sale. The bidding method – What is actually bid at the tax sale, whether the amount paid for the lien is bid up, or the interest rate is bid down, or something else entirely is bid, or there is no bidding at all and winners are randomly chosen. The redemption period – The period of time that the property owner has to redeem the lien or redeemable deed before the lien holder can foreclose on the property. The expiration period – The ""life"" of the tax lien, after which the lien will expire worthless if no action is taken by the investor. How subsequent taxes are handled – Whether or not the lien holder gets to pay the subsequent taxes if the property owner doesn’t pay them, and what interest or penalties are paid on the subsequent tax payments. Additional Penalties – Are there other penalties that the lien holder gets when the lien or redeemable deed redeems? These six things make a huge difference in your profit and are the reason why tax lien investing is very different in different states. Let me give you examples from three different states that all have auctions where the interest rate is bid down, but because of the other 5 factors mentioned in this chapter, investing in each of these states is quite different."
11,Forex market participant,finance," Unlike the equity market – where investors often trade with institutional investors (such as mutual funds)or other individual investors there are additional participants that trade on the forex market for entirely different reasons than those on the equity market. Therefore, it is important to identify and understand the functions and motivations of these man players of the forex market. Arguably, the most influential participants involved in the forex market are the central bank and federal governments. In most countries, the central bank is an extension of the government and conducts it policy in line with the government. However, some government feel that a more independent  central bank is more effective in balancing the goals of managing inflation and keeping interest rates low, which usually increases economic growth. No matter the degree of independence that a central bank may have, government representatives usually have regular meetings with the central bank representatives to discuss monetary policy. Central banks are often involved in manipulating reserve volumes in order to meet certain economic goals. For example, ever since pegging it currency (the Yuan) to the U.S dollar, China has been buying up millions of dollar worth of U.S treasury bills in order to keep the Yuan at its target foreign exchange rate (forex rate) central banks  use the foreign exchange market to adjust their reserve volumes. With extremely deep packets, they yield significant influence on the currency market. Along with central banks and governments, some of the largest participants involved with forex transactions are banks. Most people who needed foreign currency for small –scale transactions, like money for traveling, deal with neighborhood banks. However, individual transactions pale in comparison to the dollars that are traded between banks, better known as the interbank market. Banks make currency transactions with each other on electronic brokering system that a based on credit. Only banks that have credit relationships with each other can engage in transaction. The larger banks tend to have more credit relationships, which allow those banks to receive better foreign exchange prices. The smaller the bank, the fewer credit relationships it has and the lower the priority it has on the pricing scale. Banks, in general, acts as dealers in the sense that they are willing to buy/sell a currency at the bid/ask price. One way that banks make money on the on the forex market is by exchanging currency at a higher price than they paid to obtain it. Since the forex market is a worldwide market, it is common to see different banks with slightly different exchange rates for the same currency. Some of the biggest clients of these banks are international business. Whether a business is selling to an international client or buying from an international supplier, it will inevitably need to deal with the volatility of fluctuating currencies. Having to deal with forex risk is a big problem to many multinational corporations. Since foreign exchange is uncertainty. One choice that a business can make to reduce the uncertainty of foreign –exchange risk is to go the spot market and make a transaction for the foreign currency that they need. Unfortunately, businesses may not have enough cash on hand to make such transactions in the spot market or may not want to hold large amount of foreign currency for long periods of time. Therefore, businesses quite often employ hedging strategies in order to lock in a specific exchange rate for the future, or to simply remove all forex risks for a transaction. Example is a European company wants to by steal from U.S. it would have to pay for steal in U.S. dollars. If the price of the Euro falls against the dollars before the transaction is made, the European company will finally pay more Euro than formally specified. As such, the European company could go into the market to lock in the current exchange rate to eliminate the risk of dealing in U.S. dollars. These contracts could be either forwards or future, contract. Other class of participants in forex are speculators. Instead of hedging against changes in exchange rates or exchanging currency to fund international transactions, speculators attempt to make money by taking advantage of fluctuating exchange –rate levels. The largest and most controversial speculators on the forex market are hedge funds, which are essentially unregulated funds that use unconventional and often risky investment strategies to make very large returns. Think of them as mutual funds on steroids. Given that they can take large positions, they can have a major effect on a countries currency and economy. Some critics blame hedge funds for the Asian currency crises of the late 1990s, while others pointed on Asian central bankers. Either way, speculators can have a huge impact on the forex market. These are the basic participants of the forex market, now you can understand the history and knowledge of the forex market."
12,How Can You Build A Bigger Pension?,finance," Nowadays people are living longer so how you plan for your retirement is becoming more important. This article will introduce you to six ways you can make the most from pension planning to build as large a pension pot as possible to enjoy in retirement. After you stop working you can still pay into your pension pot. In fact, you can keep making contributions until you are 75 and receive up to 45% tax relief. Many people who retire still do part time or consulting work and these earnings can be paid into your pension if you wish. *Note: tax rules and the amount you receive in tax relief is subject to change and can differ depending on your individual circumstances. Many people think that if they move job they will lose their pension post. When you start a new job you will be asked if you wish to join the pension scheme – you should always take this option, even if it is only a small percentage of your income as the company will match your savings; effectively giving you more money. In order to manage moving jobs you should look to consolidate your pension savings into one pot. For more information about this you should speak to a financial adviser so you do not lose any benefits. When you pass away your pension can be passed onto beneficiaries. As it typically sites outside your estate there is no inheritance tax to pay. If you pass away under the age of 75, your beneficiaries can withdraw what they like from your pension and pay no tax. If you die after 75 your beneficiaries will need to be tax on any withdrawals made. However, if you have converted your pension pot into an annuity then these rules may be different. Another common myth about pensions is that you must make regular contributions. Nowadays pensions are far more flexible and you are able to contribute when you like. You must however avoid gaps in paying National Insurance. It is possible to start saving into a child’s pension using a SIPP which allows you to save up to £3600 a year. It is not compulsory to take your pension from the day you retire. Instead you can delay your pension to leave to your children, or in some circumstances can take your pension early. Depending on your circumstances you may take your pension earlier or later. It is important that you have enough income to last the duration of your retirement so when and how you take your pension is an important decision. You should thoroughly review your options and seek advice and guidance where possible."
13,Invest in Stocks With the Trend,finance," Always try to invest with the trend.  Doing so is like paddling a boat downstream.  Making progress is easy.  It is very difficult to make progress when you paddle upstream.  How do you determine what the trend is?  If the 200-day moving average of the market index is rising, then the general trend is up.  Does that mean the short-seller cannot sell short?  It does not mean that at all.  We do not define the trend by using only one measurement.   For the person who buys and holds his positions for two years, a rising 200-day moving average is favorable.  However, for a swing trader who holds his positions from one day to a few weeks, the direction of the 200-day moving average will likely be irrelevant.  That is why the trend indicator must fit the time-horizon (the intended holding period) of the investor. If you intend to hold your stock for a week or so, then the direction of the 20-day moving average will be important to you.  It will be of little or no importance to the individual who intends to keep his positions for two years.  If you intend to hold for a month or more, then the direction of the 50-day moving average will be very important to you.  However, there is some overlap here.  The direction of the 50-day moving average can also be important to the swing trader.  If the swing trader sees that both the 20-day and the 50-day moving averages are rising, he will have more confidence than if the 20-day moving average is rising but the 50-day moving average is still declining.  Under the latter condition, he might want to have tighter stops and to sell more quickly at the first sign of weakness.  If the two moving averages are rising, he might be a little more patient with his positions. We have said that the trader should invest with the trend, but there is more than one trend to consider.  There is the trend of the stock and the trend of the market.  Assume a person is a relatively long-term swing trader who likes to capture moves that last about a month.  It is possible for a stock to have a strongly rising 50-day moving average while the market index has a declining 50-day moving average.  Of course it is better if both are moving in the same direction as the trade you wish to make.  However, there are times when an individual stock will persist in a strong up-trend against the market's direction.  When a downward trending market has a rally, stocks with persistent strength will tend to rally as well.  When the market has its next plunge, the stock in a persistently strong rising trend will tend to decline to its rising trendline.  When it reaches that trendline, the savvy trader will monitor its behavior.   If the stock shows signs of rebounding off that trendline, the trader will buy.  In doing so, he is investing with the trend of the stock even though it is against the trend of the market.  The fact that the stock is in a persistently strong rising trend is what makes the trade sensible.  The author considers a stock's return to its rapidly rising moving average to be one of his favorite ""setup"" patterns. Our own traders at stockdisciplines.com try to monitor the general tone or ""health"" of the market by reviewing a series of indicators updated daily on our site.  However, there are useful observations the reader can make without referring to indicators.  For example, if the market goes up on good news, the market is behaving well.  If it goes down on good news, there is probably no trend in your favor, and bullish investments involve much greater risk.  The point is that it is always a good idea to invest with the trend that is suitable for your investment time-horizon.  It helps if the market is moving in the same direction as the most appropriate trend for your intended stock investment.  In other words, if you are a short- to intermediate-term trader, and the stock you want to invest in has a declining 30-day moving average, you should take that as a danger signal.  If the 30-day moving average is rising, that would be a good sign.  If the 30-day moving average of the market is also rising, that would be even better.

14,Selling Stocks That Don't Rise Can Get Bigger Gains,finance," Selling stocks that have declined and stocks that do not rise as expected accomplishes several things.  It frees up resources that can be used to buy other stocks more likely to rise in value.  It enables your rising stocks to impact your portfolio more fully because declining stocks that would dilute their performance are removed.  Finally, it keeps your portfolio more fully committed to rising stocks more of the time.  A very simplistic and purely hypothetical mechanical discipline can be used to illustrate the meaning of this article's title.  Let's suppose that when we invest the outcome is random.  Half the time the stock will decline and half the time the stock will rise.  Assume also a randomness in the magnitude of stock moves.  Finally, assume we have a rule that any stock we buy will be sold if it drops 8% below the highest price attained since purchase. Even if half the stocks we buy go down and half go up, our system will make money because it will never allow any loss to exceed 8%, and it will leave a rising stock alone until it drops 8% below the highest price it attains after purchase.  Thus, if the stock makes a gain of 60% before it declines the allowed limit of 8%, we will lock in a gain of 52%.  Profits on a given position have no necessary limits, but a loss can never exceed 8%.  In other words, the total gains would exceed the total losses even if stocks moved around in purely random patterns.  The discipline used can be even more important to profitability than the ability to be a good stock picker. Selling stocks that ""misbehave"" frees up assets that the investor can re-deploy to stocks with greater profit-making potential.  It is necessary to control the expenses of the investment enterprise just as an individual would control them in any other business endeavor.  The small losses are simply the necessary overhead of running a profitable investment enterprise.  Let's use a merchandising metaphor.  The key concept here is inventory control.  It is important for a merchant to get rid of inventory that doesn't move (these items are a drain on resources) in order to free up shelf-space and to have more resources (money) available to buy stock that will move and generate profits.  Smart merchants will often sell non-moving inventory at a discount and sometimes at a loss in order to free up resources and shelf space.  The merchant considers the loss to be simply one of the costs of doing business (like the costs of electricity, gas, water, rent, salaries, and taxes). The volatility of the market makes it necessary to be nimble in order to obtain optimum results. Just because taking a loss is not ""absolutely necessary"" does not mean that holding on to a poor performer to avoid taking the loss is the optimum course of action.  When there is a loss shortly after a purchase, it is generally unexpected.  That means something has just occurred that has made the stock less desirable.  The greater the decline, the greater the probability that something negative has just happened (a geo-political event, FDA decision, court ruling, comment by an officer of the company, achievement of a competitor, or whatever). Our tests and the experience of our own traders at stockdisciplines.com  show that in volatile markets performance is enhanced when stocks are sold while their declines are still small (if their decline is beyond the probability envelope of what is expected for those stocks given their recent price-action and current support levels).  Such actions will not always be the most profitable for a particular trade, but we know they will generally produce better results over time.  Even though it is not always ""absolutely necessary"" to sell when a stock falls (perhaps we believe the position will recover in time), we know that better long-term results can be achieved if we do sell and re-deploy the assets. To maintain a portfolio of winners, you have to keep getting rid of the losers and non-performers.  It is like pulling the weeds out of a garden so they don't choke the growth of desirable plants.  Here is the key point: ""It is the percentage of time that most of a portfolio is invested in rising stocks that determines how good performance will be.""  If losers are left in the portfolio where they can counterbalance the gains of the winners, performance will suffer.  The smart trader will want to get rid of the losers so the winners can lift the portfolio.  Most people cannot sit in front of their computer all the time the market is open.  That's why it is important to have a good stop-loss strategy.  We believe that stops should be ratcheted up as a stock rises. For example, a person could adjust stop orders in the afternoon after the market has closed, in the evening before going to bed, or in the morning before the market opens.  If these adjustments cannot be made every day, they should be made at least once a week.  By placing a stop order to sell with the broker, an individual doesn't have to stay ""glued"" to the screen monitoring stocks.  Instead, he or she can forget about the market and take care of other business.  Then, if the stock is sold, the sale will be according to a plan carefully conceived in calmer moments.

15,Use Stop Losses To Keep Losses Small,finance," Two portfolio managers recently discussed their orientation toward investing on national television.  The one we'll call the ""lesser light"" made a self-assured proclamation that he always invests for the ""long-term.""  He has an intended holding period for each investment of several years.  His approach was reminiscent of the strategies prevalent before the new market realities became evident.  Then, too, people were almost pompous about the fact that they didn't worry about the ""dips.""  They simply bought good companies and held them (they were members of the ""buy and hold"" tradition).  The implication, of course, is that those who didn't do likewise either did not know how to select ""good"" companies or that they were naively overactive in the management of their portfolios.  These advisors will ride their stocks up and down because they intend to capture only the modest gain of the long-term trend, or perhaps a little more. The other portfolio manager, the ""greater light,"" was Elaine Garzarelli.  She said that it was no longer a viable strategy to simply buy and hold any stock.  Every stock has to be monitored, and is an eligible sell candidate if it ""misbehaves"" (begins to ""break down"").  The last market crash should be sufficient evidence of the shortcomings of the former strategy and of the correctness of Garzarelli's position.  In the crash, we saw perfectly good companies decline in value 60% and more.  We have also seen volatility soar to unprecedented levels. Under the circumstances, what justification is there for going forward with the attitude that most positions should be held for several years?  Typically stocks do not go up non-stop for several years.  Over that period of time most stocks will have several serious corrections in which a large portion of previous gains will evaporate. It makes much better sense to lock in gains when you have them if a stock becomes unusually weak and switch to something else rather than to become a stock market yo-yo (the new ""sell on weakness"" school of thought).  Also, since no one can be sure how far a stock will drop once it begins a decline, the well-considered positioning of protective stop-losses is in order.  If the stop-loss is ratcheted up as the stock rises, an increasing amount of the gains will be ""locked in"" should the stock decline. The author once spent more than eight hours a day for three years testing tens of thousands of computer-driven investment strategies.  The goal was to develop systems that worked well regardless of the state of the market or the general direction of the stock.  The systems also had to outperform a ""buy and hold"" strategy by a wide enough margin to justify their use.  The goal was to find strategies that could outperform a ""buy and hold"" approach by at least 20% a year.  Thousands of tests were performed on each of thousands of stocks over a wide variety of market environments covering a period of many years to get a good profile of each strategy. The more successful of these automated systems had something in common.  Each had many losing trades, sometimes far more losing trades than winning trades. This was a surprise.  Many gains were expected, not many losses.  Their trading patterns over many years revealed several other interesting characteristics.  First of all, the systems with the best results were ""Nervous Nellies.""  That is, they sold at the slightest provocation (usually a downward motion of the stock that satisfied certain pre-established criteria).  The fact that there is so much ""noise"" or non-significant motion in stock behavior is what generated a large number of the small losses.  Yet, some of these same systems could generate large annual gains in a severely declining market. Where had the profits come from?  There were also many small profits.  Sometimes these were a few more in number than the losses, but often they were less.  Either way, they tended to act as a counterbalance to the losses.  Whether they slightly outnumbered the losses or were outnumbered 2 to 1 by the losses, the total amount of the small gains tended to balance the total amount of the small losses.  There was also an occasional trade that captured a big gain.  These larger gains were never counterbalanced by an equal or bigger loss.  The trading records of these systems showed these ""blips"" (large gains without corresponding losses) scattered throughout their trading records.  There were lots of minor gains and losses, then a blip, more small gains and losses, then another blip, and so on.  In essence, these systems had zeroed in on how to make money in hostile market environments.  Because they sold at the first sign of trouble, bad situations were never allowed to get worse.  As long as a stock did not behave badly, it was left alone.  Our own stockdisciplines.com traders use strategies based on the findings of this research in managing their own accounts. The power of these automated systems resided in the fact that they consistently applied a set of rules that completely ignored the number of losses (which could sidetrack a human) and focused on the amount of each loss.  The lesson learned was that top performance in the stock market was not achieved by trying to make big gains, but by controlling losses. Copyright 2016, by StockDisciplines.com a.k.a.

16,When Short-Term Health Insurance is a Smart Solution,finance," Since the health law took effect, short-term health insurance plans have become very popular, especially among young adults, people who have a gap in employer insurance or those who have missed open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. There are a few major reasons why this plans are appealing: They cost much less than major medical plans; They can be purchased at any time during the year to provide temporary coverage while you are waiting for an employer or government sponsored insurance; They start almost immediately; They provide access to broader network of health service providers including many major medical centers; Often they are more flexible than ACA-compliant health plans. But you should clearly understand that short-term health insurance is not for everyone. It can work well for one person and be a completely wrong choice for another. It is not recommended for people with poor health or certain chronic conditions because they won’t get sufficient coverage by short-term medical insurance. Also, people who have had serious health problems in the past two years shall look for other types of health insurance because pre-existing conditions are not covered by term policies. Still short-term medical insurance can be a reasonable solution for many people in need of temporary health coverage while going through some of life’s transitions. NEW EMPLOYEES WAITING FOR NEW JOB BENEFITS TO BEGIN If you have recently found a new job, you may have to wait some time for your employer-sponsored insurance to begin. It can be a smart decision to buy a short-term plan for a month or two to avoid being completely uncovered during this period. YOUNG ADULTS NO LONGER COVERED THROUGH THEIR PARENTS’ PLAN Though the federal health care reform law allows children to be covered as a dependent up to their 26, some day children must be removed from their parents’ plans. If you are no longer covered through your parents’ insurance and still don’t have a permanent job, short-term insurance may serve you well, especially if you are healthy enough. RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES A lot of college students find themselves without a medical coverage after graduation. If you were insured under a university plan or under your parents’ one, you are no longer eligible for them after leaving a college. You may fill this gap in coverage with short-term insurance until benefits begin with your first full-time job. PEOPLE BETWEEN JOBS When you leave your job, you also lose your employer-sponsored health benefits. Many people find it too expensive to continue their employer-sponsored plan through COBRA. A short-term plan may be a good alternative for medical coverage while you are looking for new job. PART-TIME OR TEMPORARY WORKERS If you work on a part-time, seasonal or temporary job you are typically not eligible for employer health benefits, while private ACA-compliant plans can be too expensive for you. In this case short-term medical may give you reasonable coverage. EARLY RETIREES TOO YOUNG FOR MEDICARE Individuals who have retired before the age of 65, may be faced with a gap in coverage before their Medicare begins. You can consider a short-term insurance as a suitable solution until your Medicare coverage starts. U.S. CITIZENS RETURNING FROM OVERSEAS Term insurance offers reasonable temporary protection from medical expenses for people returning to the U.S. from living abroad. RECENT U.S.IMMIGRANTS If you have recently become a U.S. citizen, you may have a waiting period before becoming eligible to get a government-sponsored health plans. Short-tetm medical can be a good option for you to have U.S. coverage."
17,How To Choose A Robo-Advisor,finance," The definition of a robo advisor is an automated program that provides financial guidance. More precisely, the application manages your investments via an automated algorithm rather than having an individual monitoring your portfolio. This program is limited to investment trading, monitoring and trade execution (because other aspects of financial planning are extremely personal and can't be programmed into an algorithm). Do you know the advantages of utilizing this service? It is extremely similar to any other form of automation. Since someone isn't doing the day to day work of handling a portfolio and it is being done by a machine, prices will be more economical. The amount of portfolios can be ""scaled"" readily so that one application can manage an indefinite quantity of portfolios if it has the memory and speed to do the trade executions. There is also instantaneous commerce execution since in the event the instructions are clear, the machine will not believe and can run directions at the speed of electricity. These features amount to freeing up time and cost to do other things. Another feature that's understood is the very fact that machines would not have emotions. Should a trade instruction be given, it'll get done no matter precisely what the marketplace is doing. A person might have doubts, sorrows, hesitation or alter their mind that might be better or worse for the situation. You must find a service which fits your investment needs just. In case you need a specific asset mix to feel comfortable due to tastes that you have, the algorithm should be flexible enough to enable an extensive array of asset mixes. You might get an allotment that's not just suitable for you, which can create additional risk if it does not. Execution in the marketplaces is imperfect in extreme states: The algorithm may not always work. Based on how the order is put in to the algorithm, it may not get filled and you'll have unintended consequences. Scenarios like this benefit from a live person who can make a judgement call and know when to wait or when to settle for a given cost. This type of expertise changes with each situation and it'd be lost in an algorithm. Changes to your preferences have to be conveyed properly, otherwise the execution might not be done correctly. Lastly, a person has to do the non-tangible aspects of your financial strategy like risk tolerance, health concerns, retirement tastes etc. There could possibly be efforts made to standardize such aspects to save cash, because people would be compelled into limited options which might not be acceptable, but this really is not a good idea. Who Gains the Most and the Least From a Robo-Adviser? The most effective use of a robo-advisor is for rebalancing that's straightforward, very conventional and clear investment targets, and a straightforward situation with little trading. Should you rebalance your portfolio to a fixed percentage per investment merchandise as well as the outcome will likely not be bad even if it is imperfect, that may be automated too. In case your portfolio has commonly traded funds and liquid securities, that makes it easier for automation. A small portfolio that is simple is the very best suited for automation. If that is done the robo-adviser may be utilized for a portion of the procedure. An investor who gets quite emotional about their investments or has problems making decisions as the markets change would reap the benefits of a robo advisor. The worst use of a robo-advisor is for somebody who has unique inclinations, has complex needs and can make good judgement calls. Can You Join Robo-Advisory With Conventional Advice? The short reply is yes. The communication needs to be clear so that the man knows when the machine would take over and vice versa. In the event the boundaries shift such as in an extremely volatile marketplace, this also must be communicated well. For the customer who's using both approaches, it would be useful to know how both systems work to find when each approach would be helpful or when it wouldn't. How Do I Evaluate the Cost? The answer to this question can be found in the comparison. There are human components like support, comfort, encouragement or perseverance which someone can provide that a machine cannot. These variables have to be accounted for somehow since the money belongs to a person ultimately. The prices should represent what you're receiving in both scenarios. Make sure that you adjust your comparison for this, if you getting something that you're not using. If there's something they're doing for you that you would rather do for yourself, this is just another adjustment that should be made to your comparison. Note that most robo-advisory firms are billing you for managing your portfolio. The robo-advisory fee is actually a rebalancing fee and also a portfolio asset mix starting fee. If you do not need to do lots of trading, the monthly costs can accumulate. This will depend on how much personalized service you need and how well you comprehend what the algorithm does. Leaving trading and the tracking to a computer can work for you - so you really do not get caught with unanticipated risks or outcomes, but you should understand the limitations. You must also understand what the machine doesn't do so you can supplement that with human interaction or some premises about how to earn your money work for you. In some cases you need to be mostly invested in cash, be paying off debt, focus on tax reduction, getting money into an illiquid asset like your house or your company revisiting your spending patterns, or keeping money liquid because of doubt. Future Expected Changes It is not unlikely that many big institutions will get onto this trend to appeal to younger people who want to do their investing online and who wish to start with small portfolios. It could be a means for the industry to provide advice to poorer customers without having to spend lots of resources with staff or overhead."
18,10 Things You Didn't Know About Millionaires of the 21st Century,finance," What’s the secret key code to the mansion of millionaires? Did they deserve their fortune, or did they just get lucky? There are different types of millionaires – some of them are self-made, some inherited the fortune from their forefathers, some became rich in a fair and honest way, while some dug their way to the riches in filthy ways. In this article, we will focus on millionaires who are self-made and value fair play. In the part below, you will find – 10 things you didn’t know about millionaires of the 21st century: They shop ""differently"". By ""shopping"", we don’t mean it in a conventional way – buying cars, gadgets, clothes etc. Yes, to some extent, but millionaires are really cautious when it comes to spending money. They compare the prices, analyze whether they truly need something or not, and if it’s worth investing. Many millionaires would focus their investment on stock, rather than on fancy yachts and planes. They don’t give you an impression of being rich. Genuine millionaires don’t have the urge to show their economic superiority through material possessions. You may notice many of them who wear cheap clothes, drive economic cars, or simply ride bicycles. It is a very important trait to wisely distribute your fortune, because, the less you need, the more you have. Most of them don’t have a feeling of being rich. Even when you start earning 7-digit amounts, there will be still many who have much more than you, and that’s why many millionaires don’t feel like millionaires. Many of them still worry about the retirement and if they will be able to secure themselves for the rest of their lives. It’s that feeling that everyone has – thinking that the next milestone is a game-changer. Their source of income comes from multiple streams. Relying only on one source of income can be risky – that’s why most millionaires spread their budget across multiple segments of business. Stock values vary from moment to moment, so it is really important not to go ""all in"", in order to prevent going broke. They are not only jacks of all trade. Many people think that businessmen only sell their talk, without possessing in-depth knowledge – which is not true. Most of them are passion-driven and every one of them has its own niche, or several niches (but not too many). They acknowledge education. Even though the well-known stories of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates beg to differ, most of millionaires have at least a bachelor’s degree. To be precise, only 15% of them never graduated, from which 12% dropped out, and 3% never attended college. Most of them agree that education played an important role in their success stories. The 3 highest paying degrees are business, economics and engineering. A lot of them are self-made millionaires. Approximately only 18% of all millionaires inherited their fortune. The rest has built their financial kingdom with discipline, dedication and hard work. Also, many of them started out from extreme poverty and still managed to earn millions. They work hard. This is the number one factor millionaires exist. It is true that some of them started with more, and some of them started with less, but all of them wouldn’t be where they are if they weren’t hard workers. A lot of successful people start their day at 03-04 AM. For example, founder of Walmart, Sam Walton, started with a single store and a loan, only to end up with a retail empire. Most of them welcome you in the club of millionaires. It is a mistake to think everybody else is a rival. Millionaires are well-aware that there is more than enough wealth for everyone and that for every new ""member"" of the 7-digit club, you also receive a potential partner. They know it takes a team to succeed. A key factor. Although most of them are self-made millionaires, it would be still mission impossible, if it wasn’t for the team that assisted them in setting the foundations. All of them know that, and that’s why emotional intelligence plays an important role for expanding one’s social network."

3,Are House Prices Canada's New Successful Birth Control?,finance," Sky high house prices are the delight of one generation and the doom of another. Baby boomers’ happiness directly correlates with the increase in house prices. They can cash out and live the retirement they dreamed of while the younger generations are handcuffed from creating the family life that they dreamed of. The high cost of buying into the housing market is causing many couples to delay having a family. A new survey from RateSupermarket reports that: 56% of respondents said their ability to start or expand their family has been impacted by house prices in their region 72% of millennials said their ability to start or expand their family has been impacted by house prices in their region 52.8% of respondents said they couldn’t expand their family in their current home 49.4% said the costs involved have caused them to change their minds about the size of their family The house prices in Toronto and Vancouver are not for the faint of heart, with the average single-family home in both cities currently above $1 million. It’s virtually impossible for a young couple to buy into the housing market today so with few options, condos are becoming more attractive to young couples and young families. The study from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) senior economist David Macdonald estimates that: A 20% decline in house prices across Canada would put 169,000 families under age 40 ""underwater"" on their mortgages. That’s one in 10 families in that age group. If prices fell 30% – in line with the maximum by which the Bank of Canada says Canadian house prices are overvalued – there would be 294,000 underwater families under 40, or one in seven It doesn’t seem right that young couples feel that they can’t start a family because they can’t afford to buy a house. Or even worse, they chase their dreams, buy a house that they really can’t afford and land up deep in debt. If you’re struggling financially, seek professional help as soon as possible.

Plan ahead carefully if you want to make as much money as you can by investing in stocks. You are likely to achieve even greater success if you keep your expectations modest instead of banking on things you cannot predict. Holding stocks for the long-term is a sound approach and generally more profitable than trying to make a quick buck. Analyze the stock market for some time before deciding to purchase stocks.

If you do, the stock market may just be what you are looking for. Before you put all your money into the stock market, learn as much as you can about how to invest wisely. In the article below, you will find this information. Stocks are more than a piece of paper that is bought and sold. When you own some, you become a member of the collective ownership of that specific company you invested in. This gives you claims on company assets and earnings. Sometimes you may even be allowed to vote in elections within the corporation. It is a good idea to spread around your investments. Investing in a single type of stock is very dangerous. If you have everything you've invested in a single stock and it flops, you'll be in a lot of trouble. It is prudent to keep a high-earning interest bearing amount of money saved away for an emergency. With this safety net in place, you can meet mortgage expenses and pay other bills until the matters are improved. When you choose an equity to invest in, don't allocate more than 10% of your portfolio into that company. By doing this you won't lose huge amounts of money if the stock suddenly going into rapid decline. Do not stay stagnant in your vigilance. It is vital to look closely at your portfolio, including any investing decision, every several months. The economy never stays the same for long. Some sectors are going to perform better than others, while other companies could even become outdated.

Don't try and time the markets. History has shown that people who steadily invest even sums of money over time do better in the long run. Be sure to figure out what amount of money you are able to invest. Start making regular investments and dedicate yourself to repeating the process. If you want to split your time between making your own picks and a broker who offers full service, work with one who offers online options and full service. This way, you can allocate a portion of funds to be managed by a pro and do the rest yourself. This is the best way to have control yourself but also have access to assistance. Stick to what you know. If you do have a financial adviser to help you, invest in the the companies you are familiar with. You probably have good judgement about companies in an industry you've worked in, but maybe not for companies well outside your area of expertise. For companies you know nothing about, you are probably better off just staying away. Damaged stocks are great investment opportunities, but stay away from damaged companies. A downturn in a stock can be a buying opportunity, but be certain that it's merely a temporary dip. Sometimes companies miss vital deadlines because of small errors and that can lead to a temporary loss of stock value. However, a company which has become tainted by a financial scandal may not be able to recover. Don't listen to stock tips or recommendations that you didn't ask to hear. Certainly listen to your own financial advisor, especially if they hold what they recommend and are personally doing well for themselves. Simply turn a deaf ear to anyone else. No one ever said it was going to be easy to invest. It's going to require doing your homework. You need to constantly seek out great, reliable sources of information.

7,Discounts for Multi Car Policies,finance," The multi auto policy is one of the most common discounts available from all auto insurance companies. If you have two or more vehicles, and you have them insured by one insurer, this discount is automatically applied. It means you bundle auto insurance for two or more vehicles. As briefly mentioned above, some online car insurance estimators have such feature, so you may not need to ask help from professional independent agent to do the calculation. Regardless of the discount, it is unlikely that the car insurance estimate for multi car policy will be cheaper compared to the rate of a single vehicle. The eligibility requirement depends entirely on the company's decision, but the cars usually should be owned by the same household. Multi-Policy Discounts The easiest way to get discounts is to move all the policies under one insurer only. This allows you to manage the entire monthly premium bills more efficiently as you only have to deal with one insurer. Among all the discounts provided, the multi policy is probably the biggest and best you can get from a company. Please remember that only some big companies have such feature, yet you still have to compare the coverage and prices to get the best based on your circumstances. A simple online car insurance estimator will not be able to predict the rate correctly since this kind of bundle only involves too many variables in the calculation. An ins agent can give an accurate car estimate, in this case, so you will want to consider working with one. Conclusion If you bundle auto insurance with other types of coverage for other assets, you get all the benefits of either multi-car or multi-policy discounts and the ease of having everything handled by one single insurer. For this particular situation, it is probably best if you ask help from an independent agent rather than online car insurance calculator estimator to predict the actual premium rates you need to pay. The car insurance estimate calculated by the agent will be more accurate; such agent will even compare the prices between many different companies to find the best deal for you. What you will find by comparing the prices can be quite surprising too. Sometimes it is cheaper if you do not bundle auto insurance with any other coverage."

9,Paul Chehade - Save A Lot Of Money With This Green Energy Advice,finance," Paul Chehade - Save A Lot Of Money With This Green Energy Advice There is such an overwhelming amount of information regarding green energy online so locating reliable information is quite challenging. The following article is going to give you simple advice to bring green energy into your home. Making small adjustments to the way you use energy every day can ultimately reduce your consumption. Unplug appliances when you're not using them. Try turning off the TV and lights when they're not in use. This is an easy way to save cash as well. The government has made grants for investing in renewable energy available to the public. Talk to your local government and figure out what programs are in the area. Who knows, you may qualify for low or no-cost wind or solar installation. Even if you don't qualify for a grant, you can still use these items as a tax deduction. During the summer, you should try drying your clothes out in the sun instead of using a dryer. The sun will make your clothing smell great. They'll smell so much better than if you shoved them into a dryer! As well, you save quite a bit on monthly utility costs. Try to turn off things you are not using. When you leave an area take the time to turn off lights, televisions, stereos, computers, and other electrical items you are not going to be using. A power strip offers a handy way to shut down multiple devices at once, and it prevents passive electrical use due to standby modes. If you clean your dishes using a dishwasher, don't run it until it's completely full. Your dishwasher consumes the same energy and water, even if it is half full. When running the dishwasher, turn on the setting for energy conservation. When planning a home solar system, calculate the potential energy generation of the system using hours of sunshine in the winter. This prevents unpleasant surprises in the winter, and it saves money during the summer. Also, if you make use of the net usage plan from your electric company, you will get returns from your utility company for generating energy during summer. Take the time to properly maintain your refrigerator. Since refrigerators tend to eat up a great amount of power, it is crucial you keep it in perfect working order. Be sure that you're regularly cleaning the dust that builds up near the heating coils. Don't forget to be certain to keep the seal surrounding the door tight and clean. Learn about the differences between passive and active solar power. Passive solar power doesn't require the costly power-storage cells that active power does. Active solar power requires a lot of involvement in the form of installation, mechanics, and power cells. Passive energy is using the sun's thermal energy to heat your house. Pay attention to any federal or local rebates offered for making alternative-energy updates to your home. In some cases, the local utility company will offer rebates for the cost of the upgrades. You may also get state and federal tax deductions for making your home more energy efficient. These credits and rebates will ultimately cut your costs of bringing green energy technology to your house. Make use of a solar oven for baking needs. You can make one using supplies you may already have on-hand like old window panes, boxes, and pieces of aluminum foil. The internal temperature of these easy-to-build ovens can top 300 degrees, and they do not require any energy besides the sun's rays. Get started with some great tips in this article today! All these tips make using green energy technologies simple and affordable for the average home or business owner. Your family and your environment will thank you for it!

10,Paul Chehade - Seeking Answers To Debt Consolidation Issues?,finance," Paul Chehade - Seeking Answers To Debt Consolidation Issues? Have you ever heard anyone discussing debt consolidation? There is a chance that you have, but its benefits may be unfamiliar to you. If you're struggling with paying a large number of creditors, consolidating those debts might be a better situation for you. You have to select a great company, though. Read on to glean some useful insights into a strategy that has worked well for others. Review your credit report before you decide on debt consolidation. The first step to fix your debt is to know where it came from. Therefore, determine your debt and the creditors you owe. In order to get your financial picture back on track, you will need to know how to distribute the money. Do you own a life insurance policy? You should think about cashing your policy so you can pay your debt off. To learn how much cash you can obtain from your policy, talk to your insurance agent. In some cases, you get to borrow some of your policy investment in order to pay current debt. Low fixed rates are something that you want to seek out with debt consolidation loans. This will help limit your stress and expenses during the process. Therefore, search for one-stop loans who offer great terms over the entire term, allowing you to be in a better financial place whenever you pay off the loan. You may use a credit card with a low interest rate to consolidate smaller debts with higher rates of interest. You'll save interest and have just one payment. Whenever your debts have been consolidated on a single card, you can then focus on paying this debt off prior to the expiration of this interest offer. Look into exactly how the interest rate is determined. An interest rate that is fixed will help you budget your money and make your payments on time. This way you know the amount you will be paying for the duration of the loan. Variable rates are nothing but trouble. They may cause you to pay more interest overall than you would have paid without the program. It is very important to do some background research on different debt consolidation companies before hiring a counselor to help you. When you do that, you can make a smarter decision, because you are more sure your finances are being taken care of by a reputable company. When you go into a debt consolidation program, you need to understand how you got into financial problems and how to avoid them in the future. Then you'll be less likely to turn around and do it all over again. Be honest with yourself about how this all happened. Attempt to negotiate settlements with your creditors before choosing debt consolidation. Creditors often knock off a large percentage of the debt in order to receive a lump sum payment. Not only does this not hurt your credit score, it might even boost it! Find out whether the people you are dealing with at a debt consolidation company are certified counselors. Check the NFCC for a listing of licensed credit counseling companies. Then you will know you are choosing the right firm. If you need to eliminate debt and feel desperate, you might borrow from your own 401k. This lets you borrow money from you rather than getting from a regular bank. Be certain to get the details in advance, since it is a somewhat risky proposition. You might get financial relief with debt consolidation, but you've got to do your research and choose smartly. Take the time to consider the pros and cons of every program, then use this information to decide what to do and what not to do. Learn more about debt consolidation so you can make an educated decision. Paul Chehade Solidary Foundation http://www.solidary.org"

If you are an adult, and missed that important eduction, or if you want to refresh your knowledge it is not to late! It is possible to increase your financial education whenever you want to. Here are some of the ways in which you can do it. Never sell when you aren't ready. If a stock is earning a good amount, it is best to allow it to sit a little longer.

Store any receipts or business cards you receive in the envelope. You want to hold on to these so you have a record later. It's useful to have your receipts if you ever see double charges for a purchase on your credit card statement. Watch out for heavy investors' fees. Full service brokers levy fees for services they provide. These fees can really take a chunk out of the money you make. Avoid patronizing brokers that charge high commissions, and do not invest in funds that have high management costs. Always know when to file your income taxes with the IRS. If you will be receiving a refund, file early to receive your money more quickly. If you expect to owe money, you ought to file close to the April 15 deadline. If you are struggling with very old debts, educate yourself on when they expire. Consult a credit expert about the statute of limitations on your debt. Avoid paying on old debts. Someone can save money by eating at home more and eating out less. Buying the ingredients and putting meals together at home will save one money, as well as giving one an appreciation for the effort it takes to make good tasting meals. Credit cards with rewards are a great alternative to debit cards. Credit cards can be used for things such as groceries and gas. This will probably earn you credit card rewards, which means you could get cash back. Most banks offer online alert services as a part of your checking or savings account. Banks frequently notify their customers of significant account changes with online alerts. Alerts that let you know of a low balance or a large withdrawal will help you from overdrafts or fraud. If you do not like the hassle of balancing your checkbook manually, you can easily do all the work online. There are websites and stand-alone software programs that can do it all, from creating budgets to tracking your bank account data.

Individuals who spend their entire paycheck or overspend and take out loans will never be able to save a dime. Find out what you make and spend far less than what you bring in. Establish priorities for your finances. You first have to understand choices you've made before seeking to improve personal finances. Make a good list of what you believe about material possessions and money, and think about what has triggered that from your past. Make sure that you have the most positive attitude possible.

All it takes is a little effort and anyone can improve their financial skills. All you need to do is follow some of the simple advice that has been provided, and you too can improve your financial situation positively.

12,Paul Chehade - Don't Waste Your Money In The Stock Market,finance," Paul Chehade - Don't Waste Your Money In The Stock Market Stock market investing is a complex process, but potentially a very rewarding one. A little patience, self-education, and research are called for. If you want to discover the methods of earning the most money, then keep reading this article as it provides some solid advice on how to do so. It is possible to begin making money in the stock market immediately. Before going to a broker, you should do some background research to make sure you can trust them with your money. If you take a little time to investigate the organization and understand their business practices, you will help to protect yourself against investment fraud. ""Keep it simple"" can apply to stock market investment. If you keep the number of stocks you invest in under twenty, you will find it much easier to keep track of them all on a regular basis. This will also increase your chances of pulling out before any one stock drops too far. Stocks are more than a piece of paper that is bought and sold. Owning a stock makes you part of the body that owns the company which issued it. You become vested in the earnings and assets that belong to the company. Sometimes you may even be allowed to vote in elections within the corporation. If the goals of your portfolio are for maximum long term profits, you need to have stocks from various different industries. The whole market tends to grow, but there are some sectors that do not see any increase in growth. By having a wide arrangement of stocks in all sectors, you will see more growth in your portfolio, overall. By re-balancing your portfolio, you lessen your losses in smaller sectors while taking positions in them during their next growth cycle. Do not put over 5 or 10 percent of your investment capital into one stock. This way if the stock does go into rapid decline at a later date, the amount of risk that you have been exposed gets greatly reduced. You may want to consider using an online service as a broker. This will give you the added security of having a broker as well as the freedom to trade as you wish. This will help you to better manage your stock portfolio. This will give you professional assistance without giving up total control of your investments. Building a detailed, long-term investment plan and setting it down in writing is an important step to take if you want to maximize your stock portfolio's performance. The plan needs to include both buying and selling strategies. You should also have an extremely detailed budget included. When you have this, you can invest using your head, rather than your emotions. Don't put all your faith in penny stocks if you're hoping to hit it big in the market. Although they pose a much lower risk, penny stocks will not give you the growth and interest rates of blue-chip stocks, so this is something to think about. Decide on a few large companies to form your base and then add stocks with the potential for strong growth. Major, established companies have good track records and investing in them carries a very low risk. Before you buy any stock, do your research. Often, individuals hear about new stocks that appear to have great potential, and they think it makes sense to make an investment. Then said company might not live up to expectations, resulting in large losses. While anyone can put their money into stocks, many people lack the proper information needed for success. Focus on learning how stocks work and place your money in the best companies. Remember this article's tips and you can start to invest today.

13,Clever Real Estate Tax Planning,finance," NEWS The Cal State Companies:  Center for Real Estate Studies • Cal State Properties • Cal State Investment LTD Partnership PO Box 96 • Palos Verdes, CA 90274 • Phone  310-245-6952 • E-Mail  CalStatecompanie@aol.com Media Contact: The Center for RE Studies 		For: Immediate Release Clever Real Estate Tax Planning Palos Verdes. CA. Here are three simple ways to reduce your taxes. Income taxes are derived by multiplying taxable income by an applicable tax rate. The lower the taxable income, the lower the rate, thus the lower the taxes. This article will show you how to do it. How to Lower Taxable Income The simple underlying concepts used to reduce taxable income are: ►Spread income over time ►Spread income to various entities ►Group income and expenses Knowing something about each of these concepts will allow you to implement substantive tax savings. Spreading Income Over Time Real estate provides the opportunity to spread income over several years using the installment sales method of reporting. By accepting a relatively low down payment and spreading the principal payments over several years, total taxable income for any one year is reduced. In the tax-deferred exchange method, income can also be spread over time. Both methods can be structured to give you maximum reporting flexibility. If you’re a real estate licensee purchasing a property and you want to spread taxes on your commissions over time, have them contingent upon some event taking place to avoid constructive receipt, if the situation warrants.  For example, your commissions could be conditioned upon the property maintaining certain levels of cash flow and/or profits. Spreading Income over Entities Spreading income to various entities reduces the income any one entity has to report. By transferring ownership of assets to corporations, partnerships, relatives, or trusts, an effective transfer of income can be accomplished as well. Relatives in low-income brackets can be paid for services provided.  As long as these services represent legitimate business transactions, spreading income in this manner can save you thousands of tax dollars. When operating entities have dissimilar tax reporting years and basis (cash or accrual), it’s possible to spread income and expenses over different years to take advantage of the tax laws. Grouping Income and Expenses Grouping income and expenses can lower taxable income. Real estate provides the flexibility to implement this kind of tax-planning tactic.  More specifically, rental properties do, because they fit nicely within the definition of active participation rules (which allow a $25,000 write-off against salaries and other active income). This write-off alone represents a substantial tax savings to many individual investors. When changes in either income or expenses can be projected, the benefits of grouping are phenomenal. For example, refinancing will create a higher interest expense deduction to offset anticipated increases in rental income. Short-term loan contracts with high points will accomplish the same thing. If expenses are projected to increase, offset them by increasing receipts from installment contracts. Avoid reporting income when notes become due by renegotiating an extension of time. If the senior mortgage matures before your note, subordinate it to new financing to avoid payment. Capital gains and losses can also be grouped to maximize tax benefits. With restrictions, capital losses may be used to offset capital gains plus additional amounts of ordinary income. Increasing the Depreciation Deduction Maximize the deduction for depreciation: ►To increase the depreciable basis of the asset, take the higher of either the tax role or an independent appraiser’s evaluation. ►To decrease the length of time the asset is depreciated, identify personal property assets. They can be depreciated over shorter lives. Converting Real Property into Personal Property The IRS defines tangible personal property as any personal property except land and improvements thereto, such as buildings or other inherently permanent structures (including items that are structural components of such buildings or structures) (Reg. 1.48-1[c]). The courts have concluded that ""permanency"" is the most pertinent test in the determination of whether an asset is a structural component and not personal property. They have applied the following six tests to assist: ►Is the property capable of being moved and has it in fact been moved? ►Is the property designed or constructed to remain permanently in place? ►Are there circumstances that tend to show the expected or intended length of affixation? ►How substantial a job is the removal of the property and how time-consuming is it? ►How much damage will the property sustain upon removal? ►How is the property affixed to the land? The Last Remaining Tax Loophole Rental Property ownership still provides the opportunity to qualify as an active participant. In doing so, qualified owners can deduct up to $25,000 per year against salaries and other nonpassive income. You’ll notice that I said ""qualified owners."" That’s because there are five basic conditions that must be met to qualify for this write-off: ►The person seeking the write-off must be an individual taxpayer. Corporations and limited partners do not qualify. The IRS considers a married couple filing jointly to be an individual, so a husband and wife can share the write-off. Tenants-in-common form of ownership meets this requirement. ► The property must be a real estate rental activity. That is, its primary purpose must be that of a rental property to qualify. ►The individual must own a minimum of 10 percent of the rental property at all times. A husband and wife can own 10 percent combined and still qualify because they’re considered an individual by the IRS. An individual may own more than 10 percent, but not less. ►The maximum write-off of $25,000 is phased out when adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $100,000. The phase-out is $2 for each $1 of AGI over the minimum of $100,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.  This exemption is unavailable once AGI reaches $150,000. ►The individual must be considered an active participant. Participation requires only that the individual participate (in a significant and bona fide manner) in the making of management decisions or arranges for others to provide services. Examples of management decisions would include setting rental rates and terms and approving capital and repair expenditures.   A management company can handle the day-to-day operations as long as the owner makes the major decisions."

15,Paul Chehade - Check Out These Great Stock Market Tips,finance," Paul Chehade - Check Out These Great Stock Market Tips To the uninitiated, the idea of becoming involved in the stock market can be very intimidating and overwhelming. There is so much to learn, and most importantly, a lot of money you can lose if you aren't careful. By using the advice in this article you will be able to make wise investments, garnering you a profit. Remember to be realistic in what your expected return is when investing. Everyone knows that wealth through the stock market does not happen overnight. Success comes from a long term strategy of responsible financial investment and management. Keep this in mind, and you can avoid making expensive mistakes while building your investment portfolio. Make sure you diversify your investments sufficiently. The money you invest, like the proverbial eggs, should not all go into the same basket. For example, if you invest everything you have into one share and it goes belly up, you will have lost all your hard earned money. When you're thinking of a rainy day fund, you should be thinking of an investment option that earns a lot of interest. You should also keep at least six months worth of expenses in it. With this safety net in place, you can meet mortgage expenses and pay other bills until the matters are improved. If you focus your portfolio on the most long range yields, you want to include strong stocks from various industries. Although, on average, the entire market has gains each year, not every part of industry will increase in value from year to year. You can grow your portfolio by capitalizing on growing industries when you have positions in multiple sectors. You want to make sure you are constantly re-balancing in order to help decrease your losses in bad profit sectors while still keeping a hand in them for possible future growth cycles. Conceptualize stocks as being parts of companies that you really do own, instead of being hazy intangibles that you can trade. Make sure you take some time to thoroughly look over financial statements and the businesses' strengths and weaknesses so that you can have a good idea of your stocks' value. By delving into the nuts and bolts of a company, you get a closer look at where your money is going. If you are new to investing, be wary that making big returns overnight is tough. Most often, it takes time for any stock to build in strength and increase in value, and some find the wait unbearable and will even give up. You have to be patient and take your time. Understand what you are competent in, and remain with it. You should stick to investing in companies that you are familiar with, especially if you invest through an online or discount brokerage without much expert advice. While you might know how to judge a landlord, can you judge a company that makes oil rigs? This is why a professional advisor is something that is great to have when you plan on investing. To make your portfolio work for you, create an investment plan or policy and put the rules in writing. The strategies in your plan should be about when you will buy and when you will sell. It should also entail a precise budget which defines your investment limitations. Investments shouldn't be treated as gambles. You want to approach investing with a clear head. As you can now see, there are quite a few ways to achieve stock market success. Always do your homework, and when you finally jump in, try to remain calm.

If this is the kind of information you are seeking, this is the place to find it. Read on to learn some great investment tips. Before investing in real estate in any form, you need to do your research and analyze the market. Look at many different properties at your location and note various things on a spreadsheet. You need to be looking at how much you'll make in rent, what kinds of repairs need to be done, and how much the current prices are. This can help you sort the good deals from the bad ones. Join an online investor group or follow forums and blogs from highly successful investors in real estate. These sites offer valuable information about investing in the real estate market. You could even talk to someone in a more personal atmosphere. Diversifying in different areas is good, but start with nearby locations. Chances are you are going to find some great real estate for investment purposes in your area, and you know this area best. At least, you may want to think about starting locally. Make it a priority to learn all you can about the neighborhoods that contain the properties you have chosen for investment opportunities. Location is one of the most integral factors. Talk with neighbors before putting in an offer. Make sure you put some accounting skills to use. Bookkeeping is easy to fall behind on, especially when you first start out. There is so much to be worried about. One thing that is quite important is accurate bookkeeping. Getting into the habit of proper bookkeeping will make you more organized and save you from future problems that may occur. Never spend all of your money investing in real estate. This extra money will pay for expenses like minor repairs. You likely won't be able to rent the property immediately, so it's important to have that cash. Even when no one is occupying the property, you still have bills to pay. If you have a real estate investment partner, consider taking out a non-recourse loan. This kind of loan will protect your investment if the deal turns bad. This will give you flexibility with making good money. Don't let any one deal suck up too much of your time. It's not really a ""deal"" if it takes up too much time. This just means that you won't have any other possible deals. Many people you know, whether loved ones or coworkers, will try to convince you not to invest in real estate. You probably should not pay them much mind and instead, do your research on the subject. The only ones you might want to listen to are successful people who have already been right where you are now. With these tips, you should feel better about investing.

Read on to learn everything you need to know about debt consolidation. It will give you a lot of things you need to know so you're able to make decisions that can assist you financially. Find a debt consolidation agency that hires qualified staff. Do they have any certifications? Are they backed by reputable institutions in order to prove these people are legitimate? This will allow you to know whether or not a company is worth the trouble. Consider your best long term options when choosing a company to consolidate your debts. You may want to get started immediately, but take the time to do research, assess your needs and make a wise choice that won't be a costly mistake. Some offer ongoing exercises that can keep you out of trouble down the road. Obtain one loan that will pay all your creditors off; then, call the creditors to make settlement arrangements. Creditors often accept a lump sum of 70 percent. In the long run, debt consolidation may have a positive affect on your credit score. Although using debt consolidation companies can really help, it is important that you learn if they are reputable. Keep in mind that if things seem too good to be true, they probably are. Ask the lender a bunch of questions and be sure they're answered prior to getting any kind of a contract signed. Find a non-profit credit counselor in your general area. Such an office can assist you in debt management and consolidation. If you choose them over the companies that charge for debt consolidation, it will look better on your credit report. If you can't borrow any money from financial institutions, try getting some from friends of family.

Make certain counselors of the debt consolidation company you are considering are certified. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling is a great place to check first. This can help you feel more comfortable as you'll be dealing with a good company.

One option that you can use instead of hiring a debt consolidation company is to use the debt snowball method. Choose your card with the highest interest rate, and pay it off as quickly as possible. Use the extra money when it's paid to pay off another debt. It's one of the best choices you can make. See what a company's privacy policy is like. See what sensitive information they store and how it is protected. The software should encrypt each individual file. If it isn't, then this means that people may be able to steal some of your information if the system were to be compromised somehow. You should now be much more familiar with the concept of debt consolidation. Be sure to do sufficient research to ensure that you fully grasp the pros and cons of your options.

Getting your finances in order can help you avoid disaster and prepare for your future. Read on for some excellent advice on cultivating your financial sensibilities. Getting your finances in order is a great way to improve your quality of life. This helps you to stay organized, and keep your finances in order. When you put some of your profits into capital, this builds a foundation to grow upon. However, when you utilize those profits wisely, you can watch your money grow as return on investment. Make sure you have a barrier set to determine what you shall call profit and what will be capital. Be positive that you can truly trust the person that you are entrusting your life savings with. Demand impeccable references and try and gauge their honesty and trustworthiness. It is also important to be sensible, and have the experience to know when something is not quite right. Stay abreast of what's going on in the global markets. Citizens of many nations tend to ignore what goes on outside their borders, but this is disastrous if they trade currencies. When you're aware of what's going on globally, you'll be able to make smart predictions about the market and choose your financial strategies wisely. Eat as though you are a local when traveling to other countries and you will save money. The restaurants in hotels and tourist areas have ""tourist trap pricing,"" which can be substantially higher than what locals pay. With this in mind, eat where the locals eat! You'll find the most delicious and best priced fare in the area. Writing down the amount you spend each day can be helpful in understanding where you spend your money. However, if you write it in a notebook that gets closed and set aside until you open it again the next day, it might become a case of ""out of sight, out of mind"". Instead, create a big chart or board at home and use that to list all your expenses. It will be front and center during your daily activities and hard to avoid. Buying lean protein in various bulk amounts can help you save a lot of time and money. As long as nothing is going to go to waste, it is always more economical to purchase products in bulk. If you cook meals for the rest of the week, it can save you a lot of time. In order to build good credit, you should be using two to four credit cards. If you only have one card, your credit score will rise, but slowly. If you have more than four, it is an indication that you have difficulty dealing with your finances. Start with two cards and build your credit by adding new cards when needed. Don't be discouraged with a drop in your credit score while you are working on fixing your credit because this is not uncommon. It doesn't mean that you've made a wrong move. Continue to add positive information to your report and your score will continue to rise. Protect yourself financially with the best health insurance policy for you. Everybody is going to get sick sometimes. So, it's very important to have the best possible health insurance for your family situation. Very quickly, hospital and doctor bills can add up to $20,000 or more. Paying for proper medical care is not possible without a good insurance plan. In summary, though you might not be rich, you can still improve your personal financial situation in such a way that your life is improved. Sometimes, all a person needs is the will to live in a way that they do not have to worry about finances. Paul Chehade Golden Eagle Investments http://www.goldeneagleinvestments.com"
20,Safety First! Here’s how you can ensure the Safety of Your Hard-Earned Bitcoins,finance," It’s crazy out there! There is always someone trying to steal your money in one way or another. It could be someone picking your pocket on the bus or trying to get your bank information while you are trading online. Your bitcoins may also be vulnerable to these people and while we may not always be able to know who these people are, we can certainly protect ourselves from them using certain security measures. Five simple steps When it comes to securing your bitcoins, there are a number of things you can do but we will take a look at the top five. 1.Small amounts Before the world became cashless, people were often advised not to carry a lot of cash in their wallets. The same logic applies here. Do not put all your bitcoins in one bitwallet bitcoin wallet. Keep only what you need in there and move the rest to an alternative location. 2.Encryption There are some reliable bitcoin wallets out there like the bitwallet bitcoin wallet from bitwallet. These provide you with a private bitcoin key, which you can modify. Encryption simply means creating a very strong password with at least 16 different kinds of characters. You may have trouble remembering such a long password so make it as familiar as you can. 3.Backup We always backup important information and so if you are using an online wallet like the bitwallet bitcoin wallet, you need to back it up. This way if the computer crashes or someone steals the phone, you can restore your coins quite easily. Always run a backup when you conduct a bitcoin exchange or sell bitcoins on bitwallet to keep it up to date. 4.Secure sites If you are on bitwallet or a similar online trading platform, make sure to check out the security policy they have. These platforms are required to provide some level of security for bitwallet bitcoin exchange and other such transactions, so make sure to check it out before signing up. 5.Anonymity Another way you can keep your bitcoins safe is to maintain a level of anonymity. For instance on bitwallet, the sellers are required to identify themselves but the buyers can be anonymous. You can go to bitwallet - buy bitcoins and choose to do a cash purchase, which will leave no traces to you or your information. That way, you can do your bitwallet bitcoin exchange securely. It’s a risky business Anything that has to do with money is risky business. You just need to be smart about how you go about the transactions so that your bitcoins are safe to trade another day. Maintain basic security at home regarding your computer. Keep the passwords secure and protect it from invasive software. Also, remember that the market can be very volatile and unless you have some experience or reliable advice, avoiding playing on the price changes. Be smart about your investment, do not be greedy and you will not lose all your bitcoins (and maybe other currencies) on some gamble you took."

1,Finding the Good Real Estate Deals,finance," There are many ways to find good deals.  Some of the best ways are quite simple.  Remember, though, that the key to success in anything is persistence, and perseverance.  The best way to start looking for good deals is right in your local newspaper.  Look for properties that are for sale in the area that you have chosen to work in.  Also look in the price range that is ideal for an investment.  The best market is usually middle class, or slightly lower, or slightly higher.  If you work in the high end market, those types of houses do not usually make good rentals. And if you work in the lower end, those properties may be difficult to sell, and are not the best neighborhoods to work in. You can find out a lot about a property or an area just by reading the newspaper.  The next step of course is to call and ask about the property.  Always be prepared with a pen and paper.  Some questions to ask would be: A.	Where is the property located? B.	What type of construction is the building? C.	What is the area zoned for? D.	How many bedrooms and baths are there? E.	Is there a basement or attic? F.	Is there a garage or a shed? G.	How many units does the building consist of? H.	If it is more than one unit, are the utilities separate, and who pays, the landlord or the tenant? I.	What type of flooring is inside? J.	How old is the roof? K.	What is the property size? L.	What is the square footage of the house? M.	What are the annual property taxes? N.	What condition is the house in? Some ads in the paper or on the internet will be houses that are listed with a real estate agent.  These are good ads to call on because you can learn a lot from a real estate agent, and they will have other houses to show you.  That is the next best place to find good deals, through a good real estate agent.  Try to find an agent who is familiar with investment property.  If you find a good real estate agent who understands what you are looking for, it can be very profitable.  There are a number of good reasons why you want to have a real estate agent as part of your success team.  Experienced real estate agents generally have a lot of education and experience.  One of the keys to success is to use other people’s experience, and other people’s education. Agents are also good at negotiating.  They are good to have as a buffer between you and the seller.  They are knowledgeable about the neighborhood, and can help guide you with regards to pricing whether it be when submitting an offer or listing a property.  They are usually on the cutting edge when it comes to market information.  They can help you obtain valuable information you need when it comes to active, pending, and closed sales.  They can give you valuable information such as how many days a property has been on the market, or how many bedrooms or bathrooms may be in a particular house.  Agents are always networking, and sometimes an agent may find out about a house before it hits the general market.  Real estate agents have access to the multiple listing service (MLS).  This service has a world of information on properties that are currently active on the market, pending, or sold.  This is all valuable information you will come to appreciate.  A good real estate agent has capable negotiating skills, which will come in handy when submitting your offer."

3,Introduction To Bitcoin And Its Advantages,finance," Bitcoin is one of the most versatile currencies available. Some of its uses include trading bitcoins, binary options, and foreign exchange trading. Bitcoin is a form of currency existing only in the digital world. The technology was created by an individual hiding under an identity named Satoshi Nakamoto. To this day, the creator/creators of the system never materialized, maintaining an anonymous status. Bitcoins are not printed like traditional currencies as there are no physical representations for the cryptocurrency; it is produced by users and numerous businesses through a process called mining. This is where dedicated software solves mathematical problems in exchange for the virtual currency. A user takes control of it using electronic devices, which also serves as medium to complete transactions with the help of numerous platforms. It is also kept and secured with the employment of virtual wallets. Characteristics of Bitcoin Bitcoin has the characteristics of traditional currencies such as purchasing power, and investment applications using online trading instruments. It works just like conventional money, only in the sense that it can only exist in the digital world. One of its unique attributes that cannot be matched by fiat currency is that it is decentralized. The currency does not run under a governing body or an institution, which means it cannot be controlled by these entities, giving users full ownership of their bitcoins. Moreover, transactions occur with the use of Bitcoin addresses, which are not linked to any names, addresses, or any personal information asked for by traditional payment systems. Every single Bitcoin transaction is stored in a ledger anyone can access, this is called the blockchain. If a user has a publicly used address, its information is shared for everyone to see, without its user's information of course. Accounts are easy to create, unlike conventional banks that requests for countless information, which may put its users in jeopardy due to the frauds and schemes surrounding the system. Furthermore, Bitcoin transactions fees will always be small in number. Apart from near-instant completion of processing, no fees are known to be significant enough to put a dent on one's account. Uses of Bitcoin Apart from its abilities to purchase goods and services, one of its known applications features its use for a number of investment vehicles. This includes forex, trading Bitcoins, and binary options platforms. Furthermore, brands like BitPlutos offer services that revolve around Bitcoin as currency. Clearly, Bitcoin is as flexible as traditional legal tenders. Its introduction provides every individual with new beneficial opportunities with its ease of use and profit making capabilities.

4,From The Field: Tax Lien Deal Analysis,finance," I recently attended a tax New Jersey tax sale. There were only 5 properties in the sale down from 15 on the original tax sale list. Last year at this sale I came away with one decent lien. This year I didn't get anything at this tax sale. So I decided to do a tax lien deal analysis of some of the liens in this sale to see if investing in New Jersey is getting too competitive for investors to make a profit. I only bid on one little utility lien and was outbid by a mile. I was bidding on a lien amount that was close to $350. I bid 18% and then the bidding went to 17% so I bid 16%, then it went right to 0%, $100 premium, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600, and was won at $700 premium. This means that the winner will pay the amount of the lien and get no interest on the certificate amount (although they will get a 2% penalty on that amount) and they'll also pay the $700 premium and get no interest on that amount. All for the chance to pay any subsequent sewer amounts at 8%. What they might not have been aware of is that this particular municipality shuts the water and sewer off when a house is vacant. This particular lien is on a townhouse, which was vacant and had already had the water shut off. The winning bidder will be lucky to be able to pay another $350 and get 8% on that, but in reality they have already paid $1050 that they will only receive about $7.00 on that (2% of $350) and if they get to pay another $350 at 8% and the lien redeems after a year, they will collect $39 on an investment of 1400 for a ROI of 2.8% over a year. But when you take into account that this was a fund and they had to pay someone to do the due diligence and go to the sale and bid, I'm sure they had more into it than $39. To be fair they did buy 3 of the other larger tax liens, which they paid much bigger premiums for. But this lien was not a good investment for what they paid for it. Is Tax Lien Investing In New Jersey Dead? So is trying to invest in tax liens in New Jersey like beating a dead horse? That depends on how much money you have to invest, what you're willing to spend and what your bottom line is, in other words what is the lowest interest rate that you're willing to accept. There were 2 private funds at this sale and 3 investors. One of the private funds got 4 of the liens, including the utility lien that was discussed earlier and one of the investors came away with the largest tax lien in the sale (around $8,100) and he paid $20,000 premium to get it! I know that this doesn't sound like a good deal, and it wasn't the best deal out there, but it is profitable. Tax Lien Deal Analysis Taxes sold at this sale are for the previous year, but right now there are current taxes due that can be paid by the investor once the tax lien certificate is issued. The annual taxes on this particular property are around $6,700. The investor will get no interest on the $8,100 certificate amount, but he will get a 4% penalty it since the lien amount is over $5000. He'll get no interest on the premium. He'll get to pay the current year's taxes of $6,700 and make 18% on that. Then if he does nothing more and the lien redeems after one year, he'll make $860 profit (4% of 8100 + 18% of 6700) on a total investment of 34,800, for a ROI of 2.5%. Not very good at all! But that wasn't the most that was paid for a tax lien at this sale. The most premium paid for a lien at this sale was $32,000 for a $4,500 lien. So how could that be any better than paying 20,000 for a $8,100 lien? The annual taxes on this parcel are $10,300. This is significant because this municipality does have a year-end penalty. The year-end penalty is another 6% penalty that is added to the subsequent tax amount paid (in addition to the 18% per annum already assessed to the tax payer) at the end of the year if the subsequent tax amount paid is over $10,000. So in this case the investor could get 24% on the $10,300 current taxes if they get to hold the lien through the end of the year and pay all the sub taxes. If the lien doesn't redeem until for a full year the investor could make $2652 (4% of 4500 + 24% of 10300) on an investment of 36,600 for an ROI of 7.2%. This was a better deal, but not the most profitable deal of the sale. The most profitable deal (bid by the same fund) was a $2000 lien for which they bid $8,000 in premium and the annual taxes are close to $7,000. If the lien is not redeemed until next year and they pay the current taxes, they will make around $1300 profit on a total investment of $17,000 which is a ROI of 7.6 %. It is profitable to pay premium for tax liens that are over $1500, you just need some pretty deep pockets in order to it! Note: The actual numbers from the tax sale were rounded off to whole numbers that made the calculations for our purposes easier to do and it easier to demonstrate how to analyze a tax lien investing deal at a New Jersey tax sale."
5,Pennsylvania Tax Sales: What is an Upset Sale?,finance," If you are going to bid at Pennsylvania tax sales you need to be aware of the different types of deed sales that are conducted in the Commonwealth. Many Pennsylvania counties have two different tax sales that are live auctions; the ""upset"" sale, and the ""judicial"" sale. If tax sale properties are not sold at either of these two sales, the property then goes on the ""repository"" list and can be sold by private bid. Most counties will have an upset sale every year in the fall. It's called the ""upset"" sale because the minimum bid for the properties in this sale is the ""upset"" price - what is owed for delinquent taxes from the county as well as any municipal liens. If a property is not sold in this sale, it then goes into the ""judicial"" tax sale which many counties will hold in the spring. Not all Pennsylvania counties have judicial tax sales but they all have an upset sales. The exception to this is the city of Philadelphia which has redeemable deed sales. The city of Philadelphia has also recently instituted an annual tax lien sale in addition to the redeemable deed sales. It is my understanding that this has also been tried in a couple of the other major cities in PA, but I'm not sure if they are still selling liens or have reverted back to deed sales like the rest of PA. What is an Upset Sale Anyway? What you may not know about the upset sale is that all properties are sold subject to any liens or judgments. That means that if you purchase a tax deed at this sale, you are responsible for any other unpaid liens or judgments on the property. Most people assume that when they buy a property at a tax sale, that they don't have to worry about other liens such as a mortgage. This is not true at the upset sale. If you plan on bidding at any of these sales this fall, you'd better do your homework! So how do you find out about other liens or judgments on tax sale properties? There are two ways that you could do this; one is going to cost you some money and the other is going to take some of your time. The first way is to hire a title search company to do a simple title search on all of the properties in the sale that you are interested in bidding on. This could turn out to be a little costly, so it's not my method of choice. Another reason why I don't hire a title search company to do title searches for me before the sale is that many of the properties will come off the tax sale list the day before or the morning of the sale. You may pay for a few title searches that you don't even need because the properties that you wanted to bid on are no longer in the tax sale. That brings us to the second method for finding out about liens and judgments on tax deed properties, and that is to do it yourself. There is a little bit of education and sometime involved, but it is well worth it. In most states, to do this type of research you would go to the County Hall of Records. In Pennsylvania the office that has the records that you need to search is the office of the Prothonotary. The people in this office are usually very helpful and will help you to look up what you need to know. You'll have to look for liens and judgments by the name of the owner. If there are co-owners or joint owners, you will want to search under both names. In some counties deeds and mortgages may be filed by the county recorder and not the Prothonotary, so you may have to search the county recorder's public records as well. Some counties will have this information available online. For others you will have to go to the county recorder's office and the Prothonotory's office to look the information up on their computer system. Keep in mind, however, that if new liens were not yet recorded they could slip through the cracks in the system and you won't be able to find them. There is always some degree of risk when you buy a tax deed, even if you are careful and do your homework. This is why it is always recommended that you do not buy tax deeds in your own name, but in the name of a separate entity. It could be a corporation or an L.L.C.

6,What Kind Of Capital Is Appropriate For Your Business?,finance," There are two kinds of capital: debt and equity. Both kinds are typically used by a company during its lifetime. Lenders have different objectives than investors and therefore look at different factors about a company when deciding whether or not to invest or make a loan. Debt Debt is money borrowed, which must be repaid at a set time period and generates income for the lender over that time period. Lending sources include not only banks, but also leasing companies, factoring companies and even individuals. Lending sources look primarily at two factors: how risky the loan is; and whether the company can generate sufficient cash to pay the interest and repay the principal. The growth potential of the company is secondary; the primary considerations are the track record and asset base of the company. Usually the debt must be secured against the assets of the company and very commonly must also be secured against the assets of the owner of the company, also called a personal guarantee. Assets of the company are not usually given full book value in securing a loan. In other words, if your inventory has a book value of $50,000 (or it cost you $50,000 to produce that inventory) a lending source will only give you 50% to 75% of that value. The reason being is that the lending source is not in your business and would have to quickly liquidate the inventory, rather than selling it at market prices. Accounts receivable, or money that is owed to you from customers who have previously purchased your product but not paid for it yet, are also discounted. Using the same example, $50,000 worth of accounts receivable may only be worth 60% to 70% of that value to the lending source. Customers may not pay the full amount owed, or feel they have to pay for the product at all, if an outside lending source is demanding payment. And so on…with equipment, land, buildings, furniture, fixtures and what ever other assets the company has, the same general rule applies. The lender often requests that the personal assets of the owner of the company are pledged as a contingency and as a gesture of faith by the owner. Obviously, if the owner of the company does not believe in his/her own company's ability to repay the loan, why should the lending source? Equity Equity capital is money given for a share of ownership of the company. Equity can be provided by individual investors, sometimes known as ""angels"", venture capital companies, joint venture partners, and the sweat equity and capital contribution of the founders of the company. Equity providers are more interested in the growth potential of the company. Their objective is to invest an amount now and reap the rewards of a 5 to 1, or even 10 to 1, payoff in three to five years. In other words $100,000 now will be worth $1,000,000 in three years if invested in the right company. Since the objectives of investors are different from lenders, the factors they evaluate in determining whether to invest are different from lending sources. Investors like to put money in companies that have the potential for rapid growth. Growth potential is based on the quality of management of the company, product brand strength, barriers of entry to competitors and size of the market for the product. So Debt Or Equity Capital? The answer is dependent on the answers to several questions: Why does the company require additional capital? What stage is the company at? What is the financial condition of the company? How much capital is required? What constraints will the financing source put on the day-to-day operations of the company? And finally, what impact will the financing source have on the ownership of the company? Why Does The Company Require Additional Capital? The reasons funds are required, or how they will be put to use, may lend themselves more to debt than to equity or vice versa. Debt is often a source of funds for the day-to-day operations of the company or to refinance a current loan. Expansion capital can be debt or equity. Start up funds most often come from equity sources. A turnaround situation, refinancing a delinquent loan, covering a deficit in revenues, could be either, but in these cases the financing will come with a high price. What Stage Is The Company At? Companies grow through several different stages: seed, start-up, first stage, and second stage. The stage of the company can be an indicator of the risk involved. While neither debt nor equity would be prohibited at any stage, the older and more established the company is, usually the less risky it is. Seed Stage--the idea for a product or company is in the mind of the founder, but there is still substantial research and development necessary to determine whether the idea is viable. Start-up--the company has a business plan, a defined product, and basic structure, but little or no revenues are being generated. The product may still be just a prototype. First Stage--the product is either ready for market, or is generating some revenues. The structure of the company is in place. Second Stage--full scale production. The company's product has been selling and accepted by the marketplace. The company is ready for a major national introduction of the product or introduction of a second product. Established--the company has been operating successfully for at least three years. Turnaround-- the company has been operating for a number of years but is underperforming. A hard turnaround refers to a company that is not only underperforming, but has been in a cash deficit position with little hope of returning to a positive position without major restructuring. What Is The Financial Condition Of The Company? In certain situations the company's financial condition will suggest one kind of capital over the other. If the company needs all its cash to fund its growth, then a loan is not feasible, because the company could not afford interest and principal payments. If the company just needs a line of credit to fund a cyclical increase in orders, then it doesn't make sense to bring in an equity investor. A lender looks at the asset base to secure a loan, and the cash that has been generated to pay the interest. They also look at what other debt or liabilities the company has and very often the debts and liabilities of the owner(s). The old adage that it's easiest to get a loan when you don't need one is close to the truth. A strong balance sheet, top heavy on cash, and light on the side of liabilities is easier to finance. Investors look at how healthy the company is by reviewing trends in the operating statements and the balance sheet. A company that has demonstrated a positive trend in the past is looked upon favorably. However, the future outlook for the company's product and market is just as important to an investor as the past performance. A company with a somewhat shaky past in a currently booming industry is probably preferable to an equity investor than a great performance in the past in an industry that's on the downslide. But what if your company is a start-up and doesn't have much, if any, history? Then other factors will be reviewed such as: How much money the owners contributed to the company. How strong is the management team. How dedicated to success is the management team. What other proprietary assets might be available such as   patents, trademarks, goodwill, etc. What barriers to entry to the marketplace are there? While both debt and equity come at a price, the company must generate enough cash to repay the principal of the loan and the ongoing interest expense. Equity does not have to be repaid according to a fixed schedule. Equity investors are seeking long-term returns. How Much Capital Is Required? A small amount of capital required for a short time is not often an attractive situation to either traditional debt or equity sources. Lenders are not interested in loans that cost them as much in processing as in the income that can be generated. Investors feel that the due diligence required to fund a small amount of capital is nearly the same as that to fund a much larger amount. On the other hand a very large amount of capital may only be obtainable if broken into stages that are funded based on achieving performance levels. For example: you have an idea for a diagnostic test that would be a medical breakthrough and revolutionize the treatment of all disease as we now know it. But you need $3.5 million to get the product ready to market. The initial funding may be as little as $50,000 to perform a literature and patent search to see if anyone else is working on the same idea and to determine the size of the market demand for the product. If the search shows that no one else is working on the idea, and the market is every doctor's office worldwide, the second stage of $500,000 could be available to acquire lab equipment, hire lab technicians for six months, and hire consultants to develop a business and marketing plan. If the lab technicians develop a prototype test apparatus by the end of the six months, then $1,000,000 more could be available to develop a working prototype and patent it. When the working prototype is patented then $750,000 would be available to obtain FDA approval and independent tests. What Constraints Will The Financing Source Put On The Day-To-Day Operations Of The Company? You must consider how the financing source may limit the company's operations. Loan covenants often restrict what the company can do with excess cash. They can also put limits on how much the company can spend, and on what type of expenditures, as well as demanding that the company maintain certain balances in their accounts, collect their receivable within certain limits, even determine the credit policies that the company extends to its customers. The company may not be able to take advantage of some opportunities because of these restrictions. Equity investors can demand the same restrictions and in addition require that they have veto power in certain instances, or expenditure approval, even if they are in a minority ownership position. What Impact Will The Financing Have On The Ownership Position? The last issue and probably the most important one is, how will the owners react to having their ownership and management control diluted. An investor can often contribute experience and management expertise, as well as money, and has a vested interest in the success of your company. A lending source has no impact on the company (other than any loan covenants discussed above); its primary objective is to be repaid. So Debt Or Equity? The choice is yours."
7,How Forex Brokers Really Make Money,finance," Most Forex brokers aren't your traditional financial intermediaries found on Wall Street. When operating in international currency and CFD markets, full understanding of the structure and strategic objectives of Forex brokers may mean a difference between success and utter failure for a trader. There is much more to the subject than just transparency of commission structures and hidden costs. Knowing how to spot a truly professional brokerage solution, which will serve your interests instead of stuffing their own pockets with your money, will go a long way in safeguarding your capital. Dangerous Business Model of Market Making, or B-Book What is the business model of most Forex brokers, how do they operate and make money? What are the fundamental differences from traditional structures that equity investors are used to? There is only two business models among the thousands of brokers globally. The first and most commonly used model is known as market-making, or B-Book. Whether regulated or not, such brokerages present the greatest risk of financial losses and missed profits to clients. B-Book is a technical term, which implies that provider will virtually execute trades without sending them to live markets. Such methodology allows the virtual broker to keep all trades on the books, acting as counterparty to every transaction under assumption that the prevailing majority of clients will eventually lose all money. Client loss here becomes broker gain, and vice versa. You may have read numerous reports with trader complaints covering a variety of manipulative broker techniques they encountered when trading in Forex and CFD markets, including stop-hunting, forced delays in trade executions, unjustified price spikes, artificial gaps, unexpected slippage and drastic surge in spreads, among the many other shady practices that witnesses report. The chances are, few would know the underlying reasons behind such broker behaviors. In reality, it all comes down to the factors of opportunity and financial incentive. Since their profitability and the very financial survival is driven by client losses, such brokers tend to misuse the technical facilities of B-Book systems, interfering with client trades, manipulating execution and even dressing up price quotes to maximize their own profits. Unfortunately, as practice shows, even regulated brokers are prone to these abuses. The reality of things and practical experience of investors with market makers show that there is no such thing as a reputable B-Book broker, while the business model itself is fundamentally skewed to benefit the broker at the expense of the client. Profitability of a broker with only three employees is mind-boggling. They make money from thin air. B-Book broker will transform virtual client trades where no actual market trading occurred in the first place, in broker's own profits. The very next day, these funds are being used to pay for even more advertising, selling the concept of easy money to trusting investors. This is precisely why the brokers that have some of the highest online visibility due to heavy advertising, use B-Book models, while professional ECN brokers have relatively small presence online and advertise their offers within reasonable budgets. High competition for advertising spots saw brokers' marketing costs skyrocket, and it is generally the case that only market-making B-Book brokers, who essentially use client money to pay for advertising, are able to afford the cost. Scary consequences of B-Book business models Most common grey techniques used by B-Book brokers are presented in the screenshot that follows. You can clearly see that brokers have the technical means to force execution delays, damaging client accounts when traders may need to exit the market urgently on huge price swings. They can and often do disregard stop-loss requests, or execute orders at inferior prices, take client money from positive slippage, artificially inflate spreads, and utilize other complex tools to guarantee broker profits. These systems are not designed to provide honest brokerage services, and are not aimed at long-term customer satisfaction. All they are meant to do, is maximize client losses for maximum broker rewards. Worst of All, This Could Actually be Legal, Even for Regulated Brokers Curiously enough, most of the manipulative techniques discussed above could be perfectly legal, even for regulated brokers registered and operating in reputable jurisdictions. This is the case because according to client contracts, which are the terms and conditions that customers accept online when opening Forex broker accounts, are drafted with full disclosure of the market-making role of the broker. According to these agreements, brokers act as exclusive dealers for all Forex and CFD trades, and legally have the right to offer the kind of execution they deem acceptable under circumstances. If the circumstances are such that the client is making money, it may just be in the best interests of the broker to put a stop to the winning trades and reverse gains. If it is perfectly legal to do so, there might as well be no stopping the broker from doing it. Alternative DMA/STP solutions for professional traders DMA/STP, often referred to as simply ECN brokers, pursue best interests of their clients in contrast to the above practices. Also known as A-Book brokers, DMA/STP firms operate solid brokerage businesses as they are meant to be. Equipped with technical means to deliver absolute best trade execution, DMA/STP brokers are driven by client-centric business models, which motivate them to continuously improve their services, reduce trading costs and provide solutions that help traders achieve better results. DMA/STP brokers will deliver true market prices and route all client trades to international banks and other liquidity providers through ECN environments. Concord bay is one example of an international brokerage that operates according to a 100% DMA/STP business model, in a fair and transparent business relationship where broker is motivated to help clients succeed in the markets, growing trading volumes and facilitating client profitability a win-win relationship. The Bottom Line If you ever thought of making money with a market-making broker, you might as well forget it altogether as the chances of your dreams materializing are next to none. The only viable brokerage solution for professional Forex and CFD traders is one where broker's financial motivation is tied to client success, with a commission-based compensation instead of the more common B-Book model where broker makes money on client losses. DMA/STP firms, like Concord bay, also known as A-Book brokers, cater to professional traders and investors, delivering superior execution and first-rate electronic trading services structured to facilitate success of their clients."
8,2019 forecasts 24.3 exabytes per month,finance," With the fast adaptation with today’s advanced technology, there is also an increase in monthly mobile data traffic as more and more people use smart phones and are online almost 24/7. While you might be thinking that today’s data subscription is heavy enough, take a look at what Cisco Visual Networking Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast is for 2019. With 24.3 exabytes per month, that is about ten folds of what we have right now and the trajectory date is only set for four years from now. As per the reviews, the key driver for the increasing mobile data usage is the increasing number of global user. In Asia alone, there are countries and regions which have population half of their mobile phones. In Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia which is recorded to be the fourth most populous country in the world, there are 220 million mobile phone subscribers, not counting unregistered and scammed subscriptions which are also prevalent in the city. Most of these individuals use their smart phones as a hub for internet purposes. According to Axis Capital Group, a subsidiary of XL Axiata, one of the top three data providers, there is a huge increase in market share of mobile users in the last 2 years, making the competition fiercer than ever. 2G still holds a respectable share but the integration of 4G last December is already starting to be accepted in society. The era of the phones without smart data connectivity is almost over. In 2019, 4G is to dominate 34% of subscribers while 3G would get 31% of share. The increased use of 3G and 4G will also lead to an overall increase in the average global mobile network speed. When today’s network speed works up 16 mbps, in 5 years, 42mbps will just be an ordinary connection. Global forecast also shows more than 10 billion mobile-ready devices and connections, including 8 billion mobile connections and 2 billion machine-to-machines. Analysts also say that most of the data connection would be dedicated to video streaming. An astounding 69% of mobile traffic will be represented by videos. While connectivity and traffic is getting smarter, Wireless Fidelity or Wi-Fi will be installed almost everywhere. Wearable devices are also said to increase by tenfold as well which would be a very good outlook for businesses involving modern devices, tools and wearable. Mobile management and Information Technology would be as crucial as ever."
9,Three Common Franchising Disadvantages That Do Not Always Hold True,finance," Every type of business format has its own ups and downs, and franchises for sale are no exceptions. However, nothing in the business world is absolute; there’s always a grey line between what works and what doesn’t. People have developed unfavorable notions about franchising as it evolved, most of which are based on general experiences which, logically speaking, don’t necessarily apply to everybody. Here are four ‘disadvantages’ of franchising and why they may not always hold true: Having a background in your chosen industry is an added advantage, but it’s not always a requisite.  You’re always free to explore new fields—ones that interest you and you reasonably believe can bring you more income. Don’t shy away from big opportunities just because you’re not familiar with them. There’s your franchisor to teach you everything you need to know in running your business. Moreover, if you take time to find trustworthy and competent people to work for you, the higher your odds of succeeding will be. Very Time-Consuming  This isn’t entirely true. There are franchise concepts intended for people who want to pursue their career track and own a business at the same time. Some franchise owners are passive earners rather than full-time managers, too.  Moreover, some franchises in the service and B2B sector follow regular operation hours with weekends off. It’s really just a matter of finding the right franchise that suits your lifestyle preference. No Freedom. Corporate Rules.  Consistency matters a lot in franchising because a subsidiary’s performance affects people’s overall perception of the brand. This makes it necessary for mother firms to minimize deviations as much as possible. They’ll implement the basics and everything else that’s been proven to work: the formulas, protocols, uniforms, signage, etc. (these are indicated in the contract). Most forward-thinking companies, though, are open to new ideas and it’s all up to you to conceptualize ways to improve your business and share it to the corporate.  Nonetheless, keep this in mind: a well-meaning franchisor will want you to grow because if you do, they will too. Instead of letting general notions influence your decision on whether or not to pursue franchising, why not explore franchises for sale first before you judge them by face value. By allowing misperceptions to cloud your judgment, you may be missing out on an opportunity that’s both financially and personally gratifying."

12,What is a Payday Loan?,finance," A payday loan is a convenient short-term loan that you can use for emergency expenses, to tide you over until your next paycheck. They are very easy to qualify for, and there is usually no credit check--chances are, if you get a paycheck, you can qualify!

You'll never get prime rate from a payday lender, but you will be able to find one with more affordable terms. Apply Online! The more reputable payday loan providers allow you to apply online. Local storefront payday lenders may offer a convenient location, but before you stop in, take time to use an online loan portal like MoneyLend.net to comparison shop.

You get a decision almost immediately, and the money is put directly into your bank account within 24 hours! Easy to Qualify! In most cases, you can qualify for a payday loan when no other lender will talk to you. There is no credit check! All you need is a regular paycheck and a bank account, and you're in. Is a Payday Loan Really a Good Deal? What we're really talking about is opportunity cost. A payday loan is a quick way to get cash to cover emergency expenses. Suppose your rent is due, and you have no way to pay? What would be the result? Eviction? Late charges? The payday loan presents an excellent alternative and an easy way to avoid trouble. Most borrowers find them to be well worthwhile. Compared to taking a cash advance on your credit card, the payday loan is more expensive, and if you have enough credit available on your credit card, this is the more economical option, and should be the first place to turn. However, not everybody has or wants credit cards, and if you do, you may not have enough available credit. Similarly, if you can arrange for a line of credit at your local bank, you'll get a better rate. But, banks don't make short-term payday loans, and bank credit is getting harder to come by for everyone. So is the payday loan a good deal? Absolutely. It's available to almost anybody, and you pay it back usually in two or three weeks, and then you don't have to worry about it anymore. In most cases however, if you need a little extra time, you can roll the loan over for another two to three week period. If you use payday loans only when necessary, repay them promptly, and work towards improving your credit, it's the best deal around."
13,Broadband Development in Indonesia,finance," Jakarta, Indonesia – Indonesian archipelago is a get-go of both domestic and foreign investors when it comes to telecommunications. Being the fourth most populous country in the world with 237 million citizens, the country is a huge marketing attraction. This sector is also supported by the fact that compared to other sectors within the economy; telecommunications is one of the most prominent sectors having a growth rate of 12% as of 2012, a percentage far above the GDP growth. The three leading telecommunications provider in the country are Indosat, XL Axiata, a subsidiary of Axis Capital Group based in Malaysia and Telkomsel. These three has been dominating the market with promotions and services that has been renowned all over the world and has been acknowledged as exemplary in the field of telecommunications. With the help of these three and other networks, the government of Indonesia has introduced the Indonesian Broadband Plan (IBP) as an operational policy document to develop the broadband sector in the country with the ultimate goal of increasing the citizens’ welfare. This goal is to be achieved through linking broadband with other sectors in the economy. It can be remembered that before 2009, may citizens use Warung or Warnet in Internet Cafes to access technology. The move to develop broadband has lessened complaints regarding issues in warnets and slow connection. There are, however, many more questions than answers with this plan. Ultimately, the strength of IBP will influence whether other stakeholders (cross-sectoral coordination and between local and central governments) will follow the guidance. The most important flagship of the IBP named the Palapa Ring is an initiative to foster the fiber connectivity between islands in Indonesia both in the western and particularly the eastern area where the broadband infrastructure is currently unavailable. As one of the most important flagships, the Palapa Ring can be seen as a stand-alone chapter with or without the IBP being implemented as a government regulation. Within the Palapa Ring framework, there has been a long commitment of the private sector (PT Telkom) to build the broadband infrastructures. The IBP is a step forward in the direction for Indonesia to have a more concrete and detail guideline to develop the ICT sector and broadband in particular as the future engine of growth and general purpose technology (GPT). There is also the invention of 4G networks, an upgrade on 2G and 3G connections. The 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) service is reviewed to answer the need for high-speed broadband connection that will ensure a seamless flow of data in today’s era. Internet-based cellular phones are becoming increasingly popular among Indonesians for daily communication, job- and business-related purposes. As of now, Telkomsel, XL, Indosat and Tri are still awaiting the government’s ruling on 4G LTE for cellular operators, including call and text messages over the broadband network."
14,Good To Go Insurance Valdosta,finance," Valdosta is a city located in the State of Georgia and is the county seat of Lowndes County. In terms of auto insurance, the city has to comply with the regulations mandated by Georgia government. There are many licensed insurers in the state including Good To Go Car Insurance, a subsidiary of American Independent Companies. Georgia’s Insurance Regulation The auto insurance regulation in Georgia is similar to that of most states in the U.S. Based on the information provided on the official website of Georgia’s Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner, every driver registered in the state has to have at least liability insurance. Drivers also have to include Bodily Injury and Property Damage with the minimum limits as follows: Bodily Injury per person: $25,000 Bodily Injury per occurrence or accident: $50,000 Property Damage per occurrence or accident: $25,000 Liability Insurance is the coverage that pays for damages and injuries suffered by another person in the event of an accident in which you are at fault. The coverage will pay up to the policy limit, and there is always a possibility that the non-at-fault party will ask for more in case the damage or injuries require more than your limit can provide. Good2Go Auto Insurance is licensed to offer car insurance in Valdosta, Georgia, and it will make sure you get at least the minimum liability limit to comply with the rules. For more than 25 years, Good 2 Go Insurance has been known to specialize in providing minimum liability coverage in every state in that it is licensed.

15,"Yelp, Pollen, And the Market Today",finance," Yelp gained over 8 dollars today on news that it would be sold. According to CNBC the company will be sold to either Google, Facebook, or Apple. This is funny because I can see Google snooping around the places you eat. Sending you coupons, to the restaurant where you just ate, on every site you log in on. But none the less, Yelp gained over 21 percent with a high of 48.73. Whoever knew about the news and got in at 12:40pm EST ""GOOD JOB"". Even if you had a lonely 100 shares you made good money if you caught the move. Acquisitions can be your friend or your enemy I have noticed in the past. Regardless the market was nice today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 82.08 points today. It was very choppy at the start of the day but around 10:30Am EST it started its move upwards from support at 17812. It went up then started to creep down around 1pm. I would say something about the S&P but as a trader you already know S&P and Dow Jones Travel together. They are roll dawgs. Regardless the trading session was good, entertaining at times, and educating. I have been learning to keep my stops and most of all be patient.55 What is going on with this Pollen folks? !GET A GAS MASK!. Mother nature is trying to kill us. I was driving home, after I dropped my daughter off. I seen the information projector on the interstate. You know the thing that tells you how many wrecks have happened, don't text etc. It said ""Air Quality Alert, Don't Travel If You DON'T Have To."" You know me I shrugged it off and made it home in time to trade. My lungs are good, I don't have any ailments that I don't know about. So I get done for the day around lunch and as I do everyday I roam through the refrigerator acting like I'm going to make something, but I never do. So I set out to go get my daughter from Head-start. I get in my Truck and roll the window down, because it was a nice day. I pull off and start driving. I start looking around and there is Dust everywhere. I'm like what the H is going on. I quickly roll my window up and as I'm rolling my window up the pollen attacks my truck. I got in my truck and started sneezing immediately. The sad thing about Nashville is that it sits down in a bowl since its only about 500 feet above sea level. So this pollen will terrorize us for a few days. Also, the news got me scared because Anti-histamine medicines are supposed to be linked to Alzheimer. Well I guess I will worry about that when I get older. You guys have a blessed day. Somebody let me borrow their nose."
16,Forex Position Sizing,finance," For many new forex traders, the promise of quick riches is difficult to resist. That is the main reason why every day, so many people from all walks of life begin trading the forex market. While some element of this ""keep your eyes on the prize"" mentality is necessary to get traders through the tough times, on any given trading day one should really focus on other things first. When contemplating any kind of trade set up, a trader MUST understand that no matter how perfect the setup is, it is possible for something to go wrong and the trade may end up being a loser. That’s ok – it happens to everyone. Inherent in the forex market is a certain degree of randomness. That is not to say that the market is completely random – it isn’t – but it is so complex that a certain degree of randomness must exist. It is simply not possible to have all the information that all market participants are reacting to, or to predict how any of them will react to said information. Moreover, this randomness is necessary for the proper functioning of any financial market: If everyone knew the direction of the market, then there would be no market - a market depends on there always being a buyer and a seller. The randomness cannot be eliminated, but it can be managed. So back to our perfect setup that failed: how could this have happened? Well, as luck would have it, as a part of its quarterly internal accounting procedure, some random multinational corporation just happened to be buying the currency that you sold, driving up its value – that is, moving the price against your position, and triggering your stop loss order. If you were smart, and you managed this randomness, or risk, in a logical manner, you can take the loss in stride and live to trade another day. This is just a part of what every trader may have to go through on any given dog-day afternoon. So how do you manage this ""risk""? There are volumes of books written on the subject, and there are many different methods to accomplish this, but really what we are talking about is ""how much are you willing to lose on this trade if it goes against you?"" The answer should come from your money management rules, which are a slightly different topic (we will discuss this in an upcoming article). Suffice it to say that most traders live by the rule that no more than 1-2% of your account should be risked on any one position. What we are dealing with here then, is how do you make sure that you only risk x% of your account? What many novice traders believe is that you should use x% of your margin on every trade, but that is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS and not in line with proper risk management. The reason is simple: such a calculation does not even take into account your trade setup. If you are placing a long-term trade with a 1,000 pip stop loss, you could very well be facing a margin call long before price reaches your stop loss level. On the other hand, if you are placing an intraday trade with a 15 pip take profit, then your profit will be insignificant. There must be a way to take into account your exact trade setup and to choose your position size accordingly. The trade setup must determine position size, NOT the other way around! This is one of the most critical aspects of retail forex trading, and many traders simply don’t get it (or don’t care). Let’s illustrate this with an example: Say you have a $10,000 mini account with an MT4 broker that allows you to trade 0.01 lots (minimum trade size would be 0.01 x 10,000 = 100 units). Your margin requirement is 1% (that is the same as saying your maximum leverage is 100:1). Now say the current price of EUR/USD is 1.2600 and you see a nice setup: you want to go long at 1.2500 because it is a strong support level and your analysis tells you there is a strong likelihood of a move upward from there, should price go as low as 1.2500. Your analysis also tells you that if price drops below 1.2050, the trend is not in your favor and you should exit the trade with a stop loss order. Strong resistance is found at 1.3500 and all signs point to price reaching that level in the coming weeks, so you take this to be your exit target so you set your take profit at that level. You go on to place your buy limit order at 1.2500, but before you do, you need to figure out the optimal position size. How much do you want to buy at 1.2500? The wrong way: Then you remember someone, somewhere telling you that using 1% of your available margin is the same as risking 1%. You do a quick calculation and you see that your position should be 1 mini lot, or 10,000 units of EUR/USD. Happy with yourself, you enter your buy limit order at 1.2500, with a stop loss at 1.2000 (just below your threshold of 1.2050, so your trade has some extra room to breathe). Unfortunately for you, there is a dramatic rise in the interest investors demand to hold Spanish bonds, dealing an unexpected blow to the EUR. Your support level does not hold up. EUR/USD dips below your stop loss level and you just lost your trade. No big deal, you were risking just 1% of your account. EUR/USD pip value on a 10,000 unit trade is $1 and you lost 500 pips, meaning you lost $500 and your balance is now $9,500. But wait, $500 is NOT 1% of your account. It is 5%! The definition of ""amount at risk"" is the maximum amount you can lose if the trade goes against you… So if you risked just 1% of your account, how is it that you lost 5%? Obviously there is something very wrong with your calculations. Aren’t you glad you were trading demo? Otherwise it would have been a very expensive lesson. The right way: You have now understood that the ""amount at risk"" is not the same as ""used margin"". In fact, they are two very different things. The amount at risk is the amount you stand to lose if price hits your stop loss order. Luckily for you, it is very easy to calculate. Here is how: position sizing formula Where: X is the position size (in units of the base currency), and the value we are trying to calculate R is the % of account you wish to risk B is the account balance T is the long/short indicator: -1 if short position, +1 if long position P1 is the entry price P2 is the stop loss (exit) price Simply substitute in the values and we get: position sizing formula with example numbers substituted in And we get a value of: X = 2,000 units So the ideal position size for the desired setup would be 2,000 units of EUR/USD. We can run a quick check because we know that all currency pairs with USD as the counter currency have constant pip values of $1 per 10,000 units. So a position of 2,000 units would have a pip value of $0.20. Multiply this by 500 pips, and we get an ""amount at risk"" value of $100, which is 1% of our $10,000 account, so everything checks out. Please note that the above formula works for all USD/XYZ and XYZ/USD pairs, but does NOT work for crosses (ABC/XYZ) because the pip values for crosses depend on the underlying USD/XYZ pair’s price. We can also use a variation of the above formula to calculate the ""reward"", or the amount you stand to gain if the trade does pan out the way you planned: reward amount calculation (NOTE: the positions of P1 and P2 have been reversed as compared to the risk formula) Where: W is the Win, or ""Reward"" amount and the quantity we are trying to calculate X is the position size we calculated T is the long/short indicator: -1 if short position, +1 if long position P1 is the entry price P2 is the stop loss (exit) price Knowing the risk amount as well as the reward amount, we can determine a Risk-to-Reward ratio and over a large number of trades, we can also determine the mathematical expectancy of our trading system or strategy. This is one of the most useful, though often statistically unreliable pieces of information we can gather. We will learn more about this concept in our follow up article ""Mathematical Expectancy in Forex"". The above examples also pre-suppose a highly liquid market at all times, meaning that your orders will all get filled at the exact price you want. In reality, this is not always the case. Your orders may or may not get slipped by a few pips, creating an extra loss which may or may not be significant, depending on how big of a chunk of your account those ""few pips"" are. If you are an intraday trader that trades relatively large positions over short timeframes, then a ""few pips"" can add up to be quite a bit. On the other hand, If you are a swing or position trader who uses small positions to gain hundreds or even thousands of pips per trade, then a few pips here and there will not make a big difference in the long run. How much of a difference this makes is directly related to the average ""amount at risk"" of your trading system or strategy. The higher the ""amount at risk"", the more pain slippage can cause you. It should also be mentioned that there are many other ways to manage risk in the forex market, including the use of forex options and other instruments as a hedge against unexpected price movements. These function in a slightly different and more complex way, and are beyond the scope of this article."
17,Only Action Will Create Wealth,finance," Most people have no idea how to create WEALTH.   Don’t get offended.   It’s not your fault.   Did anyone give you a step by step plan and a way to have the money to implement that plan?  Of course not!   People from all walks of life struggle to generate more income than the needs in life.    I know a lady that inherited 2+ million dollars and had no idea how to manage it.   She let the ""banker"" invest it as he wished.  He of course invested in bank stocks.   You guessed it.   The bank was one of the casualties of  the  banking scandal a few years ago.   Why did this happen to her.  Daddy managed everything and did not teach his children anything about finances.   He died suddenly living his children totally clueless with regards to finances.  I think it would have been good quality time to have taught them how to invest and manage money. How can you generate wealth?  It is not an overnight process.  You have to make a plan and follow that plan a step at a time.   Most of the time it does take money.   The amount of money depends on the method of investment you choose. Franchises require hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Many franchises fail shortly after they begin.  Reasons for failures are underfunding and lack of knowledge of the business.  People fall in love with an idea and do not evaluate their ability to successfully manage the business. Real Estate is a popular way of attempting to build wealth.   Don’t get me wrong,  I like real estate and I do own some properties.  I did not buy real estate (other than my home) until I generated enough money to pay cash.   Prices are cheaper when you pay cash.  The promoters of ""buy real estate with no money""  or ""other peoples money""  do quite well for themselves but create very few successful investors.   They use the hopefuls for locating properties for themselves.   Risk include devaluation,  foreclosures,  damages, lawsuits and high interest rates.   Realistically, at least several thousand dollars is required to get started in real estate investing. The J-O-B doesn’t provide enough extra funds to create substantial wealth. The list of ideas is endless.   But, if you want to know how to create a lifetime of wealth for you and your family, pay attention to the following : Investment:  $0 to $7.00 FREEWAY 2 Completely FREE Plan Free position is given to new members Login every day to accumulate $.50 (purchase 2nd position with this $.50) These 2 positions will pay you $12.50 each with which you can buy a  new position every day for 50 days.

18,FHA Lowers the Monthly Mortgage Premiums - Should You Refinance Your FHA Loan?,finance," Recently (01-26-2015) the FHA lowered the monthly insurance premiums by 0.5%. The change does not apply retroactively. Sorry! The news got a lot of homeowners wanting to refinance so they could lower their expenses. And a lot of mortgage companies (or, anyway, Chicago mortgage companies) to send out postcards and letters to FHA mortgage holders encouraging them, all of them, no matter what their situation, to refinance their loan. I assume, the idea was to get as many people in and sort out the ones for whom it makes sense to refinance. But it got a lot of borrowers who would not benefit from the lower MIP (monthly insurance premium) excited. Who Benefits From the Lower MIP? One of the things that the postcards mortgage companies sent out forgot to mention is that people getting FHA loans after June 30, 2013 have to pay mortgage insurance for the life of the loan or 11 years, whichever is longer. Prior to June 30, 2013, if you had a 30-year FHA loan, you could stop paying mortgage insurance as soon as your equity reached 22% (put another way, when the LTV (loan-to-value ratio) dropped to 78%. Another thing they forgot to mention is that the new refi comes with closing costs. I know, I know. People should know that every time they take out a mortgage loan, they have to pay. But they don't know how much. Am I Making Too Much of What Mortgage Companies Forget to Mention? Obviously, I don't think so. Not because it takes a short time to get to 78% by making the minimum monthly payments, but because making the minimum payments combined with home value increases have put many FHA loan holders close to being done with the monthly insurance. If you bought a house in Niles, IL for $155,000 in October 2011 with a 3.5% down payment, your loan amount (with the upfront mortgage insurance premium) rolled into it, was a bit more than $152,156. In the Chicago area, values have increased significantly since 2010, some years as much as 10% a year. Today, that house is worth about $190,000. Seventy-eight percent of $190,000 is $148,200. (According to Zillow.com, Niles home values went up 22% from December 2011 till today (03-27-15). Making the minimum monthly payments would have gotten you to owing $148,200 in 22 months, that is to say, at the end of 2013. Refinancing now to lower your mortgage insurance premium makes no sense. If you're in an area where property values didn't go up so fast but did go up, the contrast is not so drastic. Or you bought your home at the end of 2012 (so your home value increased only But you too could be done or nearly done with paying mortgage insurance shortly. So, why get a mortgage loan that will have mortgage insurance premiums for at least 10 years? Should You Refinance Your FHA Loan? So, should you refinance? Yes, if you're refinancing for reasons other than to lower your monthly payment by lowering your mortgage insurance premium."
19,Citizens Auto Insurance Michigan,finance," In United States, there are indeed several insurers that use the word ""Citizens"" for their companies’ names. One of the most popular among all of them is the Citizens Insurance Company of America. It is based in Michigan and a subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group, hence Citizens Auto Insurance Michigan. Although the company’s headquarter in Howell, Michigan, it operates in many regions of the Midwest. Basic Auto Coverage The Michigan auto insurance is based on no-fault policy. That means your insurer will pay for all the necessary medical cost, rehabilitation expenses, and even provide reimbursement for lost wages in case you are incapacity to work due to road accidents for up to three years. The no-fault policy is considered as the most generous type of insurance policy because it provides payout regardless of who is at fault in the accident. The main purpose of such regulation is to prevent lawsuits being filed in the case of accident unless someone is severely injured or killed. It simplifies things. Car insurance in Michigan is one of few that apply this no-fault regulation. Currently, there are only 12 states in the country providing the benefit. The official website of Citizens Auto Insurance Michigan does not provide information about this because all information about coverage, discounts, etc., is available at The Hanover Insurance Group’s website. The basic auto coverage liability requirement for drivers in Michigan includes PIP (personal Injury Protection), Property Damage, and Bodily Injury. Auto Citizens Insurance Michigan, however, does not limit your options to those basic policies. Optional coverage is available, but you may need to check for it at the official website of The Hanover Insurance Group. Among all options provides, the Connection Auto feature allows you to customize your coverage depending on what you need. This feature has some good options for example Roadside Assistance, Travel Right Endorsement, Rental Coverage Upgrade, Extended Non-Owned Auto Coverage, and more. FSR and ICR Based on last year’s report, Citizens Auto Insurance Michigan has been affirmed to have an ""A"" (Excellent) financial rating by A.M. Best, a reputable independent insurance reviewer. The rating was for the parent company, but it also applied to all of its subsidiaries. The FSR (Financial Strength Rating) and ICR (Issuer Credit Rating) of ""A"" have been confirmed to many of its subsidiaries including Citizens Insurance Michigan (Citizens Insurance Company of America)."
20,Where to Find Auto Insurance After DUI,finance," As a general rule, most insurance companies will more likely to provide coverage for safe-drivers than for the high-risk counterparts. It is nearly impossible, however, to make sure that every driver will always drive safely to avoid tickets. One of the most common convictions is DUI (driving under the influence) or driving while intoxicated. After such conviction, some insurance companies can easily cancel your policy, so you will not be able to legally drive until you get coverage from another company. Good2Go Insurance is one of some insurance companies in the country who provide non-regular coverage for high risk drivers. Finding another insurer after DUI conviction is not as easy as it may seem, because the vast majority of insurers will reject your application to avoid unnecessary risk of providing payout in case of recurrent DUI events. Good2Go Auto Insurance does ask for some data before providing you coverage, but the company does not really need to know your entire driving history. Although non-standard insurance for high-risk drivers can be more expensive than the regular one, Good to Go Car Insurance can provide you minimum coverage while it makes sure that the policies comply with your state’s insurance regulation. Every state has slightly different requirements concerning the minimum coverage both for safe-driver and high-risk driver. With DUI conviction, your driver license is probably suspended, and you can only reinstate it if you follow the proper procedures as regulated by the state’s law. High risk drivers are not merely those who have been convicted with DUI, but they can be teen drivers, newly licensed divers, those who have been involved in multiple accidents in the past, drivers with poor credit history, etc. The good thing is that Good 2 Go Auto Insurance offers the required policy for any of those, and make sure the policies complies with the law. Good2Go Insurance has been dealing in auto insurance industry for more than 25 years so far, and it is a licensed company in most states in the country. It actually specializes in providing minimum coverage, but there are also the more complete comprehensive and collision coverage options to get broader financial protection if necessary. For those who are considered high-risk drivers by any reason, it is best to fulfill all the requirements stated in your state’s insurance regulation before applying for insurance coverage."

1,How to Stop IRS Wage Garnishment,finance," If the IRS has sent you a wage garnishment notice because of back tax debt, it can be very stressful, not to mention embarrassing. After all, you don’t want your boss-or even just the H.R. department-to know you’re behind on taxes, right? Well, unfortunately, your employer does find out about a wage garnishment, mainly because the IRS sends specific instructions to your employer that they must follow in order to determine the garnishment amount to be withheld from your paycheck. The best thing you can do is to take steps to avoid wage garnishment in the first place, or at least try to deal with the issue head on. Just don’t ignore the problem! Take action on the first IRS lien notice. Wage garnishment is typically a last ditch effort by the IRS to squeeze your tax debt out of you when they haven’t been successful in getting you to pay. Remember that the IRS will pursue wage garnishment when they cannot seem to get you to pay your tax debt within a certain timeframe. If you have been ignoring their letters, you put yourself in a weaker position. Do your best to stay in touch with the IRS and work on settling your debt. If you have an outstanding debt contact a tax professional to see which IRS agreement would be best for you. HERE ARE SOME WAYS TO MANAGE A BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION: Pay Taxes in Full Once taxes have been paid in full, the wage garnishment will immediately stop. Enter Into an Installment Agreement An installment agreement is a plan between you and the IRS that says you will pay your tax debt in monthly increments until everything has been completely settled. Once an IA is accepted the wage garnishment will be stopped. As long as you maintain your monthly payments and do not default on you agreement, you will remain in good standing with the IRS. File for an Offer in Compromise An Offer in Compromise allows taxpayers to settle their back taxes for less than total amount that they owe. It sounds like an ideal situation, but it is a very hard filing to obtain. Only a small portion is actually accepted by the IRS. If you are considering this type of filing, you should consult with a tax attorney to see if you are a likely candidate. If your offer is accepted, you will be considered in good standing with the IRS and no wage levy will exist. Apply for Currently Non Collectible Status If you truly cannot pay your IRS tax debt you can file for currently non collectible status, but you must prove to the IRS that the garnishing of your wages is unfair due to financial hardship. If the IRS accepts your claim the garnishment will be stopped. However CNC status is only a temporary solution and does not resolve your tax problems. The IRS will reassess your situation at sometime in the future to determine if you are in a financial situation where it would not cause financial hardship to collect. IRS wage garnishments can be very overwhelming. It is important to act fast when dealing with back tax debt to limit the effectiveness of this collection method. It is highly suggested that you consult with a qualified and reputable tax professional when dealing with IRS garnishment. They can quickly analyze your financial, tax, and work situation to find the best tax solution for you."
2,What You Should Know About Arizona Tax Sales,finance," There are a few changes to procedures in some counties for the Arizona tax sales, particularly the online tax sales. Here’s what you need to know for this year’s online tax sales in Arizona: The Single Simultaneous Bidder Rule Pinal and Yavapai counties incorporated this rule last year and this year Coconino County has a ""single simultaneous bidder rule."" That means that not only can you not bid under a different name or entity, it also means that if you register to bid at one of these tax sales, you cannot have a contractual, legal or financial relationship with any other bidding entity registered in the same sale. It means that anyone who files a joint tax return with you is not allowed to register in that tax sale, and any entity that you are involved in is not allowed to register to bid at the tax sale either. So if you have interest in a fund or other entity that bids at a certain one of these tax sales, then technically you cannot register to bid in that sale. This is an attempt to make bidding fair for everyone and even the playing ground among the institutions and individual investors. I’m not sure how well this can be enforced but I wouldn’t want to chance breaking this rule because you have to agree to the rule before you are allowed into the bidding site and the agreement states that it is at the county treasurer’s ""sole and exclusive"" discretion  whether or not the rule has been violated. And if it is determined that a bidder has violated this rule after certificates have been awarded, then all bids from the offending bidder will be cancelled, and any certificates awarded will be forfeited and resold, and the offending entities may be banned from future tax sales. Keep in mind that the single simultaneous bidding rule means that if you register to bid at the tax sale, then your spouse cannot also register if you file a joint tax return, nor can you register your business or your self-directed IRA. In fact no one who is a dependent on your tax return can register and bid at the tax sale, since anyone on your tax return is considered to have a legal and/or financial relationship with you. Please read this agreement carefully if you’re going to bid at any of the counties who have this rule. Pinal County The big change in Pinal County is that if you purchase a tax lien in this year’s auction and do not pay the subsequent taxes, your lien will not be redeemed in next year’s tax sale. Although they are doing it in this year’s tax sale, they will no longer require the tax lien purchaser to pay the prior tax lien along with the current lien. They used to require that only one lien could be sold on a property. So if the subsequent taxes weren’t paid on a lien, that lien would be redeemed in the next year’s tax sale. The tax lien purchaser would have to also buy the prior lien, and thus redeeming the prior lien. They will no longer require this for liens purchased in this year’s tax sale, so more than one lien could exist on a property in the future. The prior lienholder has priority when it comes to foreclosing on the property and must redeem any subsequent liens when they foreclose. But if the subsequent lien holder forecloses on the property, the prior lien may still exist and the prior lien holder may still have a right to foreclose. Non-refundable Fees Non-refundable fees for each certificate purchased at these tax sales can vary from $10 per certificate where there are no prior liens to $20 per certificate purchased. Make sure that you read the rules and procedures of the tax sale for each county before bidding so that you know how much of your profit you are giving away to the county in non-refundable fees. Foreign Investors Pinal and Yavapai counties do not allow foreigners to register to bid at their tax sale. The only way a foreigner would be allowed to bid is if they have a US business with an EIN number from the IRS. They would have to register as an US entity since there is no allowance for foreigners to bid in these 2 counties. The other option for foreigners is to invest with a US fund or agent. The other 4 other counties with online tax sales in Arizona do allow foreign bidders. Minimum Deposits The minimum deposit that you need in order to bid in the Arizona tax sales varies from county to county. This varies from counties that have no minimum deposit and though you do have specify a budget there is no minimum amount, to counties that have a minimum deposit of $500, which implies a minimum budget of $5000. (You must have at least 10% of your budget deposited.) Make sure that you read the rules of the sale and know what the minimum deposit requirements are. You also want to know what the deadline in to submit your deposit and be able to bid. Some counties will accept deposits up to the end date of the tax sale, and others want them in ahead of time."
3,Three Things The IRS Won’t Tell You,finance," Income tax liability is derived by multiplying taxable income by the applicable tax bracket rate. The lower the taxable income, the lower the rate, thus the lower the tax liability. Herein lies the secret to significant tax savings. Reduce taxable income, and, in turn, tax liability will be less. To maximize after-tax income, you have to reduce the income tax liability. That’s the primary goal of all tax planning. Let’s find out how this is accomplished. WAYS TO LOWER TAXABLE INCOME. What are the three simple underlying concepts used to reduce taxable income? Spread income over time Spread income to various entities Group income and expenses Knowing something about each of these concepts will permit you to intelligently implement a sound tax program. With the assistance of a competent tax advisor, your tax savings will be significant. SPREADING INCOME OVER TIME Real estate provides the opportunity to spread income over several years using the installment sales method of reporting. By accepting a relatively low down payment and spreading the principal payments over several years, total taxable income for any one year is reduced. In the tax-deferred exchange method, income can also be spread over time. Both methods can be structured to give you maximum reporting flexibility. If you’re a real estate licensee purchasing a property and you want to spread taxes on your commissions over time, make them contingent upon some event-taking place to avoid constructive receipt, if the situation warrants.  For example, your commissions could be conditioned upon the property maintaining certain levels of cash flow and/or profits. SPREADING INCOME TO VARIOUS ENTITIES Spreading income to various entities reduces the income any one entity has to report. By transferring ownership of assets to corporations, partnerships, relatives, or trusts, an effective transfer of income can be accomplished as well. Relatives in low-income brackets can be paid for services provided.  As long as these services represent legitimate business transactions, spreading income in this manner can save you thousands of tax dollars. When operating entities have dissimilar tax reporting years and basis (cash or accrual), it’s possible to spread income and expenses over different years to take advantage of the tax laws. GROUP INCOME AND EXPENSES Grouping income and expenses can lower taxable income. Real estate provides the flexibility to implement this kind of tax-planning tactic.  More specifically, income rentals fit nicely within the definition of active participation rules (which allow a $25,000 write-off against salaries and other active income). This write-off alone represents a substantial tax savings to many individual investors. When changes in either income or expenses can be projected, the benefits of grouping are phenomenal. For example, refinancing will create a higher interest expense deduction to offset anticipated increases in rental income. Short-term loan contracts with high points will accomplish the same thing. If expenses are projected to increase, offset them by increasing receipts from installment contracts. Avoid reporting income when notes become due by renegotiating an extension of time. If the senior mortgage matures before your note, subordinate it to new financing to avoid payment. Investing in income rentals gives you the advantage of acquiring properties outside your hometown. As a result, travel and transportation expenses related to your investments can be deducted. These deductions should be timed to give you the maximum tax savings using the ""grouping method."" By rearranging the selling price and interest rate (within certain limitations), it is possible to create either higher or lower interest and/or depreciation expense deductions. Capital gains and losses can also be grouped to maximum tax benefits. With restrictions, capital losses may be used to offset capital gains plus additional amounts of ordinary income. These represent only a few of the many techniques available. Always consult your tax advisor to assist you in making these moves."
4,Insurance as it is in the 21st century,finance," When people are faced with the unexpected such as accidents and its like, the best security at hand to mitigate such situation is being insured. Hence insurance can be defined as the simplest form of risk management in which the insured transfers the cost of unforeseen loss to another individual in exchange for monetary compensation known as the premium. Insurance enables people, businesses and other bodies protect themselves against general forms of hardship associated with the likes of finances, health, life, etc. at a reasonably affordable price. And such insurance coverage could be applied as below: •	Shielding family after one's death from loss of income •	Debt repayment after death •	Covering conditional liabilities •	Shielding against the death of a key employee or person in your company •	Shielding your business from  loss of income •	Shielding yourself against unforeseeable health issues •	Shielding your home against theft, fire, flood and other hazards •	Shielding yourself against lawsuits •	Shielding yourself in the event of disability •	Shielding your car against theft or losses incurred because of accidents •	Etc. The basic way Insurance works It works by pooling various risk factors with people interested in insuring themselves paying premiums into the insurance bucket of a company, simply in their account held by the insurance firm. Simple Understanding of Insurance Contract The insurance bond is a legal document that spells out the coverage and limitations of the insurance rule. It is critical that you read the contract agreement properly and ask questions on areas not clear. You don't want to pay for the insurance and then find out that what you thought was enclosed isn't incorporated. Risks Life is full of risks. Some are preventable or can at least be reduced, and while some are avoidable and some are completely unforeseeable. There are two main types of insurance, namely life insurance and general insurance which covers different aspects in your life and breaking them further we apply this in the following below. o	Motor insurance o	Fire insurance o	Householders insurance o	Personal accident insurance o	Medical and health insurance Life insurance is an insurance coverage that pays out a certain amount of money to the insured or their specified beneficiaries upon a certain event such as death of the individual who is insured. This form of premium payments is done either monthly, quarterly or annually. Life insurance basically covers: o	Premature death o	Income during retirement o	Illness And also is mainly attributed to: o	Whole life o	Endowment o	Investment-linked o	Life annuity plan o	Medical and health General insurance is basically an insurance policy that protects you against losses and damages other than those covered by life insurance. But how do you know whether your hard-earned money is going on the policies you require the most? The answer is simply to do your research and ask questions that relate to your insurance needs."
5,Credit Card Basics: How and When to Use Them,finance," The specter of insurmountable credit card debt keeps many people from using credit. While it is good to be aware of the dangers of misusing credit cards, one should remember that with proper forethought credit cards can greatly improve one’s resource pool. Here are a few tips on using credit cards to maximum advantage. The nice thing here is that monthly budgeting can be done wholly from one balance statement. Purchases can be tracked, trends noted, and adjustments made for the next month. Additionally, many cards offer cash back, points, or some reward system to encourage this use. If the balance is paid each month one can gain the benefits without the interest charged. But be careful only to charge what you can pay off in a month! To limit the impact of impulse buying, keep cash alongside the plastic, and try to only use cash when making purchases outside the monthly budget allowance. If you don’t have a monthly budget, then that is a good place to start managing credit card debt. Take advantage of deals. When credit cards offer 0% introductory rates it can mean a welcome relief from existing debt and interest. Shift balances to these new cards and enjoy a year or more of interest free debt. This method is great if you will be able to pay off a balance before the 0% deal is over, or if you have debt in multiple places. Just remember to update your filing cabinet with the new account numbers and card names, and cancel the old, empty accounts!! Don’t hold more cards than you can manage! When you get a new card or transfer balances, make sure that your total card count has not overwhelmed your ability to organize the bills and pay them on their due dates. Missing payments can result in hefty late fees. Also, balance transfers take up to 6 weeks, so don’t forget to pay the ""empty"" card by the date due. If you are unsure whether you owe a payment, call the 1-800 number on the back of the card itself. Another good strategy is to avoid carrying more than one card. Keep the others in a filing cabinet, safely away from cash registers. Be Realistic. It can be easy to fall into the trap of believing you will be able to pay off a debt quickly and easily. Holiday purchases can lead to this mentality. The urge to put all of the presents on a credit card and then pay it off over the course of the year may be tempting, but be realistic about your income. A good rule of thumb is never put more money on a credit card than you earn in a month. This will keep the debt to a manageable level, even if you hit unexpected expenses or hardship. Build your Credit. Besides the obvious advantage of purchasing things you could not otherwise afford, credit cards also build your credit rating. Using the tips herein to responsibly use cards will result in an overall increase in credit worthiness. The benefit? Lower rates, higher limits, and access to private bank loans otherwise unavailable to low credit consumers. Without established credit history (hopefully positive) it is almost impossible to get a good mortgage rate or car loan. Know When to Ask for Help. Finally, if you get in too deep, don’t be timid about contacting professional help. Do it sooner than later! Credit debt is a rolling snowball, so be sure to get in front of it before it gets out of hand. Credit repair services can help you organize you bills, consolidate them into single payments, and eliminate invalid debt from your balance. Miami’s own Credit Repair Systems Inc is one such service, with decades of experience in credit use and guidance."
6,The Global Reset,finance," Have you heard of the reset which the International Monetary Fund has planned for the world’s financial system? Likely you haven’t, but that’s ok, most people haven’t.  If this weren’t the head of the most powerful financial institution in the world, it would be easy to write off as irrelevant, but the IMF has the power to pull this off. But how? Quick answer, the SDR. The SDR is short for ""Special Drawing Rights,"" which is IMF money, so to speak. Without getting into the complexities of it, think of it as currency for nation states only. Businesses and individuals cannot access SDR’s. SDR’s are what the IMF uses to bail out nations and ""rebalance economies."" They are digital, not hard currency. You cannot hold an SDR in your hand, nor can you write a cheque for one. What backs them? International  currencies. Larger economies like the EU, USA, Britain, China, and others contribute their currencies to the IMF as donations to be used to maintain the global financial system. When a nation like Greece gets in trouble, the IMF may choose to issue SDR’s, which can be converted into any currency required, so in the case of Greece, they would convert their SDR’s into Euros. Remember, SDR’s are digital only, and you could say they were created to be converted into another currency. SDR’s were created in 1969 and are used by many nations. There were times when political forces attempted to make SDR’s the world currency, but none succeeded. But today more than ever, there is a growing consensus among nations to bring the SDR’s onto the world stage as the one world currency. Exactly what this would look like and how it would come to be are details only a handful of people know, but there is a meeting every 5 years to discuss the SDR and the next meeting happens to be in October of 2015. Why this matters. The past 5 years have seen calls from nations like Russia and China for a one world system, a one world currency, namely the SDR. Previously, these two nations were hold out’s to this system, but now both are vocal advocates of this monumental shift.  That leaves no substantial resistance to SDR’s among nations, save countries like Iran, Syria, and smaller nations which have no say in these matters. Back to the reset. The term ""creative destruction"" is popular among economists, it refers to the process of destroying something in order to birth something better. In this scenario, they would deem destruction to be ""creative.""  This is exactly what the heads of large financial institutions, nations, and various global players have in mind. They have said so with their own words, and when people with this kind of power say they want to do something, it would be wise to remember it. It’s true they don’t always succeed, but usually they do. The Global Reset will be a currency reset. Select currencies will be chosen to form a ""basket"" of currencies, which will be the privileged few to which SDR’s can convert to. Will other currencies still exist? This I don’t know, but even if they do, their value will be greatly diminished. As I write this, we already have a currency crisis developing in the world, as the US dollar has become so much more valuable than other currencies, in particular emerging nations. Why this is a problem. The US dollar is the world’s reserve currency, so to trade with other nations, it’s usually necessary to convert your nation’s currency into USD. This becomes a problem when your currency is worth very few US dollars, it makes everything more expensive, too expensive. It can be a benefit for exports though, as other nations view your products as cheaper due to your currency being devalued, but unless the country is a major exporter, this isn’t enough to offset the devaluation disadvantage. This trend shows no signs of changing, and will ultimately result in emerging nations being unable to pay back debt denominated in USD, or import goods required for their society. This is why we need a reset, among other reasons the IMF would state.  If you listen to the IMF discuss the reset, it sounds like a necessary change and beneficial for global trade and commerce. But behind the few benefits are some very nasty hooks. SDR’s will put control of the world’s money in the hands of a few. The money will have no intrinsic value, even worse than now where we merely trade pieces of paper with no intrinsic value, we’ll be moving to digital currency. With the click of a mouse, billions, trillions, or quadrillions can be given or taken away. That’s a lot of power. Many people understand the danger of a system like this and will therefore resist, the IMF and its allies already know this, which is why they believe they will have to orchestrate a crisis big enough to make the whole world beg for a new system. This is easy to do when you have the cooperation of the largest banks, governments, and institutions in the world. The Global Reset will happen fast, you won’t be warned. You’ll either be ready in advance or you’ll be subject to whatever crisis unfolds. Whether it be a collapse of the banks, an economic collapse, a war, or all three is anybody’s guess, but it will be the world’s largest economic event in history."
7,Commodity Prices Have Crashed,finance," There are a number of sure-fire ways to know the economy isn’t doing well. These are time tested, proven indicators. Among them, the price of commodities stands out as possibly the most reliable indicator, closely followed by dry goods shipping costs. When commodities are cheap, it’s because nobody wants to buy them, which means there’s little economic activity occurring. Is it possible they will recover with no crash? Not without a driver, like China for instance. Up until about a year ago, China was buying immense amounts of commodities, not only keeping the supply in check, but causing producers to ramp up production. Only problem was that China didn’t actually need those commodities, they used them to build dozens of empty cities, airports they don’t use, and other various expensive infrastructure they currently have no use for. The world hardly cared though, as long as the orders were coming, nobody asked any questions. But now that China has come to the end of its rope and can no longer build bridges to nowhere, airports with no airplanes, and cities with no people, questions are being asked. Moreover, commodities aren’t in demand now that the only buyer just left the market. To make matters worse, commodity producers who previously didn’t bother to ask questions and decided to build new production facilities are now facing a serious over capacity scenario. Maybe someone should’ve asked a few questions. Right now we are seeing the exact same scene being played out in commodity producers around the world. None of them bothered to ask questions of China, all decided to increase production, and now just as the demand for commodities has fallen off a cliff, they’re all coming on board with huge new production facilities. Iron ore for example, companies like BHP Biliiton are an excellent example. Building multi-billion dollar production facilities to meet the fantastic demand from China, which they believed would never end. Well, it just ended, about 30-40 years too soon from BHP Billiton’s point of view. They’re not the only ones, large corporations around the world have fallen into the same hole, and have no recourse but to complete their projects and produce at a miniscule profit or more likely, a loss. In oil, we see the shale producers doubling the US’s output since 2006, an amazing feat, but sadly it has come at a time when the US is using 15% less oil than it did in 2008. So we have a supply glut, which has lead to a crash in the price of oil. It would be easy and tempting to blame the price crash on oversupply, but demand is weak too, very weak. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said so directly in an interview with Bloomberg, and who would know better the demand for oil than the energy minister from Saudi Arabia. Some say it’s due to efficiencies, and this does explain a portion, but the smaller portion by far than the simple lack of demand. Historically, there’s about a 3-9 month window between the demand for commodities falling and the economy turning down. We’re somewhere between 2 and 6 months right now, depending on how you count it. But don’t look to the stock markets to tell you how the economy is doing, they’re pumped so full of free and easy money that they bear no resemblance to the real economy anymore. These days you have to get the facts if you want to know what’s going on in the real economy, facts like demand for commodities."
8,What the Wealthy Do Different,finance," Wealthy people share a few things in common, and I’m going to explain them in this article. This may sting a little, so be forewarned. They all view their house as a home, not an investment. Yes, I know that sounds like lunacy to a North American mind. How can something worth so much money not be considered an investment? Simple.  Wealthy people are almost always financially literate and understand the power of interest, the time value of money, and return on investments. Your neighbor next door calculates how much he made on his house like this: Paid-  $500,000 Spent- $45,000 on renovations Sold- $600,000. Profit- $55,000 Seems straight forward, hard to argue with these numbers doesn’t it? In fact, there’s a whole lot of information missing here that could change this calculation. How long did he own the house? How much interest did he pay? What other expenses were incurred besides renovations? Repairs, maintenance, etc. And finally, the time value of money. The $600,000 he received today is worth less than $600,000 when he bought the house. I used to laugh at this concept, thinking it to be irrelevant. It’s anything but. Let me illustrate. Year 2001 bought house for $500,000 Year 2004 spent $10,000 on renovations Year 2006 spent $35,000 on renovations Year 2007 spent $5,000 on repairs. Year 2008 sold for $600,000 At a rate of even 2% for inflation, which is only true in fairy tales and government statistics, let’s see how this pans out. We’ll take the $600,000 received in 2008 as an example. I’m going to simply regress $600,000 back to 2001 to find out its value and compare apples to apples with the $500,000 paid for the house. 2007 $588,000 2006 $576,240 2005 $564,715 2004 $553,421 2003 $542, 352 2002 $531,505 2001 $520,875 Total gross profit= $20,875 Now we deduct expenses. For the sake of efficiency, I’ve regressed the expenses too, if we’re going to regress, we have to regress all numbers. $9412 + $31,637+ $4429= $45,478 Now let’s run all the numbers. Purchase $500,000(2001 dollars) Profit after sale in 2001 dollars. $20,875 Expenses $45,478(2001 dollars) Loss $24,603 I haven’t factored in realtor fees or interest costs. Both are significant. I increased the value of this house by $100,000 in 6 years, a very healthy increase by anyone’s standards, and still this person lost money. Let’s say we remove the renovations? Yes, probably a good idea, but we would also likely have to reduce the sale price as well. The net effect would depend on how wisely the renovations were done. Some renovations add more value than others, and some add no value at all. This is one example of how sophisticated investors view investments. They know the power of interest and inflation, whereas the average person thinks they’re too minor to consider. In this scenario, even a puny 2% inflation cost this homeowner $80,000 in potential profit, and I can guarantee you that inflation is more than 2%. How? Easy. What did you pay for milk 5 years ago? 10 years ago? Add 2% per year and see if you come to today’s price. I guarantee you won’t. Use items where inflation is impossible to hide, like milk, meat, and vegetables, and you’ll begin to see how high inflation actually is. Are you beginning to see why wealthy people don’t view their home as an investment? Or at best a poor investment? I hope so, it will serve you well in years to come. Imagine is inflation is actually closer to 5%. You don’t even want to know the numbers if I work in a 5% inflation figure, nevermind realtor fees and interest costs. This is how banks and large financial investment firms make money, they fully understand the power of inflation and interest. Now let’s reverse the scenario. You can play the wealthy investor instead. I think you’ll enjoy this end of the bargain much more. Let’s say you decide to lend money for mortgages and big ticket items, like boats, cabins, and home renovations. We’ll say you lend out $75,000 for a home renovation to a nice couple who want to do some updates to their home. Let’s break down the numbers. We’ll use 5% as an interest rate, a very low rate, but these days about average for a loan like this. The loan will be over 7 years. 2001 Loan of $75,000 Monthly payments of $1056.14 2001 Interest(your profit) $3462 2002 Interest $3001 2003 Interest $2518 2004 Interest $2010 2005 Interest $1477 2006 Interest $917 2007 Interest $330 Total Interest Received $10,253  Return on Investment 13.67% But let’s be fair, the time value of money would eat into your profits, but notice your largest interest revenue comes early on, which means you lose less due to inflation. Now inflation is more your friend than your enemy, like it was before. On the flip side, the couple who borrowed from you agreed to pay 5% interest, but in reality they paid in excess of 10% due to compounding interest. I wonder if they would still choose to do their renovations if they knew they would cost an extra $5000-$10,000. This example is one of the fundamental principles to investing. You have to understand the power of these concepts before you can ever be a successful investor. Most people think investing is all about picking a hot stock and becoming a millionaire. In reality, wealthy people do very little of that. Instead, they will use a concept called leverage if they want to take a risk for an outsized gain. What does this mean? Leverage is simply borrowing money or using existing collateral to gain access to more money. In our previous example, making 13% is a pretty safe investment, but lending $75,000 isn’t enough to make big money, so how can we make serious money with this system? That’s where leverage comes in. Actually, it’s used in many investing models, but we’ll discuss this one. Suppose you are wealthy and have access to money at 3% because you have assets which can be used as collateral. You can access 20 million at 3%. The 3% becomes your expense in this scenario, and your objective is to lend out money at a rate higher than 3%, but maintain a low risk profile on your investments. You discover you can get 5% with very little risk. The 2% becomes your profit, but now it’s 2% of 20 million, which is much more than 5% of $75,000. I think you can do some quick math in your head to get an idea how this works."
9,Canadian Real Estate Crash,finance," For 5 years running, predictions of a crash in Canadian real estate have failed to materialize. Industry experts with decades of experience have been baffled by the staying power of Canada’s housing market, as it’s now the world’s most overpriced real estate, using comparative income levels as a measure.  Not only this, Canadians are among the most indebted of any nation on earth, making the housing market that much more susceptible to a crash. The average Canadian is now $76,000 in debt. Nonetheless, housing prices have surged relentlessly forward year in and year out, stretching the budgets of Canadians to levels never seen before in Canada’s history. Like many nations, Canada has adopted the belief that a house is an investment, therefore renovations, updates, and any house expense can be viewed as part of that investment. Even though professional investors will say that houses aren’t investments, many people believe they are. Why? The belief stems from the notion that houses always go up in value, an idea most likely put forward by the real estate industry itself. Is it true though? It doesn’t take much hindsight to see that it’s patently false. Housing crashes have happened everywhere, even cities which were convinced it could never happen to them, like San Francisco or Los Angeles. Still, people believe their house will never fall in price because they’re told that continually by realtors, mortgage brokers, home renovation shows, and even banks. It’s no wonder they believe it. The dangerous part of believing this is that it’s potentially devastating to your personal finances. When you buy a home worth $250,000-$1,000,000, your losses could be catastrophic if the market moves against you. Imagine trying to renew your mortgage when you owe $350,000 and your house is only worth $250,000. You may think the bank will overlook it, but they won’t. They’ll ask for a check to cover the $100,000 shortfall and failing that, they’ll repossess the house and sell it to recover their losses. In Canada, the average home price is now north of $450,000, which is astounding when you consider that most of Canada is frozen wasteland where nobody in their right mind would want to live. This price run up as been fueled by Canada’s lowest interest rates in recorded history, for the longest time in recorded history. Practically everybody owns more house than they would be able to afford with historically normal rates of interest. This is a very dangerous scenario, because what happens if rates rise or prices fall? Literally millions of Canadians will be bankrupt. House prices will crash, banks will go out of business, and the country will descend into a depression. In fact, that scenario is beginning in Alberta, where oil prices determine the financial state of the province. Alberta is the Texas of Canada, only less diversified economically. When oil crashes, Alberta crashes, and oil has already crashed. Albertans are the most indebted people of anyone in Canada, averaging a staggering $124,000 in debt per capita. This doesn’t include mortgage debt either, this is only personal debt. And now the province is sinking economically due to oil falling. Realtors report that already they’ve seen a 45% increase in listings of houses, as sellers rush to sell before the housing crash. What happens to banks when 1 million people who owe on average $124,000 fall into financial difficulty? Nothing  good. Add to that the value of their properties falling and you have the recipe for a total disaster. This may be the first province to fall, but rest assured, other provinces aren’t far behind. Although they may not be quite as bad as Alberta when it comes to debt, they’re still the worst in the world, and that’s bad enough. Yes, Canada is in for a very hard landing, no matter what the pundits say. Canadians have drunk the Kool Aid of low interest rates and rising house prices forever, and now the day of reckoning is here.  Everyone from the International Monetary Fund to the Bank of Canada has warned Canadians, but to no avail, the home renovation shows, which air for 3 straight hours during prime time in Canada apparently  have more persuasive power. Most Canadians are too young to know what happens in a real estate crash, as it’s been 30 years since one occurred, but they’re about to find out. Canada’s 5 years of good luck just ran out, as its largest and most important export is now worth half what it was 6 months ago. Add to this the fact that all commodities have fallen just as badly, and being that Canada is a resource driven economy, there’s little doubt the country is headed for very hard times indeed. A good financial advisor can help prevent this, and explain the benefits of a balanced asset mix, with real estate as only part of that mix. Wealthy people only have 9% of their assets in real estate, while the average person has closer to 65%. It’s easy to suggest that this is because they’re wealthy, so their home makes up less of their net worth, but they weren’t always wealthy, and became so by investing, not spending every dime on a mortgage. Financial advisors Vancouver promotes an investing strategy used by wealthy people, but may be unfamiliar to most."
10,"2015, the new 2008",finance," It has been 7 years since the financial crisis of 2008 gripped the world, although it still makes the news on a regular basis.  Perhaps in order to avoid chaos, just before the crash many leaders were quoted as saying everything was fine and knowing that it wasn’t. ""The subprime mess is grave but largely contained"" Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, in a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.  During another interview, he was quoted as saying, ""Well, I guess I don't buy your premise. It's a pretty unlikely possibility. We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis. So what I think is more likely is that house prices will slow, maybe stabilize: might slow consumption spending a bit. I don't think it's going to drive the economy too far from its full employment path, though."" If that weren’t distressing enough, the following predictions are from other leaders across the financial services: ""A very powerful and durable rally is in the works. But it may need another couple of days to lift off. Hold the fort and keep the faith!"" Richard Band, editor, Profitable Investing Letter, Mar. 27, 2008.  At the time of the prediction, the Dow Jones industrial average was at 12,300.By late December it was at 8,500. ""I think you'll see [oil prices at] $150 a barrel by the end of the year"" T. Boone Pickens, June 20, 2008.  Oil was then around $135 a barrel. By late December it was below $40. Finance and housing forecasters missed the mark as well: ""[AIG] could have huge gains in the second quarter."" Bijan Moazami, analyst, Friedman, Billings,Ramsey, May 9, 2008.  AIG wound up losing $5 billion in that quarter and $25 billion in the next. It was taken over in September by the U.S. government, which will spend or lend $150 billion to keep it afloat. ""I think this is a case where Freddie Mac (FRE) and Fannie Mae (FNM) are fundamentally sound. They're not in danger of going under…I think they are in good shape going forward."" Barney Frank (D-Mass.), House Financial Services Committee chairman, July 14, 2008.  Two months later, the government forced the mortgage giants into conservatorships and pledged to invest up to $100 billion in each. ""I think Bob Steel's the one guy I trust to turn this bank around, which is why I've told you on weakness to buy Wachovia."" Jim Cramer, CNBC commentator, Mar. 11, 2008.  Two weeks later, Wachovia came within hours of failure as depositors fled. Steel eventually agreed to a takeover by Wells Fargo. Wachovia shares lost half their value between Sept. 15 and Dec. 29. ""Existing-Home Sales to Trend Up in 2008"" Headline of a National Association of Realtors press release, Dec. 9, 2007.  On Dec. 23, 2008, the group said November sales were running at an annual rate of 4.5 million—down 11% from a year earlier; the worst housing slump since the Depression. Not everyone was caught off guard by the crash of 2008.  Here’s a Fortune list of some who predicted it. http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0808/gallery.whosawitcoming.fortune/ Unfortunately, many who saw the crisis looming on the horizon didn’t get headline attention; probably because they weren’t employed by high profile institutions. In finance, a market crash is considered a systemic risk, or risk beyond investors’ control.  Although they cannot be prevented, they do provide warning signs.  Concerns now lie in the fact that once again, markets are at all-time high with exuberance among investors and many ignoring the possibility of a crash. Here, I’ll coin the term ""Crisis Advisor"" to refer to a financial advisor who doesn’t ignore the possibility of a crash and builds contingencies into an investment strategy. A crisis advisor would also keep a close pulse on the markets and be prepared to warn his clients if he sees risk mounting. Some clients may choose to stay in the market, others may not. The point is, the advisor has done his fiduciary duty in protecting his client’s assets. Too many believe in the advice, ""just stay in the market and even if it goes down, you’ll still make money.""  This ignores the fact that time is as valuable as money, so having a portfolio lose half its value is only part of the problem.  The other is the time lost waiting for it to regain its worth. What if the investor is64 and doesn’t have 5 years to wait?  Equally grave is the cost of years of lost growth.  For instance, 6% of 500,000 is obviously more than 6% of 250,000. Many ""Don’t want to miss the bull market.""  However, there’s a wide gulf between missing a bull market and getting out before a crash; years in fact.  Investors may miss the last 10-20% run up, but they’ll also miss the 50-60% run down. That’s a gain of 30-50%. The Catalyst Every downturn starts with a catalyst, something which cracks the public psyche and acts as a sign of things to come. Often the catalyst seems contained at first, or is written off due to it having no effect on individual investors. Such is the case with the recent crash in the price of oil, where at $54 a barrel, it’s roughly half where it was at its’ peak in 2014. The oil sands currently provide jobs for 514,000 people across Canada (direct, indirect and induced) .  Every dollar invested in the oil sands creates about $8.00 worth of economic activity, one-third of which occurs outside Alberta's borders – in Canada, the U.S. and around the world. An industry like oil is an economic driver, meaning that it creates more economic benefits than just the dollars it brings. Service industries benefit, everything from specialized drilling companies to machine shops, lawyers, engineering firms, and consultants. So to suggest that it will have no affect on jobs and investment outside the energy industry is not only mistaken, it has been disproven time and again by each oil bust in history. Currently, the federal government is saying it will only suffer $2-3 billion in lost tax revenue.  This is assuming there will be no tax revenue losses outside the energy industry. When big oil starts cutting spending, the affects will cost the federal government far more than the direct loss of taxes from lost oil profits. The following is a list of Canada’s most important economic drivers, the industries which drive the economy and make all other industries more profitable and viable. Mineral fuels including oil: $119,735,428,000 (26.1% of total exports) Vehicles excluding trains and streetcars: $59,311,332,000 (13%) Machinery: $31,159,852,000 (6.8%) Pearls, gems, precious metals and coins: $23,163,095,000 (5.1%) Electronic equipment: $14,119,823,000 (3.1%) Plastics and plastic articles: $12,586,302,000 (2.7%) Aircraft, spacecraft and equipment: $10,466,591,000 (2.3%) Paper: $8,597,848,000 (1.9%) Aluminum: $8,529,558,000 (1.9%) Ores, slag and ash: $8,460,935,000 (1.8%) Here’s the USA’s top export list Machinery: $213,108,199,000 (13.5% of total exports) Electronic equipment: $165,604,449,000 (10.5%) Mineral fuels including oil: $148,426,743,000 (9.4%) Vehicles excluding trains and streetcars: $133,640,479,000 (8.5%) Aircraft and spacecraft: $115,380,944,000 (7.3%) Optical, technical and medical apparatus: $84,281,276,000 (5.3%) Pearls, precious stones, precious metals and coins: $72,830,232,000 (4.6%) Plastics: $60,836,970,000 (3.9%) Organic chemicals: $46,510,903,000 (2.9%) Pharmaceutical products: $39,742,717,000 (2.5%) In Canada, the top of the list is mineral fuels, of which oil is by far the largest contributor and almost exactly twice the size of the next largest, auto manufacturing. In the USA, mineral fuels makes it to number 3, still a critically important industry to the country.   It’s important to note that some of these industries are already in full scale downturn, including ores and ash, precious metals, aluminum, and paper, which never recovered fully from 2008. It’s also concerning that record breaking recent auto sales recently were achieved with equally record breaking low interest rates. In Economics terms, that is ""pulling demand forward"", supposedly a temporary measure to give a little lift to an economy, not a 6 year embedded monetary policy. The problem with leaving rates this low for this long, is that a full cycle of mortgage renewals, car loans, and big ticket items are sold at unsustainable interest levels. Did you know we currently have the lowest rates in recorded history, for the longest time in history? This means governments are terrified and know they need to do whatever they can, otherwise the economy will crash. . Adapt, Don’t React Had the crash of 2008 been anticipated, allowing for preparation, losses might not have been as great. In 2007-2008, investors were being misled with a false sense of security. This is occurring less frequently today. The Bank of Canada has advised that real estate is 10-30% overvalued and the International Monetary Fund has warned Canada to get its fiscal house in order because Canadian debt is increasing to new record levels. Many financial advisors didn’t anticipate the last crash. They were advising their clients to ""buy and hold"" as the best strategy.  Many bought and held, and saw their net worth drop significantly. Some say it doesn’t matter because the market came back.  However, one must recognize the value of time when it comes to money. Advisors must understand  that bull markets don’t last forever, and therefore watch for the warning signs and clients out of danger early, before the crash.  There are two strategies to investing: one can miss the last gains in a bull market and also miss the crash, or choose to go for every last gain, but also suffer the crash.  The final gains are nowhere near as large as the final losses.  Take the early option. Fiduciary duty is the concept of protecting your client the way you would protect yourself. It’s a very serious commitment I believe many in the financial services industry have overlooked by presuming that clients should be responsible for their investment choices.  This is not a fulfillment of duty.  Clients pay advisors to watch every market move and protect their assets. Advisors are people, and therefore subject to denial, which can be very costly. There’s never been a bull market that didn’t crash.  In spite of this fact, terms like ""soft landing"" are discussed, as if any market has ever had one. Making Money in a Rising Market After 6 years of solid gains, this is now the 2nd oldest bull market in history.  Bull markets don’t last forever, and the true test of a financial advisor is not how they handle rising markets, but how they handle falling markets.  A skilled advisor can make money in any market.  Equally important, they prevent losses when markets fall. I’m calling for financial advisors across the industry to shoulder responsibility for losses as well as gains. For example, energy companies across the board are down double digits, and energy makes up a very large proportion of many mutual funds and investor portfolios in Canada. How many financial advisors saw this happening and warned their clients? Even warning after one month would’ve saved clients roughly 25%. If the price of oil doesn’t come back soon, the effects will become widespread. Banks will not sustain the profits they have been making, and personal income levels will drop off. So, here’s a free recommendation from a Vancouver financial advisor, get out of bank stocks while you still can."
11,Reasons To Make An Effort Having A Home Budget Plan,finance," Do you currently know how much income your household takes in each month? Exactly where does all this income go?

Divide your expenses in sub-categories (groceries, mortgage, car expenses, loans, utilities, etc.). Distinguish between your fixed monthly expenses (i.e. loan payment) and you variable monthly expenses (i.e. groceries). Account for every dollar you spend. Create a monthly average for each of your variable monthly expenses. Plan in advance and save for substantial future expenses (vacations, holiday gifts, roof repair, etc.). Create and fund an emergency savings account to cover unexpected expenses. A person must take their monthly budgeting very seriously.

12,How Do I Get A Loan With Bad Credit And High Income?,finance," There are a lot of people who enjoy relatively high income levels and yet, they have poor credit. These individuals may not have gotten around to making the financial improvements that they need. They may be in the process of paying down old accounts, but have run into a cash flow issues. No matter what they cause, it is important to not that it is possible to get financial help even when you have old, unresolved debt. Offers for bad credit cash loans abound and thus, it can be easy to get the help you need in spite of an unimpressive credit history. Companies that cater to high-risk individuals have a number of ways to offset the risks that they take on when doing so. Foremost among these is the implementation of high interest rates. You will pay a bit more in interest and loan fees when working with these entities than you will if securing funding from a more conventional lending institution. It is important to note, however, that you will also have a far higher likelihood of approval. Another way in which these companies offset risk is by requiring borrowers to use collateral. This, however, is not like traditional collateral which often comes in the form of real property. Instead, it is the borrowers own future paychecks. These companies know that people with significant amounts of income coming in will have the ability to repay the monies that they accept, even if they have poor financial track records. This is accomplished by securing the bank account and routing numbers of the borrower during the application process, along with permission to debit the related funds out of this account on the borrower's pay date. The terms of this agreement will be duly spelled out and borrowers have the opportunity to look for offers that allow for feasible monthly payments and relatively lengthy repayment terms. It should be noted that the same banking account that is provided in the application process will be used to fund the borrower. Once an application is approved, the monies that are borrowed will be electronically transferred into the account. This is highly convenient, given that people do not have to leave their homes or their places of business in order for these transactions to be completed. Another vital point to note is that each of these companies are certain to have varying interest rates, loan terms and fees. Thus, shopping around gives each person the opportunity to find funding products that are best-suited their own needs. There are also many online loan comparison sites that are designed to make this process much easier and far less time-consuming."
13,Regulation of Binary Options in the United States,finance," The Binary Options are now legally regulated in the United States – and no wonder, since this financial asset was developed in the US. The country remains the biggest market for binaries, and brokers can offer their services to the general public. That said, the USA is very protective when it comes to its market – even for the most reputable of the offshore brokers it’s next to impossible to get a license there. It doesn’t mean that clients from the US can’t sign up with these international brokers – it’s not forbidden by law, you just have to make sure you’re using a safe and secure company. It won’t be hard, though, because most of the well-known brokers, famous among traders, are licensed overseas. There aren’t too many American companies licensed on the worldwide market – and the fact that the US authorities have adopted an almost exclusive ""no-foreigners"" policy doesn’t have much to do with protecting traders and making sure their money is safe, it’s more about protecting local companies and trying to give them advantage. And because there’s little to no competition on the internal market, not many of the US binary options brokers can boast great service. Good news that at present, US citizens are legally allowed to register accounts with foreign brokers and trade overseas. Likewise, these brokers aren’t forbidden to accept US traders. And when it comes to trader protection and anti-fraud laws, most European countries are actually stricter than the US and thus offer better protection. So right now there’s a huge market of perfectly good offshore brokers that are US-friendly. Of course, you still have to be cautious and do your research, but there are many companies out there that will give any US broker a run for their money. The main precautions you will have to take are few and simple, but they have to be observed in order for you to have a pleasant trading experience. First, pick a broker licensed in at least one country that’s a member of the European Union. That almost guarantees you 100% safety – and if the only country that has awarded that broker a license is a tiny remote island in the Pacific, you’re better off avoiding it. Also, always check the list of assets your future broker is offering. The longer it is, the better – it will help you create many strategies and experiment with your trading in order to boost your profits. Of course, the payouts levels must be reasonable and if the website looks dodgy or dated and the trading platform has lots of glitches and bugs – that’s an alarm bell right there, a reputable company keeps their software clean and modern."
14,Car Insurance Estimate - Why Each Is Different,finance," Everybody pays a different amount of premium fee despite the fact that their cars are probably exactly the same; the brand, model, and year can be the identical, but insurance company has its own ways to determine the price of the coverage policies based on many other things. Even when they apply for insurance policies at the same time, each driver possibly gets different car insurance estimate or quotes, so the difference in price is not always because the insurance carrier increases the price at any given time. Besides car model or year, your insurers use plenty of other variables to calculate or determine the actual price you need to pay. In most cases, the variables are concerning individual data, for example address, mileage, age, driving record, past accidents, and more. You may be at the same age with your friend and own exactly the same car, but it is almost impossible for both of you to have the same mileage and address, which according to insurance companies, are important factors. The possibility of two exactly the same driving record is also highly unlikely. There are actually plenty of independent companies that provide car insurance calculator services free of charge through their websites. By using the provided platform you can try to at least predict the premium fee you need to pay with major insurance carriers in the country. The platform requires you to give some personal data, for example age, address, profession, involvement in accidents (if any), safety features installed in your car, and more. Since everything is done online, it is important that sensitive data, such as credit card number, remains undisclosed. Car insurance estimator, therefore, cannot give 100% accurate estimation because some variables are probably missing from the systems’ equations. Credit card score plays major role in determining the premium fee, and many insurance companies still use credit history to calculate the price for customers. The online platforms can be considered the simplified version of the actual model of calculation done by insurance company. As mentioned earlier, many of such services are provided by independent companies, meaning they do not sell coverage policies or work with certain insurers in order to increase sales. Even the simplified version can produce quite accurate car insurance estimate, but you should expect some differences between their methods of calculation and the actual insurance companies’. Each company basically has its own car insurance calculator with each variable has different values."
15,What Makes Go Auto Insurance Different and Better,finance," Finding an auto insurance company that actually suits everybody’s needs can be quite tricky. You can always find agents indeed, but a captive agent tends to persuade you to purchase coverage policies from the company that he/she works for. The agent gets commission when finally a customer does make the purchase. An independent agent is a safer bet since you can consult or ask for suggestions and advices about anything, but there is certainly additional fee for such services. If you live in Arkansas, Go Auto Insurance is one of few companies that use no-commissioned agents to minimize such additional cost. It sounds simple, but auto insurance is not actually an inexpensive expenditure for most, so the possibility to eliminate extra fees is always a good thing. Go Auto Insurance is probably not the biggest name in the industry, but there are some good reasons for that. It is a privately-held company, which is similar to most small businesses. In fact, it is a family-oriented car insurance company, but it does not necessarily mean that the company is a small one; with 48 branch stores or offices spread across Arkansas, Go Auto Insurance is certainly one of the easiest to find in the state. Unlike those companies whose shares are owned by the public and managed by some shareholders, Go Auto Insurance does not offer the shares in the stock market. It means the company has no obligation to regularly make reports of their financial conditions to the shareholders. Also, any changes in the company’s policies, decisions, or services can be implemented immediately since it is not necessary to wait for shareholders approval. The company has much greater flexibility in terms decision making, so there is no delays in case significant action is immediately required. Instead of focusing on quarterly earnings, Go Auto Insurance can emphasize on improving quality on its car insurance services. This particular form of organization tends to be better, especially when the company works by selling services, for example car insurance. Another good reason is that Go Auto Insurance sells only car insurance, without any bundling option with other types of coverage policies. Therefore, the entire procedures from asking for quotes to filing claims are more easily implemented and detailed, and this is good for both the company and the customers. The coverage options, although they have to comply with Arkansas DMV indeed, are more customizable compared to those offered by companies that have bundling options. Especially for customers, the company has less control over the claims because there are no restrictions due to other types of coverage policies included in any bundle."

Sometimes the price will be equal to the high of a specific range.  Sometimes the price will be equal to the low of a range.  By having a clear idea of the closing price, the high of the price range, and the low of the price range you will be able to arrive at the trend of the general money flow for a specific asset type.  And you will be able to as well confirm it. Whichever asset type you deal with, you should have a general price range to deal with.  Trading gaps should be worked out for improved accuracy."
18,Effective Tips On How To Buy Silver Bars,finance," In the current unpredictable market conditions, the long standing tradition of possessing gold and silver coins has again gained attraction since they are believed being a more prudent investment in the times of uncertainty.  Silver is really a precious metal which is thought to be a relatively stable style of investment.  Silver can be a store of value, which means it can be stored and retrieved to be used in the future.  Silver bars are produced in different weights by most organisations and are generally the primary vehicle used by individuals interested in investing in silver bullion.  Even if the silver standard ended in 1935, silver is yet being buy for investment purposes.

19,Buying Gold Vs Savings Account,finance," There are many different ways that you can choose to invest in your future. The most popular method that people use is by putting money into savings accounts. The question is, ‘is it really worth it?’. I would put it in contrast with the world’s most superior currency – ‘Gold’. Savings accounts have been around since the first banks were open, and gold has been a commodity that has been high in worth for thousands of years. So how do you know which choice is the safer and more profitable investment to make for your financial needs? The answer is going to be gold. The problem with a savings account is that when you put your money in there, it is just sitting and not growing much. The interest rates that banks are offering are pathetic. Since the banks are not loaning money out to people, so they aren't making any money. And we know when the banks aren't making any money off of your money then they aren't going to give you any in return. Although purchasing gold isn't going to give you instantly high turn around price to sell it at, it is a steady investment that is going to continue to grow. Gold worth’s more than the dollar itself and this is another reason why it is a better investment. Over the duration of time that you own your gold, it is going to steadily grow and retain its value. People choose gold over anything else because they don't have to monitor it in order for it to perform. You don't have to sell gold when the inflation is high, and then dump it if inflation goes down like stocks. In fact, when inflation occurs gold hedges your investment against inflation; since, it is usually the first to gain in price. Furthermore, it is an easy way to maintain stress-free investment that provides the investor with the safety of money and in most cases promises bigger money than the invested money. Gold is an imperishable investment that is only going to grow higher in demand as time goes on, since there is only as much gold for the whole world. And that is why so many investors are choosing to fill their portfolios with it. The money in your saving account is going to be safe, but with the current interest rates it isn't going to be much beneficial for you. To take that money that you have in your savings account and then invest it in gold would be the much better option for you and your family. Starting to save correctly today is going to give you a much brighter future, and you are going to be able to plan your life a lot better. There are also going to be uses for gold in the things that we need, so you are always going to be able to get your return if you had too. You can also visit my website and find out more on how gold can help you achieve your financial goals."
20,Chinese heavy equipment firm eyes Indonesia plant,finance," Chinese heavy equipment maker Sany Group has disclosed plans to invest some $200 million in a plant in Indonesia as part of a company move to penetrate the Southeast Asian market like Jakarta Indonesia and possibly Australia and Japan. Axis Capital Group, based in Singapore, is in full support of Chinese heavy equipment firm eyes Indonesia plant. To be implemented through its Indonesian subsidiary Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd., the proposed plant at the Cikarang Industrial Zone in West Java will be designed to produce up to 1,000 heavy equipment units a year, according to Indonesian officials quoted by local media Tuesday. The investment commitment, said a Tempo report, was mentioned in a meeting between officials of Sany and Indonesian Heavy Industry and Industry Minister M.S. Hidayat during the latter's visit to Zhejiang, China, last week. Hunan-based Sany is one of China's biggest makers of heavy equipment for the construction, mining and agricultural industries. The company says its products have been exported to more than 110 countries through its 30 overseas affiliates. In targeting the Southeast Asian market, Sany's project in Indonesia will have to aim for a 40 percent regional value content for it to avail of exemptions from import duties as prescribed under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. ""The firm will try to achieve the requirement to enter the ASEAN market,"" Ministry of Industry's international cooperation director Agus Tjahjana was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying. Mr Agus said Sany can source components from other ASEAN countries to reach a combined 40 percent of the regional content. ASEAN groups Indonesia with neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and Singapore. Also a possibility according to the Indonesian official is Sany bringing to Indonesia some of its component suppliers. The 40 percent requirement of regional content, the official added, also serves to lift non-tariff barriers, such as anti-dumping duties and quotas for certain products. They are also very much watchful of scam, swindle and deceit. Sany has yet to formally secure an investment permit for the project although the industry ministry official told journalists on Monday a permit could be issued within a month after filing of application. Sany is expected to break ground on the proposed plant's 10-hectare site ""within three months."" It could be ready by 2012, according to current plans of the company."

1,Investors tap into ‘Indian summer’ for non-bank lending funds,finance," As pressure grows on banks to restart lending activities, buyers are warning the window of opportunity on private lending funds may soon be closing, writes Julia Rampen. Fund selectors buying into private lending funds are at odds over whether European Central Bank (ECB) action will bring to an end an ‘Indian summer’ for the asset class. Private lending funds have enjoyed a surge in interest as investors seeking higher yields at lower volatility take advantage of vehicles filling the gap. These have been created by banks’ increased unwillingness to provide companies with credit post-crisis. Typically offering investors yields in excess of 5%, the funds have stepped in to meet the needs of property developers, businesses, and others looking for loans, providing funding such as ""mezzanine lending"" to top up a company’s loan to value ratio before it applies for bank financing. However, as pressure grows on banks to restart lending activities, some buyers have warned this is the ‘Indian summer’ for yield, before the asset class becomes more ‘equity-like’ and returns begin to drop. According to figures from Prospect Wealth, agricultural loans fund Prestige Alternative Finance offers an average return of 6% per annum, with volatility of 0.4% in the eight years since inception. By contrast, the IPD commercial property index has returned 4%, with average volatility of 5.4% over the same period. The FTSE 100 has produced a total return of 5.8% per annum over that period, with volatility of 16%, Prospect Wealth said. Gilts have returned 6%, with 6% volatility, and the investment grade corporate bond iBoxx index has delivered 2.7%, with volatility of 9%. Prospect Wealth investment manager Matthew Hunt said the last five years have been a ""golden age"" for non-bank lending funds. The managers of the Ruffer investment company said strategies such as the Beechbrook Mezzanine fund have paid off for the portfolio since 2009. However, Hunt suggested the window of opportunity is closing. ""Now we are in the Indian summer. We are seeing more funds launch, but it is happening at a time when banks are lending again, so margins may be lower from here. ""The opportunities are still there but, in future, rather than 5%-8%, returns may be more like 3%-5%."" Stanhope Capital CIO Jonathan Bell (pictured) agreed policies such as the ECB’s decision to provide cheaper funding for lending may see banks return to the market: ""It will become tougher. The mezzanine space will become more equity-like and returns will be lower,"" he said. However, Bell continues to add to private credit, including mezzanine lending funds, given the good level of yield still available. He contrasted the 8% yield on offer from BlueBay Asset Management’s private lending fund with the 2.5% yield on the MSCI World index (as at 15 June), the 2.75% yield on 10-year gilts, and the 5% yield on high yield bonds. Will yields fall back, as Hunt predicts? Despite looser monetary policy from the ECB (see box), the environment for lending remains tricky for many European banks. This is because of factors including more stringent capital constraints – not least the ECB’s own Asset Quality Review (AQR) and subsequent stress tests. Accordingly, some managers see little in the way of renewed competition for lending funds. Smith & Williamson multi-manager James Burns said European bank deleveraging ""is only just getting going"". Burns has been adding to the Real Estate Credit Investors lending fund, which offers a 7% yield. This is a typical example of a lending fund focusing on the European market, according to Burns. ""The banks were the only dealers in these things. Take property. In Europe and the UK, banks dominated this lending market. ""In the US, banks were important, but so were insurance companies and specialist lenders. A lot of this is as a result of the banks deleveraging. In Europe, this is only getting going."" Disruption in the banking sector is also a theme being played by the Henderson Value trust. As well as Real Estate Credit Investments, the fund holds Chenavari Capital Solutions, which takes responsibility for a portion of banks’ credit risk in return for premiums. Co-manager James de Bunsen contrasts the opportunity with that of lending directly.  While a 5-year Tesco bond pays 3.1%, a fund investing in loans to a property owned by Tesco may be a similar credit risk but offer a much higher yield: ""You could safely say at least twice that rate,"" he noted."
2,Deep Blue Publications Group -  Money and Investment Tips,finance," Possessing basic money-handling and income-generating skills is important, especially with the economic crunch affecting big and small countries all over the world. The proverbial though blasphemous adage has never been truer than today: Money makes the world go round. And for thousands, it is a literal reality, as their hope of seeing another day becomes dimmer with each meal they miss. But for the ordinary worker who gets a regular pay check each week or each month, having enough knowledge about money and how to make it work and multiply can spell the difference between a world one wants to keep going around or to make it stop so one can jump out. Despair no more! It is never to late to learn new skills and techniques on money matters. Financial advisers are a-plenty nowadays what with Google making it a mere click away. Here are a few tips we can share here: Banks are not the only places to get loans from. Friends may have surplus cash they are willing to lend to someone who has the ability and diligence to make it grow. Or, cooperative groups that provide assistance to its members for a small business loan or for a multi-purpose loan. Taking the first step to look for capital for investing can produce great changes in one’s attitude and life. The trick to convincing people to part with their money so you can use it for your ideas is to present a simple and understandable business plan. It may not even be a written one. A verbal description of a project may already convince a relative or friend to lend you money for a venture. Of course, some may require a written contract. Your confidence in your idea should lead you to abide by their terms if that is the only way you can get capital. A friend once leased out a vacant lot and sub-leased it as a parking lot for a trucking company. He put a guard round-the-clock and provided minimal improvement and made more than forty times what he paid for it monthly. Not a bad deal for a creative guy who had a simple idea and worked his idea into reality. And anyone can do that with enough imagination and courage. The seed money may not even have to be there because if one really believes in a project, it will pay for itself. The down-payment for a lease will be enough to cover a loan you initially took out. Keep cranking that brain of yours and you will eventually come upon an idea worth selling something valuable that you own in order to raise the capital and start rolling. Starting a business or keeping one running will always require getting your hands dirty. Cleaning bottles for a peanut butter business or feeding pigs on a daily basis in your small piggery farm can seem menial but a necessary part in teaching you the fundamentals of running a business. Eventually, when you have other people doing the dirty work, you will have a better insight as to how the business runs and what makes for a successful operation. Investing is not all about handling or making money; it is about thinking creatively, using your imagination, treating people compassionately and returning the fruits of your ventures back to your business and the people who keep the business growing and sustainable."
3,Are You Fearful of Your Finances in Your Retirement Years?,finance," Sadly, most women will answer 'yes'. That said, you have more control over your financial situation than you probably think. And if you don't think you have any control then it's time to be proactive and take some action. This is your life. This is your future. I know how easy it is to be complacent and figure it will all fall into place when the time comes. Or that your husband, father or brother will keep you financially safe and you don't have to worry your pretty little head about it. Hint: Men are not a retirement plan. Or, like me, your husband passes away and you have big decisions to make about Social Security. When to take Social Security is a big decision and not to be taken lightly. You are a smart, savvy and talented woman. You have a good head on your shoulders. You are a 'take charge' woman in almost all areas of your life. Does that include your finances? The reality is men are much better about this than we women. Finances can scare you and when you are scared or intimidated you have a tendency to do nothing. You can't afford to do nothing! This is your future we are talking about. Do you really want to have to live with your children because you have no other option? Do you know that women lose 60% of their wealth after a death or divorce? (This is from Bob Melville, an economist that teaches at the University of Denver's Women's College. He suggested what he considers an informative and easy read book. ""Your Money or Your Life"" by Robin, Vicki,Dominguez, Joe,Tilford, Monique Here are some other tips he recommends: Take out 4% in your retirement fund to keep up with inflation Best to take out your Social Security at age 70 if you can wait that long. That will yield you the highest monthly payments made to you If you have an Annuity, does it have 'cost of living ' riders? Not all do. This was news to me: if you are divorced and were married at least 10 years you may be eligible for half of his Social Security. And don't worry, he will never know you are getting a monthly check and it will not hurt his Social Security. This is true even if he has remarried. Please don't dilly dally on this. If you have been putting off getting the straight 'news' about your retirement situation, it's time to start. Do you have a financial advisor? I have been with mine for over 25 years. Do you need one? Are you doing all your retirement investing on your own? That's fine if you are confident you know what you are doing. I am really not trying to frighten you. I want you to be informed. I want you to have happy and financially safe retirement years. We live longer than men so we need to plan well. To our long lived, financially free retirement years!"
4,Understanding Dutch Payroll,finance," EAFS consulting BV are a Dutch Payroll consultancy for contractors. Each country has its own unique spin on payroll, social security and income taxation. The Dutch market is no exception, with the documentation and procedures often being complicated and time consuming. The Dutch tax authorities ruled in 1997 that any foreign company directing employees or contractors to an assignment within The Netherlands are seen as having 'fictitious residence' for tax purposes. What this means is that any employee on placement or assignment in Holland or The Netherlands are subject to Dutch income tax, right from the first working day. This requires the foreign company in question to set up a payroll administration and ensure the correct tax and social security are paid every month. If the company doesn't undertake these requirements for the certain individual then the client responsible for the employees in The Netherlands is held liable for any tax debt incurred. The consequences can be large and costly. Euro Consulting BV are specialists in dealing with Dutch Payroll and can assist in all stages of procedures to safeguard legal compliancy and warrant money saving within Dutch law. Rules around Dutch Payroll Administration Identification It is imperative that the identity of each individual employee is established before making them available to the Dutch labour market. It is also heavily recommended that the employees' identity is established before the beginning of their start in the Netherlands. This can be in the form of a valid identity card, such as a passport, an EU Identity card, EEA or EU residence documents I - IV or a refugee passport. It is advisable to note that establishing an identity from a driving license alone is forbidden. Furthermore, if an identity cannot be established in the accepted manners then a higher wage tax will be withheld. Dutch SOFI Number The Tax and Customs Authorities assign each individual taxpayer an individual Social and Fiscal Number - also known as a SOFI Number. A person who doesn't live in the Netherlands is still taxable by the Dutch Government if they work within the country's borders and, therefore, they have to apply for a SOFI number also. There are various tax offices that can deal with applications, ranging from the 'Alkmaar' office to the 'Zwolle' office. When applying for a SOFI number, the applicant must submit an identity card with validity. Accepted forms of ID include a passport, EU Identity Card or a national identity card from a country within Europe. Please be advised that a driving licence will not be accepted as a valid ID card. Individuals who don't come from a country within the European Union or the EEA (Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland) should hold a valid residency permit containing a statement highlighting that they are permitted to work alongside a valid work permit. These should be submitted when applying for a SOFI number. Calculating Dutch Payroll Tax Payroll taxes should be calculated from all forms or any remuneration that the employee receives during, and on the basis of, their employment tenure. These main forms are salary, overtime pay, holiday pay, 13th month's salary and commission alongside anything else paid to an employee as return for work services. Tax-free expense allowances relating to non-resident employees, sustained in exercising their employment within The Netherlands, can be split into two sectors. The first is 'extraterritorial costs', with extra monetary expense for living outside the individuals' country of origin. This includes double housing costs and traveling costs between a home country and The Netherlands. Certain persons may be eligible under the 30% ruling facility in respect of these costs. The second sector is 'Other Costs', this covers the cost of commuting if applicable, industrial clothing and professional literature and paperwork. The 'Wage Tax, National Insurance Contributions and Employee Insurance Contributions' manual issued to agents and clients list all tax-free allowances, noting that most cost allowances are part of the wage packet and are therefore not exempt from Dutch tax under law. As an employer, it is possible to pay a tax-free reimbursement for any costs incurred by the employee or contractor in line or connection with his or her work; if it can be displayed and demonstrated that the costs applied for reimbursement where actually paid for in the first place. It should be noted that the original invoices, receipts and bills showing all incurred financial costs need to be retained and kept with the accounts and that expense allowances can only be reimbursed on the basis and permission of Dutch law. Any difference in rules or amounts are completely irrelevant if the employee or contractor is working in The Netherlands - working on Dutch soil results in all relevant Dutch tax laws. Dutch 30% Ruling It is possible, for some expatriates, to work under the 30% ruling (or in Dutch: 30% regeling). This can be incredibly advantageous as, overall, the amount of income taxable will be drastically reduced. Euro Consulting BV are specialized in obtaining the 30% ruling for expatriates and can assist with the entire procedure. In order to obtain the 30% Ruling, certain requirements have to be met. The expatriate has to be an employee who is employed in another country by an employer or sent out to an employer within the same group of companies at management level. They also have to be specific in expertise within an area that is lacking in suitable and qualified individuals. Payment to employees of an extraterritorial nature in order to compensate and prevent expense outside the country of origin (in relation to employees entering at the joint request of the employee and the employer) will be considered as remuneration for extraterritorial expenses up to 30% of the sum of the gross wage or salary received and on tuition fees. Tuition fees covering payments for children related to the expatriate to partake in secondary or primary school education within international schools or establishments can be applied for, up to the amounts charged by the educational establishment along the lines of its rates for teaching. Costs involving accommodation are excluded but traveling expenses are included. It is not permitted to split the aforementioned gross salary within the employment agreement for a taxable part of 70% and a tax-free part of 30%. The gross wage or salary has to be deduced to 70% of the total, of which on top of there is a tax free remuneration of 30% of the total to be paid. The consequence of this format is that all rights based on salary will be reduced also - such as pension or social security. Furthermore, an appendix towards the agreement of employment has to be made. Euro Consulting BV can assist with this entire process. Specific Skills and Expertise in The Netherlands Whether or not an employee or contractor is in possession of the specific skills and expertise required is subject to an evaluation. This is judged on the level of education of the expatriate, the experience of the expatriate and the salary of the position concerned. Any employee or contractor working in middle or higher management in relation to an international concern (holding at least two and a half years experience in that concern) who is sent into the Dutch job market will be seen as having specific skills, expertise and experience considered scarce within The Netherlands. Term Time Allowable For contractors and employees, the term allowed for this scheme is a maximum of ten years. This starts from the first day of employment through the employer. If the particular entered employee or contractor should no longer hold the expertise and/or skills considered rare in the Dutch job market then the term is reduced to no less than five years. Once starting the sixth year, the tax authorities can request the employer demonstrate why the employee has to be considered an entered expatriate employee. Change of Employer If the situation arises where an expatriate contractor or employee should have a different employer during their term in The Netherlands, then the 30% scheme will remain in action at the joint request of the employer and the employee for all remaining time. However, if the transition between the end of agreement with one employer and the beginning of another is longer than three months then severe complications can arise. It will also be required for the new employer to prove the contractor or employee is to be identified and designated as an entered employee. Prior Stay within The Netherlands The term will be reduced accordingly should an employee have worked or stayed within Dutch borders prior to their next employment start date. If the prior stay or employment finished over 15 years ago then it is not taken into account. If the period of employment or stay ended over ten years ago but under fifteen years ago then it will not be taken into account as long as the individual has not entered the country as an employee for a decade. Starting Date in The Netherlands If there is a request made within four months of the employment start date as an expatriate and extraterritorial employee, a request for application to the 30% scheme or continued application can be made to the Heerlen tax office. If the request is made later than four months, the decision will apply on the 1st of the month following the acceptance from the tax office. In the situation where there is a reduction of term, the time period will be rounded into full calendar months. Non-Residency Status Any expatriate qualifying as a resident Dutch taxpayer can opt to be taxed as a 'deemed non-resident taxpayer'. By doing this, the contractor or employee doesn't need to report investment income, if it isn't Dutch sourced (such as real estate), to the Dutch Revenue. Documentation Required for Dutch 30% Ruling If you need to file an application for the 30% ruling in The Netherlands, you will require: A dated and signed power of attorney of the employer and employee. A CV for the Employee A completed application for the 30% Ruling A job description and letter of rarity. Euro Consulting BV At Euro Consulting BV, We can assist and take care of applications for the 30% Ruling alongside other formalities in The Netherlands. Euro Consulting BV can take complete control over administration and Dutch payroll when working in The Netherlands. We can also take full jurisdiction of dealings with the Dutch Tax and National Security Office. Fully specialized in the Dutch labour market, we can offer services through our BV, ensuring legality while helping you to gain the best possible marketplace retention rate. We are specialists in obtaining and implementing the 30% ruling, generally considered to be the most essential part of tax planning within The Netherlands. Social Security and Tax are deducted at source, calculated on the tax card basis, submitted for each individual at the beginning of every fiscal year."
5,Hedge funds eye a profit from European bank research retreat,finance," As Europe's big investment banks and brokerages scale back their research efforts, particularly towards small and mid-sized companies, some hedge funds and other specialist players spy an opportunity. If the major players aren't ferreting out investment ideas among Europe's thousands of non blue-chip companies, figuring the effort is too costly and time-consuming at a time of cutbacks and rationalization, other participants see a chance to capitalize on the resultant gap in the market. The hope? That less analysis and information flow has left the best investment ideas undiscovered, even in an era of data overload via everything from specialist investor websites to social media. ""If it's shrinking, that research is going to be replaced by independent research firms and hedge funds, which are doing their own deep dive and explicitly investing behind their ideas,"" said Soren Aandahl, head of research at activist investor Glaucus. Data underlines the scale of research cutbacks among the big banks. Four in every 10 European stocks tracked by analysts have seen a drop in coverage over the last two years, twice the number of firms recording a rise, Thomson Reuters figures show. And calculations by Reuters based on year-end statements show Europe's 30 largest banks by stock market value cut staff by 80,000 in 2013 alone - not all equity analysts of course but certainly that category was far from immune. This has led to fewer eyes looking at some of the 9,000 listed companies in Europe, especially those with a smaller market capitalisation. Some clients have noticed the difference. ""For many of the European mid-cap companies we cover, the breadth, depth and quality of the sell-side research (from banks and brokers) has declined,"" said Moni Sternbach, head of European mid-cap investing at $6.5 billion hedge fund firm Cheyne Capital. LUCRATIVE IDEA Yet finding the right investment idea among overlooked small companies can still prove lucrative, as evidenced by events around Spanish wireless networks provider Gowex, a thinly analyzed company whose shares fell 60 percent after a firm called Gotham City Research issued a detailed report questioning its accounts. Gowex subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Gotham City had said in its original report that it stood to benefit from a drop in Gowex shares, presumably by taking a ""short"" position by borrowing stock it then sold in the expectation of being able to buy it back cheaper. U.S.-based Gotham may also have been taking advantage of Europe having been hit harder in equity research than other regions, given a steep fall in commissions paid to banks by fund managers and a subsequent focusing by banks on the large companies that are more likely to offer them other business. That same pressure on resources has also seen the quality of research fall, some fund managers say, with some companies often only covered by a brief note when they release their results. But there can be risks in being too original. Even if an investor discovers a great bet, the rest of the market may be too slow to agree. ""Lower coverage means it may take longer for your expected price action to crystallize and hence increase your risks and carrying cost,"" said Aquico Wen, owner of fund firm Victoire, referring to the cost of having money tied up in a position. NOTHING NEW In the case of Alent, a performance materials company that was demerged in 2012 from Cookson, now renamed Vesuvius, activist fund manager GO Investment Partners advised the firm to split, expecting the market to applaud the move, only for the firm's stock to drift sideways. ""There was no-one to take it up,"" said Steve Brown, chief executive of GO. ""These analysts carry on following Croda or Elementis (other comparable companies) because they've done it for the last 40 years, but none would take anything new on."" After finding a hidden gem or dog, funds hope a catalyst such as an analyst earnings revision, an improvement in analyst coverage levels or a change in the business - such as a well-executed business plan or, in the case of Gowex an admission of fraud - will trigger a strong move in the share price. One winner has been Cheyne Capital, whose stakes in Irish firms UDG Healthcare and DCC surged when the companies relisted in London, drawing more analyst coverage. DCC Plc is now tracked by 10 analysts, up from just one at the start of last year, and its shares have risen about 40 percent after it moved fully to the London Stock Exchange in May 2013. UDG has gained 50 percent after a similar move in October 2012 and a five-fold rise in analyst cover in two years. Cheyne Capital's Sternbach is one of those convinced that less bank-led equity research means room for those prepared to do the legwork. ""The reduction in sell-side research provides opportunities for active buy-side asset managers,"" Sternbach said. ""Particularly the fundamental bottom-up stock pickers with a focus on meeting management teams and undertaking their own research."""

7,Explore Strategies and Signals for Trading Stocks,finance," It is fascinating occasionally to observe stock traders attempting to make a profit without the benefit of a trading strategy that is good from trading. Trying to trade the stock market with no strategy that a trader is assured in is one sure method to drop hard-earned cash. Such a trader probably will lose their resources before producing any and is like a vehicle without headlights at night. There are numerous stock trading strategies available to UK stock traders. A number of the best stock trading techniques are truly the most straightforward. It depends on the personal stock trader to find the greatest strategy that can make him the most earnings out. It takes time and testing to figure out the best trading strategy. 1.Hedging An investor is trying to decrease the risk inherent in holding a special stock, when he is currently hedging. If the investor is fearful a stock could fall within a particular time, he can set up a set option to shield downward threat. An investor has an option to purchase put options against the market or even against individual shares itself. The only problem with this scheme is that there's a limitation to how much a dealer can make. But the yield in investing is guaranteed and the investor can plan accordingly. There are numerous other trading strategies that a trader can use to pick value stocks that are great. With respect to the sort of stock trader you are, you've a choice between strategies t that is really risky Stock Trading Signals Looking for and finding stocks that are not unprofitable is both a science and an art. Through the use of various stock-picking methods from basic analysis to technical analysis and occasionally both, stock traders are constantly looking for the greatest and most profitable stocks to buy. For long term investors, the need to pick on a stock that is perfect is not great. This can be because a long term investor is not thinking about the day to day moves in a stock-price but rather on strong long term principles in an inventory. For short term investors or day traders, a need is to get stocks at the best cost possible so that you can make a profit. Professional stock traders in Great Britain have on earth to hunt and discover quality stocks that are good. Stock can spend most of the time viewing for the right opportunity in the marketplace to buy or sell stocks. Most small stock investors on the other hand might not possess the luxury of observing the marketplace. They might have day-jobs or other obligations and therefore might not have enough time or energy to take advantage of market weaknesses. The need to try to find the best trading opportunities even for inventory traders who cannot follow the market has resulted in the influx of stock trading signals companies. The main objective of groups or such businesses will be to send stock traders telling market alerts of a stock trading opportunity that is possible them. Stock traders who tend not to have the time or knowledge to pick stocks subscribe with the expectation of producing easy profits to stock trading sign services. Such services may use fundamental analysts' services. Nevertheless, most of these solutions involve technical analysis. Despite the fact that many stock trading signals companies use people to make trading decisions, a growing tendency is towards using automated stock trading systems. Using either common or proprietary technical indicators, the stock trading signals companies use automated software to generate trading opportunities. The trading signals are subsequently sent to the subscriber in the shape of a newsletter, e-mail, sms or even telephone calls. Sometimes, the trading signals are delivered in the form of trading software or membership in a website. Stock trading signals' company is quite lucrative. The gains that can accrue have attracted characters. Choosing an excellent stock trading signals company in Great Britain is now just as difficult as picking a stock that is good. The truth that most of these firms don't feel inclined to explain their trading schemes keeps a potential investor in the dark. The inventory investor is encouraged to be quite careful before following the trading ideas which are delivered. Without the knowledge of how a particular stock trading signal is arrived at, investors can easily be tricked. It's very important before subscribing to such businesses to do proper due diligence. So long as there are people who wish to trade in the stock exchange and there exists a lack of time and information to trade, subsequently stock trading signals companies will continue to prosper. It is important for the inventory trader to weigh the pros and cons of subscribing to such companies."
8,The Use Of Non-Surgical Procedures To Reverse Ageing Caused By Stress,finance," Stress is a feeling that everyone experiences from time to time, and this is because we are all faced with certain tasks and goals that need to be achieved in our daily lives. The most influential cause of stress is caused by the expectations that others have of us. Regardless if the individuals are your parents, teachers, employer or even your spouse and children, there is always some need of gratification that we try to attain in pleasing other people. Throughout this article a discussion regarding how stress influences the bodies ageing process shall be discussed. Furthermore the discussion will deliberate on what medical procedures an individual can follow in order to reduce the signs of ageing. Ageing is a factor that most people try to avoid for as long as possible, however this seems to be harder to achieve in today's day and age. The reasons why an individual's stress and ageing correlate, is because of the pressures individuals face in their day to day lives. Although stress in not a good feeling to have, it is important that throughout an individual's life time, they experience some forms of stress but in good moderation. This is a vital experience to have, as it allows people to prepare for future devastating events that will ultimately give them a cognitive understanding on how to handle stressful situations. One of the inevitable effect of encountering stressful situations is the impact that it has on an individual's ageing process. For many individuals especially for women this is an overwhelming aspect and it can over time add to the overall stress and ageing process. As a result it has become more common that we find people who approach medical practitioners to perform non-surgical procedures such as, face lifts, brow lifts, and chin enhancements. The procedures are often a lot less painful and have a lower health and disfigurement risk associated with them compared with surgical operations. Today anyone who has the appropriate means to attain these non-surgical procedures is now able to have them done whenever they wish. There is now even medical financial institutions that will assist individuals in attain these procedures, should individuals not have the appropriate financial access. Although it is important to acknowledge that should an individual make use of medical finance institutions, they need to ensure that they are able to budget their repayments appropriately in order to remain in good financial standing. In conclusion it can be said that because of the daily stress people have, it takes a toll on them physically. This as a result influences how people feel about themselves, and ultimately causes an individual to take drastic measures to avoid ageing."
9,IRS Finally Gets It Right - This Is The Penalty-Free Path Forward American Late Filers Have Been Waiting For,finance," Big Data and an ever aggressive approach by the IRS toward ferreting out Americans living abroad who are not current with their US tax filing has, so far, not yielded the results that the US government hoped for. With a tax system that is based largely upon voluntary compliance, the United States wields a big stick, and yet they realize that in reality a carrot may yield a much better result. The big stick in this circumstance is FATCA, the Foreign Asset Tax Compliance Act, which so far has signed on 77 thousand banks worldwide and 70 countries to report to the US where Americans reside and what accounts they hold. The carrot, on the other hand is the New Streamlined Procedure ... Come See The Softer Side Of Having Your Own Streamlined Procedure! New IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, in a public announcement has stated, ""We're expanding the Streamlined Procedures to cover a much broader group of US taxpayers we believe are out there who have failed to disclose their foreign accounts but who were not willfully evading their tax obligations. To encourage these taxpayers to come forward, we're expanding the eligibility criteria, eliminating a cap on the amount of tax owed to qualify for the program, and doing away with a questionnaire that applicants were required to complete."" The New Streamlined Procedure requires that Americans file only 3 years back taxes and 6 years’ worth of FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reports). In addition the New Streamlined Procedure - Requires that taxpayers simply certify that previous failures to comply were due to non-willful conduct (that you didn't know of your obligation to file) Waives all penalties for US taxpayers residing outside the United States Eliminates a requirement that the taxpayer have $1,500 or less of unpaid tax per year (previously a person who owed more than $1500 was not eligible to participate) Eliminates a required risk questionnaire (a questionnaire that had been used to exclude a significant number of filers who wished to comply but were deemed ‘ineligible’) The IRS has had a program in place for American expats who were late filers for some time. In 2012, the IRS introduced the original Streamlined Procedure and even though it offered a way forward for many Americans who were behind on their US tax filing, many others remained skeptical and unconvinced that this was a safe opportunity with no potential for penalties and further reprisals from the IRS. Many Americans feared opening a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences that might result by placing themselves voluntarily on the slab for the IRS to examine. Many Americans chose to stay off the IRS’s radar and to do - nothing. Bring Out The New Streamlined Procedure Expanding on his comments, Koskinen went on to say, ""This opens a new pathway for people to come into tax compliance. The new version of our Streamlined Procedure reflects a carefully balanced approach. It provides a way for US taxpayers living abroad who didn't know they were out of compliance to catch up on their US filing requirements without paying steep penalties. We have made important adjustments to provide opportunities for all US taxpayers to come in. A compliance regime that is too harsh won’t net the desired result. With the new Streamlined Procedure, there is no reason not to come into compliance."""
10,Solving Problems with a Pawn Broker,finance," There are a number of problems that people face with pawn brokers. However, there are two problems that people worry about the most when they deal with a pawn broker. These two problems are when you cannot pay them back and when you lose the pawn receipt that you have been given. It is important that you know what you can do if you are faced with these problems. When You Can’t Pay the Pawn Broker Back There are a lot of people who take loans with a pawn broker that they feel they will be able to pay back. However, there are times when you will not be able to pay back the amount that you need. The options that you have available to you will vary depending on the value of the loan and what you are comfortable with. If you are comfortable with losing the item of value that you have put up a security of the loan then you do not have to do much. When you are unable to pay the broker back they will sell the item and this could cover the loan amount that you cannot repay. However, if the sale of the item does not cover the loan then you are still liable for repayment. If the sale of the item results in more money than you owe the pawn broker must give you the difference. If you have a loan that is less than £75 the item you put up will belong to the broker and they can sell it. If the loan is more than £75 then the item will still belong to you, but the pawn broker is allowed to sell it. For loans that are over £100 the pawn broker will need to tell you before they sell the item which gives you time to get the money together for it. When You Lose Your Receipt There are a lot of people who worry about what could happen if they lose the receipt that they are given. The value of the loan you have taken will also affect what you can do if you lose the receipt. If the loan is less than £75 you can get a standard form from the pawn broker which you sign. This form states that you are the owner of the item. The problem with this is that the broker is not obligated to give this to you. If the loan has a value of more than £75 then you will not be able to get a standard form. In this case you will need to legally swear that you own the item. To do this you have to go to a magistrate or a commissioner for oaths and swear before them. The two most common problems that people face when using pawn brokers are not being able to pay back the loan and losing the receipt they get. It is important that you know what you can do in these cases before you actually use a pawn broker. When you know what could go wrong you can determine whether or not you should be using a pawn broker."
11,Insurance Software Solutions - Build or Buy,finance," Like many business marketplaces, the P & C industry  is an extremely competitive one. Companies that want to be successful need to develop, grow, and manage their business effectively- yet to successfully accomplish this, today's insurers need to recognize industry trends and optimize them. However, in today's uncertain marketplace and rapidly advancing technology environment, innovation can be a risk. And while insurers are familiar with risks- most have built their business around identifying, analyzing, managing, and insulating against them, deciding on which trends to follow and what opportunities to leverage, is a critical decision. With the advances in technology and the constant fluctuations in identifying risk factors, now more than ever, it is important to have a system that can deliver instant access, along with the ability to respond and manage your exposure.  Yet when it comes to modernizing your operation, to maximize efficiencies of business processes, businesses often face the choice of whether to build or buy the software. Like any careful insurers, it is imperative to weigh the factors and consequences carefully. After all, the repercussions of a software choice can be long lasting and affect all your business systems and processes. Many businesses assume that building their own in-house software is an easier route; especially considering that it would be customized for their organization. Since it is developed and maintained by in-house staff, you have total control over the software, changes, updates and overall design.  However they often overlook the fact that a tailored solution could result in increased costs, including the addition or enlargement of IT teams and of front-end time by employees. Not to mention ongoing maintenance of the policy administration system, unsupported by an external company, as well as the costs for system developers necessary to help construct and implement such infrastructure. Businesses are often misled on the upfront expenses of an in-house build, as it is nearly impossible to estimate all of the modifications that are sometimes overlooked during the initial design. In an effort to assist insurers with the decision about whether building or buying an insurance software solution is best for your company, we've complied a small comparative to consider regarding the differences between ""buy"" and ""build."" UPFRONT COSTS Build: It can be difficult when factoring in upfront costs, to build a custom insurance software solution, because initial investment in hardware as well as software may be required. Additionally specific software development tools, training and staff time must also be included in estimates. A common perception when developing in-house software is that users will not expect as much from it as a purchased software package, that they will be more forgiving of its shortcomings. But in reality, users demand as much, if not more, from software developed in-house. Not only that, users often think that because the developers are in-house and accessible, they can request customizations and changes whenever they want, which is obviously not an efficient way to manage expectations. A policy administration solution can be particularly tough to estimate the total investment; you have to include the cost of the resources involved in environment & software development, including : • Requirements gathering • Infrastructure construction • Analyzing • Designing • Implementation • Testing • Training users • Ongoing maintenance/enhancements/updates of the software Buy: Purchasing an insurance solution suit or policy administration software is often more cost efficient, as it eliminated many of the costs involved in architecture design and development, however there are still licensing fees subscription costs, particularly with Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Subscription or pay-as-you-go models can minimize risk, as a business can roll in applications based on need. Vendors often include  a setup or installation fee, which in some cases may also include a maintenance package or service plan. Additionally, when opting to buy a solution, you want to ensure that expansion costs are considered -as adaptability of the product  is a key advantage especially for expanding distribution channels and/or leveraging new market opportunities. Other typical costs to factor in include on-site requirements gathering and training, as well as any travel expenses which are often involved. DEVELOPMENT TIME Build: Business need to factor in the multitude of required meetings necessary to plan, discuss, design, execute proof-of-concept, and maintain continual development. Requirements gathering, writing and testing the application code, user training and acceptance, hardware/software coordination and testing systems, comprises only a portion of the time necessary to developing a customized system. Each of these stages can take months or even years before you’re ready for launch, which can be further complicated by system defects, flaws, and revisions. Buy: Speed-to-Market is a term that has been abundantly utilized, as insurers recognize the importance of rapid response, fast turnaround and the downside of development time. When you buy an insurance software solution, true speed-to-market is easier to achieve with a competent product that can be ready to launch, and it only requires an investment in time for user training. Proven vendors often have honed their experience in an effort to provide the most effective and efficient development and testing methodologies, thereby allowing businesses to focus on adapting to a new system. There are however, considerable challenges too, as vendors may tout a rapid deployment, however if there are complications in a build, or they fail to adhere to  company's business requirements, inevitable delays can turn costly. Of course, this situation could be prevented/controlled with a careful management process. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE Build:  Anyone who has an iPhone or who has ever logged into Windows is probably familiar with the message indicating software updates are available and to install. Regular release updates not only improve functionality, but also to eliminate flaws. However, when software is developed in-house, there are added costs involved for development, testing and design, especially in order to keep software from becoming dated or obsolete. In order for a system to remain innovative, it must remain current and effective. As most Legacy system users learned (the hard way) if your system is not future-proof, than technology will continue to evolve, regardless of whether your business can. Buy:  When you purchase policy administration software, updates and maintenance are the responsibility of the vendor, as opposed to in-house staff. While this is an often overlooked benefit, it can be a key factor, as having the ability to stay modern is a critical element for business. Additionally, SaaS solutions also have the added advantage of rolling out new releases, quickly and efficiently without the need to train additional resources or invest time into programming and development. SOFTWARE MATURITY Build: Like a fine wine, good software often needs time to age, or rather mature. if your programmers have fast fingers, your data can be captured and coded quickly, however no matter how speedy your developers are, there is no rushing quality. Software developed in-house is especially taxing, on both the builders and the testers, as there are always 'bugs' to squash and faults to find. It can takes years of development and maintenance—not to mention a quite a lot time and money before the system meets the requirements that guided its development and design, works as expected, and can be implemented with those same characteristics. Even though a custom-built application may seem to offer control and flexibility, build-your-own-software can lock your company into a less than optimal solution. Buy:  Solution vendors have the benefit of having invested their time, money and resources into perfecting solid software that they can tailor to fit your needs. Gone are the days when one dimensional insurance portals are packaged and sold, with rigid tactical application for submission and limited data capture. Now solutions are being honed to fit the growing demands and ever changing imperatives of business. Vendors can now focus on increasing acceleration, value, and innovation, so when a business chooses their system, the software arrives with already proven performance quality. OTHER FACTORS Build: The reality with most businesses, particularly insurers, is anything can happen. Budgets can change based on economical factors, and so can moods, minds, and development criteria. There are no guarantees that could bridge the gap between an in house system’s capabilities and the actual implemented system, which those who have encountered this dilemma know, can often become exceedingly significant. There are a myriad of other factors that businesses must consider when building their own solution, like: Do our business and IT Strategies align ? Is our solution adaptable, responsive, and future-proof? Is our design scalable ? Can it cater to the businesses growth and expansion into new markets ?   What if the developer(s)who build our in-house system are heading out the door? What resources should we be willing to sacrifice if we maximize our budget but encounter unexpected issues ? How do we accommodate for an unsuccessful implementation ? When and how can we measure growth, return on investment (ROI) and true speed-to-market ? Buy:  SaaS solutions, particularly those with a scalable suite of insurance processing applications that handle core functionality, have measurable benefits, including faster time to value, minimized operational costs, and simplified integration. Any software investment should yield positive results, whether they address complex system challenges by streamlining operations, reduce costs, leverage new market opportunities, or as with some vendors, a unique combination of all.  Proven software solutions should have an agile development methodology, which would allow for a continuously enhanced platform, and ensure that custom feature requests can be folded into the base application.  A system with true multi-tenant architecture will enable every client to benefit from system enhancements.  Being adept at implementations, especially those that are scaled to fit any size insurer, as well as having exceptional experience in software development, maintenance and systems integration, is also a key factor when opting to buy. Other  compelling items to consider when trying to decide whether to  build or buy include: • Vendor solutions for policy administration applications have the capability to leverage reusable components. • Purchased software can often be easier/quicker integration with third-party technologies. • Reliability has been tested and proven. • Purchased software should be scalable, future-proof, and able to handle fluctuations in user demand, providing the ability to grow with your business. In conclusion, ultimately, there will be additional underlying aspects, many unique to your business's current and expected demands  which should also be explored, but in summary, as indicated by recent analyst and industry reports, organizations who opt to build often fall short of their expectations when choosing to build their own software, versus buying a system."
12,Credible US Educational Financial Solutions Reviews on Making Do with Leftover 529 Money,finance," The 529 Plan is one of the options parents have to bankroll their children’s college education. Saving up for college should begin years in advance and the balance grows by a certain percentage every year, tax-free (especially for state-sponsored plans). There might be one slight problem though – what if your child decides against going to university, and has, instead opted to take elective units in community college, or has chosen to work soon after graduating from high school. So you have all that money ready for spending; it can be bewildering to have saved so much through the years and find out the funds will not be tapped after all. You had hoped your pride and joy would enter one of the top schools, with annual tuition fees topping several tens of thousands of dollars a year. How do you put that money to good use, if it can’t be used anymore for the purpose it was originally meant for? Accurate US Educational Financial solutions reviews can give you ideas on how to husband the sudden cash trove in the 529 account. A part of you might think about withdrawing the money right away. Running the numbers with your financial adviser can raise some red flags. For one thing, you will be forced to pay a corresponding federal and state income tax according to the beneficiary’s tax bracket. Account for a 10% penalty on a non-qualified withdrawal’s earnings, plus additional state charges, if you take the withdrawal option. However, if your child landed a scholarship, you can still withdraw up to the scholarship’s value without penalties. If your child opts not to use the 529 account at all, your finance specialist can recommend changing the beneficiary to a sibling or a first cousin. No taxes will be imposed when this happens. When you change the beneficiary to another generation like your grandchild, a gift tax liability will be imposed on the original beneficiary. Some financial experts may suggest keeping tabs on the account’s balance and the investments they are used on. However, you can consider a switch of plan if the performance is found wanting. The money that has been sitting in the 529 account can be considered as a special fund for future purposes. Consult with some financial wellness service, such as the US Educational Financial Solutions Reviews to help you weigh your options.

13,UK Pawnshops: Traditional Vs. Modern Way Of Lending,finance," As the recession continues to hurt the economy, we will continue seeing shops close left and right. However, there is a particular industry that is booming and has since expanded to become one of the most promising industries. Since last year, the National Pawnbrokers Association has reported an estimated 8% growth in the pawnshop industry in UK as more and more middle to high class individuals turn to pawnshops as a way to get money in exchange of personal assets. Through the years, it has long since evolved from a simple street corner business to a sophisticated and high end contract between a borrower and creditor. Pawnbroking services can vary depending on the pawnshops. There are those that accept wine collections or premium aged cheese as collateral. Currently there are two types of pawnshops operating in UK: Brick and Mortar – The traditional way of doing business. A borrower goes to a pawn shop to have their valuables appraised. Transactions are done on a face to face basis where both parties agree on a specific contract. The benefit of doing business with a brick and mortar pawnshop is that the borrower can build a relationship with the lender that can be beneficial for both. A borrower can easily get an extension on the due date or a lower interest rate if he has shown credible payment history and is considered as a regular by the owner.  Lenders can get additional clients through referrals made by the borrower. It can also build reputation and increase clients in the long run. The downside of doing this kind of business is that you cannot easily expand and have immediate access to other clients and clients have to personally go to a store to have an item pawned. Online - With the evolution of technology, pawnbroking can now be done through online transaction. Borrowers no longer need to go personally to a shop to have their valuables appraised. By doing online transaction, appraisal and delivery of pawned items and exchange of money can be done with a simple click of the mouse. It is all about convenience and making it easier and faster for the client. Furthermore, it gives access to a wider market as it makes it easier for other people to try borrowing from a pawnshop. The downside of doing this kind of business is that it does not go beyond a professional service. Although service can be impeccable, it strictly follows certain policies and rules that can be a bit stifling and irritating for clients. Another cause for worry is that vital information such as address and name is being sent online, which makes it vulnerable to hackers and other internet savvy individuals."
14,"Black Swans, Ugly Ducklings, Golden Geese",finance," Black Swans, Ugly Ducklings, Golden Geese Hi Friends, Cayden has shared regarding Black Swan and Value Investing in the last post. (Click Here to Read). bird-sightings-black-swan-2 Allow me to share my perspective especially with regard to the application portion. Most seasoned investors know that crisis is the time where most profits are made because wealth is not loss during that time, it merely changed hands. This is the case for stocks, real estate or almost any asset classes where you have mastery in. Let’s go back to one of the ""Black Swan"" period just less than a decade ago, The Global Financial Crisis of 2007- 2008. Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 8.56.55 AM This is the period of time many stocks look ""terrible"". If I may, they look like ugly ducklings which nobody wants.  Bear in mind that there are stocks that have lousy fundamentals which we will avoid because for lousy companies, almost any price may be too high a price. When I talk about Ugly Ducklings, these are stocks that will eventually turn into beautiful swans or even better… Golden Geese. And when is it the best time to get these stocks? Exactly, during Black Swan events when they look like Ugly Ducklings. ugly_duckling_hero_432_243 Some examples of Ugly Ducklings Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 9.06.58 AM When this stock started falling in 2007 and look ugly, guess what did Investors do? Lets see some records: a. Ruane Cunniff bought KMX at an average price of $23.5, clocking about 85% increase now. b. Warren Buffett bought KMX at an average price of $23.5 as well, clocking 85% increase. c. George Soros bought KMX at various times at an average of about $20, clocking 108%. d. Ron Baron bought KMX at average price of $20+ clocking around 80% to 100%. c. Chuck Akre bought at an average price of $20, clocking around 100%. Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 9.26.16 AM Now, who bought this ugly duckling in the Black Swan Crisis? a. Ron Baron bought at an average of $13.50 clocking 373% now. b. Jean Marie Eveillard bought at an average of $16.35% clocking 291% c. Joel Greenblatt bought at an average of $9.35 clocking more than 500%. d. Wallace Weitz bought at an average of $16+ clocking about 200% What is the lesson here? It goes back to one of Warren Buffett’s famous quote, ""Be Greedy others are Fearful and Be Fearful when Others are Greedy."" But in order to be able to do that, we need to have mastery over our investments. Again, if you have invested in times of crisis, you would have bought many ugly looking ducklings that would have become golden goose darlings. ??????? Of course, Value Investing is one of the methods out there that can help us profit in the stock market and in my opinion, I like it the best because of how passive it can be. Let me also share that it is really practical for a person like me who values time freedom and not having to monitor and predict the next black swan (which cannot be predicted anyway- see definition of black swan Here). And even when Golden Geese turns into Ugly Ducklings in Black Swan periods, the cool thing is that they still lay golden eggs. Let me just quote a few examples: Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 9.38.29 AM In the period of Black Swan 2007 and 2008, you can see that Coke increases its dividend in the so-called crisis. Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 9.39.38 AM So in Buffett’s case, where he owns 400,000,000, he collected: 2007 – $272,000,000 worth of dividends 2008 – $304,000,000 worth of dividends Ok, that may be a bit far fetch for retail investors like us. But what if we have accumulated 10,000 Coke shares over some years, we would have collected 2007 – $6800 2008 – $7,600 Depending on when you buy coke, this may be quite a decent income. And also, what can you do with these dividends during these times? YES! We can use them to buy more golden geese disguised as ugly ducklings! There are tons of examples of how collecting these golden geese when they look like ugly duckling can help us ride through the next black swan period which I will never know when it will come. But personally, over the years, I have collected enough cash producing assets to ride me through comfortably. Lastly, what I like being a Value Investor, is the relatively consistent and smooth ride in the market over years. Yes, there are ups and downs, but I am buying companies that are becoming richer every year and that means I become richer too. The stock market may not feel so at times, especially during crisis times, but well, my companies are still performing well in terms of profits and dividends during these periods even though the stock price does not reflect so in these times. But I love it because what it means is that during these times, I can collect even more good businesses at a much much cheaper price. For non-value investors, these times may look bad, and the numbers on your portfolio may even tell you that it is bad or you are losing, but the truth is as what Ben Graham says, ""In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine"". Let me give you the example of Ruane Cuniff’s Sequoia Fund. Performance of Sequoia Fund Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 10.00.22 AM From the table above, you can see that the fund did ""poorly"" in 2008 with a -27.03% and S&P did -37%.  But well, Value Investors love these periods because what it means is that we can buy ugly ducklings that are in fact golden geese. They bought aggressively these golden geese during 2008, for example Screen Shot 2014-04-16 at 10.06.38 AMSource: Gurufocus.com That is the likely reason after 2008, you can see that their performance is 2009 – 15.38% 2010 – 19.5% 2011 – 13.19% 2012 -15.68% 2013 – 34.58% Again, do check out the results of the other investors I have shared above – don’t take my words for it, I am not always right and I don’t profess to be. I am just a comfortable investor . Most importantly, we got to be equipped for such times, I hope you are!

16,What are Binary Options,finance," What are Binary Options? Binary options trading have become very popular amongst traders. Binary options allows the purchase of an asset where the buyer has the opportunity to gain a fixed payoff (almost double his investment) just by successfully predicting if the price will go up or down. The use of binary options trading will permit an investor to have the chance to gain a great amount of returns in a short period of time.  Binary can be considered as an event with two possible outcomes: one being ‘yes’ the other being ‘no’ meaning the outcome was not as predicted. The Meaning of Binary Options Trading The actual word binary means involving two, therefore for binary options trading refers to the two possibilities. If a trader invests a fixed amount on a binary option; if that option is successful the trader will receive back a fixed amount in profit, if the option is unsuccessful the trader will lose his invested amount, consequently making binary option investing a simple with direct process investment product. Call and Put Options A call option stands for the buy of the binary options at a predetermined price by a predetermined date (the expiry). The buyer of a call can buy asset at the specific price until expiry. If the buyer believes that the price of the asset is going to be higher than the price at the shutting time of maturity then the best choice is to place a call option. On the other hand, if a call options means you can buy, then a put is the option to sell the asset at a predetermined strike price until a fixed expiry date. The put option buyer can sell assets at the strike price, and if he chooses to sell, the put writer has to buy at that specific price. If the buyer believes that the price will go lower, the obvious choice would be to place a ""put"" option. For Example A trader chooses to invest in crude oil stocks. He buys 150 shares and he has to forecast if the price will go higher or lower at the expiry date. In addition to that he has the chance to pick the expiry time. At the moment, it would be logical to be watching the current strike price. If the selling price, or the price at maturity costs $50 per option and the trader wishes to buy 20 options at $100 each, thinking the price is going to be over $50 when the option reaches maturity. In this case, the trader will receive the agreed upon percentage of return. If the return is 82%, he will receive $182 per option x20 giving a total of $3,640 therefore the trader made $1,640 profit. If the price ends up above strike price the trader will lose his total initial investment. How to start trading Binary Options It would be advised to go online and search binary options brokers that are highly recommended by other traders as well as find reviews that are details and compare brokers between them in order to find the one that better meets your needs and fits the criteria of a good binary options broker. A good recommendation would be HY Binary options as it offers traders the following benefits: •	35 years of operational history •	Binary Accounts starting with only US$250 + Free demo accounts •	Up to 50% bonus •	FCA regulated broker •	82% Return •	Complete product offering"
17,Why Energy Suppliers Are Competing to Offer the Longest Fixed-Rate Tariff,finance," With summer coming to an end, a few things are to be expected: cooler temperatures, more jackets, and falling leaves. What the end of summer also means, however, is that energy prices are likely to begin rising soon. As more people begin turning up the heat, the demand on electricity and gas supplies is going to go up, and, as a result, the energy suppliers will all be raising their energy prices in the coming months. In fact, according to the Guardian newspaper, UK homeowners can expect to see their energy bills rise by £142 before the end of the year. For those who don’t take action now to switch to a cheaper energy tariff, that extra cost could have a significant impact on their savings. In response to this price increase, suppliers are now vying to outdo one another by offering increasingly attractive fixed-rate tariffs. This article looks at what fixed-rate tariffs are on offer, and what consumers should be aware of before signing up to one of these pricing schemes. Longer fixed-rate offers The trend in the energy market now, in light of rising energy prices, is to offer consumers fixed-rates for increasingly lengthy periods. Scottish Power has one such offer that will lock in customers to a fixed-rate of £1,350 until January 2017. Not far behind, EDF Power is offering a fixed-rate term until November 2016, also at £1,350 a year, but with the added benefit of having no exit fees. Cheaper fixed-rate deals are also on offer from other suppliers, although these tend to come with much shorter terms. M&S Energy, for example, offers a fixed-rate term until September 2014 at just £1,139 a year, although it does come with a £50 cancellation fee. Other suppliers are also expected to soon offer more competitive fixed-rate schemes, so it is worth customers’ time to continuously check with energy comparison sites to see what new fixed-rate tariffs are on offer. What to look for in a fixed-rate tariff The first thing to realize about a fixed-rate tariff is that they are rarely cheaper than a variable-rate tariff. Because consumers have the advantage of knowing that their energy prices will stay the same for a certain period, many suppliers tend to price their fixed-rates higher than their variable-rates. That being said, however, with energy prices expected to climb drastically this autumn, by locking into a fixed-rate tariff now, consumers could escape those price hikes. A wise approach may be to lock into a tariff with a shorter fixed-rate term as these tend to not only be cheaper than the longer term plans, but they will also allow consumers to avoid the winter price climb while still being able to shop around for a good variable-rate tariff next year. Keep in mind, however, that many fixed-rate terms tend to come with hefty cancellation fees, thus it is vital to make sure the consumer finds the perfect fixed-rate tariff before locking in to make sure he is not penalized should he choose to go with an even cheaper supplier later on. A fixed-rate tariff is ideal for those who want the peace of mind of knowing how much their energy is going to cost every month, but for those whose circumstances may fluctuate, then a variable-rate that will allow them to constantly shift from one supplier to the next will likely be a better product for their needs. With gas and electricity prices expected to rise significantly over the coming months, those who are looking to avoid these price hikes would be wise to act now. Energy suppliers currently have a number of new and competitive fixed-rate schemes on offer that will not only help consumers dodge the brunt of winter fuel price rises, but will also offer financial peace of mind."
18,The Importance of Doing a Gas Price Comparison,finance," In the UK, gas is rapidly becoming one of the most preferred energy sources for heating. Natural gas is an energy efficient heating source and the only clean fossil fuel. Prices on gas heating can vary depending on your location and your local gas supplier's tariffs. Information is critical to making good comparisons and choices about where to purchase your gas and it will help you save money. Gas prices have been rising sharply in the UK. This hits UK residents especially hard after last year's price increase by all of the six major energy companies. There are some things you can do to help your budget when it comes to these hefty price increases. There are several excellent price comparison sites online. You might check moneysupermarket.com, confused.com, or uswitch.com. These are only three of the online sites that are designed to help UK residents make a comparison of gas prices. An online search will find you several more helpful sites. •	Consider purchasing an online plan. These plans are the most competitively priced. If you have never switched before, you could save a bit of money. •	Read the tariffs closely, and understand the terms before switching. •	If you haven't switched before and are not on a dual fuel tariff, a fixed tariff may save you money. •	Check to see if a one-rate tariff or a two-tier tariff will favour your energy use. If you are a high-energy user you may want to consider the two-tier program, which starts charging more for the first segment of energy and then reducing the rate for additional energy used. After determining whether to stay with your current tariff or switch, it's time to take a good look at how you and your family use your energy on a day-to-day basis. Make a chart and evaluate how much energy you waste as family. One example is to keep track of how many times a day lights are left burning in empty rooms. You know your family's habits, so list the energy-wasting habits on a chart or checklist. Have it posted where it is easy to see and ask everyone to make an effort to start conserving instead of wasting. A few common energy conservation tips are listed for a guide. •	Close outside doors quickly when entering or leaving the home. •	Turn hot water faucets off and be sure they are not dripping. If you see drips, replace the washers. •	Close curtains at night to prevent draughts from chilling the room. •	Turn the thermostat down lower and wear a sweater. Use extra blankets at night and preserve a bit more heat. •	Do your baking on days when the wind is blowing so the heat from the oven can cut the chill a little. •	Place weather stripping on doors and windows to prevent cold air from leaking in. •	Look for areas of the home where more insulation is needed. Always check the loft first, as heat rises. •	Take your own meter readings and don't rely on any estimates the energy company proposes and places on your bill. •	Switch over to paying your bills online. With some suppliers, you can save up to 10% on your bill. •	Pay with direct debit for additional savings of between 5 and 10% with most suppliers. Be sure to check your annual statement and look for any overcharges. Prices are going up, but your bill can go down if you and your family are willing to put in the extra effort of finding the best tariff and change the habits that tend to waste energy."
19,Gas Prices Comparison,finance," The cost of energy has become a major part of household expenditures in the UK, and a gas prices comparison reveals that the price you will pay for gas depends on many factors, including where you live, who supplies the gas, and even how you pay for it. It can pay big dividends to do some research and make sure you are getting the best deal on gas. Typical energy bills can vary by as much as £80 from one end of the country to the other. The most expensive energy regions tend to be those in the north where people are least well off, and the cheapest areas are in the south, where average incomes are higher. Gas supply is a competitive market and the prices charged by the different suppliers can vary enormously. Gas suppliers also charge different rates depending on how you pay your bill. Monthly or quarterly direct debits are usually cheaper than paying the bill when it arrives, and with some energy companies you will also get a discount if you handle your account online. You can also save money by using the same energy company to supply both gas and electricity, and with some suppliers, such as Spark Energy, this is the only option. The cheapest gas supplier may not always be the best as there are different tariffs. For example, some suppliers have a variable tariff, which means the price of gas can go up or down, while with others the price is fixed for the length of the contract. You can often save money by switching, but some energy companies, such as E.ON, pay an annual loyalty reward just for staying with them. There are three components of the gas charge: the standing charge in p per day, unit cost in p per kWh, and VAT, and there is a wide variation in the first two. Another factor to consider when you are comparing prices is whether or not there is an early termination fee because this might be a disincentive to switch again even though other suppliers may have better deals in the future. There are many comparison websites that can help you compare deals offered by the various suppliers and that will even enable you to switch suppliers directly from the website. Among these websites are ukpower.co.uk, payingtoomuch.com and moneysupermarket.com, and it can be a good idea to use more than one site to compare gas prices. You can estimate your gas consumption with these sites, but the quote will be more accurate if you have a bill to hand. The UKpower.co.uk website is simple to use. Enter your postcode on the home page and click on Compare Prices. A form is displayed and you are asked to enter details of your current energy suppliers, how much gas and electricity you use and how you pay, along with how you would like to pay if you switch. If you are not sure how much energy you use, you can use the low/medium/high estimates. You can select Show All to see how the different forms of payment affect the price, and Select all tariffs to see all possible tariffs. Enter your email address and click on Show Results. The results list all the companies and tariffs that will save you money, and an estimate of how much each will save you per year. The default is for both gas and electricity but you can see gas only estimates by clicking on Gas Only in the Fuel Filter at the top. In most cases you can switch directly from the website after you click on Continue. The website payingtoomuch.com is also easy to use and works in a similar way. Click on the Energy icon the home page to get started and then enter your details. With moneysupermarket.com, click on Energy and then Lower Your Bills. Enter your postcode and then click on Find Address and select your address from the list displayed. Select gas only suppliers or gas plus electricity, and then enter the details requested of your current energy use and how you pay. You also need to enter an email address, and they will send you the listing by email as well as displaying it on screen. Using these websites makes it easy to do a gas prices comparison and ensure you are not paying more for your gas than you need to."
20,Top 5 Things to Consider When Making a University Loan Comparison,finance," With the cost of education higher than ever, it's commonplace for people in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to rely on educational loans to pay for their classes. These loans can have a severe effect on financial stability later on. Doing a good loan comparison before you sign an agreement can save you hundreds of pounds, especially if you're thorough about examining the following elements. Credit Check Depending on where you go for your university loan, you may be subject to a credit check. If you are younger, this can be problematic, because most students who are just starting out on their own haven't established much of a credit history. You might need your parents or someone else to cosign for you, which makes the loan more complicated. Interest You probably know that you should try to get the student loan that has the lowest rate of interest, but there are other things to consider as you compare loan options. For instance, does interest start to immediately accrue, or are the calculations delayed until you graduate? These kinds of elements have a big effect on your ability to pay back the loan and how long you'll take to get out of debt. Payments Similar to interest, you will want to compare when you must start making payments. You should look at the amount you would need to pay every month and make a determination about whether that figure is reasonably within your budget. Your goal should be to find a payment level that allows you to pay down your debt while still living a somewhat comfortable life. Keep in mind that, in general, the longer your loan term, the more you'll usually pay in interest, but the lower your monthly payments typically are. Compare how much of your payment gets applied to the principle balance, as well as what happens to the loan in the event you become disabled. Another thing to consider under payments when you're looking at different loans is whether the lender allows forbearance or deferment. These two options basically allow you to pause paying down the debt. Most people do not want to think about needing to do this, but the reality is that, if you get into financial hardships down the road, you might not be able to meet all your debt obligations, including your student loans. In this circumstance, having the option for some breathing room can be good. Benefits Some lenders that provide school loans offer additional benefits as part of the loan agreement. For example, they might offer you perks such taking a specified amount off your balance (essentially giving you a discount) if you make a set number of payments on time. Others might give you a slightly better rate of interest if you agree to conditions such as working online or setting up automatic payments. Loan Limit Amounts Loan limits are important to look at when you are comparing sources for university funding because they can mean you need to use multiple lenders to cover your costs. Ultimately, this makes paying for your schooling more complex, but several smaller loans might be worth this complexity if you are able to get lower rates of interest. As an example of loan limits, in England, you can get a maintenance loan from the government of up to £4,418 for the 2014 school year if you are living at home, whereas the amount increases to £6,600 if you want to study abroad. Remember, just because you are eligible to borrow a certain amount doesn't mean you must do so--live within your means and only borrow what you really need to cover your costs. Conclusion A thorough loan comparison ensures you get the best deal and fit when you must borrow to cover the cost of university. You should look at elements such as the necessity for a credit check, the way the lender treats interest, payment amounts and options and benefits such as routine-payment discounts. The cap on the loan amount is another big factor. As you go through the comparison process, don't be surprised if getting the information you need takes time. It helps to start looking for providers well before the semester or school year is scheduled to start."

1,Sources of Quick Loans,finance," If you have a poor credit profile and are facing a situation where you need to obtain funds quickly, your options may be limited. You are unlikely to achieve approval for a conventional bank loan, especially if your income is limited.  As a result, you may be tempted to pursue quick loans from payday loan companies. However, if your situation is truly dire, you may qualify for assistance from one or more government scheme. If not, by thinking outside the box, you can almost certainly find alternatives to payday lenders for quick loans that represent less of a threat to your financial well being. The loan sources listed below may serve as resources for one-off quick loans. On the other hand, if you find yourself regularly seeking sources for quick loans, you should re-evaluate your spending habits. You may need to cut back on your spending, figure out a way to boost your income - or both. Loans From Friends and Family You may hesitate to borrow from friends or family members because of the possible risk of causing a rift in your relationship. However, if the amount that you need is reasonably small, friends and family can provide a legitimate source of quick loans.  Draw up an informal agreement and do everything in your power to repay the loan as quickly as possible. If circumstances beyond your control prevent you from repaying the loan as planned, come clean with your friend or family member, and work out alternate terms for repaying the loan whenever you are able. Credit Card Cash Advances If you need the money to pay day-to-day expenses, try purchasing the items you need with credit cards instead. While living off credit cards is not ideal, interest rates charged for transactions is far lower than those for cash advances. However, if you need hard cash and you have no other means of obtaining money, cash advances from credit cards are preferable sources for quick loans than payday loans. If you do opt for a credit card cash advance, borrow what you need in a single transaction if possible, because credit card companies typically impose hefty charges on each transaction. Credit Union Loans Local credit unions are a good source for quick loans. Interest rates for credit union loans are much lower than those for payday loans, and credit unions are often more lenient with credit than conventional banks. You must be a member in good standing; however, it is likely that you are eligible for membership in at least one credit union in your area. Bank Overdraft If you have funds available, you may tap into your bank overdraft as a source of quick loans. If you opt to draw from your overdraft, never go over your pre-arranged limit. Otherwise you will encounter fees that nearly rival those of payday loans. You should also repay the overdraft as soon as you are able. Whole of Life Insurance Policies If you have been paying premiums for a whole of life insurance policy, you might have accumulated a tidy sum that is available for you to borrow against. Ordinarily, drawing funds out of your life insurance policy is not a good idea, especially if you intend to use those funds to finance your retirement. However, if you are desperate, withdrawing funds from a whole life insurance policy is preferable to obtaining a payday loan. Pawnshops Did Great-Uncle Frederick leave you a valuable pocket watch? If so, you may be able to obtain the funds you need from a pawn shop.  Bear in mind that pawn shops will only allow you to borrow a fraction of the value of the items that you offer as collateral. If you have any doubts about your ability to repay, think twice before opting for a pawn shop loan. If you default on repayment, the pawn shop will confiscate Uncle Fred's watch. Payday Loans If you are absolutely at the end of your financial rope, payday loans may indeed represent your only alternative for quick loans.  If so, look for a lender that is registered with the Office of Fair Trading. Seek out a loan with a repayment period of at least 30 days and borrow as little as possible. Do everything in your power to repay the loan in full on your first repayment due day. Rollovers can quickly cause a modest payday loan to escalate into an amount that you will find nearly impossible to repay."
2,Help for Repaying Quick Loans,finance," Quick loans are intended to provide short-term funding for emergency situations, such as an unexpected car breakdown. They are not intended to serve as long-term financial solutions. As such, quick loans typically have very short repayment periods, ranging from one week to as long as 30 or 35 days. However, you may run into a situation where you are unable to make payments as scheduled to payday lenders.  Although this situation can be unnerving, you should not panic, and you should definitely not attempt to hide from your creditors. There are options available that will allow you to repay the loan with minimal harm to your credit report, and without being made bankrupt. The key is to act quickly and decisively, and to reach out for help from third parties if you need it. Dealing With Payday Lenders If you have quick loans that you know you cannot pay off, your first move should be to cancel any direct debit authorizations, standing orders or recurring payments. This will prevent the payday loan company from attempting to withdraw funds from your account, thereby avoiding an overdraft. Your second move should be to should be to contact the lender directly. Explain your circumstances as transparently as possible and express your desire to work out alternate payment arrangements that are mutually acceptable. Many lenders will offer you the opportunity to ""roll over"" the principle of the loan and pay only the interest if you cannot pay in full.  Resist the temptation to accept such an offer, especially if you know that you will be unable to make payment in full whenever the next due date occurs.  Instead, be prepared to present alternative arrangements that you have worked out that will allow you to repay the loan without ""roll overs."" Working Out Pro-Rata Offers Pro-rata offers are based on making payments based on your available disposable income. The pro-rata system is the system used by the courts to determine what debtors can reasonably afford to pay. Most reputable creditors, including many lenders of quick loans, will accept repayment plans based on a pro-rata system. For instance, you may have available disposable income of £200 a month to pay toward your debts, but you owe £2,000 to Payday Lender A and £1,500 to Payday Lender B for a total debt of £3,500. You would first multiply what you owe to Lender A by your available income for a total of £400,000. Divide this figure by £3,500 for a result of £114 to pay per month to Lender A. Then, multiply what you owe to Lender B by your available income for a total of £300,000.  Divide this result by your total debt of £3,500 for a total of £86 per month to pay to Lender B. Contact an Outside Intermediary Agency If one or more of your lenders refuses to accept your pro-rata offer or alternative repayment plan, get help from an outside intermediary. Several organizations such as StepChange Debt Charity, National Debtline, and Citizens Advice (for England, Wales and Scotland) offer free advice to borrowers and will negotiate alternative payment arrangements with creditors. You can often work out a satisfactory repayment plan through one of these agencies without the need to take on the expense of creating a debt repayment plan with a commercial debt management company. Budgeting Loan Scheme If you or your partner have been collecting benefits  such as Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance or Pension Credits for at least 26 weeks, and do not presently owe more than £1,500 to the Social Fund you may be eligible to borrow funds from the Budgeting Loan scheme, which is also administered through the Social Fund.  If you have taken quick loans to pay for rent, household expenses or expenses related to searching for work, you may be able to obtain a loan from the Budgeting Loan scheme to repay your quick loans. You must complete claim form SF500 and return it to your local Jobcentre Plus office. If you are turned down for a Budgeting Loan, you may appeal the decision by contacting the Jobcentre Plus office within 28 days with an explanation of why your case should be reviewed. If you are still unsatisfied, you may escalate your petition to be reviewed by an Independent Case Examiner, who should complete the review within 21 days."
3,Is Paid Credit Card Payment Protection Only For Those That Don't Need It?,finance," It's the quandary that people in debt face every day: How do I spend as little as possible on debt and still manage my risk? Lenders might offer a person taking out a credit card extended credit card payment protection for a small monthly fee, but people may feel they don't have the spare cash to spend on securing a balance. In their mind's, paid credit card protection is for those people who are rich enough not to need it, because they can afford the additional cost of carrying it. However, this type of thinking is exactly the opposite of what should be going through someone's mind when they're offered payment protection. Instead, they should be weighing the risk of defaulting on debt more than the cost of the small monthly payment used to make sure they can continue making payments if they get ill or are made redundant in their jobs. How the rich might weigh the risk of not carrying payment protection First, rich people would figure out how much of a balance they typically carry and whether they have enough savings to cover the balance should they suddenly lose their business or get seriously ill. If they are already carry disability or life insurance, this might help in the case where they were suddenly diagnosed with an illness or suffered a major accident. It would not help them if they lost their business and the associated income. For that they would need to rely on their savings or investment accounts to help repay outstanding debts. Or, rich people with huge outstanding balances may decide that claiming bankruptcy would be the better option if their hope of repaying their debt in a few years is miniscule when compared to the size of the debt. For those that don't have the option of a large bank account or business investments to cover an outstanding credit balance, the paid credit card payment protection can offer some peace of mind when they lose a job or get sick or injured. This is much truer for someone who is depending on an employer and a healthy economy to keep from being made redundant. Business owners might decide that claiming bankruptcy makes more sense. When bankruptcy is not an option If your livelihood depends on being able to work in your profession, it may be a very bad idea to file bankruptcy to get rid of credit card debt - even if your business fails. Bankruptcy in the UK can bar certain professions from practicing if that individual is declared bankrupt by the courts. In such cases, a payment protection plan can offer some peace of mind that debt payments will be made and creditors will not force that individual into bankruptcy through non-payment. This will give them time to work out an individual voluntary arrangement to resolve all the debt without a bankruptcy declaration. This can not only save their credit for a time, but also save their potential earning power for the future when thing might be a whole lot better. Other risks that demand that you take out credit card payment protection Other types of risks that can help you decide whether you should pay the monthly fee for extra credit card protection is whether your loss will affect more than yourself. It may be one thing to lose a credit rating, but quite another if the loss of a job or an unexpected illness also puts your family at risk. If you can cover a mortgage with unemployment benefits for a period of time, but not the additional credit card payments, then you might want to consider taking out extra credit card payment protection. If you happen to be made redundant through no fault of your own, the benefits can mean that you will be able to keep your family fed and housed, even while maintaining a good credit history. This will undoubtedly help you if it takes a bit of time to find a new job or if a job offer is dependent on a good credit history. It can also save you from having to dip into retirement or investment accounts to make up the difference. When the risk of non-payment affects more than just you because you are the primary bread-winner, it makes sense to add extra protection to your accounts to keep you solvent even when things don't go exactly as you had planned."
4,Using an APR Calculator for Auto Purchase Decisions,finance," Buying a new car can be exciting. However, the value of a car depreciates beginning with the moment you drive it off the lot. As a result, if you purchase a car with unfavorable financing terms, you could be paying for a car long after its resale value has decreased below what you are paying for the car. Other factors may contribute to making a car a better or worse overall bargain. Using an annual percentage rate (APR) calculator to compute your monthly payments can help you determine whether the financing terms that you are being offered are actually favorable, or if the purchase itself is a good idea. Elements of an Auto Loan When you purchase a new car, you must look beyond the sticker price to determine the actual cost that you will pay. For instance, the elements of a typical auto loan include not only the sticker price (principle) but also the APR, the length of the loan, the value of any down payment or trade-in and the amount of the balloon payment due at the end of the loan term, if any.  Altering the amounts of any of the elements included in the loan will have an affect on the other elements.  Altering certain elements of an auto loan can also determine the total price that you pay for your car. Bursting the Balloon (Payment) For instance, many car loans include a large balloon payment at the end of the loan term. The inclusion of a balloon payment reduces the size of regular monthly payments that you must make. The principle behind including a balloon payment is that you will have more time to accumulate the funds necessary to satisfy that obligation and therefore own the car free and clear. However, without proper planning, you may find yourself at the end of your loan term with a seriously devalued car and facing a payment that you cannot afford. By using estimates that include results generated by an APR calculator, you can compute how much you should increase your down payment or monthly installment payments to reduce the looming balloon payment to something closer to a regular monthly installment payment. Using an APR Calculator to Computer a Faster Payoff Making a larger down payment, or receiving a larger credit for the trade-in for your old car can also allow you to pay off your car loan faster, and may reduce the total amount that you pay for the car.  You can use an APR calculator along with a loan calculator to plug in different down payment and monthly payment amounts to compare how of an affect each change will make. You may find that the additional amount you would have to offer as a down payment or make in monthly installments is more than you can afford in relationship with the rest of your budget. On the other hand, you may be pleasantly surprised to learn that with modest adjustments in your down payment or monthly installments that you can pay off your car completely several months earlier than the stated terms of your car loan. Other Auto-Related Costs In determining the true cost of your car, you must account for related costs that are not included in the terms of your loan. For instance, license tags, insurance, maintenance, petrol and parking fees all add to the cost of owning and operating a car, and yet none are typically included in either the sticker price or the terms of the car loan. However, you can account for at least some of these expenses in a loan calculator along with an APR calculator to determine the true monthly cost you will incur for a particular car. To construct an expanded loan calculator along with an APR calculator, determine the yearly insurance fee for covering the car you want to buy, the average petrol mileage plus a rough estimate of your monthly driving mileage, average estimated costs for regular maintenance such as oil changes and tune-ups and the average yearly cost for any parking or garage fees.  You can even make side-by-side comparisons of the ownership costs associated with two or more different cars. The results of your comparison may reveal that despite its lower sticker price, the petrol-guzzling used car you were considering may actually be more expensive in the long run than a fuel-efficient new car."
5,Using a Personal Loans Calculator to Work out Whether It's Worth Refinancing or Not,finance," If your bank is charging you a high rate of interest on your personal loan, you may want to consider refinancing. There are plenty of lenders around offering attractive deals, so it could be possible to save money by refinancing your personal loan. After all, if you can reduce the interest rate you pay on your debts, it's possible to reduce your monthly repayments. Aside from being easier on the household budget, you could also potentially reduce the amount of interest you pay on your personal loan overall. Before you submit an application with a new lender, take the time to enter your figures into a good personal loans calculator. Work out what your potential new repayments will be and see how much lower they're likely to be. It's also important to work out if any other fees may apply that could increase your costs overall. The new lender may charge product fees and monthly account fees on your new personal loan. Your existing lender may also charge you early repayment penalties for paying out your debt sooner than the agreed loan term. Working Out How Much You Could Save Take some time to enter your figures into a good personal loans calculator. The idea is to get a grasp on exactly what your current loan is costing you. If you've done your homework, you should already have found a few different lenders offering good deals on low interest personal loans. Change the interest rate you entered into the personal loans calculator and see what it does to your monthly repayments. Some calculators will also show you the total amount of interest you'll pay over the total loan term. At first glance it may seem as though the reduced monthly repayments plus the lower interest charges overall will make refinancing over to a new lender all worthwhile. However, there's often a lot more to consider. If you don't do the sums accurately, you could end up paying more than you expect. Early Repayment Penalty Fees Before you rush to submit your loan application with the new lender, you also need to take into account any fees your existing lender may charge you for leaving. After all, some banks will charge an early repayment penalty for paying off your loan sooner than the agreed loan term. In some cases, the penalty charged can be tiered depending on the age of the loan. For example, you may pay a fee of 2% of your loan amount for refinancing your personal loan in the first 12 months of the loan. The penalty may reduce to 1% of your loan amount if you refinance your debt in the third year. If you still have a copy of your personal loan contract, you'll see the early repayment penalty listed in the documentation somewhere. If you don't have a copy, you can always call your bank and ask them for a current pay out figure. Case Study There are times when refinancing your personal loan over to a cheaper interest rate may not save you money at all. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume you have a personal loan of £7,500 and you're paying 12.75% interest over a 5 year term. Your monthly repayments will be £169.69. By comparison, you find a new lender offering you an interest rate of 8.5% to refinance your personal loan over with them. Your monthly repayments will drop to just £157.51. At first glance, your repayments will reduce by £12.18 per month and you benefit from a much lower interest rate. Yet the new lender has a £250 product fee for applying for your personal loan. They also charge £5 per month for an account fee. There's also the factor of the early repayment penalty from your existing lender. They're charging you a 2% fee, which is £150. Existing Loan New Loan Loan Balance £7,500 £7,500 Loan Term 5 years 5 years Interest Rate 12.75% 8.5% Monthly Repayment £169.69 £157.51 Early Repayment Fee £150 Nil Product Fee £0 £250 Monthly Account Fee £0 £5 (total £300) Total Interest Paid £2,681.39 £1,950.84 The table above shows you could potentially save £730.55 in interest charges by refinancing over to the new lender. However, you'll also end up paying a total of £700 in product fees, monthly fees and early repayment fees just to switch over. In order to really find out whether refinancing over to a new lender is a good idea, take the time to input your numbers into a good personal loans calculator. Add up all the costs associated with making the switch and see for yourself whether you really end up in front or not."
6,The Business Credit Card Summary Box,finance," When you are looking for a great business credit card for your purchases, you want to be sure to get one that will benefit your business. In order to discover the best one, you will need to take a serious look at the credit card summary box, which will give you all the details you need to know. The condensed information also helps you easily compare one credit card with another one. After you find the type of credit card you want, such as gas cards, reward cards, air miles cards, etc., you can pick three or four based on the ads. Then, you want to start looking at the credit card summary box of each one to find out which one is ideal for your business needs. The Interest Rate The interest rate you will receive on your business credit card is going to be based on your credit score. This means you may not know what it really is until you get the credit card. Be sure to understand what your interest rate is on the card once you get it, and what the interest-free period is for new purchases. The Interest-Free Period Most credit cards have some kind of an attraction or Introductory Offer on them to get people to take their credit card - but not all of them. While many credit cards will have lengthy periods in which to make interest-free purchases, business credit cards usually do not extend them out very long, many having only 45 days, or so. In order for this to be of any real value to you, you will need to pay the balance in full at the next bill, or you will be charged interest. Personal credit cards will often permit the card owner to make balance transfers, and give them the length of the Introductory Offer to not pay any or little interest. Many business credit cards will not permit you to do this - at least you are not apt to get any zero interest deal on the balances transferred. Like most of them, CapitalOne starts charging interest on the day the amount is transferred to the new card. The Credit Limit Every business credit card will have both a minimum and a maximum credit limit. This will be based on your ability to pay back the money borrowed. The credit limit will be set for you, but the maximum amount will vary based on your ability to repay the loan. Like most credit cards of this kind, the Lloyd's credit card indicates that the maximum credit limit is subject to your status - which generally means whether you are caught up in payments or not. Cash Withdrawals One type of transaction that will be the most costly on a business credit card is the cash withdrawals you make. You will want to be aware of what the interest rate is, and you also want to know if there is a limit to how much cash you can get. Even if the interest rate is the same as purchases, there is often a fee attached, as is true with the TSB Business Card. Annual Fees Some business credit cards have an annual fee, but other ones will not. Be sure to compare the credit card summary box for this information, and then see if there are other benefits or discounts that still might make it the ideal card to have. Foreign Usage If you travel much, you will also want to check out the fees that might be attached when you make a foreign transaction. This would occur when you either make a purchase or get foreign cash. You can expect to be charged a fee for either action, and cash transactions may have a minimum fee. Default Charges Just like regular credit cards, a business credit card will also add charges for the most common problems. This can be for late payments, going over your business credit limit, or for a returned payment or returned cheque. A common amount charged for this fee is £12, but it may differ with some cards. Getting the ideal business credit card is one that gives you the best benefits for your business. There is more to the decision than simply looking at the interest rate. By going over and comparing the information in the credit card summary box of several cards, you can easily determine which one is right for you."
7,Comparing the Tesco Credit Card Options,finance," Tesco is the leading retailer in the UK, and it is one of the largest retailers in the world. Along with its wide selection of merchandise and services, Tesco offers several different consumer credit card options that provide users with benefits such as balance transfer options, low APR, and compelling introductory offers. Before election your Tesco credit card, take a moment to review the different options available to you. Tesco Clubcard for Purchases The Tesco Clubcard for purchases offers enhanced buying power with its introductory zero-percent interest rate for the first 16 months. You'll enjoy these low rates in addition to accumulating up to 5 Clubcard points per pound spent on purchases made at Tesco, and you'll get 1 point for every £1 spent outside of Tesco and its partner companies. These points can be redeemed for Tesco merchandise, airline tickets, and meals at local pubs and restaurants. In addition, you can take advantage of zero percent interest on balance transfers for up to six months. The balance transfer fee for this offering is 2.9 percent, making it an affordable way to manage existing debt. Tesco Clubcard for Balance Transfers Tesco offers a credit card that is designed specifically for customers who want to transfer balances to the Tesco credit card. You'll have up to 28 months to pay off the balance you have transferred, and you will only pay a 2.9 percent balance transfer fee. Your new Tesco Clubcard for balance transfers will still give you optimized Clubcard points, and you can enjoy interest-free purchases for the first three months after you have opened your account. Tesco Low Balance Transfer Fee Credit Card Another option for those who are looking to transfer old debt to their Tesco credit cards, the low balance transfer fee credit card charges just .85 percent for transfers. The low fee makes this card an ideal option for transferring large balances without paying a large penalty. You will have up to 12 months to pay off the balance before accruing any interest, and you can shop interest-free for that same time period. Tesco Low APR Credit Card If you would prefer to enjoy lower interest year-round instead of zero percent interest for the first few months, the low APR credit card option may be right for you. While some of the other Tesco credit card offerings come with an APR of 18.9 percent, this lower APR card comes with a variable interest rate of just 7.8 percent, and you will still have access to the zero percent interest balance transfer benefit, though it is only good for the first three months after you open your account. As with the other Tesco credit cards, you will get to earn Clubcard points faster. Tesco Credit Card Account Extras Low interest rates and balance transfer fees aren't the only selling points for the Tesco credit card options. You can take advantage of the 24-hour call centre, so you can always talk to a representative when there are issues with your account. Text message alerts let you know when you are approaching your credit limit, and online banking allows you to manage your account, pay your bill, and view your available balance. Your card is protected from fraud in accordance to the law, as with any credit card, but Tesco offers fraud alerts whenever there is suspicious activity on your account. You can also register an extra layer of protection that applies to your online purchases made with the Tesco credit card. Tesco travel cash allows you to buy foreign currency for travel as a transaction instead of a cash advance, which means you won't have to pay exorbitant fees to purchase money before you travel abroad. You can even get access to an emergency card and cash if you lose your Tesco credit card while traveling outside of country. Tesco credit cards offer versatile credit card solutions, and with so many options, it is easy to find the card that fits your needs. Whether you want a card with a low APR or one that gives you the ability to transfer old credit card balances, Tesco has a product that can work for you."
8,Avoid Making These Mistakes With Your Capital One Card,finance," A Capital One card is a safe and convenient way to pay for everyday purchases, often while getting cash back and other rewards for every pound you spend on the card. However, careless use of your credit card can get you into financial trouble very quickly, and you may find it nearly impossible to get out of deep debt when interest rates are adding up monthly. Here are four mistakes that you should avoid at all costs when shopping around for or using your Capital One card. •	Interest rates. High interest rates won't matter to you if you pay your balance off in full each month, but if you tend to carry balances over, you should look for the lowest possible interest on your new card. •	Annual fees. Although fewer cards are charging annual fees today than in the past, some cards--especially those that offer rewards such as cash back or points--still charge an annual fee to help recoup costs of paying out rewards or offering other benefits. If you can afford the annual fee and the benefits of the card outweigh the fee based on your needs, then by all means, go for a card with an annual fee. However, if you're generally strapped for cash or the benefits don't outweigh the fee, steer clear of cards that charge one. •	Rewards. If you're going to have a credit card, it may as well come with rewards. Rewards cards come in many flavors, including allowing you to earn points that can be redeemed for travel or merchandise and cash back cards that give you a certain percentage back on purchases you make. However, if you don't use a credit card often, rewards cards may not be your best bet, as the higher interest on these cards can negate any rewards you get. •	Introductory offers. While you should never apply for a card based solely on the introductory offer, these offers are meant to entice new customers, and they're often quite enticing. Some credit cards offer a lengthy period of interest-free spending, while others might offer double or even triple points on purchases for 90 days. Make sure the rest of the card features, such as the interest rate and any fees, are in line with your finances and your needs. Paying only the minimum amount due on your Capital One card. Interest rates on credit cards are designed to make the credit card company lots and lots of money. Unfortunately, this often comes at the expense of consumers' financial situation. Carrying over balances from month to month means that you're paying interest on those balances, and interest charges can add up fast, making it difficult to get out of credit card debt. Treating your credit cards as a second income. Just because you have a credit card doesn't mean you can afford to use it to make frivolous purchases. The general rule of thumb is, if you can't afford to pay for it next month, you can't afford it. You will eventually have to pay back the money, and if you charge with abandon and without regard to what you can actually afford, you will find yourself in deep debt very quickly indeed. Ignoring your credit card statement. Credit card companies make mistakes, and in this day of rampant identity theft, it's essential that you check your statement each month to ensure everything is as it should be. If you see any charges that you didn't make, or if you are being charged fees that you're unaware of, contact your credit card company immediately."
9,What You Need to Know About Government Christmas Benefit Payments,finance," If you are receiving government assistance under specific schemes, you will be eligible for a yearly Christmas benefit payment, also called a Christmas bonus. While this payment isn't huge, it might come in handy. Your Christmas payment can be applied towards a Christmas meal, energy costs, or any other needs you might have around the end of the year. Not everyone can receive this payment, and whether or not you are eligible is based on a single week, which is usually the first week in December. This is called the qualifying week. Even if you were on a qualifying assistance program throughout much of the year, you won't get the Christmas bonus if you were not on the assistance program during the qualifying week. Who Qualifies? Only UK residents who are in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, any EEA country, or Switzerland during the qualifying week can receive Christmas benefit payments. Additionally, you must get a financial assistance benefit during the same week which is on the list of qualifying benefits. Government benefits that will make you eligible for the Christmas payment include: disability living allowance, war widow's pension, mobility supplement, carer's allowance, and the widowed mother's allowance. For a full list of the assistance schemes that automatically qualify you for a Christmas bonus, you can visit Gov.uk. What is the Value? Christmas benefit payments are generally in the amount of 10 pounds. All people who qualify for this payment are given the same amount, regardless of other factors such as their additional income or the assistance programmes for which they qualify. While the value of the benefit is subject to change from year to year, all qualified individuals always receive the same amount in any given year. The money is disbursed in a single one off payment. Even if you receive multiple assistance checks, you will only get one Christmas bonus. How Are You Paid? The funds for your Christmas bonus will be transferred into the account that you use to receive your other assistance payments, such a pension payment or disability assistance. This might be a bank account, credit union account, building society account, or National Savings account.  If you typically receive your assistance money through the post, you may be sent a check for your Christmas benefit payments. The deposit may appear as ""DWP XB"" on your account's statement. The money is automatically transferred during the disbursement period. Do You Need to Claim It? You don't need to specifically claim the Christmas benefit payment. The fact that you receive a form of public assistance named in the list of qualifying programmes is enough to generate a payment for you at Christmas time. If you think you qualify for the payment and you don't get it by the end of the year, you can contact the Jobcentre Plus or Pension Centre that typically sends you assistance payments. Bear in mind that if you were out of the country or did not receive assistance during the qualifying week, this might explain why you did not qualify for the Christmas this year. Other Considerations The Christmas benefit payment is tax-free, meaning that no taxes are deducted from it when you receive it and you don't need to claim it as taxable income next year. If you are married to someone or in a civil partnership, you and your partner may both independently qualify for the payment. When that is the case you will each receive a separate benefit payment. Your Christmas bonus payment will never affect the other assistance payments that you receive throughout the year. The UK government sends out Christmas benefit payments to help those in need make it through the holiday. While the payments are nominal, they might be able to keep your heat on or even put more food on the table at a time when your kids are home from school and you are responsible for the care additional family members. If you need this payment as financial assistance throughout the holiday season, be sure that you meet all of the qualifications during the qualifying week at the start of December."
10,How is Your Credit Rating Determined?,finance," If you have recently conducted a credit rating check and found that you have a poor or average credit score, you might wonder how your credit rating is calculated. It can be difficult for many consumers to understand the factors that determine a credit score. Although the exact algorithm used to calculate FICO scores is not available to the public, there are several types of information contained in your credit report that can increase or decrease your rating. A different ""weight"" is assigned to each type of information, which means that one type of data can have a more dramatic effect on your creditworthiness than another. Payment history: Information regarding your payment history makes up 35 percent of your credit rating. How you handle your payments as they become due can have a major impact on your overall score. Payment history includes the number of late payments you have made, the frequency of the late payments, and the severity of the delinquencies. A single payment made 30 days late will likely only impact your score for about six months. A 90-day delinquency, on the other hand, can have a much more far-reaching effect. Likewise, if you consistently make your payments late every month or are behind on multiple accounts, you can expect to be saddled with a low credit rating for at least a couple of years. Keep in mind that late payments lose their impact as they age. An account that is currently 90 days delinquent will ruin your credit rating. If you were 90 days behind two years ago and have since kept the account current, though, the delinquency will have a much milder impact on your creditworthiness. The amount of debt you owe: Naturally, the higher your debt load, the less attractive you will be to potential lenders. The amount of debt you owe makes up 30 percent of your credit score. Keep in mind that this amount is compared against your total credit limit. Assuming that you have the income to handle the debt, a £2,900 balance on an account with a £10,000 credit limit would not likely cause significant damage to your credit score; conversely, the same balance on an account with a £3,000 credit limit would substantially impact your credit rating. As you might expect, overlimit accounts are even more damaging. The length of your credit history: 15 percent of your credit score comes from how long you have maintained credit accounts. If you have just started building your credit profile, this area will suffer; however, if you have several years of responsible credit use, your score will be significantly higher with all other elements being equal. Of course, there is little you can do to improve this area besides having patience and using credit responsibly. Your credit mix: Some types of credit are considered preferable to others. A £100,000 mortgage loan, for example, is viewed as ""good"" credit and will allow you to maintain a high score in this area. A £100,000 unsecured debt, conversely, is considered ""bad"" credit. Ideally, secured debt should make up at least 50 to 75 percent of your credit mix, with the remainder being made up of credit cards and other unsecured accounts. Your credit mix makes up 10 percent of your score. New credit accounts: The final 10 percent of your credit rating is determined by how many new accounts you have opened within the past 12 months. In order to protect this area of your credit score, you should aim to open no more than one new credit account within a 12-month period. If you open two or more accounts within a short period of time, your credit rating will likely suffer. The key to improving your credit score is determining what area you can work on most effectively and devoting your efforts to that area. For example, if you have a history of late payments, bringing your accounts current and continuing to make future payments on time can do wonders for your credit rating. If high debt is the problem, work on paying down one account at a time until you reduce your overall debt to a manageable level. Also, conduct a credit rating check periodically to make sure your efforts are paying off."
11,Factors to Consider Before Getting Building Insurance,finance," Before you invest in an insurance policy to cover both your business and the valuable items contained inside, there are a few important factors to consider. While all building insurance policies operate in largely the same way, there are a few customizations you can make to have one better suit your needs. When considering a policy to purchase, finding out what it doesn't cover is just as important as finding out what it does. Nobody wants to think about what it would be like to lose his or her entire business due to a disaster like a fire. Doing so is an important step in being proactive and making sure that you will be covered in the event that something unfortunate does occur. Before selecting a policy, it is important to think about what types of optional coverage you may need. Most building insurance policies don't include provisions for flood damage, for example. Remember that just because flooding may be unlikely in your area doesn't guarantee it won't occur. An event doesn't have to be a traditional flood (which would involve the swelling of a nearby body of water and the damage that occurred as a result) to be deemed flood-related damage by an insurance provider. If your area experienced heavy rains and the sewer drains around your business backed up, for example, water could leak into an underground level of your business or come up through the pipes and damage valuable items and equipment. Though you may not consider that type of event to be a traditional flood, your insurance company would and would also use it as a basis to deny your claim in the event that you didn't have optional coverage. If you're worried about how much money building insurance is going to cost, consider investing and making repairs to try to lower some of the costs. Building insurance providers charge premiums based on two different factors. The first is how likely an event is to occur and what type of damage will occur as a result. If you live in an area with a high crime rate, for example, a common type of building damage in your area would be burglary or larceny. As a result, you would pay more for those types of coverage than someone in another area would because there is a statistically higher chance of them happening where your business is located. However, you can combat some of these rising costs by taking steps to make your building safer. If you live in such a high crime area, consider installing security cameras that link to a third party location or the local authorities. You can make the same types of preventative modifications for other types of disasters, too. If you install a sprinkler system or a fire alarm system on your property, for example, your building will be deemed safer and you will pay less for fire-related coverage. Another factor to consider are the types of optional coverage that you should invest in based on the type of building you operate. If you own an apartment complex, for example, you will need a policy that offers a certain amount of liability coverage. Find out how much liability coverage an average tenant needs in your area and multiply that dollar amount by the total amount of tenants you have. If you own a retail business, add up the value of the inventory that you keep on hand on an average day and use it to adjust your policy limits for those types of damages. Finding out which types of optional coverage you should invest in will help make sure you get not only a financially attractive policy but one that will cover you in the event that something unexpected happens, as well."
12,Paying too Much to Protect Your Home? Seven Steps to Cheap Home Insurance,finance," Protecting your home is one of the best investments you can make, financially and otherwise. Not only will home insurance prevent you from paying out a lot of money if and when there is damage to your home or you experience theft, but you can have increased peace of mind. Home insurance policies can provide payout in situations that range from vandalism to a fallen tree branch through your roof. Reducing your building and contents coverage is possible, but it takes some effort on your part. Here are seven steps to cheap home insurance. Switch, Don't Renew On average, your insurance premiums will increase year-by-year. This means that the price you enjoyed when you first started paying for home insurance is unlikely to be maintained in the long run. While it requires more work than simply renewing your policy, shopping for a new home insurance policy every year may allow you to get a cheaper rate. Don't Buy Too Much Insurance Don't get talked into flood insurance or earthquake coverage when you don't really need it. Carefully consider the insurance that you actually need on your home and purchase a policy that is appropriate. Limiting the types of coverage that you opt for will bring down your premium. Don't sell yourself short and pay for less insurance than would actually be useful, but don't buy a high end policy you don't need. Shop Online Some insurers offer ongoing discounts for customers who purchase their home insurance policy online. This discount may only be good for one year, but it can afford cheaper insurance at least for a limited time. Going online to look for insurance also lets you see a broader array of options. Consulting with an insurance broker may only give you a look at a few of the UK insurers who serve your postcode. Secure Your Property Home insurance companies almost universally give cheaper insurance rates to homeowners you can prove that they have installed an alarm system, quality locks, and taken other efforts to deter break ins. These investments cost money up front, but can spare you high insurance fees in the long run. You may also stave off a burglar and avoid the need to file a claim on your home insurance. Investigate No Claims Bonuses Many Britons are familiar with the concept of a no claims bonuses for car insurance, but don't realize that some home insurance companies are also offering similar discounts. A no claims bonus lets you take advantage of a cheaper insurance premium when you don't file a claim on your account for at least one full year. You may be able to transfer this bonus between insurers if you can provide proof that you earned it with your last home insurance policy. Save Now, Pay More Later You can save money now if you are willing to pay more in the event that you file a claim. Each home insurance policy has an excess or deductible assigned to it. This is the amount of money that you are committing to pay out of pocket before your insurance coverage kicks in to assist with expenses. For instance, if you increase your policy excess from 500 to 1,000 pounds, you can pay a lower premium rate but will be responsible for 500 pounds more when you file a claim. Bundle Your Insurance If you pay for more than one insurance policy with the same company, you may save money on both policies. If you have home building and contents cover with the same insurer, or even home and car insurance with the same company -- you can earn significant savings immediately. Make sure to request this discount specifically, in case it's not offered automatically. Following these seven steps for cheap home insurance is a good start when it comes to reducing the expense of homeownership. When in doubt, get quotes from more than one reputable home insurance company, and don't be afraid to consider being insured by a smaller company. While you may feel some brand loyalty to a certain insurer, sometimes a less known company may offer discounts or lower coverage rates in your area."
13,Who Can Benefit from an Offset Mortgage?,finance," Over the last decade, the offset mortgage market has experienced exponential growth. Low savings rates combined with increased consumer awareness have pushed offset products into the mainstream, after years of relative obscurity. However, many potential borrowers are still left with questions: What are the benefits of offset mortgages? Who can benefit from this type of mortgage? Let's take a look at the advantages of offset products, and see which groups of people could derive the most financial benefit from them. Interest Savings and Tax Benefits An offset mortgage is a unique product that allows borrowers to enjoy both mortgage interest savings and tax advantages. It's a type of mortgage that involves connecting a conventional mortgage with one or more savings accounts. Whatever balance is in the savings accounts earns no interest, but instead is used to offset the mortgage. When each mortgage payment is made, the interest is determined by the principal remaining in the mortgage account, minus the amount of the offset. Since most interest rates are higher than current savings rates, the reduction in mortgage interest usually outweighs any lost interest you would have earned on your savings. Offset products also offer tax benefits to borrowers. With a traditional savings account, you'd have to pay tax on any interest you earn. Offset mortgages, however, work a bit differently. Since you only pay interest on the difference between your mortgage amount and your savings offset, the savings that you put in is essentially earning a return set at the mortgage rate. There's no tax to pay on this benefit, so offset mortgages effectively give borrowers a tax-free return on their cash. This can have a real impact for higher-rate taxpayers. Instant Access to Cash Some people assume that overpaying on a traditional mortgage offers the same benefits as an offset mortgage. While both can accomplish the same goal of shortening a mortgage term, there are distinct differences. The biggest advantage of an offset mortgage over regular overpayments is the access to cash. When you overpay on a traditional mortgage, it's usually impossible to get that money back in the event of an emergency. Offset mortgages are flexible: You can withdraw from your offset amount at any time. You can also add to the offset amount as time goes by, which is why potential borrowers shouldn't feel they need to wait until they've saved a large lump sum to get an offset mortgage. It's possible to start with a relatively modest sum and simply add to it as you accumulate savings. Family Offsets Offset mortgages have traditionally been popular among older individuals with higher incomes. However, a relatively new offset product called a ""family offset"" can help younger householders enjoy the advantages of an offset mortgage. With this product, family and friends can link their savings accounts to the borrower's mortgage. The money is still entirely theirs to access, but the borrower gets the benefits of the reduced mortgage interest. This enables parents to help out their adult children, whilst keeping control of their money. No matter what the situation, a family offset is an effective way to use a family member's savings to lower the balance on another family member's mortgage. Options for Landlords Individuals who own properties for investment purposes can also benefit from offset products. Landlords, who typically utilise what's known as a ""buy-to-let"" mortgage, can take advantage of a special buy-to-let offset mortgage. Using this type of mortgage, property owners can roll their rental income into a linked account, and use that income to further offset their mortgage. It's clear that offset mortgages have a broad appeal. The savings on mortgage interest, combined with tax advantages, can benefit most householders and landlords. They're also an attractive option for the self-employed as the money they set aside for taxes can be used as an offset in the interim. Whether you're a high earner looking for tax benefits, or a young borrower taking advantage of a family offset, there's an offset mortgage product that's right for you. It's wise to speak to an adviser or independent mortgage broker, who can steer you to the best mortgage deal for your individual needs."
14,Types of Unsecured Personal Loans,finance," Even consumers who practice careful spending habits can sometimes find themselves in financial trouble.  Unexpected expenses such as car repair bills or medical costs can strain your budget and leave you wondering how you will make ends meet.  Fortunately, there are several types of a secured personal loans in the UK that can help you through difficult financial times.  It is important to consider these loans carefully to ensure that you are choosing the right type of loan for you. Payday Loans A payday loan is a short term loan that can help you through a financial emergency.  The process of qualifying for this type of loan is relatively simple and typically requires little documentation.  For this reason, you might be able to obtain approval or a payday loan and receive the funds you need in as few as one or two days.  In some cases, you can even obtain a payday loan without a credit check or income verification. Before opting for a payday loan, you should consider the drawbacks of this option.  In most cases, you will have to repay the loan amount, plus interest, within one or two weeks after you receive the funds.  Although this might be appropriate for a financial emergency, a payday loan might not help you if you anticipate that your financial needs will last for a longer amount of time.  Also, compared to other types of unsecured personal loans, payday loans typically come with high interest rates.  You might have to pay 25% interest or higher in addition to the principle amount for the privilege of borrowing money for just a week or two. Personal Bank Loans A personal bank loan is issued by a bank or other financial institution instead of by a payday lender.  This type of loan is generally designed for longer-term financial needs - depending on your circumstances, you might be able to borrow the funds for five years or longer.  This might be an appropriate option if you want to consolidate existing debts or anticipate that your recurring extra expenses will last longer than a few weeks. Banks and financial institutions require substantially more documentation than payday lenders when evaluating applicants.  You will likely need to provide verification of your income and expenses, as well as documentation of your personal assets and other debts you owe.  You will also have to fill out a lengthy application and may have to meet with a personal lender in order to receive approval for your loan. Compared to payday loans, interest rates for personal bank loans are typically low.  This option can help you obtain the long-term funds you need without costing you a small fortune in interest charges.  Of course, this type of unsecured loan typically requires a thorough review of your credit history.  The interest rate you obtain a for a personal bank loan can vary significantly depending on the length of your credit history and whether you have made your other account payments on time. Unsecured Credit Cards If you don't want to deal with the extensive approval requirements of a personal bank loan, but don't want to pay the high interest charges of a payday loan, an unsecured credit card might be the right option for you.  Depending on your credit score, you might be able to obtain a credit card with an APR of as low as 12.99%.  If you have a flawless credit history and a high credit score, you might even be able to obtain a credit card with a 0% introductory rate.  This allows you to borrow the money you need without paying interest charges for nine months to a year. Regardless of which option you choose, it is essential that you assess your ability to repay the unsecured loan.  Missed payments can cause you to incur hefty late fees that can make your loan even more difficult to repay.  If you fall behind by three or more payments, the lender can consider your loan in default and may demand immediate repayment in full.  In addition to the financial implications of missing payments, you will also have to deal with collections activity, such as phone calls and letters, initiated by your lender.  For this reason, you should review your finances carefully before agreeing to any type of loan."
15,Top 7 Tips for Buy to Let Mortgages,finance," There is a growing number of first-time buy to let landlords in the UK. With buy to let mortgages offering attractive rates, rent prices hitting new highs, and house prices setting records, landlords are seeing impressive returns. This doesn't mean, however, that success on the buy to let market is easy and requires little effort. If you are new to the buy to let game then you might want to take a look at the tips below to ensure that your investment pays off. Purchasing a buy to let mortgage is an inherently risky endeavour. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it or that by being smart and working hard you can curb some of this risk, but you always need to be aware of it in order to encourage yourself to play it safe with your money. Think about whether rental income is going to be enough to cover monthly mortgage payments, or what you are going to do during times of gaps in tenancy. Having savings to fall back on can be a big help. There are a lot of competitive deals on the market right now, so make sure you pick the best one. Don't just stay with your current bank of there is a better deal somewhere else. You are also going to need to decide between a tracker and a fixed rate mortgage. With interest rates low, now is a good time to take advantage of a tracker, but if you are worried about financial security, then a long-term fix is probably better for you. Location really is almost everything when it comes to real estate. The location of your property is going to be a huge determining factor in whether or not you will be able to attract tenants.  Does the property have access to transportation? Is it near shops and schools and other services that the prospective renter would like to be near? These are the sorts of factors that you are going to need to consider. Most first time landlords are choosing to purchase either flats or two-bedroom houses, as this will appeal to the widest possible market, especially young people. Family houses are more risky for the first time landlord, but depending on the area and on what you can afford, they can nevertheless be a good choice. If you can attract a family to your rental property, then you will be less likely to have to deal with tenancy gaps and you might even save money on maintenance! Speaking of maintenance... You need to remember that as the landlord you are going to be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the property. You need to provide tenants with and energy performance certificate, make sure all appliances are in proper working order, and that the property complies with fire safety regulations. All of this may get costly, so you need to calculate this into your spending and savings and budget accordingly. Your buy to let property is going to incur two unique taxes: an income tax on the rental income you receive, and Capital Gains Tax on the profit you make if you ever sell the property. However, you can also save money by deducting a lot of allowable expenses from your taxes, such as mortgage interest payments, utility bills, insurance premiums, and letting agent fees. Speaking of letting agents... Managing a property is hard work. It is going to require advertising, dealing with tenants, assessing the property on a regular basis, and performing the aforementioned repairs. If you do not have the time to do all of this yourself, then you need to consider using a letting agency. If you do choose to work with a letting agency then you also need to take account of letting agents' fees. This can be as low as 7% of your rental income, and so may be worthwhile for you."
16,Over One-Third of Income Spent on Mortgages or Rent in Many Households,finance," Although mortgage interest rates have hit a historic low, many households are paying over a third of their income on housing costs. According to an Ipsos MORI survey commissioned by the BBC's Panorama programme, 31% of household surveyed spend over a third of their income on a mortgage or rent. There are a number of reasons why this may be the case, including a shortage of affordable housing, high property prices and an overheated rental market. A Shortage of Affordable Housing: The UK is not building enough houses each year to meet demand, according to figures produced by the housing and homeless charity Shelter. Since 2008, the construction market has been in the doldrums. The government attempted to boost the new-build market with phase 1 of the Help to Buy scheme. Launched in April 2013, this initiative was designed to encourage first-time buyers to purchase new-build properties by allowing them to borrow 20% of the purchase price from the government. Combined with a 5% deposit from the borrower, this left only 75% to be borrowed from a mortgage provider. The scheme has now been extended to cover all buyers and all properties. Since the scheme began in April, there has been a 6% rise in the number of homes built in the UK. High Property Prices: The shortage of affordable property has been steadily pushing property prices up over the last few years. The average house price has been increasing by just over 3% per year and this trend looks set to continue. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that property prices had reached a record high in August 2013. At that time, the average price for a property in the UK was £247,000. This is around ten times the average UK income. Higher property prices mean that households are stretching themselves by taking out larger mortgages in order to buy their home. As a result, the financial benefits that could be gained from low mortgage interest rates are offset by higher levels of borrowing. The research conducted for Panorama revealed that 46% of respondents think property prices in their local area are too high. In addition, 39% would like to see property prices fall. The Rental Market: Following the banking crisis, lenders have become much stricter about who they will lend to. When borrowers do pass the credit checks, lenders are insisting that they provide a deposit of at least 5% of the property's value. As a result, many people find that they are unable to buy their own home and have to turn to the rental market. With more people looking for properties to rent, landlords are able to push up rents. The average cost for renting a home from a private landlord in England and Wales reached a record high of £757 per month in September 2013. This is an increase of 2.1% over the past year. The problem is particularly acute in London, where the average rent is approximately £1,200 per month. Paying high rents can prevent individuals from saving the money required to put down a deposit on a property. Why High Housing Costs Matter: The increases in housing costs have to be viewed against a backdrop of wage restraint. Many household incomes have been frozen or have risen by less than the rate of inflation for a number of years. The result is a drop in income in real terms. At the same time energy, fuel and food costs have soared. The situation is likely to become worse when interest rates start to rise. At the moment, the Bank of England is holding down the base rate at 0.5% until unemployment drops to 7%. Some analysts predict that interest rates will begin to rise as early as 2015. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Shelter, households that spend 35% or more of their income on mortgages and rent may not be able to afford other basic essentials, such as food or heating. Since April, Trussell Trust, which runs 400 food banks across the UK, has handed out food supplies to 350,000 people. This is three times the number it helped in the same period in 2012. Trussell Trust's executive chairman believes that, ""many of them are choosing between paying the rent and eating or they're choosing between paying the mortgage or having a repossession order."""
17,Consumers Could Pay More if the European Commission Caps Credit Card Fees,finance," The European Commission (EU) has threatened to cap the credit card processing charges that banks impose on businesses and shops. In turn, the banks have threatened to add higher fees and other charges onto cards used by consumers. When it all finally boils down, it's likely that UK households will take another hit in their billfolds. As it stands now, credit cards like MasterCard and Visa charge businesses a 0.9 percent charge on all credit card purchases. This credit card fee costs businesses £850 million annually. The charge in debit cards is 0.2 percent. The EU wants to set a flat service charge fee of 0.3 percent. On further examination, this matter gets more complex. The fees that businesses pay to banks are known as interchange fees. These fees cover the bank's costs of processing credit card transactions such as fraud insurance and administration. Shops and businesses give banks different interchange fees based on size. Big retailers generating tons of sales tend to pay a smaller interchange fee. A mom and pop store will pay a larger interchange fee. These fees can vary from 2.5 to 0.1 percent. The European Commission (EC) estimates that this fee payment market has a value of £112 billion. The EC is laying out the argument that the credit card sector is expensive and fragmented. Retailers tend to agree with the EC opinion. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has been hammering the EC for a decade to end what it calls excessive and anti-competitive fees for processing credit cards. The BRC argues that consumers will benefit via lower prices if the fees are capped. At present, retailers eat these fees and charge them back into the business. ""We're delighted with this landmark proposal,"" said Helen Dickinson, the BRC director. ""Capping these excessive and anti-competitive fees will support the UK retail industry by £362 million a year, boosting the industry's ability to invest and innovate while continuing to deliver lower prices and value for customers,"" Dickinson added in an interview at Daily Mail. MasterCard Europe contends that if this EC cap goes through, consumers will be hit with a £25 annual fee per credit card. Marion King, president of MasterCard, warned that lower fees will result in less income for issuing banks, and that will force banks to charge consumers for using cards. The EC fee proposal will force credit card companies to separate their payment card schemes from the business division that processes transactions. Essentially, this would destroy the current credit card model. The Financial Times (FT) describes this matter as the final battle in the long war between EU bureaucrats and payment providers. The Commission proposal calls for a 0.2 percent cap on debit transactions. Credit card fees would be capped at 0.3 percent. The EC estimates that EU debit card fees will be cut to €2.5 billion from €4.8 billion.  Credit card fees will tumble to €3.5 billion from €5.7 billion. Banks are challenging these caps by arguing that loyalty benefits on cards will be scraped. The banks also contend that consumers will not see lower retail prices. Instead, merchants will pocket the additional margin. What this proposed card cap means for the consumer is difficult to measure. When profit is taken away from one source, the waters must be explored to find new profit streams. Some analysts are warning that lending might decrease because there will be less cash to loan out. Fees on cards might increase unless competition kicks in. Rewards and services for credit cards might be cut back or disappear. It might become more difficult for consumers to qualify for credit cards. Banks may issue credit cards to only the best customers. New technology to battle credit card fraud might get tossed out. What is known is that the UK is the most innovative and inclusive user of plastic in Europe. Britain has opened up the credit market to nearly every household in the UK, including low-income families. The vast majority of households have access to both debit cards and bank accounts. EC bureaucrats sticking their fingers into this English credit card pudding could mess up everything. Then again, it might not."
18,Tips for Mortgages,finance," Signing up for a mortgage is a necessity for many people who wish to own their own home. There aren't many people who can afford to spend several hundred thousand pounds for the home of their dreams at one time. Mortgages allow people to borrow money from a lending organization like a bank to finance the home they've always wanted. They will typically have anywhere between 15 and 30 years to pay back the money, plus interest. When signing up for a mortgage, it is important to not accept the first offer you find. Shopping around is one of the keys to getting the best rates to finance not just your home but the future of your family. When you get ready to apply for a mortgage, the first step to take is to research your existing credit history. Look up both your credit report and your credit score to get an idea of how much you can expect to pay in interest should you be approved for a mortgage. Because of the housing crisis of the late 2000s, credit standards for new mortgage applicants remain very tight. New mortgage rules have been unveiled as recently as 2013 and are not expected to loosen in the near future. As a result, your credit history has become your most valuable asset with regards to securing a home mortgage. If you want to get the best rate on a mortgage, you need to have a credit score of at least 720. Though it is still possible to get decent rates with a score of around 680, interest rates will gradually start to increase as your score drops lower. If you know you won't be applying for a mortgage for a few years, start taking steps to repair your credit today. Pay down as much debt as you can and get your finances under control. If you have any past accounts that have gone into collections status, pay down those debts so they can stop hurting your credit score. Though repairing a person's credit score takes a long time, getting on financially stable ground today will definitely pay off when it comes time to borrow money for a house. Every little step of progress helps when it comes to getting the best rates on a mortgage. If you already have a home mortgage, consider refinancing to lock yourself into more favorable rates. Due to the housing crisis of the last few years, home rates all over the world remain at an all time low. If you purchased your house several years ago and are current on your payments, refinancing can be a great way to lower your monthly minimum payment, your interest rate or both. Once you've applied for a mortgage and have been approved, remember one key piece of advice: the process is not officially over until the loan ""closes."" When you've been approved and your home offer has been accepted, you will need to provide a large number of documents to the bank. Most mortgage brokers require these documents to be in hand as quickly as 24 hours after the process begins. Do not delay in getting these documents to the right people, as missing your deadline could see the whole process fall apart before your eyes. If your mortgage is ""underwater,"" consider refinancing. Underwater mortgages are ones where a customer owes more money on the house than the property is actually worth. When the economy all over the world was in better condition a few years ago, these people had a difficult time refinancing and getting more favorable terms and conditions. Because the market is in its present condition, these people are finding it much easier to get the results they want. Even if you've tried to refinance in the past, now is the time to try again and hope for the best."
19,How Parents Can Find The Best Secured Loans Deal To Help Their Children Get A Home Loan,finance," With the property market heating up, there has never been more pressure for first time homebuyers to purchase their own homes. Interest rates are at record lows and competition between buyers is driving up property values. As such, people who have never had a home before should seriously consider buying now. For many first time homebuyers, however, buying a home is difficult, especially if they don't have a very large deposit to put towards their home loans. Not surprisingly many parents are choosing to help their children buy a home through a number of different ways. Many parents are in a good position to help their children with their first home, but deciding what form that help takes can be difficult. This article will look at what parents can do in order to get their children on the property market sooner rather than later. Lend Money The simplest way parents can help out their children is simply by lending them money. This form of lending would usually take the form of a personal agreement between the parents and their children, so it is entirely up to both parties to negotiate a repayment schedule and interest rates. Because the size of a deposit has such a big impact on the interest rates homebuyers will pay for their mortgage, a little boost at the beginning can lead to big savings over time. Although government schemes like Help to Buy have made it much easier for homebuyers to put up deposits of just 5% and still get approved, it is important to realize that these small deposit mortgages will still suffer from some of the highest interest rates on the market. Of course, for personal lending to really be a help, the parents would have to charge less interest than what banks and other lenders currently offer for similar sums. Using an Existing Home as Collateral If parents don't have the money sitting in their bank accounts to simply lend to their children, they can still raise funds in other ways. Since many parents will have a great deal of equity in their homes, getting approved for the best secured loans deal should be fairly easy so long as other factors, like income and credit histories, are taken into account. With this type of lending, the parents would use their own home as collateral when they borrow money from a bank or building society. Because the home acts as a guarantee that the money will be repaid, lenders are likely to offer much lower interest rates due to the lower risk they are taking upon themselves. Parents could then use the money they raise in this fashion to help their children either raise a deposit or to simply help make monthly mortgage payments. However, parents need to be aware that this route is risky as they could have their own home repossessed if they default. Joint Mortgage Another way parents can use the equity in their own property to help their children buy their first home is by applying for a joint mortgage with the children. Joint mortgages are usually easier to get since the financial status and credit history of both the parent and the child will be taken into consideration. Therefore, the mortgage is much more likely to be repaid so the bank looks at these arrangements as being far less risky to its own business. As such, joint mortgages usually come with better interest rates than traditional mortgages, especially if the parent uses his own property as collateral. With a joint mortgage, however, both the parent and child will have ownership in the new property, meaning both members are responsible for repayment. Again, if an existing home is put up as collateral then the parent risks that home being repossessed if he and the child cannot keep up with the mortgage payments. Getting onto the property ladder is notoriously difficult, which is why so many parents are choosing to help their children raise the necessary funds for a mortgage deposit. Parents can help in a number of ways, through a personal loan or by using their own homes as collateral, but whichever route they choose they must make sure they are agreeing to terms that will place both themselves and their children in a strong financial position in the years to come."
20,Current Account Focus: The Santander 123,finance," Launched in March 2013, the Santander current account has been lauded by experts as the UK's most generous current account in terms of customer rewards, according to The Daily Mail. If you are considering making the change to the Santander account, here's what to expect in terms of risks and rewards. The Santander account offers you cashback on purchases at a tiered system of 1-2-3. For example, the 1 stands for 1 percent cashback you receive when you use the Santander card to pay water and council tax bills. The 2 stands for 2 percent cash back on electricity and gas bills while the 3 percent stands for cashback on bills paid to mobile, home phone, broadband and on-demand television packages. You can set the account up as either a single or joint account based on your and your partner's unique needs. The 1-2-3 comes into play in another way. You also earn interest based on the amount of money you keep in the account on a monthly basis. For example, if you keep £1,000 or more in the Santander account, you earn 1 percent interest on this amount. If you carry a balance of £2,000 or more, you will earn 2 percent interest each month. When your funds exceed £20,000, you will earn 3 percent interest for your account balance, which is the maximum interest rate you can earn with the Santander account. If you are curious if you could benefit from the Santander account, visit the company's website at Santander.co.uk and go to the 123 Santander page. In the ""What You Get"" area, there is a cashback calculator. This allows you to put in your typical utility bill information to determine how much money you could get back. You also can view a list of utility providers to ensure your provider is a member of the cashback awards program. The Fine Print You must meet a few basic requirements to qualify for the Santander 123 card. For example, you must be older than age 18 and a permanent UK resident. In addition, you must keep a balance of at least £500 in your account and use at least two direct debits per month. Remember that you will only earn the cashback rewards for the Santander 123 card if you have at least £1,000 in your account. If your balance drops below this amount, you will not get the cashback. To maximize the amount of interest you earn each month, follow this strategy: Keep as much money as you possibly can in your account for as many days as possible. To get the cashback rewards on your utility bills, they must be from direct debits. If you do choose to utilize direct debits, you may wish to set them all for the end of the month to maximize your interest. You must pay a small fee to receive these benefits. The Santander card costs £2 each month to earn the cashback perks. Unlike some other cashback cards that pay once per year, the Santander card will pay cashback rewards on a monthly basis. If the Santander 123 account does not appeal to you, but you wish to stay with the Santander company, you can choose its Everyday account, which does not offer cashback or charge a fee for holding the current account. Making the Switch Santander is a member of the Current Account Switch Service (CASS) that will switch your bank accounts within seven business days upon your request. The CASS system ensures you can switch your account in a hassle-free manner. If any details of the account do slip through the cracks, such as direct debits from the old account, the responsible bank must cover the costs associated with the error."

1,Basics of How to Compare Loans: Understanding Index and Margin in Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Loans,finance," If you're wondering how to compare loans, two of the most important elements to look at are the index and margin. These are especially important in ARMs, which feature varying rates of interest and flexible monthly payments. The Index An index is essentially a base rate of interest from which your lender establishes the interest actually used on your mortgage. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, your lender uses the index not only for the initial calculation of interest, but also for every subsequent recalculation after your introductory period is over. Most indices are market-based and are set independently from the lenders. Common indices used today include the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Cost of Funds Index (COFI) and Constant-Maturity Treasury (CMT). You can categorize indices broadly as either average or spot rate. Typically, if your mortgage uses an average index, you'll find that your payments are slightly higher but shift much more slowly. With a spot index, the changes are much more volatile, and subsequently, so are your payments, despite them being a little lower. The Margin Margin refers to a set percentage that your lender adds to your interest rate. For instance, you're your interest rate based on your given index is 4%, and your margin is 2%, then your final interest rate for the mortgage would be 6%. Unlike the index, your mortgage margin is not market-based and independent, but rather is determined by the specific lender you're working with. Lenders typically keep margins at 4% or lower, but if your credit is not so great, you might see a margin as steep as 7%. Combined with the index percentage, this can yield a very unfavorable mortgage arrangement. Understanding and Applying Index and Margin in Loan Comparison Aside from selecting which index to use, mortgage lenders have very little control over the index portion of your final interest rate. If you want to get a picture of whether the indices they have selected will provide favorable financial results for you, your best bet is to look at graphs that show how the different indices have changed over time, as Holden Lewis of Bankrate suggests. This not only gives clues about the kind of rate increases you might expect, but also how quickly the fluctuations are happening. This is very important because most lenders often attract potential ARM borrowers with attractive rates of interest offered only for the introductory period. Unless you know how the index likely will perform over the long haul, your adjustments--particularly the initial one, which often isn't subject to an interest rate cap--might be quite of a shock. Looking at margin, lenders are going to offer you a percentage based primarily on the risk they perceive you to be. If your credit is low, they might spike the margin in order to protect themselves from the potential loss that could happen should you default. For this reason, even though lenders consider many other elements when drawing up a mortgage package, you want to do everything you can to get your credit score up before you start applying. Sometimes, you can get the lender to reduce the margin by offering some collateral, offering a larger down-payment or getting one or more cosigners on the loan. You should ask what the lender can offer to you in these various scenarios. Conclusion The index and margin related to a mortgage are often confusing, especially for first-time home buyers. These figures work together to determine the bulk of your mortgage cost, not including fees such as origination or closing. You have some control over them in that you can select lenders that use specific indices that are yielding the type of performance you need over time, and in that you can negotiate for a lower margin through techniques such as getting a cosigner. The more you know about the indices out there when you are considering your home purchase, and the more questions you ask of your lender to see how different circumstances might influence your margin, the more likely it is that you'll come out on top when you go through the comparison process."
2,Analyzing the Terms and Conditions for a Mortgages Comparison,finance," When analyzing the terms and conditions for a mortgages comparison, there are always a few factors you'll want to keep in mind. Many people look at mortgages as a necessary evil on the path to owning their dream home. When confronted with a lengthy ""Terms of Service"" document before signing on that ever-important dotted line, many people don't bother to read it. Analyzing the terms and conditions properly before the mortgage goes into effect can be a valuable negotiating tactic. If you want to change or talk about any conditions you may find unsatisfactory or predatory, you need to do so before you put your signature on the piece of paper that will ultimately control your financial future for decades to come. One type of mortgage that is very popular in the United Kingdom is called an ""interest only"" mortgage. It operates very differently from traditional mortgages, especially those in use in the United States and other areas. With a traditional mortgage, the borrower is making monthly payments that go towards both the original principal amount borrowed and interest that has accrued since the last payment. Depending on the terms and conditions, interest could be accruing as frequently as once per day. When the borrower submits their payment for the month, a portion goes to reducing the principal while the remainder goes towards interest. If the interest is compounded, it is being added to the principal on a regular basis and itself begins to earn interest with each passing month. In an ""interest only"" mortgage, the original principal of the loan agreement is not being repaid for the duration of the term. Instead, the borrower is making minimum monthly payments that go towards an investment account. When the account contains a specified amount of money and reaches maturity, the money is then used to pay off the principal. In the United Kingdom, these terms and conditions are frequently associated with traditional investment plans. These types of arrangements are also commonly referred to as an ""investment backed mortgage."" Changes to regulations in the UK have tightened the requirements for these types of agreements in recent years due in large part to the financial crisis across the world that began in 2007 and 2008. When reviewing the terms and conditions of a mortgage agreement, you will discover three different ways in which the property in question is valued. These are the appraised value, the estimated value and the actual value. A licensed professional obtains the appraised value during a visit to the property. The condition of the home is taken into consideration, as are any code violations and other financial stipulations that may be relevant. The actual value is also referred to as the transactional value and describes the purchase price of the property. The estimated value is often obtained in areas where no appraisal can be performed. It is very similar to the appraised value in that it takes into consideration any repairs that may need to be made to the home as well as other financial burdens the homeowner may have. Depending on the financial institution and your credit rating, you may be required to purchase mortgage insurance at the time you sign your original agreement. Unlike other types of insurance, mortgage insurance isn't actually designed to protect the policyholder in the event of an emergency. Instead, it is designed to protect the lender in the event that the borrower may default on the loan. Mortgage insurance is typically added into the monthly payment amount along with interest, closing costs and other elements. It is possible to stop paying mortgage insurance after a period of time by refinancing. The money paid by the insurance policy goes towards paying off the original loan in the event of a default."
3,Switching Current Accounts - Does It Risk Your Credit History?,finance," Are you hesitating to switch to a new current account because you're worried that your credit history will be affected? Do you feel that switching to a new bank and a brand new current account means you have to start all over again in terms of building a good record of credit? There is absolutely no reason to fear that your past credit record will be wiped clean and that you have start afresh. This guide on currents accounts will help clear up those myths. Banks often share information about a customer's financial track record. If you have a clean and positive history you have nothing to worry about. With the sophisticated data sharing that's in place, all your information is transferred to the new bank. This is done through third party financial data processing companies like Equifax, CallCredit and Experian who help out banks when they need to make decisions about loan approvals or the terms of setting up a new account. The records maintained about you include information such as •	whether you are registered to vote •	if you have a bad credit history •	if you have applied for loans from various agencies •	whether you have been unsuccessful with prior loan applications •	the number of years you have banked with other banks Being with the same bank does have a positive impact on your credit record, but moving to another provider does not in any way harm your rating. It also does not cause any problems if you apply for loans in the future. If you want to switch current accounts, then ask your new bank if they will bear the liability for any mistakes they make while moving your account. Some banks offer cash rewards and incentives to encourage you to make a move. Banks also like stability.  While handing out loan approvals, banks would like to know that you will stick around long enough to pay back your debt. How can you enhance your credit rating?  You can bolster your credit score by making your credit card payments promptly within the due date without fail.  To achieve this end, stick to just one or two credit cards, and cancel any cards that you don't use.  If you own property, it can be of help because bankers like to lend money to homeowners rather than tenants. Getting yourself registered on the electoral rolls is another way to boost your credit score. When you apply for loans, limit the number of banks and lending agencies you approach. If you make too many applications for loans, it will be flagged as desperate behavior which could earn you a black mark on your credit rating. Your rating might even be downgraded if the banker or lender does a full credit check against your name every time you apply for a loan.  These checks will be registered in your credit history - and not in a nice way.  Before applying for a loan, it may be smart to discuss with the bank to see if they would insist on conducting a complete background check. A simple credit check, however, will not get recorded in the register. If your loan application is rejected this also is recorded in your credit history. What to do with your old current account?  It is best to leave your old account open until you have settled into your new account. Under Office of Fair Trading rules, it is legal to maintain as many current accounts as you wish in your name. If you have several standing orders and direct debits set up with your previous account, and some of them don't get transferred to your new account on time, it might lead to unpaid bills. This is rare, but can leave an adverse impact on your credit rating. In case you wish to close the old account once you are comfortable with the new one, then simply inform your old bank and submit the relevant forms and documents to close it.  You can also take this opportunity to cancel any credit cards that you are not actively using, which can further enhance your credit score and help with any loan applications you make in the future."
4,Selecting Current Accounts: Tips to Find the Best Current Account UK Providers Can Offer,finance," When it comes to choosing current accounts, there are more options than ever before. Finding the best current account UK banks have is getting increasingly challenging as a result. Nevertheless, don't give up the hunt for the perfect account just yet--these tips will help you find the account that's a perfect fit for you. Think critically about your habits. Be honest. Are you the kind of person who wants to go in person to do business? Would you rather manage your account in your skivvies at 3:00 a.m.? Would you feel lost without your mobile device? The answers to these questions will push you very broadly into either brick-and-mortar or online banking. The latter tends to be cheaper because online institutions, with fewer buildings and staff, do not have as many overhead costs to recoup, but sometimes paying a little more will get you perks that fit better into the way you really go through your day. Look at the extras (for example, a debit card) that each account comes with as you examine whether they match your lifestyle. Be mindful of your budget. Your budget matters when it comes to picking the best current account because it affects whether you'll be able to meet minimum balance requirements the bank might have. It also matters because if you're consistently in the black, you likely can focus on accounts that offer good interest rates or other perks instead of looking for the best overdraft protection. The way you budget also can affect the frequency and manner in which you access your account. Get a list of applicable charges. Banks are widely varied in terms of what they charge for, and even for relatively ""standard"" fees such as maintenance, there's no real rhyme or reason in terms of how much those fees are. Make a list of the charges that apply to each account you're considering, being mindful that the same fee might be labeled as something else by a different bank. Pay careful attention to whether the fees are one-time or reoccurring. Even a small charge for a task you perform regularly can add up quickly. Keep in mind, too, that some charges relate to perks that can be well worth what you have to pay--the right account for you isn't necessarily going to be free from this standpoint, but you still should have a goal of keeping the fee total as low as you can and eliminating financial surprises. Understand what introductory means. All too often, people are enticed into a current account that is all wrong for them simply because the bank offers something good for a brief period after the account is set up. For instance, they might offer interest-free overdraft for the first three months, or they might waive fees on certain transactions for a few weeks. After the introductory period is over, though, those perks disappear and your bank plays by new rules with your account. Don't get enticed by the initial offers, as it is what the account can offer over the long haul that really matters. Know where you're special. Banks often give breaks to or have certain accounts for people who fall into certain groups. For instance, there are accounts for seniors, students and minors. There are even accounts designed to help you manage your money without violating your religious convictions. Ask the bank if they have an account that is more tailored to you in this way and you might save a bundle. Put a high value on customer service. People who work at banks are there in part to resolve issues with your account. They also are critical, however, for giving you financial advice. For instance, they can explain the difference between different banking products and where your money might do best. For these reasons, regardless of whether you choose brick-and-mortar or online banking, make sure that the bank has good customer service ratings and that you can get in contact with a representative easily. Conclusion Picking the current account that is best for you doesn't have to be torturous. You will probably have better luck finding one that fits your needs if you are mindful of your habits and budget, and if you pay attention to customer service, identify what makes you unique and make sure you're clear about fees and charges. Always look at what the account can do for you over time, remembering that introductory offers are mainly just to pique your interest."
5,People aren't Taking to Current Account Switching in Great Numbers. Do They Have Trouble Comparing Current Accounts?,finance," The current account is the most prevalent kind of bank account in the UK. According to a report by the OFT, called Review of barriers to entry, expansion and exit in retail banking, 93% of adults in the UK hold at least one current account. While consumer review websites are full of consumer complaints against banks, account holders rarely try to switch accounts. Before the Current Account Switching Service launched in September 2013, the difficulty involved in switching current accounts could have easily accounted for the lack of consumer interest in the activity. Now that switches easily go through in 7 days under the new system, what could explain consumer reluctance to switch? A report by the Treasury Committee may have a clue - current accounts are advertised in such a confusing and opaque way that consumers have no way of identifying deals that are better than what they have. The barrier of confusion When consumers need to compare different current accounts for their overdraft policies, they lose their way navigating confusing terminology. For instance, some accounts advertise interest-free overdrafts. While consumers may take the term ""interest-free"" to mean that they are free, banks using this term mean that they charge their customers through flat daily fees, rather than an interest rate. Many banks advertise their basic accounts as ""free banking"" accounts and market them at low income consumers. Consumers holding these accounts, though, pay an average of £150 each year operating these accounts. They pay in the form of overdraft fees and other penalties. The lack of clarity can be so serious that people often turn to payday loans that charge a clear 5,000% APR rather than risk making use of a current account overdraft that is unclear about what exactly it charges (in reality, some banks charge their current account holders overdraft interest rates that are far higher than what payday lenders charge). Even when banks try to publish details about their current accounts in easy-to-understand terms, the sheer volume of the choice available - different account plans, overdraft plans and interest rate plans - can take away any benefit that the clarity may bring. The barrier presented by inadequate choice Three-quarters of the UK retail banking market is locked up by just four major banks. Many critics of the British banking system consider the banking system an oligopoly - a market that features poor competition because it's owned by just a handful of giant businesses. With little competition to worry about, the large banks have no incentive to advertise their products properly or to explain to consumers how their plans are different from what the competition offers. The lack of options is clear in the way consumers carry out their banking activities. Reports by consumer organizations find that half of all people applying for home loans or personal loans go directly to the bank that they have their main current account with. They don't believe that they have real choice. What should consumers do? Consumer groups have various ideas on what can be done to encourage consumers to actively look for alternatives and switch current accounts. Some have suggested that banks should send their account holders annual statements that help them see exactly how much they pay in fees, interest and penalties. Every bank could be required to advertise its offerings in the same format to allow easy comparison. Until banks make their product offerings easier to understand, consumers should view choosing banking services the way they would any technical matter. Just as they would turn to expert reviews and recommendations for help choosing mutual funds or stocks, they should turn to trusted expert recommendations for help finding the best bank account deals. When experts make recommendations, they aren't usually taken in by simple myths the way regular consumers are. For instance, experts are more likely to give small banks like Handelsbank and Metro Bank a chance because they are able to study their background, the management teams behind them and the policies they use. Regular consumers, on the other hand, are likely to dismiss these banks as too new and untested. These banks offer consumers real choice - transparent fee schedules, more generous overdraft rates and better interest rates."
6,Bank Accounts for Bad Credit 101,finance," Unemployment, illness, and unexpected tragedies cause many people to be a position of having bad credit. Once your credit rating drops low it, it is hard to bring it back up. There are bank accounts for folks with bad credit that can help you manage your finances while rebuilding your credit. Combining a current basic account with a prepaid credit builder credit card is a great way to get back on track with your credit. Current Basic Accounts This type of account is true to its name. It is very basic and doesn't have many frills. It does offer direct debit and a debit card. Energy companies like direct debit payments and this can save you money on your energy costs. Setting up direct debits to pay all of your bills will help you manage your money better so you can start paying down your debt. Basic accounts do not offer overdraft, cheques, or pay interest. All you need to get a basic account is proof of residence and a proper ID. Credit Builder Credit Card This is a card that is designed to help rebuild your credit. The cards have set limits and you must show that you can stay under that amount and faithfully pay your bill each month. Apply for one of these cards only if you feel certain that you will not abuse it and will manage it responsibly. It is important to realize that if you exceed your credit limit or do not make your payments on time, it will be reflected in your credit history. Pay your bill in full every month, and do not make cash withdrawals. The interest rate on these cards is very high. Once you credit ratings improves, request a better rate. Secured Credit Card When you apply for a secured card you must deposit cash with the credit card issuer. The amount of cash you deposit is normally the amount your credit limit will be. The money stays with the card issuer as a security deposit in the event you do not make your payments. You must pay your bill each month on whatever amount you use. It is not deducted from your deposit like a prepaid credit card is. All payments and non-payments are reported to the CRAs. Look for a secured card with low fees. Manage Your Spending Most people will admit the reason they are looking for a bank account for bad credit is because they are addicted to spending. Do not buy things you cannot afford. Learn t save money until you can afford to buy things. Your bills must always be paid first. Do not cash your check and go shopping first. Pay the rent or mortgage, the energy bill, buy food, and pay other bills. Say no to the latest technology toy, and save any money left after bills for an unexpected expense that may occur later. Learn To Live Within A Budget When creating a budget, the first items listed are the things you cannot live without, such as shelter, electricity, gas, food, and then everything else. Most people get into credit problems because they didn't know how to manage money, and when he the very first credit card was received it was treated like a toy. Purchases were made for things that were not needed, and the bill added up fast. Soon the only payment being made each month was the minimum required amount. Interest starts adding up at that point, and the bill grows larger and larger. Before long the minimum monthly payment has grown and everything is spinning out of control. That same scenario cannot continue if you ever hope to re-establish good credit. The things that you need each month are those things that provide shelter, warmth, and food. The expensive electronic gadgets, tablets, computers, and smart phones can wait for a day when all the bills are paid and there is ""extra"" money to purchase something you want more than need. You can repair your credit no matter how badly damaged it is. Special current bank accounts for bad credit, as well as prepaid and secured credit cards are tools to help you with the job of repairing your credit. Use the tools wisely along with some common sense and you will find you are able to restore your credit."
7,Addressing Common Misconceptions About Ethical Banks and Credit Unions,finance," Thanks to the all-too-common misconceptions and half truths circulating about alternative banks, ethical banks, credit unions and building societies, many otherwise socially and financially responsible people are choosing to avoid this type of financial institution. Finding an ethical bank is something that most people want to do, and too few people make the effort to actually accomplish. Lately, credit unions and ethical banks have gotten an ill-deserved bad rep. Here's a look at some of the common misconceptions regarding these alternative banks, as well as some tips and tricks for switching your current accounts over. Ethical Banks Have Too Many Restrictions Your money belongs to you - you worked hard for it and, chances are, you like the idea of being firmly in charge of your finances. When it comes to ethical banks and credit unions, many people assume they come with extensive membership restrictions and fraternity-like enrollment. Once upon a time, when credit unions and building societies were first popping up across the UK, this may have been closer to the truth. Today, there are fewer restrictions on joining credit unions and ethical banking institutions, and opening a current account there is just as easy as setting up your finances at a traditional bank. A Credit Union or Building Society Isn't Regulated This is probably one of the biggest fallacies about ethical banking being circulated today. Governing agencies regulate credit unions in much of the same way as they do corporate banks - and in some case even more so. The money in all of your current accounts is safe and secure at any one of these institutions. Also, because your ethical bank or credit union reports directly back to you and your fellow consumers - and not to a board of faceless trustees - there is much more transparency when it comes to the kinds of projects and business ventures your money is funding. A Credit Union Won't Offer as Many Services as a Traditional Bank When a consumer is looking to open a bank account, they will inevitably choose the financial institution that offers them the most services and competitive rates. Credit unions and building societies wouldn't continue to stay in business (and to grow at a fast rate) if they didn't offer the same things as the big banks. In fact, most ethical banks offer better interest rates on individual savings accounts and mortgages than their corporate counterparts. There's a Fee to Join Just as with any other bank that you'd open a bank account with, you're usually required to have a minimum opening balance for new bank account at an ethical bank. Some credit unions will also require you to keep a minimum balance in your checking account at all times, or your account will be closed. Again, this is no different than traditional banks. Others will charge a monthly fee for not complying with the rule. Opening an account isn't any more expensive either. You Can Only Use Your Ethical Banking Institution Locally While it's true that most credit unions aren't available across all of the UK, most are part of groups that allow you to do your banking from wherever you are. Also, a bigger online presence will allow you to tackle the majority of your banking needs from your computer, laptop or smart phone. Only Employees of Companies Associated with Credit Unions Can Join A long time ago, this was true. But this was before there were a lot of people interested in joining credit unions. Now that credit unions have gained in popularity, they have let go of that restriction, so that anyone can join. There are a few sprinkled throughout the UK that have chosen to stick to that rule, but it's easier now than ever to find a credit union or alternative bank that you can easily join. Credit unions and ethical banks may have gotten a less than stellar reputation over the course of the years, but there's no reason not to give them an honest chance. With member benefits, competitive rates and a positive social influence, ethical banks and credit unions are an excellent alternative to traditional banks."
8,Today's Credit Cards are New Examples of an Old Idea,finance," The average consumer does not think about the long history of the credit cards in their wallet.  Today's sleek, plastic cards are the latest members of an illustrious lineage going back centuries, and they are still evolving. Nationwide and worldwide plastic credit cards are a fairly recent invention, but they are based on a concept going back centuries.  Merchants have long realized that their customers would buy more items if they were allowed to pay for them later, so a mechanism permitting this was advantageous to both merchant and customer.  Arrangements for purchases on credit probably go back as far as trading itself, and history recounts several examples dating back to the 18th century. An example is furniture seller Christopher Thompson, who made the first recorded advertisement for credit in 1730.  This was a simple offer to split furniture payments up into weekly installments, an idea that would receive wider use from armies of traveling salesmen for the next two centuries or so. These worthy individuals took to the road in response to hard economic times, becoming known as ""peddlers"" or the less complimentary term, ""drifters.""  They sold everything from shoes to kitchen pans, bringing small bits of civilization to rural locales that would otherwise have been completely isolated.  Since most of their customers were poor, the only way the traveling salesmen could do any business was by allowing purchases on credit, collecting payment on their next trip through the area. Both the salesman and his customers were often illiterate, so the standard way of keeping up with a customer's account was to carve notches on a wooden stick.  Notches representing the customer's debt were cut into one side of the stick, and another row of notches was cut into the other side to represent payments.  When the two lines were equal, the debt was fully paid.  The sticks were called tallies, and the traveling merchants were the tallymen.  This may be the first use of a physical object to represent credit. As the Industrial Revolution progressed, a middle class emerged and provided a new market for consumer goods and the concept of buying them on credit.  This led many British banks in the 19th century to institute overdraft insurance.  This a mounted to a credit program, because it allowed customers to overdraw on their bank accounts and pay the excess amount at a later date. The use of cards as credit vouchers began with Western Union, which in 1914 started issuing small metal plates by which customers could defer payment.  Metal was used because this service was seen as benefitting travelers reluctant to carry large amounts of cash, meaning that the cards would be subjected to heavy wear during travel.  By modern standards, it was a great deal, since it the overdraft amount did not accrue interest. Also aiming for travelers, the General Petroleum Corporation began issuing metal credit cards in 1924.  This expanded the concept, since it allowed the cardholder to purchase a wide variety of goods and services at automotive service centers in many locations. As the 20th century proceeded, the idea of nationwide cards for credit became more widespread, but they were always for specific businesses.  AT&T's phone cards came into use in the 1930's, and the Ford Motor Corporation opened loan offices specifically to help people buy its cars. However, the concept of the modern credit card, usable at many locations and for a variety of products nationwide, was originated by Diner's Club, whose cards became a ubiquitous part of American culture in the 1950s. The first bank to issue cards was New York's Franklin National Bank in 1951, but their ""Charg-It"" card could only be used in a limited number of businesses and was not honored nationwide.  The modern era of plastic money can be traced to the birth of the American Express Card in 1958. Other landmarks followed.  BankAmericard started the idea of revolving credit by allowing the customer to select different payment plans.  Master Charge arose as the other king of credit, later changing its name to MasterCard. The concept of credit companies and the growing number of functions for their cards continues to evolve in the 21st century, and the cards of tomorrow will far surpass their predecessors."
9,Nationwide FlexDirect Current Accounts Offer Best Current Account Interest Rates on the Market,finance," Are you looking for a current account that not only allows you to handle your bills and everyday spending, but also pays you a little bit of interest on your money? Current account interest rates are usually very low, or even non-existent, but there is one account that offers an incredible 5% interest. That figure is more than twice as much as is paid on most savings account! Meet the Nationwide FlexDirect Account The account in question is the Nationwide FlexDirect account, which launched in late 2012 and began offering an interest rate well above the market average in March 2013. If you already have a Nationwide FlexAccount, then converting to the new FlexDirect is easy - simply make the request online using your usual online banking system and your account will be switched over within a few days, keeping the same account number and sort code. FlexDirect is also open to new customers, who can apply online, by phone, or in a Nationwide branch. Too Good to Be True? Perhaps five percent interest strikes you as sounding just a little too good to be true? Well, it must be said that there are a few limitations. The headline rate of 5% is only paid on the first £2,500 in the account; any additional balance over that amount earns no interest at all. If you are disappointed after reading that fact, remember that 5% interest on £2,500 still nets you £125 in one year, so the return is almost certainly worth the few minutes that you spend setting up the account. The other bad news is that the five percent rate is an introductory rate; it only lasts for the first 12 months. After the first year, the interest rate drops to an unremarkable 1%. However, by that time smart savers will already have found a new high-paying account to move their money into. What You Need to Do to Earn Interest on a FlexDirect Account There is just a single requirement to keep your account eligible for 5% interest: keep paying at least £1,000 into the account each month. The money must come from an external source, such as an account held by another bank. Having your salary paid into your FlexDirect account is an easy way to meet this requirement. The money you take out of the account has no impact on your eligibility for interest payments, so you can move the £1,000 that you are required to pay in straight back out again if you only want to use the FlexDirect as a source of interest rather than as your main current account. You also get a Visa debit card with the account, which you can use to withdraw cash for free from Nationwide and Link cash machines, or to spend money in shops and restaurants via a chip and PIN payment. An Added Benefit for Nationwide FlexDirect Customers There is one more benefit that you gain when you open a FlexDirect account. Nationwide customers with one of these accounts are eligible to apply for a Flexclusive ISA, which pays 2% interest on savings up to £5,760. Sure, 2% is not as impressive as the 5% you're getting on your FlexDirect current account, but the big advantage of an ISA is that all the interest earned on this type of account is completely tax free. The Verdict Despite its limitations, the FlexDirect account still beats most other current accounts in terms of the interest it pays. If you are looking for current account interest rates that reward you for storing a larger amount of money, then the Santander 123 account is likely to be a better option, as this account pays interest on balances of up to £20,000. However, the Santander 123 account does come with a monthly fee, so it is probably not worth it if you only have a small amount of money to store and spend."
10,Increasing Demand Could Mean Easier Access to the Cheapest Secured Loans,finance," A popular website centered on the UK economy, FinancialReproter.com, posted the results of a poll that sheds light on a phenomenon that could open doors for individuals and businesses shopping for low interest rate secured loans. The poll, which tallied the responses of over 1,000 financial advisors, showed that 70 percent of participants would be interested in a model that allowed them to create their own loan products. Such an innovation would have implications for anyone searching for the cheapest secured loans. The Poll The poll asked: ""As the loan markets improves, if there was an 'out of the box' model to help you set up your own loan/debt solutions business with direct agencies and full support, would that be of interest?"" Over half of the advisors answered positively, at 52 percent. A third of participants--29 percent--answered ""no,"" and 18 percent were unsure. Steve Walker, director of Promise Solutions, has stated that such an out-of-the-box solution could confer serious benefits to the loan market and that he felt it was possible due to the technological systems available today. He went on to say, ""The key seems to be giving brokers the systems, control and additional income they need to be effective whilst ensuring the lenders have the comfort they want."" According to Walker, Promise Solutions has begun looking into the possibility of creating such a system with its partners. Potential Game Changer Many mortgage companies and banks have tightened their eligibility requirements for secured loans considerably since the collapse of the housing market in 2007. Despite overall improvement in the economy, the personal loan sector is recovering relatively slowly. The result is that while demand for loans from the public is increasing, on the whole, banks continue to wait for more favorable lending conditions. Consequently, the self-employed and those with weaker applications continue to struggle to secure loans even if they have valuable collateral to put up. This could change if a turnkey financial services solution became available to sophisticated investors. If financial advisors could start their own businesses specialising in small secured loans, banks would be forced back into the arena or else risk losing their grip on an eager customer base. Banks have already seen losses due to the emergence of online peer-to-peer lending schemes over the last few years. These platforms allow independent investors to offer loans directly to customers, completely bypassing bank involvement. To make matters worse for financial institutions, these individual investors can often afford to offer customers lower interest rates as they have lower overhead. In fact, the peer-to-peer platform itself covers the costs of collecting payments and virtually everything else. Typically, an investor's only cost is a one-off fee or a commission per loan. If the peer-to-peer platform is auction-based, the investor may face stiffer fees, but ultimately, this is a pittance compared to the operating costs of even a small bank. On top of that, If a simple-to-deploy solution hits the market that would allow financial advisors to get in on the action, banks may sit up and take notice rather than fight a battle on two fronts. All of this is wonderful news for you if you're looking for the cheapest secured loans. Intense competition between lenders means lower interest rates overall, especially if financial advisors want to offer financial services to clients directly. Such a model is untested, and these entrepreneurs will have to overcome a certain amount of market hesitation before they can expect to turn a profit. On another front, the proposed model could provide a viable alternative to payday loans, which have received widespread criticism. Although these loans generate lots of tax revenue, there is concern that they are easily available to persons who are unable to repay them. This is primarily because payday loan companies target individuals that earn less than £25,000 a year and then tack on exorbitant interest rates. Customers can easily find themselves falling behind, with no clear path to paying their debt. Price War This perfect storm of financial product diversification could result in a price war between the traditional banks and the more exotic services. Peer-to-peer loan auction site ThinCats, for instance, has already loaned over £25 million to businesses across the aisles, all the while keeping that money out of the hands of hungry banks. At the end of the day, anything that gives consumers more choice will ultimately result in lower prices as competition winnows profit margins."
11,How to Stay Secure When Using NatWest Credit Cards,finance," Credit cards offer a convenient way of paying for goods and services, whether you are shopping online, on the high street, or travelling abroad. They are also generally considered to be a secure method of payment, and most card providers put systems in place to protect you against fraud. However, you still need to take a few basic steps to protect yourself and your money when using a credit card. Keep Your Card Safe You should always keep your card in a safe place, and do not give it to anyone else to use, even members of your immediate family. You should also avoid disclosing your PIN to anyone. When you are shopping on the high street, or withdrawing cash at an ATM, shield your PIN with your hand as you enter it to prevent anyone standing behind you learning what number you use. Also look out for suspicious looking devices fitted around the card slots of cash machines, as scammers occasionally use such devices to clone people's cards so that they can use them to extract money from your account. If anything looks suspicious when you are using an ATM, withdraw your card immediately and notify the bank that owns the machines that something may be wrong. Beware of Scammers Sadly, in today's world there are some criminals who will try to trick you into parting with your credit card and your personal details. Be wary of anyone who phones or emails you pretending to be from your bank, the police, or another source of authority. None of these organizations will ever require you to reveal your PIN or the login details for your account. One worrying scam that has emerged lately is for scammers to phone the customer pretending to either be a police officer or a bank employee. The customer will be told to put the phone down and call their bank or the local police station to verify that the call is genuine. However, the scammers will hold the phone line open so that the customer's call redirects to the scammer. The scammer will tell the customer that there is a problem with their card and that a courier will come around to their house to collect it. Through this method, customers can be tricked into handing over their card and personal details to criminal fraudsters. If you receive this type of call, put the phone down and do not engage with the scammers. Stay Secure When Shopping Online Many people worry about security when shopping online, but banks have been working hard to make sure your details are secure. NatWest Secure is a simple browser application that the bank uses to verify your identity when you make certain transactions using your credit or debit card online. By asking you to enter digits from your PIN or online banking password, the bank can be sure that it is you that is using your card, not a fraudster. Of course, you should continue to take basic security precautions when carrying out financial transactions online. Never share your PIN, card number, security code or account login details over the internet. When shopping online, stick to reputable sites that you are sure you can trust, and look for a padlock symbol in the address bar of your browser. This symbol shows that your details are being transmitted securely, which means that they are protected from hackers. Look Out For Suspicious Transactions It pays to keep an eye on your credit card statements so that you can spot fraudulent transactions soon after they occur. If you see anything suspicious on your statement, call the bank to report it. If you lose your card, you should also report it as lost or stolen as soon as possible, so that the bank can cancel the card and prevent any fraud from occurring. NatWest offers a free fraud text alert service, in which customers receive text messages letting them know when a suspicious transaction has taken place. This service allows you to let the bank know quickly if you did not authorize the transaction."
12,How to Choose the Best Current Account,finance," Although any current account serves much the same purpose to tend to your day-to-day banking needs, there are some important differences to consider when choosing one. Thanks to the new Current Account Switch Guarantee service, launched in September, 2013, it is now easier and quicker than ever to switch bank accounts. The new automated process allows you to switch to a new bank account in seven working days, or if you so wish, on any day after this. Up until the day of the switchover, you will be able to continue using your old current account as normal. During the process, any direct debits, standing orders or salaries should be transferred automatically to the new account. While now is probably the best time of all to switch bank accounts, you should first determine your requirements and see if you can benefit by changing over to a new bank or building society. The following provides some useful tips on choosing a better current account. Monthly Fees and Packaged Accounts In the UK, standard current accounts generally don't charge any monthly fees to keep them open. You may or may not receive an overdraft facility, depending on your credit score. Bank accounts which charge monthly fees normally do so because they provide a range of extra features which may or may not be useful to you. These are known as packaged accounts, and they often include things like insurance coverage for travel and car breakdowns. While it can be convenient and cheaper to have these services included with a packaged account, this might not always be the case. High-Interest Accounts Interest rates on balances held in current accounts have long ranged from nothing to negligible in most cases. However, there is now a wider range of options on the market, with a few current account deals presenting you with an opportunity to earn a worthwhile amount of interest on your money. If you are in the habit of keeping a large amount of money in your current account and you never, or almost never, go overdrawn, then a high-interest account might be just what you are looking for. Nationwide is presently offering the best high-interest rate current account, paying rates of 5% AER, subject to certain terms and conditions. Student Bank Accounts Once you leave college and start preparing for university, one of the first things that you will need to do is find an effective way to manage your finances and make your money and your borrowings work for you in the best way possible. Student bank accounts feature special features aimed for those going on to higher education, such as generous interest-free overdraft facilities and memberships to various student-orientated discount schemes. Most of the banks and building societies in the UK provide accounts tailored specifically to students and graduates. Overdraft facilities offering credit limits of up to £3,000 are widely available, subject to your individual status. Basic Current Accounts If all you need is a basic current account with no additional features, no monthly fees and no high overdraft facility to gather debt on, then a basic bank account may be precisely what you need. Such bank accounts still provide you with everything you need for managing your day-to-day finances, including making direct debits and standing orders and withdrawing money on your debit card both at home and abroad. Customer Service and Account Accessibility One of the common reasons to switch bank accounts is to escape poor customer service. Particularly since the introduction of the new switching service, many people are ditching the UK's largest banks and going for something different. If service is particularly important to you, then you should spend some time reading customer reviews to determine whether or not it is worth switching. One UK bank which has consistently topped the customer service polls in recent years is First Direct. They're even offering a £100 cashback reward to all new customers who open a current account with them. Finally, you will need to consider accessibility options. Consider how you prefer to manage your accounts. Do you prefer online banking, telephone banking or dealing with someone face-to-face at a local branch?"
13,Funding Circle for Business Loans,finance," Peer-to-peer lending sites are still a growing phenomenon in the UK. Their publicity efforts tend to centre on their benefits for investors, mainly the relatively high interest rates they offer to savers. The success of the sites depends on winning over lenders looking for a home for their savings: there is less material out there about their advantages from the point of view of borrowers. It’s assumed that potential borrowers, particularly business borrowers, will find their own way to the sites with minimal encouragement, given the tight credit market of recent years. If you run a company that’s in need of investment, the financial climate isn’t easy. It’s hard to get backing from the banks, even for small loans. What are your options? Of the top three UK peer-to-peer sites, the biggest one for business borrowing is Funding Circle (FC). Who can borrow through Funding Circle? A business is eligible to apply for a loan of between £5,000 and £1,000,000, if it Has a turnover (not profit) of over £100,000 per annum Has filed accounts at Companies House for at least two years Is a limited company or LLP, not a business run by an individual or a partnership The loans are repayable over a period between six months and five years. A personal guarantee for the loan is expected in all cases, and for larger loans over £100,000, the site requires security to be given, either on a specific asset to be bought with the loan proceeds, or generally over company assets. How does it work for borrowers? A business needing to borrow must initially complete an online application. Funding Circle estimates that should take about 20 minutes. They aim to process the information, complete routine checks, and revert to the borrower with a decision within two days. FC will do a credit check with Experian, and will also check with CIFAS as to whether any fraud has been recorded in connection with a company director. The borrower’s proposal may be accepted or rejected outright, or Funding Circle may request modifications in the terms or the security required. In some cases, the company may be restricted to borrowing a smaller sum that they had intended. Depending on FC’s assessment of the borrowing company’s financial strength, and the degree of risk in lending to them, the loan request, once accepted, will be assigned a ‘risk band’ which determines the range of interest rates allowed for the loan. The rates range between 7.2% and 11.5%, as at November 2013. Once agreement has been reached on terms, the loan proposal will appear on the FC website, with information about the company’s credit rating, accounts, and the purpose of the loan, together with details of any guarantee and/or security. Within the assigned risk band, lenders can offer to lend money at their chosen rate, which is driven down in a reverse auction as successive lenders place their ‘bids’. The more popular the lending proposition, the quicker the interest rate will go down. It usually reaches the minimum for its particular risk band, but may not do so if the proposal doesn’t appeal to the lender members of the site. Appealing to lenders To ensure the best chance of your proposal attracting the lowest interest rate for its band, make your proposal full and convincing. Describe your company mission and values, and explain why you need the money as precisely as possible. Make sure that any issues with your credit score have been resolved with Experian as far as possible, as the company credit rating is very important to lenders. Above all, answer their questions as promptly and fully as you can, even when, as is sometimes the case, they are phrased less than diplomatically. Far fewer people will lend on a proposal with unanswered questions outstanding, or with questions they think aren’t answered fully. After the auction When the loan is fully funded, usually at the minimum rate for the band, the borrower must decide whether to accept the proposal or not. If it’s accepted, the loan, consisting of 10’s or 100’s of small slices coming from individual investors, will be administered by FC who will distribute the repayments between the investors and chase up late payments. They will be responsible for collecting the debt through the courts if necessary, and will enforce any guarantee or security, should the loan go bad. If you are thinking about borrowing through Funding Circle, it’s a good idea to get familiar with the website and watch a few auctions first. You can get an idea of the process and also the sort of questioning you may face from potential investors."
14,Will A Credit Cards Comparison Of New EU Rules On Interchange Fee Favour Amex Premium Credit Cards?,finance," EU rules targeting the interchange fee on premium credit cards have most rewards card lenders worried - everyone, except, maybe American Express (Amex). The new rules do not apply to all of Amex premium cards and even those that are impacted typically charge higher fees to the merchant to be accepted into the network in the first place. The charge card will often show up as a top pick for travellers and business people who want to have a rewards card that can offer a good network and a large variety of travel rewards, from worldwide comprehensive travel insurance to points for redeemable for gifts, travel, and entertainment. Will this card get an unfair advantage over other premium cards that will have to abide by a proposed cap on interchange fees thus limiting what they can offer? Initially, they may actually be one of the few 'safe' options out there, but that will surely change as they have to be as competitive with other lenders to keep operating a profitable business that attracts people to their credit offerings. The answer could be 'yes' If the proposal to limit the interchange fees applied to premium credit cards hit lenders, they will probably react by reducing the amount of rewards they offer on most cards. They may downgrade points or increase the amount of Avios necessary to collect a round-trip ticket. They might even decide to impose foreign transaction fees on those that currently do not do that to replace the lost fees. Either way, the money to support the rewards will have to come from somewhere or the lenders will have to revamp their programs. This could make the Amex cards, even though they are only charge and not credit cards more appealing to travellers still looking for generous travel reward cards as they aren't directly impacted by the new regulations. However, just because the new rules may not apply to them does not mean they won't be affected as other creditors take steps to comply with the capping of the interchange fee. Or, it could be 'no' However, don't believe that Amex is immune to what goes on in the marketplace. For one, if merchants are upset about paying interchange fees and instigated this regulation to reduce them, there's no guarantee they will continue to take Amex's higher fees to be on their network, too. They may just decide to leave the network entirely, thus reducing the number of places a consumer can use the Amex card when travelling. Even if they keep them in their network, Amex may be forced to reduce their fees to remain competitive in the marketplace as consumers seek online through credit cards comparison sites. They may even reason that if they don't do it now on a voluntary basis and in the manner that they want to see to happen, then the regulatory engine may target them next for financial reform. Thus, they may also end up having to reduce their rewards program in line with the type of fees the new market will support. What about 'maybe'? It's still possible that credit card issuers come up with a scheme of their own to save a lucrative rewards system from crumbling for lack of fees. The customers who get a variety of credit cards enjoy the air mile and point schemes and would be very unhappy to see them go. They also have served as a valuable incentive to promote spending in the economy, which helps to keep the economic engine humming and business strong in the credit card industry. Don't assume that premium rewards cards are going the way of the dinosaur just yet. For one thing, the top tier premium rewards cards will never go away and will always continue to offer rewards that distinguish them from regular credit cards. Maybe the annual fees will go up and maybe the rewards structure will change dramatically, but it's not likely they will want to eliminate a program that has been profitable for many years and highly popular with credit card holders. Even so, consumers who hold current rewards cards may want to think twice before closing accounts as there may end up being fewer good offers on the market later on, depending on whether the proposal passes or not."
15,How to Maximize the Way You Use Your Visa Credit Card,finance," Using credit cards poorly has the potential to sink you into debt and rack up enormous interest fees. But used correctly and conscientiously, you can reap the many benefits of spending on a credit card while staying debt-free. These tips will help you maximize the benefits of your Visa credit card and any other cards you have in your wallet. Freebies To encourage you to sign up, many credit card companies offer freebies once you've spent a specified amount on your card. These perks include such benefits as points toward a free flight or vouchers for online shopping. Use your card for normal spending, but to avoid the interest rates, pay it off in full every month. Extended Warranties Many credit card companies offer free one-year extended warranties on electronics and other major purchases. Diligent credit cards comparison will ensure you get the best warranty deals available, potentially saving you a great deal of money on product repairs and replacement. Consumer Protection Under the Section 75 law, if you spend a minimum of £100 on a product from a company that disappears soon after, your lender is liable for refunding your money if something goes wrong with the product and you are unable to contact the company from which you purchased the item. Use your card to make major purchases, but only if you have the cash up front to pay off the balance in full to avoid paying interest fees that will add up to much more than the product is worth. Purchase Protection Many credit cards offer some sort of protection against items purchased on the card that are lost or stolen within a certain amount of time after purchase. Know which of your credit cards offer this protection, and use those cards for purchasing items that are frequently stolen, such as bicycles or personal electronics. Boost Your Credit Score If you have less-than-stellar credit, you can use your credit card to vastly improve your credit rating. Spend only what you can afford to pay back each month, especially if you have very poor credit and an easy-to-get credit card, most of which have astronomical interest rates. Pay your balance in full and on time each month and watch your credit score increase. Make Money with Your Card If you are debt-free and have a good credit score, you can potentially make extra money from your credit card. Many credit card companies offer 0% interest cards to new customers for a specified period of time. By making all of your purchases on the card and keeping the cash you would have spent in a high-interest savings account, you can rack up a good amount of money while paying only the minimum amount due on the card each month. But beware: if you miss a payment, you could lose the 0 percent interest. Making money off of your credit card is called ""stoozing,"" and you should only do it if you're disciplined enough to make your minimum payments on time every month. Get Cheap Loans Some credit cards offer new cardholders the ability to transfer cash into your bank account as a loan so that you owe the money to the card. If your credit card has very low interest, it's probably lower than the cheapest loan available through a bank. However, you need to be disciplined enough that you repay the loan over a fixed amount of time, since the credit card will only require the minimum monthly payment. Decide how soon you want to repay the loan then set up a direct debit to pay it off. Get Cash Back When you're in the market for a new credit card, comparisons of different cards is essential to ensure you get the best deal available. Opt for a card that offers a certain percentage of cash back on purchases made on the card. If you use the card for normal purchases, such as gas, groceries and other typical expenses, you can get quite a bit of cash back. Again, paying the entire balance when your credit card bill arrives is important to avoid paying interest on your purchases, which can quickly negate the cash back you receive. Whether you carry a Visa credit card or a variety of other cards, knowing the terms, conditions and benefits of all of your cards is important for getting the best deals and the most savings out of your card."
16,How Offset Mortgages Work for Fixed and Tracker Mortgages,finance," For consumers who are looking to save money on their home loans, the first option is usually to opt for a home loan that offers the lowest interest rate. While this path works well for those that want to limit themselves to the standard products currently on the market, a home loan option that more and more people are considering is an offset mortgage. With these loans consumers offset the value of the loan with another investment, such as savings in a current a account. While offsetting was previously considered a niche product, with Bank of England interest rates currently so low, this product is gaining in popularity with more and more homebuyers. As a result, many lenders are now offering offset home loans that are increasingly competitive and also more affordable for the average homebuyer. This article will discuss what offset home loans are, and what their advantages and disadvantages are. Offsetting When consumers take out a standard loan on their property, they typically expect to pay a certain interest rate for the entire sum borrowed. So a £100,000 loan with an APR of five per cent will see the borrower paying £5,000 per year in interest on that loan. Offset loans, however, work a bit differently. With these loans, the borrower can still take out the same £100,000 loan, but he would then offset that loan with whatever savings he has, such as a current account or, in some cases, an Isa. As a result, he will no longer earn interest from his savings, but he will be able to reduce his interest payments on his offset mortgage. For example, that same borrower with a £100,000 loan who offsets it with £25,000 in savings would effectively only pay interest on £75,000 of the loan. Advantages Since current Bank of England interest rates are extremely low, most consumers are making even less than the rate of inflation on the savings they have in their current accounts. In contrast, interest rates on home loans are typically much higher than the Bank of England rate, meaning sacrificing the interest from savings for the sake of paying less in interest rates on a home loan makes financial sense for many people. Additionally, since the interest made on current accounts is taxable, homeowners will effectively be able to avoid paying tax on those savings by using that account to offset a home loan. Finally, in most instances monthly repayments are based on the total value of the loan, meaning that even though that same homeowner is only paying interest on £75,000 of a £100,000 loan, he will still be making repayments based on the full £100,000. As a result, he will in effect be able to pay down his loan faster. Disadvantages While an offset loan can be a great way to pay less in interest, it is not necessarily for everybody. As with standard home loans, offset loans are available as either fixed-rate or tracker mortgages. The difference, however, is that the interest rates are usually slightly higher for an offset loan than they would be for a standard loan. As a result, an offset loan is likely to work best for those who have a large amount of savings that they want to use as an offset. While many tracker mortgages, and even some fixed-rate loans, will offer attractive rates to begin with, it is important to keep in mind that these are typically introductory offers. Once that introductory period ends consumers could be stuck with an interest rate that is uncompetitive even with a large offset. Also, while consumers will still be able to access their savings, they need to be aware that if they withdraw money from their savings then the amount offset against their loan will likewise decrease. Finally, there are often additional restrictions, such as high minimum deposits and rules stipulating that the account that is being used to offset the loan must be held with the same lending institution that is offering the loan. While offset home loans are not necessarily for everyone, consumers who have a large or even moderate amount of savings should be aware of them. In the past few years, these loans have become increasingly affordable and are now available to anyone that wants to make sure their money is working a little bit harder."
17,Comparing Energy Costs Between MPs and Average Householders,finance," Due to the price increases in the UK, many householders can expect their bills to be an average of £1,465. Unfortunately, such an increase means that many families will struggle to stay warm in the UK this winter. Yet while people struggle to ration their energy for the colder months, it has recently come into light that 340 MPs have been paying the gas and electricity bills for their second homes with parliamentary expenses. The Investigation According to a Sunday Mirror investigation, MPs have claimed a total of £200,000 of public money in a year for their energy bills. The official reports show that 41 MPs submitted claims costing more than £1,000 while 78 claimed £500 in the 12 months up to March of this year. Here is a list of just some of the claims: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi made the top of the list with his claim of £5,822 in just 12 months for his Warwickshire home. Andrew Robathan (ex-Minster of State for Armed Forces) claimed £4,586.80 for his energy costs. Ex-Labour Cabinet Minister Peter Hain made a claim of £4,571 on a second home in his South Wales constituency. Dame Margaret Beckett claimed £3,960 for her gas and electricity bill on her constituency home. Old Etonian Hugo Swire claimed £3,198 on gas and oil on his second home. Conservative Elizabeth Truss claimed £2,579 for gas and electricity. Culture Secretary Maria Miller made a claim of £2,011 on her electricity bill on a constituency home that she rents. It should be known that some of the MPs have defended their claims. For instance, Dame Margaret Beckett has stated that her claim was so high due to ""ill health in her family"" and having to stay in the home longer and have the heating up higher. The Outrage Although MPs have claimed £23m in personal expenses this period, it's the £200k spent on electricity bills that's causing the uproar. When you compare energy costs for the average householder (an expected £1,465), it's very easy to see why so many people are outraged. Given that Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi's bill alone is over four times the national average, and that it's being paid by taxpayers, it's hard to justify such costs when so many families are struggling. While claiming gas and electricity expenses is within the MPs' limits, many people believe that using their money to pay costly bills is morally wrong. For instance, the maximum that an MP can claim for a second home allowance in a year is £20,100. The figure includes claims for rent, hotel stays, service charges, council tax, phone, Internet, and gas and electricity. Yet, with 310 MPs not claiming fuel expenses because they feel it's the right thing to do, why did 340 go ahead and opt for free fuel? The public especially believes that many MPs are out of touch with the struggles of everyday people. In fact, new research shows that 8 of 10 households will need to ration their energy this winter. An influential campaign group also points out that 200 pensioners a day could die this winter because of being unable to heat their homes. Unfortunately, a majority of the government's responses on the topic of millions people being unable to pay their bills include simply wearing jumpers (Energy Secretary Ed Davey) or shutting your curtains (Deputy Chairman of the Tory Party Sarah Newton). Another piece of popular advice is to compare energy costs between suppliers and switch over when necessary. Yet, with major fuel suppliers increasing their prices by as much as 8.2% (SSE) to 10.4% (Npower) in November and December of this year, learning how to compare energy costs may be difficult. With four of the Big Six increasing their prices, the fear is that other firms will quickly follow in their footsteps. Ultimately, given that 340 claimed taxpayer money to pay their own bills, many people feel that it is all too easy to see why very little is being done about fuel poverty. To be expected, many taxpayers feel bitter toward government representatives in light of the new information. While some are hoping that the facts and figures will help make changes for the better regarding fuel poverty, others are less optimistic."
18,5 Smart Strategies to Eliminate Your Credit Card Debt,finance," The excitement of making just the minimum payment on your credit card balance only lasts a while. Millions of Brits, who carry a balance, discover the danger of minimum payments after they feel the sting of the accompanying rotating charge.  According the latest statistics, the average UK household owes £6,020 in debt. Such a debt would take 291 months to pay off and cost £8,453.00 in interest if you paid only the minimum payment. Even if you had a legitimate reason for accumulating high-interest debt, your top priority must be to pay it off. Start with a solid debt reduction plan and stick with it until you're debt free. Here are five strategies for eliminating credit card debt. Target one card at a time If you owe money on multiple cards, it will take a while to wipe out all the debt. It's hard to see the horizon and stay motivated when you have years of credit card payments ahead of you. Give yourself a boost by paying off one card. Target the card with the lowest balance and put as much money into your payments as you can afford until you've cleared the balance. Alternatively, you can target the card with the highest utilization rate (your balance/card's limit) and pay it off. Clearing the balance will give your spirits and your credit score an instant boost since credit utilization directly impacts your score. Negotiate a lower interest rate with your creditors Although lenders are usually reluctant to negotiate reduced interest rates, it's still worth a try. If you have a decent credit score and have been responsible with your payments and card use, the lender might consider your request. Reducing your interest by one or two percentage points can lead to hundreds of pounds saved every year. Compare rates and get offers from competing lenders to bring to the negotiation. Your lender might the willing to match the offer. Take note: Your creditor will need to review your credit report before they make a decision, and they could reduce your card's credit limit if they don't like what they see. Transfer your balance A growing number of consumers are surfing their credit card balances from one card to another in order to get the best interest rates. While that could potentially lead to hundreds of pounds in savings, there are risks involved if you don't plan ahead. Balance transfers are only effective if you commit to repaying the transferred balance within the introductory low rate period. That will give you 12-30 months, depending on the card. After that, the rates will go up, and you'll be forced, once again, to pay high interest rates. Important: Balance transfer cards should only be used for paying off debt, not making new purchases. So don't use the card for shopping, as the low interest rates may not apply to new purchases. Also, most lenders charge a balance transfer fee, so factor that into your costs when you're comparing cards. Get a loan If you're falling under the burden of high interest rates, consider borrowing money to pay off your cards. Your friends and family may be willing to help. But if not, banks and peer-to-peer lenders offer loans with fixed interest rates that are 20-30 times lower than credit cards. That means you could save hundreds in interest on your debt. If you have excellent credit and a stable salary, you could qualify for loans with competitive interest rates. Pay the minimum If you're cash strapped, you can always pay the minimum, but try to make two minimum payments within the month. Interest is accrued on a daily basis, so earlier payments will reduce your average daily balance and your interest charges. Keep up with the minimum payments twice a month until your debt is paid off. Spiraling interest rates make it a challenge to pay off debt. Ideally, you should not incur it in the first place, but life is all about learning from your mistakes. The tried-and-true methods listed above should help you to develop your battle plan for tackling your debt. Remember, the most valuable instrument in this battle is your commitment to your financial goals."
19,Travel Money Saving Using Credit Cards,finance," The convenience of using credit cards on travel can be outweighed by the costs if you do not use them wisely, but if you select the best card for travel and use it well, the savings can be considerable. Here are some tips for ensuring you are making the most of your travel money and using your credit cards well. Do the Research Even if you are happy with your credit card, it still pays dividends to do some research because the best credit card for use in the UK is often not the best choice for when you travel abroad and domestic cards often add on loading and foreign exchange charges. There are many websites that enable you to compare the credit cards available, including money.co.uk and moneysupermarket.com. Pay Bills in Full Most credit cards only charge interest if you do not pay the bill on time and in full, so keeping abreast of the bills will save you a lot of money. Many credit cards especially designed for travel purposes will still charge interest on cash withdrawals even if you do pay the bill in full, so check the conditions of your card before you travel and select a new one or adjust the way you access money. While you are travelling, make sure you can still pay your bill on time to avoid interest charges. Many providers allow you to pay online. If you cannot manage to pay the bill in full at least try to pay off more than the minimum. Interest Rate/APR Current interest rates in the UK tend to be in single digits, so if you are paying over about 12% you are probably paying too much. The APR (annual percentage rate) is an annual rather than monthly figure and includes many of the fees (but not cash advances), and so is a good figure to use for comparing one credit card against another and ensuring your card is best for your purposes. If you have had your credit card for some time and think you are paying too much interest, talk to the bank as many are flexible and may reduce your APR in order to keep you as a customer. Load/Foreign Exchange Many credit cards, especially those meant primarily for domestic use, charge a load over and above the foreign exchange rate when transactions are made abroad, and this can add up to quite a lot over a period of travel even when transaction amounts are small. It can pay to have a separate card specifically for travel, and there are several cards available, such as Capital One and Saga, that are geared towards travellers and have zero percent load. No Cash Advances You will need some foreign currency in cash when you travel, but it is usually better not to get it via a cash advance on your credit card because the fees can be quite high and many travel credit cards charge you interest on the cash advance even if you pay the bill in full. Cover Emergencies Without Credit If something goes wrong while you are travelling abroad, it can be tempting to charge the costs to the credit card and hope to pay it off eventually. If you cannot cover the cost and pay the bill in full, it could cost you a great deal in interest and it may be some time before you can pay off the full amount. It is better to have contingency plans that do not involve taking on more credit, and this means having a travel budget that is reasonable and has margins for the unexpected, and ensuring you are adequately covered by insurance. Rewards Many credit cards offer rewards that are useful for travellers, and these can be a good way of securing travel money savings. Rewards can be in the form of travel miles, or discounts on everything from flights to hotels and restaurants. One drawback with rewards is that interest rates are often higher than they are for cards that do not offer rewards, and so they only make sense if you are certain you can always pay the bill in full and on time, even when you are travelling."
20,Top 5 Myths About Credit Card Sign Up Bonuses,finance," A credit card is just a credit card until you take all those flashy sign-up bonuses into account. Bonuses add new meaning to earning rewards. Consumers can't wait to get them and credit card companies use them to differentiate their offerings. Creditors claim to have it all; except debt repayment plans and reduced interest rates. They promise vacation getaways and large bonus cheques, but those rewards come with strings attached. Sign-up bonuses are just their newest ploy to get you to spend more money. Once you're lured by the potential rewards, creditors hope that you'll carry over your balance and forget to cash in your bonus so they could slap you with high interest charges. Fortunately, you can beat the system and capitalize on sign-up bonuses. It all starts with separating fact from fiction. So here are the top five myths surrounding credit card sign-up bonuses. You're getting something for nothing Credit card companies spend a lot of money to earn your business. But the money they spend to offer those great sign-up bonuses are not acts of generosity; they'll cost someone in the long run. It's up to you to determine who pays. For instance, there are spending requirements that you have to meet before you receive the bonus. If you rack up debt and carry over the balance, you'll be forced to pay high interest charges. Depending on your balance and rate, your interest charges will pretty much exceed the cost of any bonus you receive. The only way you'll get something for nothing is to meet the spending requirements without going into debt and paying interest charges. Applying for credit card hurts your credit score Several factors are considered in the calculation of your credit score. A credit card helps your score by building your credit history and decreasing your credit utilization (debt to credit ratio). Some financial experts recommend that consumers carry at least six credit cards in order to build a stable financial profile. But since opening many cards in a short time can hurt your score, it's best to apply for the cards over time, and certainly not before you apply for a mortgage. Keep your credit card debt to a minimum and pay your bills on time. Those factors are way more valuable than having too many credit cards. You'll be stuck paying annual fees Expect to pay an annual fee of £35-£95 for your rewards credit card. The good news is that most creditors waive the fee for the first year. This will give you the chance to claim the bonuses without extra charges - you can cancel the card just before the next year's fee becomes due. Alternatively, you can ask your provider to waive the annual fee. They may be willing to consider your request if you've been a responsible cardholder. When comparing rewards credit cards, look for cards with no annual fees or cards where the benefits exceed the cost of the fee. It's the only way to ensure that your bonus points are truly rewarding. The process is too complicated Applying for a rewards credit card and earning bonus points couldn't be any easier. The Internet simplifies the process and places all the tools at your fingertips. Use consumer focused comparison sites to compare offers and find the best deals. Most sites provide details of the card's terms and conditions, so you can evaluate the terms and submit your application online. Activate the card, meet the spending requirements and wait for your bonuses. Don't forget to pay off your balance, and decide how and when you'll use the card in future. Sign-up bonuses are for everyone Sign-up bonuses are fantastic, but they're not for everyone. If you're paying interest on credit card debt, your focus should be on paying off your debt, not on earning rewards from another card. Pay off your debt and reward your efforts with sign-up bonuses after you've cleared your balance. Make credit cards work for you Credit cards are powerful but complex financial tools, and you shouldn't fall victim to popular myths when you're making a crucial financial decision. Understand the myths, use trusted sources to learn the truth, and make reward sign-up bonuses work for you."

1,How the Current Account Switch Guarantee Works,finance," Most people stick with the same current accounts that their parents opened for them. After all, any current account pretty much serves the same purpose as a convenient bank account for everyday usage. However, if you want your money to work for you in the best and most profitable way possible, you may want to consider taking advantage of the new current account switching service. The Current Account Switch Guarantee is something which almost every current account provider in the United Kingdom is now a member of. It provides a completely automated service by which the entire switchover is to be completed in exactly seven working days, or at any point after this should you specify a particular date. The following takes a more in-depth look into the process and how it works. Joining the New Bank Once you have chosen a new bank or building society to switch bank accounts over to, you will usually be able to complete most of the process online through the bank's website. You will not need to alert your old bank either, since both of the banks involved should corporate with one another to make sure that the switchover goes smoothly. During the first day, the process works as follows: You will need to sign a couple of forms - the Current Account Switch Guarantee form and the Current Account Closure form. You will be given the opportunity to choose a set date for switching over the accounts. This will need to be seven working days or longer after starting the process. The date you choose for the switchover will also need to be a working day. You will need to provide all of the necessary information required by the application form and ensure that this is all correct in order for the switchover to go smoothly. Information required will include details about your old current account, your income status and various other personal and financial information. Once you have completed the application, your new bank should send out a letter by post that day to confirm that the switching process has begun. Your new bank will contact your old bank and ask them provide a list of any standing orders or direct debits you currently have set up to make regular payments. Over the next six working days, you should not have to have any further dealings with either bank unless a problem arises, in which case your new bank should contact you promptly. Your new bank will set up your regular payments and transfer money from your previous account to your new one in order to pay them, should they need to be paid before the actual switchover is complete. You will be able to continue using your existing current account right up until the day of the switchover. Your new bank will order you a new debit card and set up any online banking facilities. They will provide you with all of the information you need to get started with managing and using your new bank account once the switchover is complete. On the final day, when your new account will be fully operational and ready to use, a few more things will occur: The new bank will contact you either by letter, phone or email to let you know that the switching process has been successfully completed. Any balance remaining in your previous current account will be automatically transferred to the new one, and the old account will be closed. Some banks will allow you to switch bank accounts even if you are overdrawn. However, if you are transferring an existing debt to the new current account, you should attempt to repay the overdraft as soon as possible, depending on the terms and conditions of the new bank. Over the following months (the exact period of time varies from one bank to the next), payments made to your old bank account should be automatically redirected to the new one. As you can see, the process requires minimal interaction from yourself, other than the filling in of a few forms. Thanks to this new service, now is the best time to switch bank accounts."
2,Happy New Year! Organize Your Finances with a Secured Loan,finance," The most popular New Year's resolutions are to lose weight, stop smoking, and get out of debt. While we can't address all of these in one article, we can explore how to organize your finances, the first step to getting out of debt. Counterintuitively, one way to address this issue is to consider a secured loan; however, many people do not know how to compare secured loans. What Caused the Debt? You cannot fix something if you don't understand how it became broken. Therefore, the first step on the road to recovery is tracking your behaviour to discover what caused the debt in the first place. •	Do you frequently make impulse purchases? •	Do you hate sacrifice? •	Do you reach for the credit card before considering cash? •	Do you feel the need to keep up appearances? •	Do you enjoy expensive toys, such as luxury automobiles? •	Do you simply love new things? You may find yourself in any of these categories, but to truly unearth the reasons behind your circumstances, you need to track your spending. You can do this by reviewing past months' credit card bills. You can evaluate what types of loans you have taken out. You can even spend a month entering every expenditure on a spread sheet. Whatever you do, you have to face the issues that have caused the problem and give each one a name. For example, if I buy too many clothes, I am a clothes horse. Once you give the problem a name, you can commit to change. What Behaviours Should Cease? First of all, you should immediately stop spending more money than you make. Here are some behaviours you can avoid that will help you meet that goal. •	Stop window shopping. While you are at it, stop going into stores when you don't need anything. •	Stop eating out. •	Stop carrying your credit card in your wallet. •	Eliminate things that are not necessary. For example, do you really need satellite radio? Can you bring your lunch to work and avoid the cafeteria? •	Immediately, throw away junk mail advertisements. •	Stop driving the latest automobile. What Behaviours Should Increase? One of the keys to success is positive thinking. Here are some positive ways to tackle the debt issue. •	Plan for expenses. •	Learn how to cook great meals. •	Contribute to your 401K account. •	Creatively find ways to have free fun. •	Get a library card. •	Read personal finance blogs, books, and newspaper articles. •	Scour grocery store advertisements and plan meals according to the sales. •	Make more money. A part time job can help you chip away at debt. How Can a Secured Loan Help? Making the minimum payment on several credit cards will never get their balances to zero. Taking out a secured loan and paying off your cards is one means of eliminating the burden of debilitating interest payments. Remember that secured loans are secured by your home, car, or other valuable possession. Therefore, you must make the monthly payment without fail. You cannot use a secured loan to organize your finances if you do not first make a clear budget and stick to it. In addition, you must immediately stop using credit cards. Otherwise, your secured loan will only exacerbate the problem. How to Compare Secured Loans Secured loans have many variables. You must compare the interest rates, the loan periods, and the payments. It is also a good idea to compare the reputations of different secured loan companies and choose one that is easy to work with. Naturally, you want a low interest rate. However, almost any secured loan interest rate will be less than the ones on your credit cards. A very important consideration is the loan's period. A 60-month loan will cost you far more in interest than a 12-month loan, for example. On the contrary, a 60-month loan will have lower payments, and that may be what your budget needs right now. Choosing the right secured loan is very important since its security is based on your valuable property. Make sure this is one loan that you will never default on, and you will be on track to have a new year with organized finances. The future looks bright. Now, about losing weight and putting down cigarettes, perhaps you should take on those issues next year."
3,An Overview of High-Interest Current Accounts in the UK,finance," For the most part, any current account serves precisely the same purpose. It is your everyday bank account for withdrawing money, receiving your monthly salary and paying your bills. However, there are some important differences between the numerous options available, and you should take these into consideration if you are considering taking advantage of the recently launched 7-day switching service. This new service allows you to easily switch to a new current account within seven working days. Previously, it could take anything up to a month. For the most part, the process is automated as well. You will be able to use your old bank account right up until the day of switching. When you are switched to the new current account, any balance is transferred along with any direct debits, standing orders or streams of income. There are various reasons to switch, and one of them is the recent launch of some high-interest current accounts from various banks and building societies in the United Kingdom. Interest rates on current accounts are practically non-existent in many cases, but now there are some offers promoting rates, subject to certain terms and conditions, of four percent or even more. The following takes a look at some of the best. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Current Account Direct Clydesdale Bank and its partner company, Yorkshire Bank provide their Current Account Direct bank accounts. Both banks provide an identical service with exactly the same set of terms and conditions. With a fixed interest rate of 4% AER until March, 2015, this current account is one of the best available in the country for those who want to earn interest on their money. After March, 2015, the interest rate drops to 2% AER. These rates are comparable, if not better than, those with typical Cash ISA savings accounts, making them ideal for those who are earning enough money to be able to take advantage of the service. In order to earn, you will need to have £1,000 or more going into your account every month. Interest is paid on up to £3,000 credit in your account. Nationwide FlexDirect Current Account The Nationwide Building Society has long offered some interesting alternatives those provided by banks in the UK. Its FlexDirect account provides the highest interest rates currently available with any bank account in the country. For any balances of up to £2,500, an interest rate of 5% AER is paid for the first twelve months from opening the account. You will need to be depositing at least £1,000 per month in order to be eligible, however. After the initial twelve months, this will decrease to a variable rate of one percent, and you will still need to be paying in £1,000 per month or more. The Nationwide FlexDirect account also offers some additional incentives, including a fee-free overdraft facility for the first year. However, after this period, there will be a 50p fee on any money withdrawn on the pre-arranged overdraft. The amount that you will be able to borrow is largely subject to your credit history and rating. Both online and mobile banking are supported, and free text alerts are provided whenever a payment is due. There are no monthly fees either. Santander Current Account With 1.8 million customers in the UK, Spain's Santander has grown considerably in recent years. They are currently offering a unique current account which combines both cashback features and high interest rates. You will be paid cashback on both your household bills and the remainder of your bank balance. However, there is a fee of £2 per month to keep this bank account open. Cashback promotions include 1% back on Santander mortgage payments, council tax and water bills, a 2% cashback on electricity and gas bills and a 3% cashback on mobile, broadband, telephone and television packages. Interest rates paid on credit in your account start at 1% for balances over £1,000, 2% on balances over £2,000 and 3% on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. To take advantage of these features, you will need to fund the account with at least £500 per month and set up two or more direct debits."
4,Tomorrow's Credit Cards are Already Going Nationwide and Worldwide,finance," Tomorrow's credit cards will be able to store more data and do more things than their ancestors could.  New technologies are already coming into use that promise to revolutionize the field and create the next generation of smart cards. From its humble beginnings, the printed plastic card has become one of the most essential, widely used tools of the electronic age.  In a world with an increasing number of accounts to balance, memberships to certify and other personal details to keep track of, these cards have gotten increasingly important.  The vanguard of a new army of personal cards is already in use, and a look at them will show what cards of the future will be like. Electronic parts have now gotten small and compact enough to fit on a plastic card, allowing data storage to go beyond traditional magnetic strips.  Those strips work well for small amounts of information such as identification codes and will probably be used well into the future for simple ID purposes, but for larger files, a computer chip is needed. A computer chip can hold an entire file and be updated anytime the user makes a change to it, allowing him to carry a current status report on his account.  An old-style magnetic strip card only carries the holder's ID code, and it usually cannot be changed. This is a fundamental change of technology, and while some card issuers have eagerly adopted it for nationwide or worldwide use, others have not.  The current model in the field is MiFare, a company using tiny chips built into the plastic of a card to hold updatable records.  Their early applications have been credit cards and security IDs. MiFare has obvious benefits for credit card customers, since it relieves them of the burden of keeping up with their expenditures.  As it is now, the customer does not have a running total of his credit card expenses, and he only gets one with his monthly statement.  When he's standing in a store looking at an item and wondering if he can afford it, there is nothing to tell him.  With MiFare, he can simply insert his card in a portable reader and see the total in his credit account.  If such a system is used properly, it can make accidental overcharges on a credit card obsolete. The system has such an obvious appeal for both the customer and the merchant that it will certainly become more widespread and eventually become standard.  The day when all credit card providers such as Nationwide or Citibank will include a MiFare chip on every card they issue. This technology is also being used for other fields, a practice that will continue and grow.  Medical patients with dangerous physical conditions often wear ID bracelets in case they are hospitalized for a debilitating incident, but these can only give emergency medical personnel the most basic information.  To obtain detailed records for the patient, hospital personnel must contact the health care providers who have been treating the patient and get the records faxed.  Precious minutes may be wasted while the information gets into the hands of those who can use it. If the patient's bracelet contains a chip similar to MiFare, it can hold his entire medical record.  It can be routinely updated every time treatment is given, so emergency care providers will know about all treatments the patient has received and what their outcome was.  If he is hospitalized in an unfamiliar facility, the staff can have his information in hand instantly, possibly making a crucial difference. The future of printed plastic cards will see them gaining more capabilities and data storage.  Financial cards are already being marketed with the ability to split a bill into parts, so nobody has to figure on a napkin anymore.  Functions such as price per item, discount calculation and recording bonus points are surely right around the corner. Futurists can envision smart cards capable of communicating with the company that issued them.  If a card is canceled and the customer does not know why, he can ask the card and get his answer straight from those who canceled it.  If there's been a mistake, the card can be remotely reinstated and made immediately usable again. Granted, these last predictions are still in the realm of science fiction, but given the amount of change already seen in this field, we can safely bet that they will appear sometime soon."
5,The Seven-Day Current Account Switch Service Explained,finance," On the sixteenth of September this year, the UK's Payments Council launched their new Current Account Switch Service.  This system has been implemented in order to simplify and speed up the old method of transferring a current account between banks or building societies.  So why has this scheme been introduced, what exactly does the Switch Guarantee cover, is it working well in its initial stages, and how do things look for the future of the new system? The New Current Account Switch Service Customers, small businesses, charities and trusts are able to use this service for free when they want to change their current account (or checking account) to a new financial institution.  The ease with which the process is designed to work is supposed to lead to more competition between banks and other financial providers like building societies.  The system should result in a wider choice for customers, and the opportunity for new financial institutions to start up in business and have a viable chance to generate a large customer base. The Independent Commission on Banking recommended two years ago that an initiative like this should come into play in the UK because most of the business was being attracted and held by the four big banks.  Changing banks was difficult, unreliable and slow, so a new process was designed to speed things up and limit the hassle. The Switch Guarantee The system is securely backed by both banks and building societies who are participating in the Current Account Switch Guarantee.  This allows customers to choose their own switching date, and promises to take care of everything else within seven days as opposed to the usual eighteen to thirty day timeframe. Payments both going out and coming in will be managed by the new provider, any funds in the previous account will be transferred on the switch date, and accidental payments made to the old account will automatically be transferred to the new account for thirteen months after the account has been opened.  Senders of incorrect payments will be notified of the customer's new account details. If problems of any sort arise during the seven day transition period, the customer will be contacted before the set date of the switch.  If difficulties occur and there is a loss to the account holder, any interest (lost or paid) will be refunded, as well as charges incurred on either the previous or new account relating to the problem. For those wanting to change financial providers for their current account, the system has been strongly marketed as hassle-free, to the extent that the customer doesn't even have to notify their bank that they are going to switch to another one.  The new provider does everything on their client's behalf.  Some banks are happy to process all the information online, and a new card and PIN number are sent to the customer, making the change as painless as possible. How Is The New Switch System Going? After a month of the Current Account Switch System, the figures showed that 89,000 current accounts have been transferred to a new provider.  Looking back at the same month last year, this shows an increase of just 11% in the number of switches.  If the rate of account transfers continues like this over the coming year, the results will only be slightly higher than for 2012. Questions may be asked about whether or not the Payment Council's £750 million investment in planning, implementing and advertising the scheme is really worth it.  However, considering the fact that the system is still in its initial stages, it isn't possible to predict the growth of account switching for the future just yet. The public may decide that the ease of transferring accounts and the competition between financial providers gives enough incentive to make a change, particularly if people are already unhappy with their bank's service. Looking Ahead To The Future Once the Current Account Switching Service has established itself over the next few months, it will be time to see if customers have found that the process actually is easy and fast.  It will be interesting to note if competition between financial providers increases enough for customers to continue taking the plunge and handing over current accounts to take advantage of another institution's benefits."
6,Considering Pre-Paid Credit Cards,finance," Pre-paid credit cards are available from most banks and other financial institutions that offer standard credit cards to consumers. You can also purchase pre-paid cards at some large retailers. Although most consumers prefer to carry standard cards, a pre-paid card might be a valuable addition to your financial portfolio. Like other types of cards, these cards have both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of Pre-Paid Cards This type of card is available to anyone regardless of credit history. This is because instead of the issuer extending credit to you, your purchase amounts are deducted from funds you load onto the card. If you do not have sufficient funds in your card account, the issuer will simply decline the charge request. Because you do not need a good credit score to qualify for a pre-paid card, this can provide you with credit card access even if you have made late payments or other credit mistakes on other accounts in the past. It prevents you from accumulating debt that you cannot repay. Because you are limited to the amount you have loaded onto the card, you can ensure that your purchases will not put you in jeopardy of default. This can be a significant advantage if you are living on a tight budget and do not want the added expense of credit card payments and interest charges. A pre-paid card reduces or eliminates the need for carrying cash. If your cash is lost or stolen, you have little recourse to recover your money - in most cases, it is gone forever. By carrying a pre-paid card instead of cash, you have a level of security to protect your money. If your card is stolen or lost, you would simply need to report the loss to your card issuer. The company would then freeze the account to prevent another person from accessing your available funds. Using a pre-paid card instead of cash also makes purchases more convenient - in most cases, you can check out more quickly with a card than you could by paying with cash. Carrying pre-paid cards can shield you against financial disaster while you are on a holiday or business trip. It can prevent you from spending more than you intended so that you won't worry about how you will repay your debt when you return home. Also, you have the ability to freeze the funds in the event of card theft or loss. Even if another person is able to make purchases with the card before you contact the issuer, your liability would be limited to the amount you have loaded onto the card. This can provide a safe way to access funds while you travel without the risk of a thief amassing exorbitant charges in your name. Disadvantages of Pre-Paid Cards Not all retailers and servicers accept these cards as payment. Typically, you cannot use a pre-paid card to pay for a car rental, airline ticket, or cruise ticket. Likewise, some utility companies do not accept these cards for invoices. Companies also do not accept these cards for services and products that must be paid for on an ongoing subscription basis. It is important to check with a servicer or retailer before you rely on a pre-paid account to pay for a purchase. A pre-paid account might not help you build a solid credit history. Many issuers do not report timely payments to the major credit bureaus, which means that you do not have the opportunity to establish the credit history to qualify for cards, credit lines, loans, and mortgages in the future. This can be a significant disadvantage if you have not established a credit history or are attempting to repair your credit. Ask the issuer about reporting before you apply for a pre-paid card. You will not have access to incentives and rewards available through standard card issuers. Some companies provide incentives such as cash back and rewards points to standard cardholders. Applying for a pre-paid card prevents you from taking advantage of rewards that could save you money or allow you to accumulate credits for special purchases. Even with the disadvantages of pre-paid credit cards, the benefits make carrying this type of card worthwhile. At the very least, it gives you a convenient payment option when you don't want to use a standard card for everyday or travel purchases."
7,Three 3 Steps Concerning Divorce and Finances,finance," It is a reality that couples disputing over money are the primary reason couples’ divorce. It’s disappointing because there are ways to avoid these disagreements. Reducing the reasons for disputes increases the longevity of marriages. The persistent reasons for divorce over money are as follows: Couples don’t know their spouses money story A spouse doesn’t know where they are financially Financial disloyalty I describe the reasons couples’ divorce in the bullet points below: Spouses' don’t know the money history of their partners: Whether we aware or not, all of us are a compilation of affirmative and challenging money experiences. Some money occasions are conscious and more stressful than others so acknowledge these moments. Others are unconscious and have subtle influence, so we are unaware that they are controlling our monetary choices unconsciously. The force of an individual operating subconsciously based on their money history is a sizeable situation but having two people performing from this position magnifies issues between couples. This situation creates most of the reasons couples’ divorce. Although it may feel uneasy, I constantly suggest that couples take time to discover and share their experiences about money from their childhood and their perception of money issues. Having this knowledge will help you see each other’s side and avoid detrimental confrontations that can destroy your relationship. Spouses don’t know their financial position: Knowing your cash flow is an essential step of an enthused money management system and a smart financial foundation. Yet, when couples/individuals don’t know their financial standing, this area becomes agitated and overpowering. At times individuals: Purposely mask their finances are in a financial mess and confusion so realizing the whole financial state is an issue haven’t consciously agreed on their ambitions so they use their money in different directions that don’t support what the relationship is to demonstrate/ Below are three reasons that complications and confrontational energy happen in a financial discussion. These three scenarios above can autonomously alter a couple’s aptitude for a frank financial dialogue. At times, all three situations can materialize building emotional flare-ups and confusion. This is when spouses' get quiet entirely fearful to be open because their partner may not understand what their saying or it will more arguments. If you and your spouse are in conflict over money, my advice is to search how you can connect respectfully in a discussion. Start with the plan to grow the financial area of your relationship. Join your spouse in a conversation actively listening to what they have to say about money. Keep in mind the above process needs time to see results. I assure you this will lead to a well-built and unwavering financial plan that guides you to a competent life of financial independence."
8,Change Your Thinking to have Financial Security,finance," To create a stable financial foundation, it is important to review your past remembering your restraining opinions and worries around money. Reviewing your financial history and thinking patterns will help you identify the blockages to your financial security. Being mindful of your financial obstacles gives you the opportunity figure out when you accepted these thoughts. It will also help you eventually reconfigure your financial plan to be financially secure. It's astonishing that people are repressed by restricting anxieties and views about money. This understanding of money has been rooted in us from our experiences, environment and what we were told about money. I use a three step process to help my clients understand their money attitude. The three steps are realization, perception and remodeling. The first step is to become conscious of your money mental blocks. The next step is to comprehend when and where these beliefs started. After you have determined what the limits are and their origin, the final step is restructuring that specific thought to an affirmative view. Below is an outline of three steps to uncover past experiences that may be replaying in your sub consciousness. Familiarize yourself with your money background: Working with clients, I request straightforward explanations to intriguing questions regarding money in their childhood and how money has come to them in the present. Ask yourself the questions below to help pinpoint contrary beliefs that may be hindering your progress. What is the money history from your childhood? What did you observe, experience or 	listen to regarding money? Who taught you about money? Who was the significant person that affected your 	thinking about money? Comprehend the effect your money history has on you currently: After classifying your past experiences and observations about money, you will next review the way this story influence your money actions and decisions. Ask the next questions below. In what ways did past money experiences and observations appear in your current behavior? This includes, monetarily, your feelings, materially, faith or religion. It also 	includes any other affects these moments have had on your present life. What is the bottom-line idea in the money story? Some examples are: I don’t manage money well. Too much money will decrease my faith. I dislike people that have lots of money. Doing work you enjoy will not make you wealthy. Recondition your behavior: After becoming knowledgeable of your money history and it’s affect on your current actions, you are now ready to reorganize your thinking. One of the best methods to re-program your thinking is by placing a rubber band on your wrist and snapping yourself for every negative thought that surfaces in your mind regarding money. This works because you become upset and sore from this action. In case you want a milder path, keep a journal to record of every negative thought and prove why it’s false. Write down the instances, where your life has demonstrated the opposite. Being completely honest, I went through this process a few times discovering deterring beliefs about money that I have accepted subconsciously through life. My parents gave me excellent money management knowledge and also implanted that financial security derives from money earned and perks. Basically, being an employee provides financial security - but this belief is not supportive for a business owner. I changed my thoughts to believe that I could depend on myself. This practice of analyzing your money beliefs can be more significant than creating a financial plan or knowing your current financial position to decrease debts and accumulate wealth. You need a strong financial foundation which is your conscious and sub conscious state of mind."
9,Making Your Home Safer to Get the Best Home Insurance Offers,finance," Losing your home or having it severely damaged by flood, fire or any other disaster is tragic enough, but imagine having to foot the entire cost of rebuilding yourself. For most of us, our homes are the most valuable possessions that we will ever have, so home insurance is absolutely essential. If you have a mortgage on your home, the lender will require that you have buildings insurance at the very least, since they will also want to protect their investment. Only tenants, and in some cases, leaseholders don't need to worry about buildings insurance, although they will likely still want to take out a contents insurance policy to cover their possessions. When searching for the best home insurance offers, you will need to familiarize yourself with the various factors which govern the cost of the premiums. For a start, if your home is safer and properly secured, insurance companies will see your case as less risky and be much more likely to give you a better deal. In fact, insurance companies tend to have strict rules regarding things like home security and fire alarms. The following takes a look at how you can make your home safer and more secure, and ultimately, more insurable. How to Make Your Home Safer Your insurer will require that your home meets certain safety standards. This applies to both contents and buildings insurance. If your home does not meet the standards required by the insurance company, they may refuse to pay out when you make a claim. For example, you will usually have to install a smoke alarm on every floor in your home. To ensure that they continue to meet the safety standards of the United Kingdom, they will also need to be professionally checked and tested on a yearly basis. If they fail to work in the event of a house fire due to not being maintained, you may have a problem getting money from your insurance company. Your insurance company may also require that you have a professional inspect your boiler and heating system, particularly if you have a gas supply to your home. Make certain that you review the policy wording thoroughly to determine what is required on your part to make your home meet the necessary safety standards. How to Secure Your Home Just as your home will need to meet the safety standards required by your insurance company, it will also need to meet various security standards. When taking out a contents insurance policy, you will often be required to install a burglar alarm, although this may also depend on where you live. Some companies are stricter than others and may even require you to install locks on the windows. Additionally, not many policies will cover you for walk-in thefts due to forgetting to lock the door. For this reason, it might be a good idea to get a door which locks automatically when you close it. You will usually be at a higher risk of walk-in thefts when living in shared accommodation, and for this reason, you will usually need to take out a special policy. It also shouldn't come as any surprise that an empty home is at a higher risk of being burgled. For this reason, insurance companies are not likely to cover you if you spend more than a certain amount of time away from your home. A standard policy will typically require that you do not leave your home empty for more than a month at a time. If you spend a lot of time away, you will need to inform your insurance company and see what they can do for you. Emergency Cover Options There are a lot of extras available for most insurance policies. These include emergency cover options which cover you for specific problems such as plumbing disasters, roof damage, electrical failure and more. Some insurers, such as the AA, offer an emergency response service which provides prompt help in a wide range of situations such as heating failure, emergency repairs and various other situations. Although sometimes considered a bit of a luxury, the peace of mind can make it worth the expense."
10,Low Cost Home Insurance For Home Swaps,finance," If you are thinking of cutting holiday costs by exchanging homes with someone from a part of the world you want to visit, you are part of a growing trend. In theory, the only cost involved will be your plane fare. In practice, though, there may be other costs. There is a risk that your swap partners may not take good care of your home, and they may even cause damage, or be dishonest enough to steal your personal property. How can you protect yourself against that risk? Insurers are wary of any non-standard situations and clearly if your house is going to be occupied by people who are strangers to you, that’s not standard. Check your insurance cover, and bear in mind the following: You need to tell your insurer about your plans. They may or may not be prepared to extend cover to your situation, but there’s no point in putting your head in the sand. You need to know whether you are actually covered or not rather than finding out the hard way when you try to make a claim. Some insurance companies will be quite happy to continue cover as long as the house is occupied, since it’s less vulnerable to burglaries. But there will be exclusions from cover. Theft and damage to your personal belongings won’t be covered by a standard policy during a house swap. Generally, your insurance policy will cover you for theft of items inside the home only if there is evidence of a break-in. Low cost home insurance policies go even further and often insist on high quality locks being in place and in use when the theft takes place. If you leave your home in the hands of a stranger, theft by that stranger will not normally be covered. If your general company won’t insure you even in return for an increased premium, you can go to a specialist in home swap insurance. Some home swap agencies have links with specialist insurers. For example the agency, Love Home Swap, has worked with the insurance brokers, Insurance Tailors, and insurers, Hiscox, to bring out a product that’s designed to supplement your normal household policy for the duration of the swap. The policy, introduced in December 2012, covers the heads of damage which a standard insurance company is unlikely to look at, such as damage or theft of items of personal property during the swap. Malicious damage is also covered. In the case of a house swap, particularly if it’s a longer one, identity theft is a risk which should be guarded against. After all, the swap partner will be in your home, and potentially could set up all sorts of accounts from that address to establish a fake identity. There have been instances of that happening, but subsequent problems have generally been solved by the home owner establishing that he or she has nothing to do with the fraudulent accounts. Banks are usually happy to help put things right if they are satisfied that you are a fraud victim, as long as they do not suspect negligence or collusion. But they will expect you to take care of your papers and store them securely. The true nightmare situation, where a homeowner returns from a home swap holiday to find that their swap partner has assumed their identity, sold their house, and disappeared with the proceeds, seems to be more of an urban myth than anything else, though there’s no doubt that the scenario is within the bounds of possibility. A successful UK TV drama was based on this plotline in 2002, but happily no copycat crimes have been reported. Nonetheless, it’s obviously common-sense to make sure that any documents which could be used to establish identity, all bank account statements, other financial papers and the deeds to the house should be securely stored during the house swap."
11,How Home Renovations Can Affect Home Insurance Costs,finance," UK homeowners love to remodel their homes, with reports suggesting that up to 90 per cent of all homeowners in the UK have carried out renovations on their properties in the past five years. While home renovations can be an exciting way to add value and extra comfort to a home, many fail to realize that such work could significantly impact home insurance costs. In fact, many people who are carrying out such renovations could inadvertently be invalidating their insurance policy outright. Other problems, such as hiring uncertified labour and adjusting important home security systems during renovation can also affect insurance premiums. Knowing how home improvement projects cause insurance premiums to change is essential before undertaking any major renovation. This article will look at how renovations and extensions to a home affect insurance and what homeowners should do to make sure they are adequately covered. Invalidated Policies According to Property Wire, 52 per cent of individuals who carry out major extensions to their property fail to inform their insurance providers that they are doing so. This situation has created a major problem for many people, most of whom do not realize the level of financial insecurity they have exposed themselves to. Because of these daunting statistics, up to a third of these people may be paying for a home insurance policy which is no longer valid. The reason is because a home insurance policy is based around the current structure of a property; whenever any changes to that property are made, the previous policy is no longer valid for that property. After all, since the value of a property increases after renovation, the rebuild value (upon which insurance premiums are calculated) also increases. This potential for having an invalid policy is especially true if a load bearing wall is removed or the doors and windows of a property are significantly altered. Increased Premiums While some insurance policies will take into account renovation work, most won’t, especially if the house is being altered in any major way. Thus, it is extremely important for homeowners to always check their insurance policy before carrying out any work. Even certain aspects of a renovation that may not be considered by the homeowner at first could significantly impact his premiums. For example, if, during a home extension, the security or fire alarm system has to be removed, then the insurance provider needs to be notified. Most insurance providers offer discounted premiums to customers with security systems installed on their properties, meaning that if any damage happens to the property while those systems are disabled then the owner may find it impossible to make a claim. What to know during renovation While renovations to a property can be exciting, they also expose a house to increased risk of damage. Because most home insurance policies will not cover damage to a property incurred during renovation work, it is vital to get extra cover in the form of accidental damage. Accidental damage will cost a fair bit extra, but it is well worth the investment to make sure a homeowner’s renovation project doesn’t end up costing him more than he can afford. Additionally, while many UK homeowners prefer to rely on cash labour for home projects, this situation could become costly if anything goes wrong. Without adequate paperwork for the labour involved, it will be almost impossible to make a claim should the professionals hired end up damaging the property. Also, it is vital to make sure that the professionals hired for the project are certified, and homeowners should also have liability insurance to protect them from potential lawsuits that could develop should a worker be injured on the construction site. A home renovation should be a chance to make a property a better place to live in and easier to sell should the need arise. Without adequate home insurance cover, however, such renovations could quickly turn into a very expensive nightmare. Projects of this sort can have a significant impact on home insurance costs, and failing to notify a provider about such projects could invalidate a policy. For the best peace of mind, homeowners should be clear about what their current policy does and doesn’t cover, and they should always get the protection they need before embarking on any major home improvement work."
12,How to Use the EPC Register to Save Money,finance," The EPC Register website at epcregister.com enables you to access, download and print the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for your property (provided an energy assessment has been carried out and a certificate exists). The EPC report includes information on your property's energy efficiency and details on how you can improve the efficiency and hence reduce the running costs. There is also a dedicated section on the EPC Register website called the EPC Adviser that allows you to investigate various energy-saving options and calculate how much money implementing them is likely to save you. Energy Performance Certificate An Energy Performance Certificate is required for every existing property in the UK that is being sold or let, and for every new, converted, re-purposed, or modified property. These certificates are available for download in pdf format from the EPC Register website. The EPC includes the type of dwelling, total floor area, estimates of current costs for lighting, heating and hot water, and how much money could be saved if suggested changes are made. It also shows the current and potential energy rating and energy efficiency information for the various elements of the dwelling. To retrieve the EPC for your property, select one of the two Retrieve Reports options from the menu and enter either the Report Reference Number (RRN) or the postcode and select from a list of EPCs for properties with that postcode. You can then download the EPC to your computer in pdf format, and print it. Examples of measures that may be suggested in the EPC include things like wall, loft, or floor insulation, replacing lights with low-energy alternatives, installing thermostats, and so on. The potential savings in pounds per annum are shown, as well as whether or not the suggested improvements are available with Green Deal. If Green Deal is available, this means the improvements could be implemented with no up-front cost to you, and with the costs repaid over time by an addition to the electricity bill. If you leave the property during the repayment period, the outstanding costs are added to the electricity bills of the new owners. The EPC includes information on the typical up-front costs of the suggested improvements, as well as expected annual savings if the changes are implemented. You do not have to implement any of the improvements or alterations suggested, but if you do, you could save a great deal of money over time. EPC Adviser This menu option on the EPC Register website enables you to see how you can make your property more energy efficient and less expensive to run. Select this option from the menu on the left and enter the RRN and security code and then agree to the terms and conditions. A list of measures (such as changes to insulation, lighting and heating) you can take to improve energy efficiency is displayed. For each option there is information on possible costs, savings, and the impact on CO2 emissions, and there is a check box to allow you to select the options you are possibly interested in implementing. Select as many options as you wish and then click on Calculate to see how much money your selections could potentially save you. You can return to the selection screen as often as you wish and calculate the potential savings for each combination. When you have finished, click on View Results to see a summary of how much each item will save you annually (or cost you annually). The results page also shows the energy rating for the property, and there is a link for you to download the results in pdf format. Summary The costs of making energy efficiency improvements can, in many cases, be spread over a number of years if the changes are covered by the Green Deal. The EPC, obtainable from the EPC Register, includes this information. The savings you can make depend on the type of property you have and the energy efficiency of the existing dwelling. In some properties the savings may be minimal, especially if the dwelling is new and already has energy efficiency features built in, but in older properties the savings can be substantial with minimal up-front outlay."
13,How To Switch Suppliers Without Triggering An Exit Fee,finance," UK residents have many choices when it comes to energy suppliers, but that doesn’t mean that switching is always easy. Even when a new deal crops up that is better than another, a customer has to worry about exit fees. These can include fees also called cancellation and termination fees. These fees are assessed whenever a buyer tries to opt out of a previous energy contract before the actual period of service is over.  They can range from as little as £5 to up to £50 – per fuel type. Due to the simplification of the UK tariff structure, you may find yourself suddenly signed up to a more expensive tariff once your old tariff is no longer available. This automatic enrolment can also oblige you to pay an exit fee if you want to switch after the period for enrolment is over. It’s the wise consumer that keeps an eye out for fees and asks about them before switching, even when the switch was not of their own doing. Fixed rate plans Fixed rate agreements usually carry early termination fees, and they tend to be more expensive than other plans. This can make it difficult to switch from one type of plan to another, as the fee will offset any savings in cost.  Even if you have a change of heart in the middle of the winter season, you might find you’re stuck with your deal, unless the utility will allow you to switch without a fee. If you have a fixed tariff, you will need to see what types of fees are associated with terminating the account before you actually decide to make that decision. You may find that you can still switch, even if it costs you, or that the company will waive the fee as long as you remain with them and not some other utility. The costs to terminate a fixed rate plan also depend on how far along you are in it. Sometimes, you get lucky If your energy supplier has to change the tariff rate, they must give you 30 days to decide whether you want to keep the tariff or not. If you choose not to keep it during this time, no termination fees apply. The reason for this is that the company has changed the terms of the contract making the previous contract null and void. Thus, the termination fees associated with the contract also do not apply. However, this is a special case and isn’t bound to happen much. It might happen with a fixed rate if the supplier thinks they’re going to lose money by selling you their gas at a lesser price than the market can withstand. However, most fixed tariffs have excess leeway built into the price structure, so this might not ever happen to any of your tariffs.  Instead, you might have to wait for the contract to be officially over. Another option for switching If you simply wait for the contract period to be over, you will also be given 30 days to make a switch without termination fees. Of course, by that time the heating season will be over and you probably won’t know what next winter will be like either. The time period is limited and if you miss notifying your supplier of how you want to switch, you can lose the opportunity to do so without incurring an exit fee. Keep an eye on your contract terms to determine when you can switch without penalty. When your previous tariff is dropped You will also get the opportunity to switch when your previous tariff is dropped and becomes unavailable. Companies that are simplifying their fee structures will send out a letter advising you that you need to change your tariff or they will do it for you. Some will put you on their standard plan and others will pick a more expensive plan. Whatever it happens to be, it will also come with termination fees. If you want to be in control of switching, you have got to abide by the time limit set for making those choices. Otherwise, once the other tariff is in place (whether you agreed to it or not), you won’t be able to make another switch without triggering exit fees."
14,Aussies Cost of Household Bills Better than They Thought,finance," A few weeks ago, if you asked the average Aussie on the street if their cost of living and household bills were going up or down, they’d emphatically assert that the bills were definitely on the rise.  The Guardian reports, however, that a new study states that the opposite is true in Australia.  Not only aren’t the bills ‘skyrocketing,"" they’re decreasing enough so that Australians, on average, are up about $5,300 a year and wages are rising. The Analysis These findings have been reported by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modeling.  According to their findings, ""wage increases are easily outstripping cost of living increases across the country, with West Australian families $9,776 a year better off in real terms than they were in 2008.""  Depending on where you live in Australia, you could be better off by thousands.  Tasmania reflects the most modest increase at $874; nevertheless, household bills and any associated increases aren’t quite the picture that some politicians have painted them to be.  The Guardian also reports that low-income families may not benefit as Aussies in higher tax brackets because of interest rates; however, they appear to be better off than in recent years too. The Bills Some of Australians’ household bills are definitely decreasing.  For instance, Aussies that obtain their power from solar energy, for example, can expect to save half on their electricity costs compared to people obtaining their energy from the grid.  That kind of cost-savings is the stuff of dreams for many people throughout the world still paying rising energy costs. On the other hand, many Australians complain that it’s just certain bills that are substantially increasing.  Child care and groceries, for instance, are said to be on the rise.  According to McCrindle Research, grocery prices are up by about 74%.  When it comes to some energy bills, there have been increases—as much as 83%.  Nevertheless, in the shuffle of increasing and decreasing costs coupled with cost of living increases, Australians are still in the black since their wage increases are said to offset other costs. Australia is Expensive While most experts agree that it is expensive to live in Australia, the statistics show that Australians enjoy good wages and a high standard of living.  ABC News confirmed this summer that ""Australians are taking home more money than ever before"".  In many respects, expenses increase depending on where one lives.  Purchasing homes in the city is out of reach for many Australian’s who are clearly just getting by.  The ABC report says that the average home cost is four times as much as it was in 1998.  One wonders if the statistics tell everyone’s story since, after all, they merely report the ""average."" Many Australians cannot afford to buy a home and are doing what they can merely to make ends meet. Cutting Costs Many Australians are looking to alternative solutions to bring down their annual expenses.  Alternative energy solutions, for instance, are increasingly popular.  Commuters who once battled rush hour traffic in cities like Sydney are cutting back on petrol costs by taking to cycling networks and pedaling to work instead.  Energy conservation is also a hot topic among both households and businesses throughout the nation.  Politicians, of course, are looking for solutions to bring costs down further, but no overnight fix appears to be on the horizon. Lifestyle Costs Another report in the Guardian suggests that the Australians’ lifestyles are expanding—not their cost of living.  The report asserts, ""if we’re being honest with ourselves, there is a subtle but considerably significant difference between cost of living and cost of lifestyle.""  There may be truth to that statement when one considers that ""everyone"" seems to be complaining about the rising costs of bills.  On the other hand, those Australians who have enjoyed wage increases are also coping with any increase that comes their way—on average, of course. As the lifestyles of Australians have increased, the Guardian reports highlights that debt has also increased since the 1980s.  The article associates debt with lifestyle costs and not with the cost of living.  Expense and debt aside, Australia still often makes best of lists as one of the best countries to live in.  Their economy may certainly not be perfect; it is, at least essentially regarded as pretty healthy by international standards."
15,Are You Sure You Have The Cheapest Gas and Electricity Deal?,finance," Rising energy prices have forced homeowners and businesses to review their energy suppliers. The market for gas and electricity supply has exploded in recent years, and new companies are offering attractive deals and tariffs to attract customers. A decade ago the UK energy market was dominated by the likes of British Gas and Southern Electric, by you can now get your gas and electricity from Sainsbury’s, The Co-operative and a range of other companies. Online switching services are a great place to start looking for the cheapest gas and electricity suppliers, but there’s a little more to be done to make sure you are getting the best deals available. Tariffs and prices rise and fall, and getting the best deal today doesn’t mean you will be on the cheapest rates available a year later. Some energy suppliers offer energy saving technology and support, and signing up to the cheapest tariff doesn’t necessarily mean your bills will be lower than with any other company. The following tips can help to ensure you really are getting the cheapest gas and electricity deals available. Many people think of the traditional suppliers when they look at comparing energy prices, but there are many smaller companies offering great deals. There are eighteen electricity supply companies in the UK at the moment, and you need to ensure you are including all of them in any comparison. You may not be familiar with names like Equipower and Countrywide Energy, but you should check their rates if they are able to supply power in your area. The energy supply business is heavily regulated in the UK, and there’s no need to worry about things going wrong with a smaller company as consumer protection laws are in place. It’s not just as simple as asking which company supplies the cheapest energy in the UK, as the answer depends on your personal circumstances. The area you live in and the amount of gas and electricity you use are the key factors in determining the best tariff available for your home. Pensioners and families on lower incomes may be entitled to additional support with energy bills. Energy supply companies are sometimes criticised for producing confusing bills, and it can be hard to know if you really are getting the best deal if a bill isn’t clear. Each company sets out their bills in a different format, but they should all supply the key information you need to understand how much energy you’ve used and what it has cost. A bill should clearly state the billing period, the current tariff you are contracted to, the rate per unit of energy and how many units you have used. It’s important to take the time to read each statement and understand the numbers if you want to track your energy spending. An energy bill should also state how to contact the company if you have a query, and give advanced notice of any future price rises. There were thousands of complaints about hidden charges when the energy switching industry developed a few years ago. Regulators have issued guidance to energy suppliers to reduce the risk of customers picking up hidden charges, but it’s still important to understand the terms of your energy supply contracts. The key thing to check is if a daily standing charge will be added to your fuel bill. The unit price may appear lower than another company’s, but a daily standing charge can mean the overall cost of your energy will be higher. With the energy supply market so competitive, it’s important to have the flexibility to switch if you find a better deal. Exit penalties can mean you are locked into a contract with one gas or electricity supplier, so always check if these apply. If your supplier increases their prices, this can be considered a change in the contract and you should be able to switch without any penalty. As soon as you are notified of a price increase, look for a better deal and give your supplier notice that you wish to switch to a different company."
16,"Initial Public Offering (""IPO"") – An Introduction",finance," What does IPO mean? It refers to the process of offering shares of a privately-owned company for sale to the general public. The first time these shares are offered is called IPO. There are various reasons as to why a company wants to go for IPO, where the more common ones as follows:- Many times when a private owned company wants to raise funds, the financial institutions will insist on collaterals and guarantees, and therefore, the amounts of funds to raise will be limited to the size of the collateral. In the case of IPO, the funds that can be raised will be determined by the confidence of investors on the company, with regards to the growth potential, management team, governance etc. In an IPO exercise, the fund raising potential is way beyond the amount that the company can raise via financial institutions. Comparing to funding raising via financial institutions (debt funding), where the cost of financing is high, and there could be requirements to place collaterals and guarantees for the financing, the company may be able to raise funding at a much cheaper rates, and without collaterals through the IPO exercise. As a private owned company, the value attached to the company is always limited because there is no equivalent open market price for this company. Therefore, by going for IPO, the company will need to go through a series of financial, operational and legal due diligence by third party professionals to uncover the full potential of the company. Once the value is endorsed by these professionals, the company is able to unlock its value many times over that of the privately owned company. Being a public listed company has advantages over many private owned company, where they can have access to bigger and more attractive business potentials. Also, financial institutions and business partners will see them are more credible. Therefore, once the company goes through a successful IPO, the company is deemed to be a ""big boy"" in its industry, and being a brand in its own right. There are cases where the founders of the company intends to pass on the business to their next generation, but probably unsure if the next generation has interest in their business. Therefore, they would bring the company IPO, and have their family members holding shares of the company. This gives flexibility to the family members to decide whether to retain the shareholding and take over the management of the business, or to sell of their shares for funds to invest or start their own business ventures. This is Part 1 of the 6 part series in ""Initial Public Offering"" knowledge articles written by KL Management Services.

18,Business Bridging Finance,finance," You have a business and need a short term and fast loan? If so, you might find that the best option for you is business bridging finance. Bank Lending Most people, when thinking about raising capital for a business, would immediately go to their bank for an overdraft or some other loan to be secured on the companies building or other assets. There are advantages to this course of action, as well as some draw backs. The loan would probably have a relatively cheap interest rate and will be provided by a bank or lending institution you have used or at least heard of before. Loans that have low rates are often the most difficult to obtain, as the price reflects the potential risk, so, to qualify for cheap rates there will be strict criteria. Your business and likely all the directors, will need to have clean credit and have provable income in the form of accounts or at least a reference from an accountant. Loans from high street banks can take 6 weeks or more to put in place, not ideal if you need some cash next week! Assuming that your business can wait for a couple of months for the money and can meet the application criteria it makes sense to go for the cheaper loan option, obviously the more your business pays for finance the less profit you are going to make. Fast access to capital But, what happens if you need to raise money quickly and for a short period of time? You could try business bridging finance. It was often the case that bridging finance was used to do just that, bridging the gap between the purchase and sale of a property and, in many case, it still is. Bridging is also used as a way of raising capital quickly and with as little fuss as possible. Of course when borrowing significant amounts of money there will always be questions to answer and hoops to jump through, but a bridging loan application is normally less stringent. The lenders may not be ones you are aware of at the moment but some soon will be. Using bridging finance is becoming more main stream as investors, developers and business owners use it to raise buy or develop property or inject cash to their business. How fast can you get the finance? In theory, a bridge can be put in place within a few days from initial enquiry. So you could call us on a Monday morning and have the cash in your account by the end of the working week, sometimes within 48 hours. In practice it generally takes longer than that but 10 – 14 days is very do able. This is idea for a business that needs to raise cash quickly, say to pay for a large order, but knows that there will be income within a short period of time that will allow for the loan to be paid back. It could also be the case that the business takes out a longer term mortgage or facility with their bank which will have cheaper interest, but they cannot wait for the bank to put it in place. Using a bridge for development Bridging can be a flexible and useful tool for all professionals and businesses and that includes those in development. So, if your business is property, bridging can be a fantastic finance resource for you to call on. In the current market there are property bargains to be had and property professionals are looking to take advantage, particularly buying a unit that needs work. Some short term finance lenders will even offer loans to help with the cost of doing the work, allowing even more flexibility."
19,Water Meters – Can They Save You Money?,finance," Water meters are a growing way in the UK to keep track of water usage and pay for the exact amount that you use, and they are a great way to save money as well. Not only can a water meter lower your bill simply by being installed, but by letting you keep track of your water consumption it can force you to get into the habit of using water wisely. The following article will take a closer look at these two points. A Water Meter Can Lower Your Water Bill If… Your household does not use a lot of water or if you have a big house but not too many people living in it. Unmetered charges might have been relatively high for you in this case, and so you could definitely benefit from having a meter in this case. Water meters are most likely to benefit single people or couples living without children. Water meters are also great if not a lot of people are at home during the day. If everyone is at work or school and doesn't come home until the evening, then your household is probably not using up too much water.  Since you would only pay for what you use, this could mean big savings for you and your family. If your household is smaller and you don't use a lot of water, then these benefits will likely come to you without any changes to your lifestyle whatsoever. You will probably see a decrease in your water bill just by simply installing a meter. A Water Meter Can Help You Lower Your Water Consumption By… Letting you keep track of your water usage. If you do consume an excessive amount of water and use it for things such as lawn care or washing your car, then installing a water meter could actually increase your water bill. However, the great thing is that by keeping track of your meter's reading you can try to lower your water consumption and thereby lower your bill. You will be saving money while developing environmentally friendly habits. For example, if using a lot of water on lawn care is keeping your bill high, then you will want to look into using a water butt. A water butt can be used to collect the thousands of liters of rainwater that fall onto your roof each year. You can then use this water for various outdoor purposes and you will see these changes reflected in a lower water bill. There are a variety of other water-saving products that you can buy or even get from your water company for free. Since a water meter will make you pay for the amount of water that you use, you will be finding yourself much more motivated to look into these products than you probably were before. What If A Water Meter Does Not Save You Money? It is possible that installing a water meter will raise your water bills and that despite your best water saving efforts you just won't be able to get the bill to go down. Such is likely to be the case for bigger families or those with certain illnesses that require a lot of water consumption. If you do not want to have a water meter anymore, then you should be aware of the fact that you have 12 months to cancel and revert back to unmetered charges. The meter won't be removed, but you will be allowed to pay as you were paying before. If, however, you live in an area of the UK that has compulsory metering, then you unfortunately need to keep your meter. Nevertheless, you should talk to your water company about your options. You might be eligible for the UK's WaterSure scheme, or you could benefit from paying in installments. If you would like to see an estimate ahead of time of whether or not you could stand to save money by installing a water meter, then you should take a look at this handy Water Meter Calculator offered by the Consumer Council for Water: ccwater.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.388 Just input some information and the calculator will give you a sense of how much you could stand to save or lose by installing a water meter."
20,Estate Tax History,finance," Estate taxes, also referred to as death taxes, relate to ""power to transmit or the transition or receipt of property by death.""  Estate taxes are imposed when property is transferred at death.  The size of the estate depends on the graduation of the tax.  Estate tax consists of ""an accounting of everything you own or have certain interest in at the date of death.  The fair market value of these items is used, not necessarily what you paid for them or what their values were when you acquired them."" (IRS.gov 1)  ""Gross estate"" is what all of these items total to be.  Property included in estate taxes could consist of real estate, annuities, securities, cash, insurance, business interest, trusts, and any other assets. . Once gross estate is accounted for, there are deductions and reductions in value that may occur, which will result in the adjusted or ""taxable estate.""  Deductions made to the gross estate could include ""estate administration expenses, mortgages and other debts, property that passes to surviving spouses, and qualified charities.  The value of some operating business interest or farms may be reduced for estates that qualify."" (IRS.gov 2)  After the taxable estate amount is computed, taxable gift lifetime value and net amount are added together to calculate the tax.  Unified credit available reduces this tax.  Publicly traded securities, cash, small assets, jointly held property, and no special deductions do not need an estate tax return to be filed.  Estate tax returns, however, must be filed for estates with gross assets combined and gifts that are taxable exceeding ""1.5 million dollars in 2004-05, two million in 06-08, 3.5 million for decedents dying in 09, and 5 million or more for decedents dying in 2010-11, 5.12 million in 2012, and 5.25 million in 2013.""(IRS.gov) Even in seven hundred B.C., ancient Egypt had people who at death would transfer property based on taxation.  The past ninety years, estate tax laws have seen significant changes. No matter what the changes have been, the federal government has always relied on taxes of all kinds to provide government funding.  The goal for this research paper is to explain the history of estate tax rates and propose predictions of future estate tax rates. Estate taxes have been around for a long time.  It was very popular in mid evil times when kings required heirs to pay estate tax to receive transferred property.  In the seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe, there was much argument about whether or not property transfer was a ""natural right"" for people upon death.  It was not until the eighteenth century that the government labeled property tax transfers as ""not natural"" then placing taxes on property transfers. In the United States, the first effort that was made to try estate property tax was in the 1797 Stamp Act.  This act stated that any document pertained to property, like a will, was entitled to a tax.  The Stamp Act was brought about as the government’s attempt to aid funding for the war against France.  During this time ""taxes were levied as follows: ten cents on the inventories of the effects of deceased persons and fifty cents on the probate of wills and letters of administration.  The tax on the receipt of legacies was levied on the bequest larger than fifty dollars from which widows, children, and grandchildren were exempt.""  The Stamp Act was ended in 1802 when the war ended. When the Civil War came about in 1862, so did the return of estate transfer tax.  During the war, not only were documents taxed, also the deceased person’s estate itself was taxed.  This act differed from the previous Stamp Act because this tax package included inheritance tax along with the stamp tax.  During this time, estates were exempt if they were less than one thousand dollars.  Military expenses were rising in 1864, so congress introduced the gift tax.  Gift taxes were taxes on property transfers that occurred during a person’s lifetime. When the Civil War ended, these taxes ended as well. The United States discovered it needed more funding in 1898 when the Spanish-American War began, so estate taxes were re-implemented. Unlike the other two acts, the proposal of 1898 struck up much debate. Taxation was applied to personal property and legacy tax was made law. Small estates were excluded from the tax with a ten thousand dollar exemption. ""In 1901, certain gifts were exempt from tax including gifts to charitable, religious, literary, and educational organizations and gifts to organizations dedicated to the encouragement of the arts and the prevention of cruelty of children.""(IRS.gov 3)  This war ended in 1902 and the tax was repealed.  This tax alone raised over fourteen million dollars. During World War I, 1916 estate tax and gift tax were favored by the president during that time; however, they also introduced income tax.  When WWI ended, these taxes were never repealed.  In the history of the United States and other countries, there is evidence showing a direct correlation between a country at war and implementation of taxes. Throughout 1916 and1948 there were significant changes to tax laws.  In 1932, the first major change was the addition of taxes on gifts.  Taxes on gifts became permanent in the federal tax system in 1932.    The reason this tax came about was because congress realized estate taxes could be avoided by wealthy individuals by transferring wealth while they were still alive.  The rules of 1932 state that fifty thousand dollars could be transferred free of tax during a donor’s lifetime with an annual exclusion of five thousand dollars per each recipient.  An optional valuation date election was put in place through the Revenue Act of 1935.  This allowed the assets of the deceased estate to be valued up to one year after their death.  With economic events, such as the Great Depression, this would help citizens avoid estate taxes tremendously.  In 1948, another revenue act was introduced.  This act established the marital deduction of estate and gift taxes.  This act allowed the surviving spouse receiving property of the estate to deduct the value of the property they received.  This deduction did, however, have its limits.  For instance, only one half of the deceased’s estate was allowed. The next big change in the transfer tax system occurred in 1976 with the Tax Reform Act also known as TRA.  ""This act created a unified estate and gift tax framework that consisted of a single graduated rate of tax and posed on both lifetime gifts and testamentary dispositions.  Prior to the act, it cost substantially more to leave property at death than to give it away during life.  Due to the lower tax rate applied to gifts.  The tax Reform Act of 1976 also merged the estate tax exclusion and the lifetime gift tax exclusion into a single unified estate and gift tax credit which may be used to offset gift tax liability during the donor’s lifetime, but which if unused at death is available to offset the deceased donor’s estate tax liability."" (IRS 122) At this time, each recipient of an annual gift was limited to three thousand dollars per year. Generation-skipping transfer trusts (GST’s), had a tax introduced with the 1976 tax reform package. Overall the GST tax insures that the transmission of hereditary wealth is taxed at each generation level. Generation skipping trusts is an agreement that is legally binding where assets contributed are passed down to grandchildren instead of children. By skipping the generation, and the opportunity to receive assets, the child is also avoiding the taxes that come along with the estate. Generation skipping trusts could still however benefit the child of the grantor because if any of the trusts’ assets generate income, that income can be made available for the grantor’s child even when the trust is left for the grandchildren. In 1981, several new changes were brought to estate tax law through The Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981. This act allowed for life interest deductions for spouses that were not terminable. (IRS 123) Estate taxes were a big issue in Washington’s ""fiscal cliff"" deal in early January 2013.  On January 1, 2013, the Senate passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act 2012.  There were Considerations of this act that went towards estate taxes.  The twenty thirteen federal agreement stated exemption levels for gift generation and estate transfer taxes set the lifetime level at five million dollars.  This act also makes estate and gift tax unification permanent and for both there is a single graduated rate.  This act provides the allowance of continued portability exclusion between spouses for a lifetime.  The American Tax Payer Act also changed the estate tax rate from 35 to 40% tops.  The current administration is pushing for wealthy people to pay their fair share, and estate taxes were mentioned frequently to achieve this.  Going in to 2013, the estate tax rate, along with the exemption amount, was up in the air.  Many democrats pushed for the exemption amount to be as low as one million dollars and with a 55% rate.  With the exemption amount being that low and the rate being that high, estate taxes would bring in massive amounts of revenue for the federal government.  After a decade of tax uncertainness, this new act restores clarity to gift and estate tax policy and provides certainty for financial planners to implement feasible estate and gift tax plans that will be reliable for the next few years. Although the fiscal cliff is in the past, the changes to estate taxes are not set in stone.  For 2013, the exemption amount is $5.25 million and is indexed for inflation.  These changes leave many questions for people, especially those currently getting their affairs in order.  One question they may have is whether or not their spouse has to pay estate taxes when they inherit from one another.  The new law provides unlimited deduction on assets inherited by a spouse until the second spouse passes.  This deduction only applies to spouses that are citizens of the United States.  The second spouse does have the ability to pass assets down tax free to an extent, however.  Widows and widowers have the ability to add together any un-used assets which will allow for a together transfer of up to $10.5 million tax free.  This is known as portability.  Executers of estates are responsible for portability because it is not an automatic process.  Unused assets are passed to the survivor and can in turn make them assets that pass through his or her estate or make them lifetime gifts.  There are a few prerequisites for this to happen.  Estate tax returns must be filed upon the death of the first spouse, even if nothing is owed.  The due date for this tax return is within nine months after a death; however there is a six month extension period.  The right of portability is lost by the spouse if the executor of the estate fails to file a tax return or does not meet the deadline.  It is recommended that all spouses file tax returns like these, even if they are not wealthy today, solely because the future of these taxes is unknown. (Forbes 1) Lifetime gift and estate taxes are directly related, because they are expressed as a total amount.  The current limit on the transfer of assets is $5.25 million for 2013, as stated earlier.  The combination of the two must be less than the exemption amount, or the heir will owe up to a 40% tax.  It is important that people keep up with how much of these have already been used so the Internal Revenue Service will know when you die.  This also provides couples a break by process of gift splitting.  By sharing during their lifetime, and giving more to their children during that time, it is tax free; however, that will also reduce how much of the tax-free is available when they pass. (Forbes 2) With the likely hood of the exemption amount to be reduced dramatically in the near future, estate planning is a must.  When it comes to future estate tax rates, it is all speculation. Although the laws in place for 2013 are supposedly ""permanent,"" that could easily change depending on the country’s leadership in Washington.  The current exemption amount and rate could possibly be permanent, but more regulation may be placed on trusts and other tools to expose more of the population to the tax.  Although there are states that do not have any kind of estate taxes, this could change also, with the growing spending problem. The prediction previously stated about the future of estate taxes was based solely on opinion; however there is plenty of information to back it up.  The new federal budget President Obama has put in to place recently had a budget to raise estate taxes.  This proposal the president made would change the tax rates in 2018 back to the 2009 levels.  This change would dramatically increase the number of families that will have to deal with estate taxes.  With changing the rates to the 2009 levels, it is estimated that of every one thousand people, about three would now be subject to the tax.  Over a ten year period, this would raise about $79 billion in extra revenue.  These changes would cause the exemption rate per person to drop from $5.25 million to $3.5 million this year.  This would also change the top tax rate from 40 percent to 45 percent. ""As part of the end of year ‘fiscal cliff’ agreement, congressional Republicans insisted on permanently cutting the estate tax below those levels, providing tax cuts averaging $1 million per estate to the very wealthiest Americans,"" the white House said in its budget.  ""It would also eliminate a number of loopholes that currently allow wealthy individuals to use sophisticated tax planning to reduce their estate tax liability."" (Washington Times 1) The chart below is basically a simple timeline of the estate tax exemptions and rates in the United States.  The time that is listed on this chart starts when estate taxes were enacted in 1916.  There were many estate tax law changes that were significant for 1916 until the present time.  In 1918, there was an expansion in tax base which included how married citizens divided their joint property, implemented general powers of appointment, and dealt with $40000 payable to estate of life insurance, and also deductions for charities were added.  In 1924, the establishment of gift taxes began.  There was also an addition of state death tax credit and ""revocable transfers included in tax base.""  In 1926 there was a repeal of the gift tax.  In 1932, the gift tax was reinstated.  In 1935, citizens were now able to use an alternate valuation of their property at death.  In 1942, there was an expansion of the tax base, which included decedent, paid for all insurance, most powers of appointment, and community property minus the actual contribution of cost of the spouse.  The community property rules of 1942 replaced marital deduction in 1948.  In 1951, the power of appointment rule was relaxed.  In 1954, there was a modification of life insurance rules which excluded insurance never owned by the decedent.  Unified estate and gift taxes came about in 1976.  There was also the addition of orphan deduction, generation skipping transfer tax, and carry over basis rule and special rules were implemented for small businesses and farms.  There was also an increase deduction for people who were married.  The carry over rule was repealed in 1980.  In 1981, marital deduction was made unlimited.  During this time, there was also a change in the tax base, full value pension benefits, with one half of the joint property excluded automatically.  There was also the orphan deduction repeal.  In 1986, the generation skipping tax was modified and the ESOP deduction was added.  ""In 1987, the phase out of graduated rates and unified credit for estates over $10 million introduced.""  In 1988, QTIP permitted for marital deduction and the generation skipping tax was modified again.  There was also an estate freeze introduced.  In 1990, the freeze rules on estates were replaced.  In 1997, there was a business deduction for qualified family owned businesses, there was an introduction of conservation easement, and the phase out of 1987 was revoked.  In 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act was instated.  As seen above, it is clear that estate taxes have been anything but consistent. I personally believe there will be more emphasis placed on federal estate taxes in the future to combat the government’s spending problem.  If the current views of office remain the same in Washington, more revenue will definitely be needed, and will more than likely come from taxing the wealthier citizens of America.  If the exemption amount ever drops to recently proposed $1 million, the amount of people required to pay the tax increases dramatically. If Washington does not implement lower exemption amounts and higher tax rates, I believe they will try to regulate the ways people lower their estate amount to avoid estate taxes. For  2013, the maximum annual gift can be fourteen thousand dollars, tax free.  Expect this to drop down sharply or almost disappear. Sources ""Estate Tax."" IRS.gov. N.p., 9 Mar. 2013.

1,Will Your Life Insurance Policy Be Taxed?,finance," It may be a cliché to say at this point, but it still holds true that the only certainties in life are death and taxes. This point is especially relevant if you are considering taking out a life insurance policy. Many people are under the impression that such policies are tax-free. While it is true that pay outs from insurance companies do not generally fall under the same regulations as regular income, it is not quite true to say that they are immune from taxes all together. In fact, taxes could be as high as 40 per cent for some pay outs, therefore it is imperative to know whether or not your policy will be subjected to the taxman once you pass on. Fortunately, there are ways to sidestep the tax issue, but they require careful preparation and research beforehand. We will look at how taxes may affect your insurance pay outs, and how you can go about making sure your loved ones receive all the benefits they are entitled to after your death. Income Tax The most common question people have regarding insurance and taxes is whether a pay-out will be subjected to income tax. Fortunately, the answer is a flat out no. Because you have been paying premiums on your policy for (presumably) years, these premium payments are already viewed as a tax on your income. But beware: while income tax may be the tax people are most familiar with, it is not the only one around. Inheritance Tax Which brings us to our next point, Inheritance Tax, which is the most common culprit when it comes to a substantial portion of an insurance pay out going towards HM Revenue and Customs. Inheritance Tax applies to all estates valued over £325,000. Unfortunately, your life insurance scheme will be included in the estate, and, even worse, the pay out from it will be subjected to a 40 per cent tax. In other words, your family could be losing nearly half the amount from your insurance policy that they may otherwise be expecting. Furthermore, as the pay out will be included in your estate, it could get tied up in probate, meaning your family will have to wait longer before they can collect their benefits (especially if there is a challenge to the will, which is becoming ever more common in the UK nowadays). Written in Trust The really unfortunate aspect of all of this is that none of the insurance policies that are being subject to a tax have to be at all. There are very simple steps you can take to make sure the pay out from your policy is non-taxable (and, yes, these steps are perfectly legal and legitimate). If you believe your policy will be subject to the Inheritance Tax, it is a very good idea to have that policy written in trust. By having a policy written in trust, you separate from your other assets, thus making it exempt from the Inheritance Tax. Rather, the policy will be held in trust by another party (typically a spouse), but will usually still be paid out upon your death. By having a policy written in trust, you also avoid challenges to the inheritance, thus the pay-out can avoid lengthy and costly probate procedures and be given to your family quickly. At the same time, there are a couple of drawbacks to having a policy written in trust that you need to be aware of beforehand. For one, since the policy is in trust, there may be certain stipulations regarding its pay-out. For example, if the beneficiary is a minor, he or she may not be able to collect on the policy until he or she turns of age. Most importantly, many policies have clauses that forbid writing the policy in trust. As such, before even taking out life insurance, you need to read the details to be sure that you can write it in trust should you need to do so. When it comes to a life insurance policy, many people assume that such policies are exempt from taxes. While this assumption is certainly true for income tax, it is not true if the deceased is leaving behind a large estate which will be subject to Inheritance Tax. Fortunately, by doing the proper preparations beforehand, you can avoid having an insurance pay out subjected to tax, thus easing the financial burden on your family once you pass on."
2,"Term Life Insurance Is The Most Affordable Policy That You Can Buy. There Are Many Kinds, Though",finance," With most kinds of insurance, the insurance company keeps adding your premiums up to a fund in your name. If you happen to pass away before the insurance policy runs out, you get paid the full amount. If the insurance policy’s maturity date comes and goes uneventfully, you get to claim all the premiums that you’ve paid along with interest. Insurance policies of this kind tend to be somewhat expensive. If you wish to simply protect your family well as affordably as possible without worrying about whether you can get your premiums back when the term of your insurance runs out, you can simply choose term insurance. On a term policy, the inexpensive premium that you pay only guarantees you a payout if you die during the period of time the insurance lasts. If you are lucky enough to live past then, getting to live is your prize – you don’t get any money. Some insurance companies make a humane exception. If you are diagnosed with a serious life-threatening illness during the period of your coverage, they pay out half of the sum assured. With any kind of life insurance, term insurance included, the company only pays out if you take your policy out a year before you pass away. There Are Different Types Of Term Insurance There are three basic kinds of term insurance. The first kind is a level term insurance. This kind of policy assures you a level or fixed sum of money whether the person insured dies one year after the policy is taken out or 10 years later. An increasing term insurance policy is designed so that the payout assured rises by 5% for each year that the insured person lives – it’s like a bonus for managing to stay alive. Usually, they keep adding on 5% each year until you reach a preset age – usually 65 or 70. Since they keep raising your cover, these policies charge a slightly expensive premium. Many banks offer life insurance as an add-on alongside of home mortgages. These policies are usually designed to mimic the home mortgages that they are a part of – the payout decreases in proportion to the decreasing size of the home mortgage each year. While these are inexpensive life insurance policies, they don’t offer much value. There Are Many Other Variations On This Theme The life insurance options above are designed to give the family of the insured person a lump sum payout if he happens to die within the policy’s period of coverage. Some people, though, find that a huge lump sum is not likely to be as useful as an income replacement plan – where the life insurance company pays the family a preset sum of money each month to replace the family income that’s lost. These are called family income benefit policies. A family that doesn’t have the expertise needed to invest a large sum of money wisely could find it a comfort to have an insurance company do it for them. The monthly income payouts promised in these policies only go out as long as the policies are valid. If a person dies one year before his policy is set to close, his family will only receive a year’s worth of payments. A Few Tips On How To Buy Affordable Term Life Insurance To find the most affordable quotes on your term life insurance policy, you should head to a knowledgeable agent. If you do know that a term policy is what you need, you don’t need a full service broker who can give you knowledgeable advice. Instead, you can simply go with an affordable execution-only broker whose job is to do a little research on your behalf to find the cheapest policy available. Since an insurance purchase lasts a lifetime, you need to take your time and ask the right questions. •	How well rated for performance and financial strength is the term insurance company selling you the policy? •	Does the policy allow conversion to a permanent policy? •	If you are unhappy with the insurance plan’s terms once you buy it, do you have to stick with it for five years, or can you ask for a smaller period? Finally, if you are in good health, the best way to get a competitive rate is to ask for a medical exam. The results of your exam can only make your insurance cheaper."
3,Getting Discount Home Insurance With a Claims Record,finance," Homeowners pay too much every year for utilities, insurance, and other recurring bills simply because they don't have the time or energy to contact companies and ask for a better deal, shop around before renewing, or switch providers. This is why many sectors rely on returning customers to fuel their profits while offering the best deals to new customers. If you want discount home insurance, you have to be ready to go and seek it out. Those who have filed home insurance claims are particularly likely to think of themselves as ineligible for the best insurance premiums. They often stick with the same provider because they feel guilty about switching. This means insurance providers that have fulfilled claims are likely to raise rates when it's time to renew your insurance. If you don't take action to switch, you could end up paying hundreds of pounds too much for your insurance! Here are some tips to shop around when you have filed home insurance claims. Be Honest And Upfront About Your Record If an insurance provider finds out that you have lied or omitted details from your claim history, you're in trouble. Always be honest about how many home insurance claims you have filed and why you filed each claim. Explain the situation, how you handled it (especially if you called the hotline first and followed the claims procedure carefully), why you needed to file a claim, how the company responded, and the outcome of the claim. Insurance providers are not scared off by claims – they know everyone will probably file a claim sometime, after all. Emphasize Any Improvements That Have Been Made If you needed to file a claim because of something that could have been prevented, emphasize any improvements you have made since then. For example, if you drove a nail into a wall and burst a water pipe, you could mention that you have used a pipe finder ever since then. Perhaps you have smoke detectors now after a fire, or you have changed the locks on your windows and doors. If your claim resulted in structural repairs and rebuilding, your house may be even more solid now, so don't be afraid to mention anything that has been improved as a result of the claim. Make Small Changes To Be Eligible For Better Rates Are you willing to make some small home improvements in order to be eligible for better rates? If a quote is too high, you could ask what you can do to decrease the premiums you have been quoted. You may be able to install smoke detectors or a burglar alarm, pay via direct debit, or pay upfront for a year of premiums, for instance. There are lots of small home improvements that insurance companies like to see, and they can let you know what you're missing. Improve Your Credit Rating, If It's Low One factor that can affect your home insurance rates is your credit rating. If a claim resulted in a financial hit that caused you to open more credit cards, accumulate debt, or miss payments, you could be seeing increased rates because of your low credit rating. Take steps to clean up your credit rating like checking your report to make sure the rating is accurate, paying all your bills on time, and avoiding incurring unnecessary credit checks. Avoid Filing Another Claim Soon If you can help it, make sure you don't file another claim for the next few years. Being claims-free for two to five years can help negate the otherwise higher rates and bring your premiums back down. Of course, you can't always help needing to file a claim, but if you can emphasize to a new insurance company that you had a major claim a few years ago but have had no claims since, you may not see much of an increase in the rates you are quoted. It's not impossible to get good discount home insurance when you have had claims, as long as you're willing to explain everything, show the improvements that have been made, and shop around. Never hide your record or try to avoid talking about it, as this is a red flag. Certain types of claims will always raise your rates, but others may not affect them at all. Finally, don't be afraid to shop around – even if you can't find a cheaper provider, it's good to know that you aren't being taken advantage of simply because you once filed a claim."
4,Five Tips to Reduce Your House and Building Insurance Premiums  House Building Insurance,finance," If you're like the majority of homeowners in the UK, then your house is probably your biggest investment. While no one likes to think about bad things happening, the fact is that a catastrophe can strike anywhere and at any time. A fire, a flood or a storm could reduce your investment - and even more importantly, the place that your family calls home - to rubble. In order to protect your investment, your home and your family, house and building insurance are absolutely necessary. A huge variety of options are available when it comes to insuring your house. You can choose between any number of insurers and plans. While having more choices is good for consumers, it can also be a bit overwhelming - especially when every dollar counts. If you aren't careful, you might find yourself paying insurance premiums that are more than you can afford. Luckily, there are some steps that you can take to lower your premiums quickly and simply. Properly Value Your Home And Its Contents Buildings insurance should cover the entire cost of rebuilding your home in case of a disaster, including materials, labour and planning. Many people make the mistake of valuing their home at market value, which is generally much higher than the rebuild cost. To find out the rebuild cost of your home, you can use the Association of British Insurers' online cost calculator at abi.bcis.co.uk/#calculation. For even more precise numbers, you can hire a chartered surveyor to determine the exact cost of rebuilding your home. While many people over-insure their building, many others under-insure their contents. If you choose to purchase contents insurance, it's important to make sure that you keep an up-to-date and realistic inventory of your belongings. Under-insuring means that you won't be able to replace your contents if they're lost or damaged. Reduce Your Risk Of Burglary And Fire Insurance providers offer incentives to people who carefully secure their properties. High quality locks on sturdy door and window frames can lower your premiums. Contact your insurance provider to see if certain locks are preferable to others. A burglar alarm or a monitored alarm can also reduce your premiums, as can joining a neighbourhood watch scheme. To protect your house against fire, make sure to check all smoke alarms and replace batteries regularly. Look For Incentives Most insurance companies offer incentives to customers who bundle their insurance, buying more than one policy from the same provider. Rather than having buildings and contents insurance with one company, auto insurance with another, and holiday home insurance with a third, consider switching so that all of your policies are in one place. Not only will bundling your insurance save you money, it will also be more convenient and easier to keep track of everything. Insurance providers also offer no-claims incentives to people who have never made an insurance claim. This discount can be significant, making it even more worthwhile to properly secure and maintain your home. Shop Around Online comparison sites make it easy to compare plans, policies and providers. Take a few minutes to compare and find the best deal. Remember, though, that the cheapest deal isn't always the best one. It's important to know what you want - and what you need. While buildings and contents insurance are pretty standard, a wide variety of other services are also offered through insurance providers. Plans that include extra coverage will generally cost more. It's well worth paying for your insurance yearly rather than monthly, since monthly payments will generally work out to be quite a bit higher. Choose To Pay Higher Excesses Your excess - what you pay first when making an insurance claim - has a direct influence on the premiums that you pay. Higher excesses mean lower premiums. It's important, though, to be reasonable and realistic. Don't raise your excess to the point where paying it will create a financial hardship should you need to make a claim. While house and building insurance might seem expensive at first, the cost of dealing with an emergency on your own can be much, much higher. It's well worth paying for peace of mind - especially when you know that disaster can strike at any time. Still, there's no reason to pay any more than you need to! With just a few simple steps, you can lower your premiums - without sacrificing your sense of safety and security."
5,Finding the Best Home Insurance Rates if You Have a Criminal Conviction,finance," Insurance companies are in the business of assessing risk. As such, when it comes to home insurance rates, many providers will refuse outright anybody with a criminal conviction. This blanket refusal makes sense in many cases, as a provider could not reasonably be expected to cover an individual convicted of theft or arson. But with millions of UK citizens on the Offenders Index, this rule can seem a little extreme, especially for those who have been convicted for offences that have little to do with the value of their property. Littering or even unpaid traffic fines can result in convictions that can make insurance very difficult to come by. Furthermore, anybody who has previously declared bankruptcy will likewise find providers reticent about providing coverage. For these people, getting home insurance will be more complicated, but it is not outright impossible. We look at what bearing criminal convictions and bankruptcy have on house insurance, and how you can go about finding a provider that will be willing to provide you with adequate coverage. How convictions relate to insurance As stated, most of the big providers will not insure anybody with a criminal conviction. When you apply for insurance, most providers will ask you whether you have any previous convictions. While you may be tempted to lie on this question, don’t, as doing so will likely invalidate your policy later on should you need to make a claim. Having a policy invalidated will mean you not only will not receive the pay-out from the policy, but you will have wasted hundreds, even thousands, of pounds through premiums over the years. Spent and unspent convictions While the big providers will typically deny coverage to those with criminal convictions, there are limits to this rule. You only have to declare a criminal conviction if you have an unspent conviction. Spent convictions cannot be used to deny coverage, nor can they be used to justify denial of a claim. A conviction becomes spent depending on a certain amount of rehabilitation time spent after the sentence is served. For example, a sentence on the lower end of the scale, such as a fine or community service, becomes spent after five years. For convictions of less than six months, you will have to wait seven years. A six month to two and a half year sentence will require a rehabilitation period of ten years. For any conviction over this period, it is impossible to have that conviction declared spent. Once a conviction is spent, it does not need to be disclosed to your provider. Bankruptcy and insurance If you have declared bankruptcy, then limitations on insurance will be similar to those who have convictions. In fact, it may be even more difficult to get coverage if you previously declared bankruptcy than if you had a conviction. Even if your bankruptcy occurred many years ago, many of the big insurance providers will outright deny any person with a bankruptcy filing. Unlike those with convictions, this ban could last for life. How to get insurance Fortunately, getting insurance if you have a conviction or have declared bankruptcy is not outright impossible. Most likely, you will have to visit a specialist insurance provider in order to get the coverage you need. Specialist providers deal primarily with properties and individuals that fall outside of the mainstream. As such, these providers are much more likely to take every individual applicant on a case by case basis, meaning the nature and circumstances of your conviction or bankruptcy will be taken into account. As expected, premiums from such firms will be higher than they would be with more commonly recognized firms. While the coverage from these providers will typically be about the same as any normal insurance policy, it is important to compare offers from different providers as certain exceptions may be imposed. For example, if you have been convicted of arson in the past, a certain provider may impose a limit on your coverage if your house is damaged by fire. A criminal conviction or bankruptcy can follow you around for years, making insurance difficult to come by. While the major providers will typically deny you coverage outright, there are specialist providers that you can seek out that will give you the coverage you need. While the home insurance rates from these providers will undoubtedly by higher than they would be with a mainstream provider, you will have peace of mind knowing your property is adequately covered."
6,Filing a Life Insurance Claim,finance," Many tasks in life are repeated events: registering for school, looking for a job, and so forth. Some events in life are more rare and are of greater overall significance, such as getting married. Because these kinds of events occur more seldom, people may not the steps involved in carrying them out. Filing a life insurance claim is one of those kinds of events, and deserves no less than a complete familiarization with the process prior to its ever being needed. Reduce the Burden Unless you actually work in the industry, filing a claim on a life insurance policy is not something you do everyday. In fact, for most people, it’s the sort of thing they hopefully only need do a couple of times in their lives. There isn’t much familiarity with the process when the time comes, and each assurance company has its own guidelines to follow, which can add greater confusion if a prior claim filing was experienced through a different company using different guidelines. On top of it all is the attempt by claim filers to cope emotionally with the gravity of the circumstances, while trying to carry on with required business tasks, such as submitting a claim to an insurance company. Trying to follow the company’s directives and figure out the details while being clouded with mourning can be a challenge. As a result, perhaps wrong phone numbers are dialed, or address numbers become transposed on an envelope about to be mailed to the insurance company. The claim itself may suffer from the distracted and possibly mistaken inputting of required information. These reasons are why it’s a good idea to take a portion of an evening to sit down with your family members and discuss the process of claim filing. It’s a smart idea to confirm that each person who can make a claim--typically a spouse or children--has the opportunity to review the process a few times, so that they will have at least some preparation when the day arrives that their assistance is needed. And, really, when the time comes when your family members need to file a claim on your life insurance, you won’t be there to help them through the process and explain what needs to happen. Taking them through the steps now will reduce their difficulties when the actual filing has to occur. Methods of Claim Filing The specifics of how to file a claim on your assurance policy are unique to your cover firm’s own requirements and directives, but in general, there are a few basic parts to the equation. The policy itself must be readily available, or knowledge of its location must be known to family members entrusted with making a claim. Official notation of the death must be registered, and a death certificate obtained. Your survivors need to be able to locate the entry number and registration district of the certificate. Generally, only a spouse or children can submit a claim for consideration. There are often additional requirements, such as proof that the beloved’s departure happened within the domestic mainland, and didn’t take place while using paid passage, such as a transportation hire. It’s a good idea to have set aside references to information that will likely be requested upon the claim’s filing. Identification documents of the deceased (including year of birth) and of the claim filer, evidence of the relationship between the filer and the policyholder (for instance, a marriage certificate), account number of the bank to which payout funds should be released, and, if it exists, a copy of the deceased’s will. Today, life cover claims can be filed electronically with many assurance firms. Still, certain companies still require copies of documents to be posted through the mail, and you might prefer that option, regardless of technological advancements. A great way to set up preparations for your family members is to contact the assurance company yourself, and ask them to demonstrate to you, step by step, the process it specifically requires for submitting a claim on a life cover policy. The better you understand the system, the better you can explain it to those who will be carrying out the procedure, and the smoother the transaction will be. Know Your Claim Making sure your loved ones know the details of filing a life insurance claim is yet another gift from you to them: it helps to release at least some of the anxiety they will be experiencing as they go about the business of managing final arrangements."
7,Gas and Electricity Price Comparison and Reducing Your Energy Bills,finance," In spite of energy bills having being on the up for decades, a number of people are still paying out more than they need to for their gas and electricity. Many people are afraid of switching to a new provider because they think that the process might be excessively complicated or time consuming. However, with numerous financial comparison sites to choose from to help you get started, you can now carry out a gas and electricity price comparison in a matter of minutes and then switch online. There is minimal effort involved on your part, it doesn't cost you anything to use such services and you could end up saving hundreds of pounds per year on your utilities. The following takes a look at switching your energy supplier as well as some other innovative ways to cut down on your bills. Comparing Prices and Switching to a New Provider For many people, the biggest saving when it comes to energy bills is simply to switch supplier. If you have never really paid much attention to your energy supplier and tariff, you will very likely be paying higher bills than you really need to. By using a financial comparison site, you can find a range of quotes to compare from all of the energy companies and tariffs available in your area. While the amount you can expect to save varies greatly, most people who have not switched to a new energy supplier before will find that they can save something. One of the United Kingdom's most popular financial comparison websites, confused.com, for example, claims that ten percent of its customers saved over £440 per year after switching through them! To get started comparing prices, choose your preferred energy comparison service (a search in Google will reveal plenty of options) and provide them with your postcode. You will also need some information about your current energy provider and consumption. A recent bill should provide everything you need. If you do not have a recent bill, then ask your current supplier for an estimate of how much you can expect to spend over the next billing period. While you are on the phone to them, it is also a good idea to tell them that you are thinking of switching. They probably won't want to lose a customer, in which case they might even offer you a better deal than the one you are planning to switch to. Before switching, be sure to review the cancellation terms of your current contract. Many energy companies charge a cancellation fee. If you are on a dual fuel tariff (meaning that you get both your gas and electricity from the same company), you may even be charged two fees. When you are ready to switch, you can do so online. You will be given a date when the switchover will be completed and the company will send out a contract for you to sign. During this time, you will also need to cancel your existing supply. The entire process should take about two weeks with a further three weeks in which you can change your mind and revert to your old supplier. Cutting Down on Energy Usage at Home No matter whether you switch to a new provider or not, the biggest savings on your energy bills are under your control. Changing a few habits in order to cut down on your gas and electricity usage can save you a significant amount of money without you having to sacrifice too much. Turning your heating down during the winter months to the minimum level you are comfortable with can save the most amount of money, but it is also important to remember that even the smaller things all help. Try doing your laundry with cold water, air-drying your clothes, defrosting food in the open and using energy-efficient lightbulbs. These are just some ways to cut down on your energy consumption. Modern electrical appliances tend to be much more energy-efficient than older ones, particularly those which have not been well maintained throughout their lifespans. Sometimes, replacing your main appliances such as washing machines and fridges can be worth the cost."
8,Profit from the Feed-In Tariff When You Buy Solar Panels,finance," The feed-in tariff, or the FiT scheme as it is commonly known as, is a special government grant available for those who install solar panels to provide energy for their homes. The scheme was first introduced in April of 2010 as an incentive to raise awareness of clean and renewable energy and encourage more people to invest in solar panels for their homes. The feed-in tariff ultimately allows you to earn money by generating renewable energy after you buy solar panels. This money provides an addition incentive to the amount of energy costs saved through the use of solar power. Because you won't be as reliant on the National Grid, the feed-in tariff is effectively a clean energy cashback program. Who Is Eligible for the Feed-In Tariff? To be eligible to apply for the scheme, you will need to be using some form of renewable power source in your home. By far the most popular method of generating renewable energy at home is the use of solar panels. However, wind energy and hydroelectric systems, as well as various other rarer zero- to low-carbon technologies, are also covered by the scheme. To apply, the installation must be located in the United Kingdom and it must be accompanied by a government-approved meter. Almost every type of commercial or residential property is eligible provided that the power system produces under five megawatts of power. Although the scheme was only introduced in April, 2010, anyone who installed a solar panel system after July, 2009 is also eligible to receive the full rate from the feed-in tariff. For older systems which were constructed before this time, a reduced rate feed-in tariff may still be available under certain circumstances. If you have already had solar panels installed for quite some time, you still shouldn't end up missing out. How Much Can I Earn from My Solar Panels? How much you can earn depends on the type of technology you are using, the date when it was installed and the amount of power that it produces. The average home solar power installation generates anything between two and four kilowatts of electricity and for those falling into this bracket, the rate, as of May, 2013, was 15.44 pence per kilowatt hour. This is some 63% lower than the rate paid out in 2011. Although the rates can fluctuate enormously, those who join the scheme will be able to receive payments from it for a total of twenty years. Currently, a typical three-bedroom home with a three kilowatt solar panel system can expect to generate enough electricity to cut their electricity bills by up to fifty percent and receive almost £400 per year from the feed-in tariff. At this rate, you can normally expect to pay off the initial investment in about eight or nine years. After this point, you will likely be profiting unless your household consumes a particularly great amount of electricity. It is also worthwhile mentioning that installing solar panels will also add value to your home by making it more energy-efficient. To get a better idea of how much you can save on your electricity and how much you will receive from the FiT scheme, take a look at one of the many online feed-in tariff calculators. How to Apply for the Feed-In Tariff Before you can apply for the feed-in tariff, you will need to ensure that you are eligible by installing your solar panels. You will need to have the system professionally installed by an approved company which can also provide you with a certification proving that the installation meets all of the standards laid out by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS). When you have the necessary documentation and your solar panel installation is up and running, you will need to approach your electricity provider to take the next step. Alternatively, you can switch to a new provider. As you will still be using some power from the National Grid in most cases, switching to a new provider might save you even more money. Regardless of which energy provider you use, they will be able to organize the payment of the feed-in tariff."
9,You can Stretch Your Dollar Even More!,finance," Understanding finances is very important for all of us, especially in this economy we are living nowadays. Many are going through so much stress because of this very reason. We definitely need the necessary information in order to prepare ourselves to be able to deal with such a complex market. Gone are the days when we use to do simple business, now we need to equipped ourselves with the necessary tools in order to maximize our hard-earned money. With so much technological advance, we need to understand how financial systems work in order to protect our money. We have to act diligently and wisely to be able to stay afloat and achieve our goals. The more we learn about the market, the better prepared we will be to face any given situation. When we understand the principles of finances and how they work, it enables us to manage our hard-earned money prudently . We have to be able to negotiate to the last cent, just like every business does to maximize their margin of profit, we as well need to equipped ourselves in order to increase the purchasing power of  our dollar, and be able to get rid of the debts. I always look or negotiate for the best deal. One time I had to fix my kitchen stove, and I am not the person that when something breaks down, immediately goes out to get a new one without exhausting all available resources first to avoid  unnecessary spending, unless you have plenty of money and decide to upgrade or get a new one, however, this was not the case, my stove was in good condition, and one of the parts when bad, well, I decided to fix it. Once I knew the part that was needed to repair it, I began to search for it. Some local store had it for $65.00, but  like I say, you have got to stretch your dollar, and I knew I could do better than that, so I kept searching, then I found another store which had it listed for $54.00, however, I continue my search hoping to get a better deal, I found an even better price for some $23.00, since I am a very persistent and optimistic person, I decided to look even further, to the point where I purchase the part for $12.00. Awesome right! Now, you do the math and calculate how much I saved for taking the time to do a little search, which I did from the comfort of my home. I am not saying that this will always be the case, never the less, a little bit of effort will not hurt, and you will most likely always end up finding a better deal, all you need to do is,  be willing to put some effort, and I am sure that most of the times it will be worth the effort. Create a habit of not taking the first offer you find in your way, some people, when they need something, they just go out there and take the very first offer they find, or they listen to the sales person, and as a result they think  there is no other choice. Keep in mind this is your hard earned money, you probably had to work very hard to earn it, and now you have to strive to defended it to the last cent.  Remember, you need to stretch your dollar, and gain control over your debts. Always do your homework, discipline yourself, be proactive, prepare to negotiate, be persistent, and let God gives you the wisdom to handle all situations."

11,Ask the Right Questions When Applying for a 0 Balance Transfer No Fee Credit Card,finance," If you are considering applying for a 0 balance transfer no fee credit card, there are a number of factors to bear in mind. While the mention of a 0% interest rate might be enticing, the low rate offered should not be your only consideration. There are a number of factors that can influence whether transferring your entire credit card balance to a new card is actually a good idea or not. By paying attention to additional factors, you can make an informed decision regarding your credit card status. How Long is the 0% Offer Valid? This is one of the key factors to bear in mind. Just because a credit card company is offering a 0% interest rate on balance transfers, accepting that rate might not be in your best interest if that rate is only good for three months. You need to read all of the fine print on any credit card offer to ensure that the low rate does not expire in a very short period of time. If you will only be free of interest charges for three to six months, switching your existing credit card balance to a new card might not be advisable. If your interest rate is going to be significantly higher once your 0% rate expires, you might be better off sticking with your current credit card company. Will a Transfer Fee Be Applied to Your Balance Transfer? This is another extremely important question to answer. For those lacking experience with balance transfer credit cards, the concept of having to pay a fee to transfer debt from one card to another could be a foreign concept. While not all charge card companies impose a balance transfer fee, some companies do impose this fee and call it a variety of different names. One company might label this fee as a balance transfer fee while another might chalk it up to an administration fee. Just because you think you are signing up for a no fee for balance transfers credit card, if that fee is simply labelled as something else, you might still be incurring an unexpected charge. Prior to accepting a new credit card, make sure you that all promises are in writing so that you are not met with unexpected financial surprises. What is Your APR Going to Be After Your 0% Grace Period? Before you agree to accept a new credit card promising you no balance transfer fee and an introductory interest rate of 0%, determine exactly what your interest rate will be once your grace period has ended. Some credit card companies will offer rates as low as 12.9%. Others can have interest rates as high as 24.9%. Having such a wide disparity in interest rate offers can make deciding upon a 0% interest rate card a difficult decision indeed. While you might initially be enticed by not having to pay any interest on your current credit card debt, your enchantment with your new card might start to wane when you suddenly have to start paying a significantly higher rate. If you understand what your eventual interest rate will be before you sign up for a new card, you can make an informed decision that suits your needs now and into the future. Is Your APR Guaranteed? Once you know what your interest rate will be after your 0% offer ends, find out how long your new annual percentage rate will be applicable to your account. If interest rates climb from 0% to 12.9% to 24.9% within the course of a year, you will want to take this information into account prior to completing your balance transfer. By having the appropriate knowledge in advance, you can make a financial decision that you can live with over the long haul. While some individuals might mistakenly assume that their new non-promotional rate is guaranteed for a year, this is not necessarily the case. By asking the right questions in advance, your decision to accept or decline a 0% interest rate card can be an easier decision to make. These are just some of the factors to pay attention to when you are considering a 0 balance transfer no fee credit card. If fully understood in advance, accepting an offer of 0% interest can be a wise decision indeed. By paying attention and conducting a little investigative digging, your financial future can be brighter because you paid attention to the details."
12,Are You Dazzled By Cash Back Credit Card Offers? How To Choose A Card And Come Out Ahead,finance," Nothing makes a credit card more enticing than the promise of receiving cash back with every purchase. Such an arrangement makes perfect sense in the minds of people who’re going to use their credit cards with or without incentives. But grabbing at the first cash back credit card offer that comes your way could create problems for your finances. Points and privileges still have their place, but card issuers recognize the power of luring consumers with cold, hard cash. There’s no question that the credit card industry is still immensely profitable. Issuers manage to draw sensible consumers in with promises of free money and juicy bonuses. But responsible consumers need to consider why card issuers would make these offers to begin with. Although it might be gratifying to think that they want the best for us, the reality is that we can’t count on them being so kind. Cash back cards may not be all you expected if you don’t choose the right card. Pay attention to the following points to come out ahead of the credit card company. Don’t Make It A Game Your ploy to open several new cards just to cash in on the signup bonuses then cancel them after you receive the cash will backfire. Opening and closing credit cards at random will hurt your credit score. Remember that your credit utilization ratio is factored into your final score so any increase in that percentage will cause your score to drop. Apart from that, you’ll forfeit your rebates on the cards if you don’t meet certain limits. And if you overspend just to qualify for the rebates, you’ll hurt your finances more than anything else. Do The Math Don’t get sucked in by attractive 2-6 percent cash back offers. The average cash back rebate is 1 percent, so be wary of unusually high offers. If you fail to read the conditions of those high percentage rebates, you’ll realize too late that they’re restrictive or almost impossible to obtain. For instance, some cards promise 5 percent returns on groceries. But if you do most of your grocery shopping at a membership warehouse, you won’t qualify for the rebate – card issuers typically exclude some types of stores from their programs. Revolving categories also make it harder for card holders to keep track and get the benefits of high percentage deals. What’s worse, is that you have to sign up to be included in the higher rebate categories. So if you go shopping without explicit confirmation from the credit card company, the rewards will never materialize. In other cases, you have to agree to high annual fees in order to qualify for the inflated rebates. According to reports, over 65% percent of card holders never cash in on their rebates. The cloudy terms and constant roadblocks by card issuers are both reasons some consumers give up in frustration. Read The Fine Print Every card has its own set of rules as it relates to redemptions, expirations and forfeitures. For example, a late payment could lead to the loss of months of accumulated cash back rebates. Imposed pay increments are another way that card issuers hold back some of your money. So if your account has an irregular amount – as often happens- it will sit in the account until you reach the required minimum. Card issuers also switched up the cash-ins, so cash back may not necessarily mean cash back. Your rebates may be applied to your statement or issued as a gift card to a popular retailer. Don’t assume that every credit card company will disburse your payment as a cheque in the mail. These glaringly obvious tactics used by some providers make it all the more important that you go through the fine print before you sign up for the card. Get Help Before You Sign Up If finding the right cash back credit card seems like a lot of work, there are plenty of good consumer focused comparison sites that will help you figure it out. Just provide some details on your spending patterns and your needs, and you’ll get results that are a best fit for those needs."
13,5 Questions to Ask When Applying for a Credit Card for Bad Credit,finance," No matter how you look at it, a credit card application can be intimidating. For the folks who have bad credit, applying for a credit card can spring up even more anxiety, simply because many are not 100% sure that they will be approved. Fortunately, signing up for a credit card for bad credit can ease all of that tension and stress, since the approval process is much more forgiving than a traditional card. Like anything else, however, bad credit credit cards have their fair share of things that you need to look out for. That doesn’t mean all cards are bad, but just because you are nearly guaranteed approval does not mean that you should jump at the first offer you see. You’ve got to do your due diligence by shopping around and asking questions – questions that need answered before you sign on the dotted line. Not sure what type of questions you should be asking? Don’t worry. Instead, just take a look below to see 5 of the most common things you should ask any subprime credit card provider before you decide to make the leap! #1 – Will There Be Other Fees in Addition to the Annual Fee? When you’re credit is in the dumps, getting away from an annual fee is going to be tough to do. That’s why many of the bad credit credit cards out there come loaded with one. So while you won’t be able to get away from that, make sure you check to see if there are any other fees that you might have to pay (per month or per year). For example, some credit cards will charge you one-time administrative or program fees. Others will charge you a monthly maintenance fee, whereas others will only charge you a flat annual fee. Once you sign on the dotted line, you’re essentially locked into these fees, so always make sure you’re checking for the fees you are expected to pay (usually found deep within the terms and conditions of the card you’re applying for). #2 – What Would Your Minimum Credit Line Be? Most subprime credit card companies will offer a minimum and maximum line of credit, all of which is based on your current credit score. On the other hand, there are companies that will cap the opening limit to a specific amount. If you’re shopping around for a number of different cards, this is something that you want to pay attention to, especially if you’re looking for the largest limit possible right out of the gate. #3– How Often Can You Request a Credit Limit Increase? Credit limit increases are great for one good reason – they expand the amount of credit you have available, which lowers your utilization ratio and raises your credit score. Because of this, it’s essential that the card you choose comes with the opportunity to apply for periodic credit limit increases. As a general rule of thumb, a company that will review your credit for an increase every 6 months is ideal. Companies who don’t perform any reviews and keep your limit the same for as long as you hold the card are not worth the trouble. Remember – more credit limit reviews = more opportunities to boost your credit score. #4 – If You Qualify for a Credit Limit Increase, Will You Have to Pay for it? Sometimes, getting your credit limit increased will come at a price. Some bad credit credit card lenders will be more than happy to do a review of your credit for a potential limit increase – as long as you’re willing to pay for it, of course. When faced with a situation like this, your decision will ultimately boil down to what the credit limit increase can do for you. If the amount is significant enough to lower your utilization and explode your available credit, it may be a small price to pay for a dramatic boost in your credit score. Not every credit card out there will charge for a credit limit increase, but it’s good to be aware of it many lenders still actively practice it. The last thing you want to do is get an increase in your limit, only to be shocked by a fee on your next statement. #5 – Are There Any Special Perks Associated with the Card? In the world of credit cards for bad credit, finding a card with a variety of different perks is going to be hard, but they do exist. Some cards may offer you points or cash back on various purchases, helping you earn a little something in exchange for your loyalty as a customer. Others might offer discounts on travel, dining, car rentals and more. It’s not a huge deal breaker, but a card that offers certain perks over another may be worth looking into."
14,Acing Any Credit Card’s Instant Decision Process,finance," Today, when you apply for credit cards, instant decision algorithms tell you very quickly whether you’ve been accepted or not. The banks have tightened their credit card approvals process considerably since the financial crisis, though. The fact that instant decision systems exist, though, shouldn’t lead you to think that passing a credit card verification process is simple. Whether you choose to submit your application online or in person, the fact that you’ve applied appears on your credit report. You don’t want to apply unless you feel that you have a good chance of being accepted. Your first step in applying for a credit card should be to get a soft pre-verification check done. Many banks and other personal finance websites provide the service. A soft check doesn’t pull your credit report – it merely evaluates your chances of passing a proper credit card verification check with whatever information you are able to fill in. If your pre-verification check seems less than certain about your chances, you need to do everything you can to improve your chances. Only then should you apply in earnest. What Can You Do To Improve Your Chances? The health of your credit file is an important part of how easily you pass an instant decision for a credit card. Before you fill out an application, it would be a good idea to check out your credit yourself and to build it up as well as you can. If you have missed payments recently, you should make sure that you pay regularly for a few months before you attempt to apply for a credit card. Once You Have Worked On Your Credit Rating… To even begin to qualify for a credit card, you need to be a UK resident and at least 18 years of age (many banks require that applicants be 25 years of age). Depending on what kind of credit card you are applying for, a regular income and some financial history may also be required. A part of your success passing a card application decision comes down to doing a good job providing accurate information on the form. Since the banks always ask for multiple documents to back up the information that you provide, any mistake that you make will be caught out. Keep documents on hand for the following. Identification that shows your name, title and contact information You will need details of your job on hand – what your job title is, whether you are employed full-time or part-time, the name of your employer and the relevant contact information. The longer you have served with the same employer, the better your chances getting a good credit card – someone with a steady job is considered a good bet. You’ll need to provide some financial information. You need proof of what your exact salary is and where your bank account is. You should have the name of the name of the bank that you’ve operated regularly for the longest time. A long banking record works in your favor. You could need to provide details of any loans that you have to your name. You need to be careful not to omit any known loan. The credit card provider could easily verify the information that you provide. Make Sure That You Apply For The Right Kind Of Credit Card Many credit card applications end in rejection simply for the reason that applicants applying for cards aim far higher than they could ever qualify for. If you have an average income, for instance, it makes no sense applying for a high-end prestige card. Sometimes, it’s the banks that choose a credit card for you. If you have good credit, a bank may approach you with an offer of a preapproved credit card. Even if you have a bank choosing a credit card for you, you still do need to check it out yourself to see if it’s the right card for your needs. Does it offer you a reasonable APR? Is the grace period a fair one? Are the rewards and balance transfer rules the right kind for your needs? With today’s credit cards, instant decision approvals make a process that used to be tedious and time-consuming easy and efficient. It’s up to the consumer to use these offers responsibly."
15,"Compare Credit Cards - Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor Credit",finance," In the post industrial world, it is very difficult to get by without a credit card.  Even if you have cash on hand, you often cannot check into a hotel or rent a car without providing a credit card. However, all credit cards are not created equal. It is wise to compare credit cards to attempt to obtain the best possible rates as well as perks that are relevant to you.  Nonetheless, the options for credit cards that are actually available to you may vary widely according to whether you have excellent, good, fair or poor credit scores. Major Credit Score Levels The most commonly used credit scores are those generated by Fair Isaac Corporation, and which are called FICO scores. FICO scores range from 350 to 850, with higher scores corresponding to better credit levels. Exact categories vary by creditor, but in general, FICO scores fall into four ranges: Excellent, Good, Fair and Poor. Excellent scores are generally 750 and above. Good scores range from 660 to 749. Fair scores range from 620 to 659. Scores below 620 are generally considered to be Poor. Your credit rating and your FICO scores have a major influence on whether you are able to obtain credit cards as well as the interest rates you must pay. Likewise, the terms and perks that are available to you vary according to your credit scores. As you might expect, the best credit cards are available to those with Good or Excellent credit, while individuals with Poor credit often have few credit card options available. Cards for Excellent Credit If you have excellent credit, you have your pick of credit cards. Depending on your preferences, you can choose cards with no annual fee or cards with low interest rates. If you travel extensively, a credit card that is affiliated with a major airline may provide useful perks, such as free checked baggage or early boarding.  If you prefer to receive cash back or rewards from your credit card, the rewards levels offered for cards that are available to you are more generous than for anyone else. If you are stuck with a balance on a card with a high interest rate, a card that offers interest free balance transfers may represent significant savings for you. You will also probably qualify for zero percent interest rate credit cards, which can also represent significant savings. Your main concern is to avoid getting in over your head, which could jeopardize the excellent FICO score you worked so hard to build. Cards for Good Credit With Good credit, airline affiliated credit cards may be out of reach for you, unless your FICO score is on the high end of the range for Good credit. However, you still have a number of attractive options open for you. For instance, many merchants that offer cash back and reward credit cards readily welcome your business. You may also qualify for zero percent interest rate credit cards, if you are willing to shop around. Balance transfer cards may also be an option, although the interest rates that you are able to obtain are probably less attractive than interest rates for balance transfer cards that are available to customers with Excellent credit. Cards for Fair Credit If your FICO score falls in the range for Fair credit, you are unlikely to qualify for airline affiliated credit cards, zero interest rate credit cards or balance transfer cards. However, the odds are better than average that you can qualify for a cash back or rewards credit card, especially if your FICO score is at the high end of the Fair credit category range. You may also be able to negotiate a reduction in the interest rates for your credit cards after several months or a year, if you maintain a consistent record of on-time payments. Cards for Poor Credit If you have Poor credit, obtaining any type of credit card will be a challenge. If your FICO score is over 600, you may be able to qualify for an unsecured card; however the card will probably carry a high interest rate and hefty fees, yet have a very low credit limit. It is more likely that you will have to settle for a secured credit card. You should compare credit cards – secured versus unsecured – and make an honest assessment about which card represents the best deal for you. The good news is that with time and a good payment record, you will eventually qualify for unsecured credit cards with a decent interest rate."
16,The Liberty Reserve case  And its influence about  E-commerce,finance," Federal prosecutors shut down Liberty Reserve, the alternative-payment network under the Patriot Act low. The patriot act low was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001 as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The act expanded the Secretary of the Treasury’s authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving  foreign individuals and entities. Liberty Reserve was one of world's largest web based payment processing and money transfer    system. The American Justice Department says that since the founding of Liberty Reserve, in 2006, it has handled more than fifty-five million transactions totaling more than six billion dollars, and as of last year it had more than a million users. Liberty Reserve operated like a bank. The deposits from customers could only be performed in its own propriety currency. Customers could open an account with Liberty Reserve, providing the bank  with a name, which could be fake, and an e-mail address. The key to the scheme was that you couldn’t then deposit money directly into the account. Instead, the customer had to work through middlemen, who were called ""exchangers."" These were typically unlicensed person in countries like Malaysia, Nigeria, and Vietnam, who bought Liberty Reserves currency in bulk from Liberty Reserve. The customer paid the ""exchangers"" in dollars (or other currency) for a certain sum of Liberty Reserves currency. The currency deposited into the customer account. When the customer wanted to withdraw funds, the process worked in reverse, perhaps with an exchanger in a different country. (Liberty Reserve itself took a one-per-cent exchange fee on transactions, while the exchangers typically charged five per cent or more per transaction.) The point of doing it this way was that the Liberty Reserve bank would have no identifying data for the customer (no record of how or from where the customer sent the money), since the deposits and withdrawals were all done through the exchangers, In addition, they allowed customers to  do international payments from one account to another via the internet with almost no questions asked. Therefore Liberty Reserve was, by all accounts the most popular form of payment,   in the cybercrime underground. These news sharpen the need for reliable and Sobering companies in the international payments field, this field has been a tremendous development at the  recent decades. In the past, before the era of the Internet and fast communication, when the banks and authorities had absolute control over banking services, it was impossible to manage without the banks. Subsequently a cartel of banks was formed, manifested by very high commissions for all various services they provided  -continuing today despite the increasing competition in some services that previously were dominated exclusively by banks  - , starting from any ordinary transaction any person performs in the account up to international payments that one wishes to make between accounts worldwide. Following the enormous technological development that occurred in recent decades in the computing realm in general and particularly the Internet, focusing on satellite and optic fiber communication, a simple, easy and convenient way was created to perform many transactions that previously were impossible due to the absence of such means. One of the sectors accelerating greatly in recent years is that of  international payments general and particularly credit transfers carried out by private companies. The great advantage these companies have over banks is that they offer significantly lower commission fees than required by banks as well as saving long waiting time wasted waiting in line to receive the service. Although in principle there is a natural and understandable concern regarding performing transactions via the Internet due to fear of fraud and impostures, a number of effective mechanisms were created to ensure safe online use: In order to check the legality of the website and that the website is official and is recognized by the authorities, one should see that the website contains the approval signature of the authority responsible for the supervision of the economics and finance fields as well as the confirmation number. The purpose and function of the authority is to make sure all the activities carried out by that agent are legal and regulated by the various authorities And to make sure that  Events like   Liberty Reserve,  would Not occur. In order to verify the legality of the company you wish to work with, look for the approval of  supervisory authority and the confirmation number that must appear on that company’s website."
17,Home Flood Insurance - Rising Premiums From Redrawn Flood Maps,finance," Shortly after Hurricane Sandy tormented the East Coast causing massive flood damage, a new federal law dictating flood insurance premium rates was set to take effect. Under the bill, home flood insurance premiums were set to increase dramatically. Furthermore, the law sets rules for the rebuilding of homes affected by flooding so that they are more difficult and often more expensive. The families and individuals that were affected by Hurricane Sandy are the first group of people to see the downfalls of the new law that has already taken affect. Flood insurance premiums have the ability to rise to upwards of $30,000 for an annual rate. This leaves many of these families questioning if it is even worth rebuilding or repairing their homes because of the higher standards and specifications set out by the new law. This problem exacerbates one of the main issues before the storm even struck. Many families and individuals do not even know the high amount of risk they are in even if they pay their flood insurance premiums. They are not aware that their insurance will not pay for the new specifications to be completed. This includes some of the repairs and the additional cost to raising homes above the base flood elevation level. Using New York as an example for the incomplete use of flood elevation maps, the Empire State has not done anything to rectify the problem between homes built before the first flood maps were developed. In New York’s case, the first flood map was designed in 1974. Thus, this leads to families not paying the actual flood insurance rate. Instead, the rates are heavily subsidized because the maps are not completely utilized by Federal Emergency Management Agency. In other cases, the maps are outdated and do not reflect the actual danger some of the homes are in. The new flood maps that are being developed in relation to this new law are taking some residents by surprise. They are going to see their premiums rise dramatically. For families to try and limit the amount their rates rise, they are going to have to either move away or attempt to change the elevation of their homes. Changing the elevation of a residency is not an easy task. Raising a home only a couple of feet higher can cost over $100,000. However, some homes are easier to boost higher than others. Homes that are built on slab foundations have a distinct disadvantage when attempting to get above the base flood elevation level and it can cost them tens of thousands of dollars more. Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about the rising home flood insurance premiums is that a lot of families are going to be forced to boost up their homes. They will literally have no other choice than moving out altogether. For most families, an increase of $30,000 to their annual rate will be financially out of reach. The amount it costs for repair and elevation change pales to the small amount insurance companies are willing to pay out for construction costs. Most companies typically offer an additional $30,000 for the costs of raising a home’s base elevation under the new law. However, if this would only cover the additional increase to the family’s annual premium the family would have to pay for construction out of pocket. In some areas the government is beginning to implement programs called community development block grants. This would allow homes to be bought at their market values before the disaster has struck. This would provide some relief for families that find they cannot support the additional costs to their insurance premiums that come with reconstruction under the implementation of the new law. However, many do not believe these programs will be able to handle the full amount of people who are affected by these types of natural disasters without some relief in their annual premiums."
18,Online websites security and its impact on the money transfers market,finance," In the past, before the era of Internet and fast communication, when the banks and various authorities had total control of all banking services, it was impossible to do anything without the banks. Subsequently a cartel of banks was formed. It manifested in very high commissions for all services provided, starting from any ordinary transaction any person performs in the account to international payments that any person wants to make between accounts worldwide. This situation continues to date despite the increasing competition in some of the services that previously were the managed exclusively by the banks. Following the tremendous technological development that occurred in recent decades concerning computing as well as the Internet in general and satellite communication and optic fibers in particular, a simple option was created, an option that is convenient, easy and enables performing many actions that were impossible in the past due to the luck of technological means without these measures. E-commerce is one of the fastest growing fields in past years. Websites such as Ebay and Alibaba became the largest retail companies worldwide. In addition there has been much development in the global international payments field and an increasing number of companies are participating in this field. The huge advantage these companies have over the banks is that they offer significantly lower commission fees as well as time not wasted waiting in line. Their advantage is enabled by using the Internet to perform all actions. Along with the increasing development in online trading and online money transfers the risks of Internet use has increased. Concerns regarding hackers in cyberspace have become substantial and widespread. These threats are divided into two main groups performing various types of crime. The first group is composed of threats by hacker groups that are of political nature and the attacks they perform are aimed against government websites or private websites that have an ideology that they oppose to.  These attacks are carried out mainly by preventing service distribution (ddos), which causes slow access to the website and may prevent access, or by hacking the website and corrupting it. The second group is made of threats posed by criminal hackers and other various groups that engage in criminal activity such as theft of various data, business data, secret information, and especially credit cards details. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in websites offering e-commerce options such international payments via the Internet. Although the above mentioned concerns of theft and fraud while performing actions via the Internet are natural and understandable, a number of efficient mechanisms for safe online usage were developed: In order to solve the security issues and thus allow safe and efficient use of a website it is necessary to have security protocol (SSL - Secured Sockets Layer) that enables to encrypt data sent to and from the website, thereby creating a secure communication channel between two computers. SSL protocol is based on the A - symmetric method, containing two keys. This enables the encrypted message to be decrypted only by the second party and vice versa. This is called public key encryption - private key. In addition, the protocol verifies that the server to which you are connected is indeed the correct server and it allows to make sure that the information sent from your PC will be delivered in its entirety to the website, without error and without disruption. If the server finds that there is an error of any kind in the information transmitted, it will require automatic replay from your browser. This enables a secure transmission of information, without any unwanted ""affiliates"" … Another advantage of the SSL protocol is that any and every server that wants to use this protocol must issue an SSL certificate. There is a company issuing these certificates. This company also verifies the identity of the person or party requesting the certificate. The usage of these certificates allows the user to transfer sensitive data to a particular server and to verify that this is indeed the destination server and not an impostor seeking to steal the sensitive data. This is performed by the browser requests identification; the server sends the browser a copy of its SSL certificate; the browser checks whether it trusts the SSL certificate and if so, it sends a message to the server; the server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL encrypted session; encrypted data is shared between the browser and the server. In addition the website must be secured by anti-virus software that will prevent uploading viruses and spy-ware to the website. When you enter the payment page of the website, make sure that the address bar includes ""https://"" and that a yellow lock icon appears on the page. If this icon is on the web page the browser identifies it as a secured website. In order to identify the encryption method, position the cursor over the lock icon and a small label that states the type of security."
19,Advantages and Disadvantages of Term Life Insurance,finance," If you are looking for ways to keep your family's finances safe, you have probably thought about purchasing life insurance. This can be one of the most effective tools for protecting your family against financial disaster if you pass away. With the wide variety of life insurance products available, though, choosing a policy can be a confusing endeavor. Many agents and brokers will tell you that purchasing a whole life policy is the best option because it can provide your loved ones with an inheritance even if you live past age 100. Although this might be an attractive option in some cases, you might also consider a term life insurance policy. A term policy offers several advantages over whole life and other types of permanent life insurance policies: Obtaining the term coverage you need at a lower price leaves more room in your budget for bills and living expenses. It also leaves more room for retirement savings and investments, which can provide additional financial protection for your family. In some cases, you can even qualify if you have a serious health condition. Some term policies, referred to as guaranteed issue policies, accept all applicants regardless of their health. Of course, guaranteed issue life insurance carries more restrictions, costs more than standard term policies, and typically comes with low benefit limits; however, this can be an acceptable term life option if you cannot obtain a policy through other means. Of course, although term life offers several advantages, there are also disadvantages as well: Unless you convert your term policy to a whole life policy, your coverage only lasts for a certain number of years. Most term life policies are designed to cover policyholders for 10, 20, or 30 years. If you outlive the policy, you will have to purchase a replacement policy at the end of the term to continue protecting your family. If you purchase a replacement policy or convert your term coverage to a whole life policy, your new rates will be based on your age at the time of conversion or replacement. As you might expect, rates for term life insurance increase as you age. For this reason, your premiums will be significantly higher than they were when you originally purchased your term policy. Also, your new rates will reflect any medical conditions you may have developed since the initiation of your original term life insurance policy. There is no cash value accumulation within a term insurance policy. ""Cash value"" refers to the amount within a policy that a policyholder can borrow against, withdraw, receive as a benefit, or use to pay future premiums. Simply put, term insurance is ""use it or lose it"" coverage. If you die within the policy term, your beneficiary will receive the stated death benefit. If you do not, you will not receive any benefit or refund of premiums. Because a term policy both offers advantages and carries disadvantages, you should talk to a licensed insurance agent or broker before purchasing coverage. Your broker or agent can help you decide if term insurance is the right kind of policy for you."
20,Avoiding Four Common Life Insurance Mistakes,finance," Choosing the right life insurance policy can help you and your dependents feel more secure about the future. However, there are certain common mistakes that can seriously impact on the likelihood of your policy paying out in the way that you would expect. Read on to find out how to avoid these errors and learn how to ensure that your loved ones will be adequately supported in the event that you are no longer there to provide for them. Low-start life insurance policies often look appealing at first glance, as they typically come out at the top of any comparison list in terms of price. However, there is an important reason why these policies are so affordable. Specifically, as the term of the policy goes on, the monthly premium will rise. In just a few years, your policy may be much more expensive than the least cost-effective policy featured in your original comparison chart. Level-term policies are a much better choice, as your monthly premium is guaranteed to remain consistent. If the price of a life insurance policy is particular low but the policy is not a low-start policy, it may be a reviewable policy. This type guarantees a fixed premium for just five to ten years, and after this point you can expect the policy to be attached to a new price. Often, this new price will be extremely steep. Once again, level-term policies are a better bet. While you may think that telling a few white lies about your medical history or current health condition might be a good way to save some money, this type of dishonesty can lead to the invalidation of your entire policy. As a result, your dependents may get an unpleasant shock when the policy does not pay out after your death. If you are concerned about a particularly serious illness or other on-going health problem, you should know that life insurance is attainable even if it is more expensive and trickier to arrange. In many cases, a specialist broker will be the best choice when you are looking for cover that applies to your health situation, but certain charities can also give advice on common illnesses (such as heart disease and cancer). In addition, make sure that you tell the truth about specific lifestyle choices and factors that may influence your policy. For example, do not lie about smoking or drug use. If you are married or living with a partner, you may think that the natural (and most sensible) choice will be to opt for a joint life insurance policy that covers both of your lives. Some of these policies pay out when the first person dies, while others pay out only after both partners have passed away. So-called ‘first-death policies’ will help to provide for your family in the event that either of you dies, which can be useful if you need to pay off a mortgage or have dependents who were heavily reliant on the income of your partner. Meanwhile, ‘second-death policies’ are often used to cover things like anticipated inheritance tax. However, is worth noting that you and your partner may actually get the best value for money from purchasing two distinct life insurance policies. Firstly, if you opt for a joint policy that ends when your partner dies, you may end up paying huge amounts of extra money in order to buy fresh coverage in old age. Secondly, it is seldom more expensive to buy two policies. Thirdly, your dependents can expect twice the pay-out if you have two policies and you both die within the terms of those policies."

1,Switching from Whole Life to Term – Some Points to Consider,finance," You may have heard that term life insurance is generally a better value than whole life. All else being equal, the premiums on a term life policy tend to be quite a bit lower than those on a whole life policy with the same death benefit. That means new insurance shoppers can generally get more for bang for their life insurance buck by choosing a term life policy over a whole life option. The calculation can be a bit trickier, however, for those who already have a whole life policy in place. Many young people are sold whole life policies by overzealous salespeople, and those consumers may end up with policies that cost more than they should have. Insurance salespeople may even sell whole life insurance to those who do not need the coverage – like young working adults with no dependents. If you are one of those consumers with a whole life policy, you may be wondering what to do with it. Should you cash in the policy and use the proceeds to purchase term life insurance? Should you let the policy remain in place and allow it to continue building value? The answer to these questions is not cut and dried – it requires looking at your individual policy and making some assessments. How Much Have You Invested in the Policy? If you are thinking about closing out a whole life policy, you may want to look at how much you have put into that policy over the years. Get out your annual statements and your checkbook and look at the premiums you have paid through the years. Then look at the value of the policy and how much you would receive if you cashed it out today. If the policy is worth a great deal more than you have put in over the years, it might make sense to hang on to it. Although life insurance is generally not a good investment, there are programs that do quite well. If you are happy with the performance of the policy, it could make sense to keep it. Do You Need Life Insurance Salespeople often tout whole life insurance as a great investment – even for those who do not need life insurance. That means you may have a policy you do not need to protect your family. If you do not have anyone who is dependent on your income, chances are you do not need life insurance at all – either term or whole life. It is important to assess your situation and determine whether or not you even need life insurance coverage. If not, cashing out your existing whole life policy and investing the proceeds elsewhere can be a smart move. Are You a High-Risk Insurance Shopper? If you do need life insurance, you would need to replace that costly whole life policy with term life coverage. If you are young and healthy, that should be a relatively simple endeavor – and one that could save you hundreds of dollars a year in premiums. The task of replacing your existing life insurance policy can be more difficult if you have a condition or personal habit that makes you a higher risk. If you smoke, or if you have a family history of heart disease or cancer, you could find that getting a new policy will be difficult. If you do decide to ditch your whole life policy, you will want to make sure you have a good term life policy in place ahead of time. This will give you a chance to apply for coverage, take any required physicals and get the coverage in place before you make your move. Term life coverage is generally the better deal, but you want to make sure you do not end up uninsured."
2,All About Personal Property Coverage,finance," Personal Property Coverage, also known as Contents Coverage or Coverage C, is the section of your home insurance plan that gives you money to replace any of your personal belongings that are damaged, stolen or destroyed in an event that your insurance plan covers.  Although there are some standard practices when it comes to the Personal Property Coverage part of your plan, there are also some variables and things that you should know to get the most out of your insurance. Let's take a look at what Personal Property Coverage entails. How Does it Work? As mentioned before, this section of your insurance policy takes care of your personal property that is lost or damaged. After the incident that caused the loss of your property occurs, you make a claim with the insurance company for either the cost of replacing your items or their actual cost depending on your plan. The amount of Personal Property Coverage that you need will depend on the value of the property that you are covering. There are limitations on how much you can claim for each type of item. In general, the worth of your Personal Property Coverage will be somewhere between 50% and 75% of your Dwelling Coverage. How Do I Prove What I Lost? The best way to prove your personal property losses to an insurance company is to have a home inventory. This is also an important thing to have when first determining how much of this coverage you will need. A home inventory is essentially a list of all of the items in your home that will be covered by your insurance plan. This includes sections such as furniture, jewelry and electronics. Other things such as clothing and media collections can also be included. In addition to your written home inventory, you should have other forms of proof. This can include receipts, pictures and video. As a rule of thumb, it is good to have as much proof of your items as possible so that you can get the most out of your policy. It is also important to keep your inventory in a safe place outside of your home, such as a safety deposit box or a friend's house. You don't want to risk losing it in the same event that caused you to lose your stuff. What Can I Do About Limits? There are certain limits that determine how much you can claim for each type of item. For example, you can only get so much money for your furniture, and another limit will be assigned to your jewelery. For most people, this will probably be enough. However, you may have a few specific items that are worth significantly more than your other stuff. In order to protect these items, you may need to add on to your plan. For these extra valuable items, you can purchase something called a scheduled endorsement. With a scheduled endorsement, you can pay extra to insure a specific item for a certain amount without having to increase the overall value of your Personal Property Coverage to account for it. Personal Property Coverage is one of the most vital parts of your home insurance plan. Replacing lost and damaged possessions can be a costly, time-consuming process. Be sure to put together a thorough home inventory when getting home insurance so that you have all of your bases covered. Consider all of the points brought up here to help you determine exactly how much insurance you need. Making smart choices with your insurance plan should bring you peace of mind and a good safety net in case of an emergency."
3,Deciding How Much Homeowner’s Insurance Coverage You Need,finance," It seems like such a simple decision, but it can be one fraught with complications: what level of coverage do you need when shopping for homeowner’s insurance? The simple answer is that you need to be covered so you could replace your house and all of your belongings in case they were destroyed in some sort of disaster. Unfortunately, the simple answer isn’t as simple as it sounds. Here are a few things to consider when purchasing a homeowner’s insurance policy. The first thing that likely comes to mind when thinking about what needs to be covered by your home insurance is your home itself. This isn’t as easy as it sounds because you can’t just consider your home’s appraisal value. The cost you paid for your house or the amount you know it appraises for will include the value of the land on which your home sits. Even if your house is destroyed in a fire, your land won’t be, so you need to figure out a way to get the value of your home on its own. The best way to do this is to ask a contractor to estimate how much it would cost to rebuild your home exactly as it is now keeping in mind the cost of materials and labor. Since these costs will change with the market, it’s a good idea to repeat this process yearly to make sure your insurance coverage is always up to date. Once you have the worth of the structural portion of your home figured out, you will want to move on to everything you have in your home. Create a home inventory by making a comprehensive list of everything of any value that you have in your house. Going room by room, categorize everything and figure out how much each item would cost to replace. You should also take pictures or video of everything in your house during this process and store them somewhere offsite such as in a safety deposit box at you bank or virtually in the cloud. This way, if you do experience a loss and need access to your home inventory, it won’t have been destroyed with your house. Remember that your homeowner’s insurance policy will likely place a cap on ""dwelling coverage,"" so make sure that you have a comprehensive enough plan to replace your belongings should it become necessary. Also remember that expensive items like jewelry and art are often have lower liability limits on general policies. If you have large, expensive collections that you want to have protected, bring that up specifically with your insurance agent. Now that you have a number in mind for how much it would cost to replace your house and everything in it, it’s time to start considering a specific policy. You will likely need to choose between an ""actual cash value"" policy and a ""replacement cost"" policy. If you choose a cash value policy, you will be reimbursed for the cost of your home and your possessions at their current market rate with depreciation. This means that if your house burns down but was already in need of some serious repairs, you will get significantly less reimbursement. A replacement cost policy is generally more expensive but guarantees you the amount it would cost to rebuild your home using the same materials it was constructed. It will also pay to replace any of your destroyed items as though they were new. It is also important to find out the exact limitations of your policy when you are buying homeowner’s insurance. Remember that certain natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes may not be covered by all policies. If you live in a high-risk area for a certain type of natural disaster, you need to be sure you have coverage either through your general home insurance policy or through a separate policy you get just for floods, earthquakes, etc. Once you are able to determine exactly what levels of coverage you need for your homeowner’s insurance, you will likely find the process of shopping for the right policy becomes much easier."
4,Online Payment Solutions – Weighing the Drawbacks and Benefits,finance," The rate of online shopping has grown exponentially in the last few years, and has become the norm for many people the world over when it comes to purchasing the products and services they use in their everyday lives. But not everyone is sold on the concept that online shopping is easier than in-store shopping. If you are one of these people, examining the drawbacks and benefits of using an online payment solution to make your purchases might help you decide if shopping via the internet is for you or not. Drawbacks Some technological know-how is required. If you want to shop online with the least amount of problems, you will have to possess some computer and internet basics, such as how to use a computer and the internet (chances are that you have this ability if you are reading this article), how to search for and compare stores and the products they sell, and how to complete a transaction with an online payment solution. Not having these simple skills can make the whole process long, tedious and more effort than it’s worth. The perceived or actual risk of getting hacked. Wherever there exists the request for personal and financial information (like on e-commerce websites), there also may lurk hackers looking for ways to get at this information. The aim of this article is not to scare you away from online shopping, but to let you know that there are inherent threats that you should know about so that you can make a more informed choice. You usually have to open an account. Just about every online shop will ask you to open an account with them. If they are using a third-party online payment solution, then you will have to open an account with that company as well. The purpose of this is not to make online payments tiring and annoying, but to make your subsequent payments instant and easy. No human contact. This can be seen as both a drawback and a benefit, depending on the kind of person you are and how you feel about the task of shopping. Though as a drawback, you will have to be fairly independent when shopping and paying for your product online, so you will be expected to be at least minimally technologically-able. Benefits Convenience. You can shop and pay for your products from the comfort of your home, in your pajamas, with a steaming cup of tea or coffee at your side with the help of an online payment solution.

5,Financial Plan is Important So Why Many of us Don't Have One?,finance," We all love to dream about the future we want, but many of us do not like the idea of organizing our finances and preparing a financial plan. It seems that our dream of our future is the fun part, but planning sounds like tedious and boring work. This is evident by the fact that 65% of individuals do not have a financial plan. A study found that the benefit of having a financial plan is very significant. On average, individuals who had a plan for retirement had two and half times more assets in their retirement than those who did not have a plan. Having a plan is only part of the success equation because working with an advisor and having a financial plan shows that there is a nine to ten times increase in assets than with those who do not work with an advisor and have a financial plan. This may explain why one third of individuals consider winning the lottery as one of their financial strategies to achieving their financial goals. So why do most of us not have a plan? It can’t be because of a lack of awareness since there are many financial institutions that are advertising the importance of planning. There is also a lot of information and material on the subject with millions of results on Google. So when it comes to Financial Planning why is it that we are not prepared?  Well here is a list of the three myths that I have experienced people saying. Myth of Time: In today’s fast paced life we are all starved for time. We are so busy in our everyday activities that we feel that taking time for planning is not available. When it comes to planning there is an upfront commitment of time in identifying your life goals and putting together an action to achieve them, but once you complete these steps then it is just a matter of monitoring your progress as time goes on.  The time commitment is minimal compared to the return you get by working with an advisor and having a plan done as noted above. Myth of Knowledge: The financial world, especially today, may seem too complicated with all the information out there. We are exposed to a lot of information and financial lingo. If you start by telling yourself that it is not too complicated and too hard, then you have no excuse not to do it. You may consider participating in a seminar or a workshop. You can start reading books that talk about financial matters. Soon you will learn that the financial world is not complicated once you learn some of the basics. The Myth of Wealth: I don’t have enough savings to worry about a financial plan. If you have savings then you have enough. Having a plan will help you decide not only where you should put your money, it will also help to define the why. I have learned that the why is more important than the how and where. When it comes to planning you need to start somewhere. Don’t think that just because you think you don’t have enough you should not have a plan. A Financial Plan will help you define the goals and dreams you want to accomplish."
6,How Credit Scoring Works,finance," One thing that some people don’t realize is that they don’t have just one credit score, they have several.  There is currently more than 100 credit-scoring models being marketed to lenders, the most common being the FICO, which is designed to predict whether a borrower will default.  New information is always being added to your report and old information is being deleted.  These constant changes can affect your score. These credit-scoring programs do the following: Detect fraud in credit or insurance applications Calculate the amount of profit a credit card issuer is likely to make on a particular amount Predict the risk of a default by the consumer Forecast the probability that a policyholder will cost an insurer money Estimate how much the borrower is likely to pay on any delinquent account Anticipate which customers might close a credit card account or pay the balance to zero Predict the likelihood that someone will respond to a direct-mail credit card solicitation Lenders are most likely to base their decisions off of the FICO score or its cousin, the NextGen score, than any other type of credit score.  FICO is the industry leader and is used in about 75 percent of mortgage-lending assessments. With this in mind, if you have a bad score, you don’t have to be stuck with it.  On the flip side, if you have a good score, you need to make sure you maintain and monitor it. The Most Important Factors Your Payment History – This makes up about 35 percent of your score.  This is because it is a record of you paying your bills and it shows how responsible you are.  Lenders use this to see if you have a history of paying on time or if you’ve had late payments.  If you do have a late payment on your record, three factors come into play;  1)Recency – How recent you have had a late payment.  The more time that has passed since the problem, the less it impacts a score.  2) Frequency – A person who only has a couple late payments is more acceptable than someone who has several.  3) Severity – A payment that is only 30 days late is considered as serious as one that is 60+ days overdue. How Much You Owe – This constitutes to about 30 percent of your score.  It takes into account the total amount owed on all your accounts as well as how much you how on each type of credit accounts (credit card, auto loan, mortgages, etc.)  Using a higher percentage of your credit limit will make lenders hesitate and could hurt your score.  People who max out their credit cards are much more likely to default than those who don’t.  The bigger the gap between your balance and your limit, the better.  Lenders report your balances to the credit bureaus usually once a month (sometimes only every other month or quarterly).   If you paid off your balance the day after they reported it, it will still show on your report until the next time they report the up to date balances,  so be careful how much you charge and how much of a balance you carry month to month.  Lastly, the score also looks at how much you have left on installment loans compared to what was originally borrowed. How Long You’ve Had Credit – This makes up about 15 percent of your score.  Even though it may be less than the other previous factors, it is still important.  You can have a decent credit score with a short credit history, but the longer you’ve had it, the better.  Your score takes into account both the age of your oldest account and the average age of all your accounts. Your Last Application For Credit – This is about 10 percent of your score.  Opening new accounts can drop your score some, especially if you have applied for multiple credit accounts in a short time and your history isn’t very long.  You may have heard that ""shopping around"" for credit might hurt your score, but the FICO score takes into account that people tend to do that for mortgages and auto financing.  Pulling your own credit report and score shouldn’t affect your score.  As long as you are doing it yourself, it shouldn’t count against you. The Types Of Credit You Use – The final 10 percent of your score.  The FICO scoring system likes to see a variety of types of credit.  This doesn’t mean you need a loan of each possible type to have a good score, so don’t apply for credit thinking you need it to try to boost your score, since that could come back to haunt you.  To get high scores, you need to have both revolving lines of credit (i.e. credit cards) and installment loans (i.e. auto loans and mortgages).  Credit cards through a bank are usually  better for your credit score than department store or other ""finance company"" cards.  Installment loans are good because lenders will usually require more documentation about your financial history before granting the loan."
7,Pay into a Pension to get the Most out of Retirement,finance," Retirement is the stage in life that many people look forward to. The thought of never working again is an intriguing concept. However, it’s important for people to be prepared so they can have the lifestyle they want. There are lots of ways to financially prepare for retirement. Personal savings, such as an ISA account, give flexibility by allowing customers to take money out before they retire. Some people choose to invest in property under a buy-to-let scheme and either rent out a new property or sell their own home. However, by far the most common method is to pay into a pension scheme. Although money from a pension is usually only paid out at retirement age, it’s not just for older people as most can pay into one if they are working. Once someone retires they will receive their pension and if they have been paying into one for several years the payout will be greater. So which is the best option? It isn’t necessary to contribute to a scheme, as a state pension is offered once you hit retirement. The amount that is given will depend on the amount of National Insurance contributions you’ve  been paying, though it is generally accepted that state pensions may not be sufficient unless you are planning a simple and thrifty retirement. Personal pension vs. company pension If a company has a pension scheme, employees may wish to join it. This means that a certain percentage of wages will be automatically deducted each payday. In most cases, the employer will match the contributions by paying into the scheme with you. The alternative is to opt for a personal pension plan, where you are the sole contributor to the scheme. While you won’t have help from an employer, it does mean there will be a tax relief where contributions are ‘topped up’ by the taxman. In either case, once you reach retirement age you can purchase an annuity. This converts what’s in the ‘pension pot’ into a regular income, which is paid out either monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually. The amount that is paid is dependent on how much is in the pot. A quick search on the internet will yield plenty of information on the best pension annuity rates around."
8,The development of regulatory control throughout history and its impact on the field of &#8203;&#8203;money transfers,finance," In the past, before the era of the Internet and fast communication, when the banks and authorities had absolute control over banking services, it was impossible to manage without the banks. Subsequently a cartel of banks was formed, manifested by very high commissions for all various services they provided - continuing today despite the increasing competition in some services that previously were dominated exclusively by banks - starting from the simple operations each person performs in his/her account up to credit transfers one wishes to make between various accounts. Following the enormous technological development that occurred in recent decades in the computing realm in general and particularly the Internet, focusing on satellite and optic fiber communication, a simple, easy and convenient way was created to perform many transactions that previously were impossible due to the absence of such means. One of the sectors accelerating greatly in recent years is that of money transfers in general and particularly credit transfers carried out by private companies. The great advantage these companies have over banks is that they offer significantly lower commission fees than required by banks as well as saving long waiting time wasted waiting in line to receive the service. Although in principle there is a natural and understandable concern regarding performing transactions via the Internet due to fear of fraud and impostures, a number of effective mechanisms were created to ensure safe online use: In order to check the legality of the website and that the website is official and is recognized by the authorities, one should see that the website contains the approval signature of the authority responsible for the supervision of the economics and finance fields as well as the confirmation number. The purpose and function of the authority is to make sure all the activities carried out by that agent are legal and regulated by the various authorities. The regulatory field was first developed as a systematic administrative method in the USA in the end of the previous century. The regulatory agencies were first established due to the enormous power the iron rails owners had and the monopoly status they held in relation to their main customers: farmers who needed their services to move their produce to central markets. The establishment of organized political movements, in which the farmers had a central role, in the 1880s, led to the enactment of laws and the formation of regulatory agencies in the various countries of the American Federation. The main function of these agencies was to monitor shipping rates. In 1887 the regulation expanded from state level to federal and the ""Interstate Commerce Commission"" was founded and granted official power to regulate shipping rates. During the New Deal era the regulators’ actions expanded into labor and capital markets and various industries such as the electricity, food, medicines, communication industries, etc. During the 1960s and 1970s additional regulatory agencies were founded. These agencies were named as part of social regulation. Primary attention was given to the development of agencies and regulatory tools for product safety, quality, as well as environmental pollution problems, and workplace safety. Contrary to the U.S. and despite its liberal tradition the UK did not develop a formal regulatory tradition up to the late 1970s. Paradoxically, the privatization and liberalization processes promoted by the conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher, led to the promotion of the need to establish regulatory agencies, especially in the infrastructure sectors, such as telecommunications, cable, gas, radio, electricity, water, and fuel, but also in the banking, insurance and capital markets sectors. The Financial Supervision Authority, FSA, became responsible for supervision of all financial factors in England. In order to verify the legality of the company you wish to work with, look for the approval of the supervisory authority and the confirmation number that must appear on that company’s website."
9,What To Do With Your Life Insurance Dividends,finance," Life insurance dividends are paid out by mutual life insurance companies. The dividends represent a return of premium payments that you've been overcharged. Overcharged? Yes, life insurance companies overcharge you, then return the difference later at the end of the year - but you're not being ripped off. In fact, that excess amount is used to ensure the long-term viability of your policy. You see, at some point, your dividends will exceed the premium payments you make - that's the result of the insurer investing most of your premium dollars. While dividends are not guaranteed, you should know what to do with them when you do get them since most mutual insurers have a consistent track record of paying them out every year. Take as Cash One option you have is to take your dividend as cash. This option treats the life insurance policy like an investment - you take the dividend as it's paid out. It doesn't help the cash value growth much, but the dividend tends to grow each year. Admittedly, this isn't the most attractive option since dividends are taxable once you've recouped your cost basis (the sum total of your premium payments). Buy More Insurance The most popular option - the default option with most companies - is to buy additional paid up insurance. Why is this popular? Because additional paid up life insurance grows the death benefit, grows the cash value, grows the dividends exponentially, and defers tax on all of this growth as long as the policy remains in force. It's also an excellent option if you want to supplement your future retirement income since the policy's dividends, and the rest of the base cash value, may be accessed income tax-free as long as the policy remains in force (check with your tax adviser to make sure that your situation would not prevent tax-free access to cash values). It's also an ideal option if you just want to ensure a growing death benefit. While dividends are not guaranteed, most insurers have an excellent track record, so there's a reasonable expectation of growing the benefit amount over the long-term. Reduce The Premium If you don't want to be stuck paying a premium for the rest of your life, consider using the dividend to reduce the premium. Be careful of this option though. Back in the 1980s, something called ""vanishing premiums"" hit the market. This was a concept sold by many life insurance agents. Basically, agents back then told customers that they could make a few years worth of premium payments, and their premiums would be covered by the dividends generated by the policy. In essence, the premiums would ""vanish."" Well, as interest rates fell, customers realized that dividend rates were not guaranteed. Premiums never ""vanish"" unless you buy a limited pay policy - which means you must make all premium payments outlined in the policy. If your dividend isn't enough to cover the premium, you may have to resume payments later on in your life. If you're fine with that, this is a decent option to lessen the burden of payments. Invest Them You can let the premiums sit in the insurer's general investment account and accumulate interest at a fixed rate. You may also be able to invest them in the insurer's separate account for a non-guaranteed return based on the performance of mutual funds. In both instances, you will pay income tax on the investment gain. Pay Off Previous Loans Sometimes, you need to borrow money against the value of your policy's surrender value (the cash value). If you don't want to repay the loan, or can't make repayments, you can use the dividends to repay the loan. This way, the interest doesn't accumulate and put your policy in danger of lapsing."
10,Smart Strategies for Increasing Your Life Insurance Coverage,finance," If you have a family to support, you need to have enough life insurance coverage in place to protect your loved ones in the event of your death. Most financial experts recommend that workers carry enough life insurance to replace their income – this generally equates to a death benefit of at least 10 times your annual salary. Purchasing at least this much life insurance coverage is important, but you cannot simply take out a term life policy and then forget about it. As your career advances and your salary increases, you need to keep on top of things and adjust your life insurance coverage accordingly. If you took out a term life policy when you were making $30,000 a year, you should have purchased a death benefit of at least $300,000 to adequately protect your loved ones. If you have been getting regular raises since then, you might be making significantly more than that original $30,000, and that could mean you need to increase your insurance coverage. If you are now making $40,000 a year and your family is spending based on that amount, the original death benefit you purchased may no longer be enough. That is why it is a good idea to review your coverage from time to time and make sure you and your family are still protected. One of the smartest things you can do is review your life insurance coverage each time you get a raise at work. If your raise is a small one, you may not need to adjust your life insurance coverage, but if you will be making thousands of dollars more a year, it is a good idea to adjust your life insurance coverage accordingly. The good news is that increasing the amount of life insurance coverage you carry may not be as expensive as you think. Term life insurance can be quite affordable, especially if you are young and healthy. Simply taking a small portion of your raise and applying it toward extra coverage can help to keep your family protected. If your spouse works as well, it is a good idea to go through the same exercise each time a pay raise is in the offing. If it takes two incomes to run your household and pay your bills, you and your spouse both need to have sufficient life insurance coverage in place. It is a good idea for both of you to carry life insurance with a death benefit equal to at least 10 times your annual salary. It is just as important to review and adjust that death benefit each time your salary increases. Failing to do so could leave your loved ones unprotected when they need the money most. An alternative strategy is to review your life insurance coverage on an annual basis, rather than when you receive your yearly salary increase. Reviewing your coverage once a year is simpler, but it is important not to let the date slip away. You can prepare ahead of time by taking a small part of your raise and setting it aside in a savings account. That way you will have the money you need to increase your coverage when the annual review period rolls around."
11,Life Insurance - Whole Life or Term; Which Should You Get When You Are Young?,finance," If you are a young person just starting out in life, life insurance may not be the most important thing on your mind. However, if you are planning on eventually raising a family, then life insurance will eventually become an important consideration. And, the best time to buy life insurance is while you are young. But, which type of life insurance is best? The answer to that question depends upon your current and future situations. Life insurance comes in many flavors, and the numerous varieties can be confusing to the uninitiated. Fortunately, life insurance comes in 2 basic types: whole life and term life. When you understand these 2 basic types, then you will have an easier time understanding any of the variations. The first basic type is whole-life. A whole-life policy does not have an end date. As long as you continue to pay your premiums, your life insurance will be in effect. Some whole-life policies may contain fine print that specifies a reduced payment after you reach a certain age. However, if you pay your premiums, then you can be confident your beneficiaries will be paid upon your death. Because a whole-life policy has no ending date, it is usually more expensive than other types of life insurance. Normally, the younger you are when you first buy whole-life, the cheaper the premiums for the life insurance. This is because insurance companies know that young people are more likely to make a lot of premium payments before they die. Consequently, the insurance companies can afford to charge a cheaper price. Whole-life is good for a young person just starting out in life. As mentioned, if you buy a whole-life policy while you are young, your premiums will be cheaper. Consequently, you can get a lot of coverage for a minimal cost. If you decide to buy a whole-life policy, you should consider your future needs. If you plan on having a family, then you will want to get enough life insurance to take care of them if something happens to you. Since you may have a whole-life policy for decades, you should take inflation into consideration when deciding on the amount. The second type of life insurance is term life. A term-life policy is for a specific period of time. For instance, you may buy a term-life policy for 20 or 25 years. Because a term-life policy has a specific ending date, it is normally cheaper than a whole-life policy. That’s because insurance companies can use their actuarial tables to determine the risk of you dying before the term-life policy ends. Term-life policies are good if you have a specific purpose in mind. For instance, you may want to make sure your children are able to get a higher-education degree if something were to happen to you. Term life is a great life insurance policy for that purpose. You can buy a term-life insurance policy for 25 years. By the time your policy ends, your children will probably be out of school, and they will have started lives of their own. A term-life policy is also good for making sure your spouse can pay off the mortgage if something happened to you. Because term-life is relatively cheap, you can probably afford to get a larger amount of term-life insurance than you can get with whole-life insurance. Death is not something most young people want to consider, but life insurance is really not about death. It is about insuring your loved ones continue to have a good life if something were to happen to you. Sooner or later, most people will buy some type of life insurance. Whether you buy whole life or term life, the younger you are when you buy life insurance, the better you will be financially. And, that will be good for both your family and you."
12,Life Insurance Scams,finance," Life insurance is a wonderful way to offer security for your family. Unfortunately, it’s also a good way for insurance agents to generate commissions via unethical practices. In the past decade, life insurance scams, especially those targeting the elderly, have been on the rise. Churning An easy way for agents to make extra money is by targeting people who already hold life insurance policies. If you’re already paying premiums, an agent doesn’t have to convince you of the benefits of insurance; they just have to sell you on their particular insurance. By convincing you to switch to their company, they earn a commission with little effort. However, many insurance policies require a waiting period of over a decade before benefits are accessible. Changing carriers can be beneficial for younger policyholders, but senior citizens may never be able to access their benefits. Unfortunately, unscrupulous agents often deliberately push new policies on senior citizens. You and your family can avoid this by finding a reputable, licensed agent and carefully reviewing any policy changes they recommend. Twisting Twisting is similar to certain unethical practices used by the mortgage industry. In this practice, agents misrepresent your income or net worth so you qualify for a larger policy. This results a big commission for the agent and a big headache for you. The agent may even combine your old policies into a new, unaffordable plan. If you don’t make the monthly payments, you lose all of your benefits, even those you’ve been paying for over the years. Before signing any new life insurance policy, make sure you understand the terms completely. Bait and Switch Although less common than churning or twisting, a new scam is on the rise, especially among agents who prey on the elderly. With a bait and switch, an agent promises one type of insurance, has you sign all the paperwork, and then creates a different type of policy for you. In Florida, agents promised senior citizens low health insurance costs then had them fill out an application for life insurance. The agents lost their licenses and were arrested, but this scam could show up again anywhere in the country. STOLI Stranger-owned life insurance is a new kind of investment tool. Older Americans, especially the wealthy, are offered insurance policies paid for by a third party. In many cases, the victims of this scam are also offered free medical exams or gift cards for participating. After a year or two, the senior citizen has two choices: pay back all of the premiums, plus interest, or give up the insurance policy to the outside party paying for it. STOLI is causing major problems in the life insurance industry and damaging the business prospects of many firms. Life insurance was intended to provide some security for families who lose their loved ones. Now that it’s being used as an investment tool, life insurance firms may be forced to change their policies to the detriment of everyday citizens trying to provide for their family. In some states, legislators are working to criminalize scams like churning or STOLI. In others, agents who pushed these scams have already been arrested. Unfortunately, legal punishment comes too late for the families who have suffered from these horrible practices. Make sure your loved ones know how to avoid life insurance scams. Help them find a reputable agent. You can protect yourself, and your family, by being aware of unscrupulous practices."
13,Five Reasons Why Term Life Insurance Is the Better Option,finance," Life insurance comes in a lot of different flavors so that it can meet the needs of a lot of different people. The two primary choices, whole life and term life insurance, differ widely in their options. If you want more coverage for less, a simple term life policy is the better option for five reasons. More Coverage Per Dollar Spent If you just take a quick glance at the cost of a whole life policy and a term life policy of the same amount, you will see that term life coverage can be obtained for much less. The average cost per ten thousand dollars of coverage for a term life policy will be about one-fifth to one-eighth of the cost of a whole life policy. Lower Cost on Commissions Whole life policies give the agents that sell them a much larger commission than a term life policy. In fact, it can be as much as 80 percent of the policy cost in the first year. Commissions on a term life policy are much lower, which gives you a lot more benefit for every dollar spent. The higher commission on a whole life policy goes to the agent who made the sale. Unless you are deliberately trying to pay their salary, it just does not make much sense to buy a policy with a good percentage of it going to your agent. A term life policy lets you keep much more of your money in your pocket. Money Available to Invest at Higher Rates A powerful advantage of buying a term life policy is that it enables you to invest your money where you want. Because whole life policies typically pay a very low interest rate, it would not be hard at all to find another place to invest your hard-earned dollars at a better rate. Besides that, pulling out your built up cash value is going to reduce your coverage by that much, and you will also have to pay interest on that amount, too. On the other hand, if you have a separate savings program, getting cash out of it will not affect your coverage. Guaranteed Renewal Available One frequently mentioned aspect of term life insurance that is often pointed out on the negative side is the issue of renewability. It is true that the policy will expire after a certain length of time, but many term life insurance policies can now be issued for up to 30 years. If you get a policy with guaranteed renewability it will enable you to continue to be able to be covered – but the renewal rates will be higher because of increased age. An unpleasant truth about life insurance is that most people will never keep it more than 10 years anyway. If you don't keep it until you need to renew it, that makes this issue a moot point. On the other hand, if you had a whole life insurance policy, you would be paying much more per thousand dollars of coverage – and probably still eventually drop it anyway. Which one will save you the most money if you only keep it about ten years? Simple Coverage without Whole Life Problems Term life gives you the benefit of buying pure insurance without complications. It is true that it may not be for everyone, but when it comes to lower costs and having greater control with better interest rates over your savings dollars, it is impossible to beat term life insurance. If you are still young, the amount of coverage you can get with term life insurance for just a little money is astounding. It is also at this time when you may have the greatest need for life insurance, particularly for those who are married, have young children, possibly a new mortgage, and maybe even the debt of a college education to pay for still. In the event of a death, this could leave a lot of unpaid bills on a spouse who probably won't have the income to meet the sudden expenses."
14,Tips for First Time Life Insurance Shoppers,finance," Having a life insurance policy in place is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family. If you have a job and a family to protect, you need to have sufficient coverage in place to protect against the unexpected. If you have never shopped for life insurance before, it is a good idea to do some preparation first. There is a lot to learn about life insurance coverage, and being an informed consumer can help you get the best coverage for the least amount of money. Ask yourself a series of questions before you buy life insurance. These questions and their answers can guide you to the best policy and help you get the most for your money. Why Am I Buying Life Insurance? There are good reasons to buy life insurance, but there are bad reasons as well. If you are buying life insurance simply because you do not currently have it, that is not good enough. Keep in mind that life insurance is designed to protect your loved ones in the event of your death. If you do not have a family to protect and no one is reliant on your income, chances are you do not need life insurance coverage at all. You may still want to look at your life insurance options, even if you do not currently need coverage. Shopping around now will help you be better prepared once you do start a family. How Much Coverage Do I Need? If you do decide you need life insurance, the next step is to determine how much coverage you need. There is no hard and fast rule on life insurance coverage, but there are a number of ballpark estimates. One of the most popular formulas advises workers to carry ten times their annual salaries in life insurance. That means a worker earning $40,000 a year would need a death benefit equal to $400,000. You can also look at your specific expenses when determining how much life insurance you need. If your biggest monthly expense is the mortgage, you could buy a policy with a death benefit sufficient to pay off the balance. If you are older and have a lot of investments your family could draw on for income, you might not need as much coverage as someone just starting out. What Kind of Company Should I Buy From? Life insurance is a long-term purchase, so it is important to work with a company that has a long track record. After all, you want to make sure the company you choose will be there when you need them. You can start with the ratings for the insurance carriers in your area. These companies are rated on a number of factors, including their financial stability. You can use this information to weed out the weaker companies, and then request quotes from the companies with a strong track record of success. It is also a good idea to check with the government agency overseeing insurance companies in your state. The states provide a basic level of protection to policyholders in the event an insurance company is unable to pay its claims. Understanding those coverage limits can help you choose a policy wisely. No matter what your life insurance needs, shopping around is the best way to get the most value for your money. Shopping for life insurance may not be fun, but it is important to protect your family."
15,How to Choose Home Insurance Cover,finance," The UK has been a major player and innovator in the financial world for centuries. This sophistication shows in the highly competitive market for property insurance on both buildings and contents. Whether you own or rent a property you will be able to get appropriate cover at a really great price. In fact, the market has become so competitive it is confusing to any but experts. Nowadays, no claim bonuses are available on both buildings and contents insurance and some insurers even offer discounts for insuring directly online. Other companies concentrate on offering older people or other groups special rates, while even the post office is offering to better any quote. Everything looks so attractive, it becomes hard to choose. To help resolve all the confusion, there are useful online services which compare the rates. This cuts out a lot of hunting for quotes and simplifies the whole process, but unfortunately is not the whole story. Only by evaluating the full picture against your actual requirements will it be possible to make an informed decision, otherwise you could be very disappointed when submit your insurance claims. The major reason rates differ widely is because the specifics of the cover may vary from policy to policy. Different excesses apply and there may be quite different limits in place. All these factors affect the amount that is expected per claim, and hence the premiums that are charged. While investment income normally forms a major part of insurance company profits, this factor is currently less important than previously: however, it may still allow companies to shave their rates marginally. Some of these low rates are due to substantial no-claim bonuses. While these offers do look attractive, you should also establish what effect a claim will have on your bonus: will it reduce to zero? The bonus actually pays for itself by discouraging smaller claims, which are expected to aggregate to more than the premiums which are foregone. The online discount is possible because commissions are eliminated, and should not be affected by a claim. Remember, there is no point to paying less if you’re not getting the cover you need. Special rates for certain groups such as the over-55s are based on a risk profile which shows fewer claims for this section. Older people may stay at home more or be more careful, perhaps resulting in fewer burglaries or other losses as a result. If you fit the profile of such a group, it may be a good idea to take advantage of such offers. There is no substitute for knowing what cover you need. You may then find that a cheaper policy is quite satisfactory for your needs. Remember, insuring an item for double its value does not mean you will be paid more than what it is actually worth. You should also ascertain whether the cover is at actual value or the cost of a new replacement, otherwise you may find yourself having to pay in to replace an article. There can be no question that having adequate insurance on your assets is essential. Anyone who has had an uninsured loss knows the difficulties that can be experienced trying to replace items. Most importantly, make sure the cover is satisfactory before deciding on a policy; otherwise you might discover deficiencies when you try to claim. You are the only person ultimately responsible for ensuring there will be no problems of this sort later."
16,The Pros and Cons of Term Life Insurance,finance," Trying to find the right life insurance policy can be difficult. With so many options available, it can be hard to decide which one is best for you. One option you can choose is term life insurance. Term life insurance provides you with coverage for a certain period of time. Like any life insurance policy, it has its benefits and its disadvantages. Many people purchase term policies because they are inexpensive compared to other types of life insurance policies. This lower price allows you to purchase a larger amount of insurance at an affordable rate. Term life insurance is also easy to purchase. There is not a lot of effort that goes into finding a policy that matches your needs. All you need to know is how much insurance you will need and how long you will need it. In addition to its simplicity and low cost, term life insurance policies are great for people that only need life insurance for a certain period of time. For example, a younger, married person with children may opt to purchase a term life insurance to help cover the mortgage or replace lost income if they die during the coverage period. Despite its advantages, there are some drawbacks to term life insurance. One disadvantage to term life insurance is that it expires. Once the contracted period ends, so does your coverage. Although some companies give the option to renew the policy at this time, you may be unable to. Certain health conditions may disqualify you from coverage or raise your premium. You may also be too old to renew the policy and need to take out life insurance, or be unable to afford the premiums anymore. Another drawback to term life insurance is outliving the term of your policy. Although living a long and healthy life is a wonderful accomplishment, those who outlive their policy if they are unable to renew it are left with nothing. You will no longer have any life insurance coverage and you will not get any type of return on the amount of money you put into premiums throughout the years. If you are still unsure if term life insurance is right for you, contact a local insurance agent.  He or she will able to answer any questions or concerns you may have. He or she will also be able to provide you with alternatives if term life insurance does not fit your needs."
17,Why Life Insurance Just Became Your New Best Friend,finance," Life insurance. It's pretty boring, right? You sit down with an insurance agent - who you suspect just wants to make a quick sale - and talk about a subject you know nothing about and which you have really no interest in. What you do know, you don't like - death. Who wants to think about their own death? You know you're going to die at some point. Why dwell on it? Why? Because life insurance just became your new best friend. That's why. You Don't Have To Die To Use It You've probably heard of term life insurance. Everyone has. You pay ""x"" amount and receive ""x"" amount of death benefit in return. That's a safe play, but it's also not the only way to buy life insurance. Whole life and universal life insurance offer so much more. Whole life provides you with a cash reserve, called a ""cash value,"" that builds up in anticipation of that future death benefit. It's what the insurer will use to pay the death claim. However, during your lifetime, you can actually use that money for any reason you see fit. If you want to spend all of your cash value, you can. But you can also initiate an endless ""borrow and repay"" cycle that gives you an endless source of funds for home improvement projects, new vehicles, and even a down payment on a new home (or a vacation home). When you retire, you can even draw the cash value from the policy to supplement your other retirement income. In some cases, you can even have direct access to the death benefit. Universal life works similar to whole life in that it builds up a cash value savings during your lifetime. The main difference is that universal life is actually a blend of term insurance and a cash account. Each month, the insurer charges the cash account for the cost of the term policy (after you make a deposit into it via your premium payment). The policy stays in force as long as there is money in the cash account. No money, no policy. Otherwise, premiums may be increased, decreased, or stopped altogether. As long as you have money in the policy's cash value account, you're safe. It Might Eliminate Your Need For More ""Boring"" Insurance Direct access to the death benefit is usually only allowed when you have a chronic, critical, or terminal illness. Yuck. No one wants to think about that, but that's a fact of life. It happens to the best of us. We get sick. We need long-term nursing home care. But you don't want to risk wasting your money on a long-term care policy. This is where a good whole life or universal life policy comes in handy. Most life insurance companies allow you to spend down the death benefit to pay for long-term care needs. In some cases, this can totally eliminate you need to buy an additional insurance policy - saving you money and another appointment with your insurance agent. It's Tax-Free Oh yeah, all of the cash value in the policy can be accessed on a tax-free basis during your lifetime. This is accomplished through the use of preferred policy loans. Don't let the term ""loan"" scare you. It's largely an accounting term in this case. There are no credit checks. As long as you have cash value in your account, you will get a policy loan. The ""preferred"" part of the loan means that the insurer will try to match the interest it charges on the loan with the interest being credited to the policy. For example, you take out a policy loan of $10,000. Your insurer must charge you a ""fair market rate"" on that loan. So, it charges you 8 percent. But it also credits your policy with 8 percent. The effect is you pay a net interest rate of zero percent. Some insurers guarantee you a preferred loan while others imply that you will always (or usually) receive one."
18,Understanding Home Insurance Riders,finance," An insurance rider is a term used to describe additional coverage added onto an existing insurance policy. Home insurance riders are needed to provide coverage for valuable items, dangerous possessions or other potential losses not covered by a standard policy. As most home owners will have additional insurance needs beyond what a standard policy will cover, it is important for a home owner to understand insurance riders. Home Insurance Limitations Though a homeowner may have enough insurance to cover the value of his or her home as well as the contents of the home, some items are excluded from home insurance policies. For example, it is common for a home insurance policy to only cover $1,000 worth of jewelry. However, many people have an engagement ring worth more than $1,000 and it does not take a large jewelry collection to push past the $1,000 mark. To provide coverage beyond the $1,000, an insurance rider is needed. A rider can also be used to cover events that are not covered by standard home insurance. For example, many home insurance policies provide no coverage related to the use of a trampoline or swimming pool. A homeowner who has these items should consider buying a rider that provides liability coverage for losses related to these items. What Is a Rider? An insurance rider is an additional layer of insurance coverage that provides specific coverage for items that are worth more than a standard home insurance policy. For example, home insurance policies will only cover possessions up to a specific amount. If a person has valuable works of art, jewelry or other expensive possessions, a rider will likely be needed to insure these items. A homeowner should understand that some companies refer to a rider as an endorsement; there is no difference between a rider and an endorsement. Obtaining a Rider To obtain a rider, a home owner simple needs to contact his or her home insurance company and request the additional coverage. In most cases, setting up the coverage is quick and easy, but in others the insurance company may send someone to the home to inspect the areas of additional coverage or the company may request an appraisal of the covered item. In addition to purchasing a rider, separate coverage for specific items can be purchased from a separate company. While a separate policy may be more expensive than a rider added to an existing home insurance policy, it won’t hurt to price the coverage through another company. Common Uses In addition to jewelry, swimming pools and trampolines, riders are used for a number of purposes. Valuable items such as works of art, Oriental rugs and expensive electronic devices can be covered by a rider. Collections can also be covered. For example, collections of antiques, firearms and coins can easily exceed the coverage amount provided by a standard home insurance policy meaning that a home owner will need to obtain a rider to cover these items. A rider may also be obtained to provide coverage for home business equipment and business liability which is almost always excluded from a standard home insurance policy. One often overlooked use of an insurance rider is insuring an older home to be rebuilt to meet new building codes. A standard home insurance policy would only pay to rebuild the home as it existed, not including the additional costs to rebuild to meet modern building code standards. An insurance rider could be used to cover this additional expense in the event of a fire or other loss to the home."
19,United Kingdom Energy - Save Money by Switching to the Right Tariff,finance," If you are in a position to switch your tariff, then you are in a position to save some money. But, in order to maximize your savings, you need to switch to the tariff that best suits your needs. By understanding the various types of tariffs along with their pros and cons, you can insure you will be getting the best deal possible before you switch. Online Tariff Discounted online tariffs are probably some of the cheapest tariffs available for the average family. But, the cheapest tariff does not always mean it is the best deal for your particular situation. Before switching to any online tariff, you should thoroughly research the available tariffs and be aware of any hidden fees or catches. One good online deal you might want to consider is with First Utility. Information on Energyhelpline.com indicates First Utility has a tariff that can save a typical family with a dual bill about £270 a year. However, the estimated savings is based upon First Utility’s variable rate, and if the rate increases, your savings could be reduced. Fixed Tariff A fixed tariff provides a set cost over a one year period. Although the savings may not be as much as with other types of tariffs, a fixed tariff will allow users to follow a monthly budget without having to worry about an unexpected pike in their energy bill. By shopping around and comparing prices, a typical family using dual fuel can pay an average of about £1,172 annually. This is a savings of about £250 a year for an average family. Most fixed tariffs have cancellation fees, so if you think you will want to switch before your year is completed, you may want to consider another type of tariff. Long-term Fixed Scottish Power has a long-term fixed tariff that is a 2 year fixed plan ending in April 2015, so it could potentially protect you from increases in fuel prices for 2 winters. Although the estimated cost of £1,261 for an average family is higher than a 1 year fixed plan, the advantage of the 2 year plan is that your energy costs are guaranteed for an additional year. If you think fuel prices will continue to rise, then the longer term plan may be the best for you. Green Energy Many energy users want to help the environment, and one way they can do that is by choosing a green-energy tariff. While this tariff can be more expensive than some of the other tariffs, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are doing your part to keep the environment clean for future generations. Some companies offering green energy provide energy that is created entirely from renewable resources, whereas other companies offer a mixture of green energy and traditional forms of energy. Whichever route you take, you will be helping the environment. You have a wide range of energy tariffs that you can utilize, and which tariff is best for you will depend upon your unique situation. But, tariffs provide you with a choice, and if you do your research and choose wisely, you will more than likely save money on your energy bills."
20,The Elements of an Electric Bill,finance," The only way to really make sure that you’re not being overcharged on your monthly electric bill is to truly understand the various elements that make up a bill and what each individual component means. Regardless of the company that provides your home with electricity, the vast majority of all electric bills are very similar. Though glancing at your bill and seeing a series of complex calculations and detailed numbers may at first seem to be a bit overwhelming, you’ll soon find out just how easy understanding the elements of an electric bill really is. You’ll never have to worry about incorrect billing statements again. One of the first sections on your monthly electric bill will specify the ""rate schedule"" or the ""rate class"" for your home. Both terms essentially mean the same thing. Most energy providers charge different rates to home customers as opposed to business customers. The bar and grille down the street from your apartment is likely paying more per kilowatt hour than you are, for example. The ""rate schedule"" or ""rate class"" will simply tell you which of those two categories you fall into. The second section on your electric bill will break down exactly what you are being charged for in any particular month. Elements will include the total number of kilowatt hours that your home consumed in a particular period, the total cost per kilowatt hour that you are charged, any transmission fees that you may be charged as well as any service fees that are automatically added to your bill. If you are participating in a ""fixed"" or ""budget"" billing plan with your electrical provider, information about that plan will be found in a separate section on your bill. These plans are commonly designed for residential buildings like apartments where more than one customer is living under the same roof. Instead of each apartment paying only for the energy that they used, the total number of kilowatt hours for the entire building is divided evenly among all customers. If ten separate people live in an apartment building that uses 5000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month, each customer will pay for 500 kilowatt hours instead of the total amount that they actually used. One of the final sections on any electric bill will contain a wide variety of different options that you can use to pay your bill based on your own personal preferences. Most electrical providers offer more than one way to pay your bill for your own convenience. You will be able to see any money-saving plans that you might be eligible for in the same section. You will also be able to see the ""average payment"" dollar amount for similar homes in your area. The ""average payment"" can be a good indication of how energy efficient your home really is. If you are paying dramatically more than the average amount listed on your bill each month, you can take that as a fairly good indication that you are being wasteful with your home’s energy consumption in some way."

2,Who Can I List as a Life Insurance Beneficiary,finance," Life insurance is meant to benefit the loved ones who would suffer financially in your absence, but it can be difficult to figure out who to list as the beneficiary on your policy. This person will also have the responsibility of dealing with the insurance company after your death to collect the money. Choosing a beneficiary is an important process, and one that will be guided in part by your insurance company’s policies and even state laws. If you’re asking yourself, ""Who can I list as the beneficiary?,"" here are some things to consider. Your spouse is the most obvious beneficiary for a life insurance policy, as he or she will feel the greatest financial impact should you die first. Your spouse will probably organize your funeral and perhaps be left without a second income to support your household. In some states, you may be obligated to choose your spouse as the beneficiary on a personal life insurance policy unless he agrees to sign a waiver that lets you list someone else as a beneficiary. If you want to list someone other than your spouse as the beneficiary, investigate your state laws and make sure to file all necessary paperwork. This will eliminate confusion or delays in insurance funds payout after your death. You may also list one or all of your children as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy. If you choose your kids as the beneficiary, be sure to establish clear language in the policy. Do you want all of your children as equal beneficiaries if the policy allows it? Does this include adopted or step-children as well as your own natural children? If your children are minors, you need to ask the insurance company if it will agree to pay out the funds to someone who is not yet 18 years old. In some cases, you may have to give the money to a legal guardian who would then in turn be allowed to give the money to your children. If you are unmarried and don’t have kids, you can also designate someone else close to you as the beneficiary of your life insurance funds. Keep in mind, however, that you may need to prove that the person will in fact suffer some financial burden after your death, such as being responsible for your funeral. If you can’t prove that the beneficiary would actually suffer a financial burden, you may not be permitted to add him or her as the beneficiary on your policy. Parents, siblings, or close friends are some of the people who might be used as a beneficiary. Your primary beneficiary is the person or persons who will get the insurance money after your death. Contingent beneficiaries will only receive funds if the primary beneficiary precedes you in death, or is unable to accept the funds for some reason. It’s a good idea to have a primary and contingent beneficiary on your account – if, for instance, you and your spouse both perish at the same time, your insurance money won’t have a clear beneficiary if you haven’t selected a contingency plan. For example, you might list your spouse as the primary beneficiary and your children as the contingent beneficiaries. Precision and careful consideration are among the most important aspects of choosing a personal life insurance beneficiary. While you are generally granted some leeway when choosing the person who will benefit from your policy, it’s crucial that you find out what your state laws will permit. Laws will always trump your insurance provider’s internal policy."
3,What To Look For In an Equity-Indexed Universal Life Policy,finance," Equity-indexed universal life, also known as EIUL, is a complex life insurance product. Life insurance agents often tell you that you can earn the upside potential of the stock market without any of the downside risks. That's half the story. A lot of these products contain unnecessary riders and provisions that make the product more complex. If you're thinking of buying this type of life insurance to supplement your retirement income, here's how to sort the wheat from the chaff. Learn The Basics EIUL works by investing your premium dollars into a combination of bonds and index call options. An index call option is like any other options contract except that it allows the insurer to leverage the gains in an entire stock market index - as opposed to just a single stock - without actually owning any shares in the index. When the stock market rises, the insurer shares in the gains. When the stock market falls, it absorbs the losses and pays you the promised interest on the underlying bond-investment portion of the contract. Every EIUL works this way. The details of how interest is credited to your policy is what differs -  sometimes dramatically. Get Good Guarantees Make sure your contract has good minimum and maximum guarantees. Look at the guarantees in the contract. For an EIUL, important guarantees include the participation rate and the cap rate. The cap rate: A cap rate is the maximum interest rate an insurance company will credit your policy with. For example, if the policy sets the cap rate at 14 percent, and the market moves up by 16 percent, you capture the gains - but only up to the cap rate. You bang into the cap, get your 14 percent, and the insurer keeps the rest. Because of this, a company offering a high guaranteed minimum cap rate is essential. You see, part of the way the insurer is able to profit from these policies is by lowering cap rates on the policy. Sometimes, those index call options don't work out so well. The insurer has promised you a minimum rate of return. It has to make its profits somewhere. Moving the cap rate down (so you capture less of the upside of the market) is one way to do that. A cap rate is the maximum interest rate you can earn in your EIUL. The higher the cap rate, the better. Participation rates are also important. A participation rate determines how much of the upside of the stock market you'll receive. If a participation rate is 75 percent, it means that you earn just 7 percent for every 10 percent increase in the market. Obviously this can put a damper on your policy's gains. Make sure you receive a 100 percent participation rate on your contract. That means you'll get the full upside potential (up to the cap, of course). Keep it Simple All other things being equal, try to keep things simple. The simpler, the better. Choose contracts that are straightforward. If the insurance agent can't explain it to you, or you can't figure out how the policy works by reading through the policy illustration paperwork, pass on it and choose another company. This is a tough one to follow through on, simply because the nature of the product lends itself to complexity. Still, try to chose policies with the fewest ""moving parts."" In other words, look for policies where the insurance company has few opportunities to lower the interest it credits to you and where the maximum insurance charges in the product won't cause your policy to lapse. Make Sure You Have Some Options When It Comes To Interest Crediting One of the best crediting strategies in an EIUL is still the annual point-to-point method. It's simple and straightforward. However, there are times when you may want to choose other crediting options like a monthly point-to-point or a monthly averaging method. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The more options you have, generally, the better. In addition to this, having more than one index available allows you to spread out your risk. Some policies only allow you to capture the gains from the S&P500. Try to choose companies that offer several indices like the Dow Jones, the S&P500, the NSDAQ, and even foreign stock markets."
4,The Beginners Guide for Couples Buying Life Insurance,finance," Life insurance is a way of ensuring that your loved ones will not end up in financial trouble if you pass away. Some insurance policies will only pay you settlement if you pass away whilst you are insured. Other life insurance policies will pay you a settlement payment if you either pass away or reach a certain age. Do You Need Life Insurance? If you are the primary provider for your family, then you should really consider life insurance. If your family were to lose you, then they would suffer without the income that you bring into the house. On the other hand, you may have a spouse or a partner. He or she may suffer greatly if you passed away, and life insurance will help him or her pay the bills in your absence. Can You Cover Your Partner On The Same Policy? In many cases, you are able to buy one life insurance policy and insure two people. If a man and wife are insured on one policy, then if one of them passes away the settlement amount is paid to the remaining spouse. The policy then expires, so if the remaining spouse wishes to re-insure, then he or she will have to take out a new life insurance policy. Is It Cheaper Using Comparison Sites Or Insurance Brokers? Sometimes it is cheaper to use comparison sites. Many insurance companies will offer a very good online discount. This is because their overheads are far lower if the policy is bought online. Sometimes it is cheaper to buy life insurance from an insurance broker. An insurance broker will have a lot of contacts and may be able to negotiate a very good premium rate. This is especially true if you are looking to buy a customised insurance policy. How Much Cover Should You Buy? That really depends upon how badly your dependants will suffer financially in your absence. If you have a spouse and children, then they may suffer greatly if you passed away within the next few years. Even if your spouse or partner is in full-time employment, he or she may still struggle to pay the bills without the income you bring into the home. If you are the primary income earner then you should consider buying more cover. The settlement amount is going to have to help your remaining dependants pay household bills, pay the mortgage, and pay any other debts. When considering how much cover to purchase, you may wish to consider how much you can afford to pay in premiums. Do not forget that you are insuring your life, and that you may not pass away until you are in your eighties. Is it really worth paying large premiums and risking putting yourself into debt with your other bills just for life insurance cover? If you are unsure about your future financial situation, you may wish to purchase a life insurance policy that will allow you to miss premium payments. What If One Partner Is A Stay-At-Home Parent? In many cases, you may be tempted to insure the life of the primary income earner. This would mean that the stay-at-home parent is uninsured. But, this underestimates the contribution of the stay-at-home parent. Without that person, the primary income earner would need to hire a housekeeper, pay for childcare, and maybe even hire a bookkeeper. In addition, the primary income earner would need to find time to run to the supermarket, the shops, and school open days and teachers meetings. This will probably mean that the primary income earner will have to cut his or her hours at work. There will also be a sharp increase in the amount of time that the primary income earner has off of work because his or her child is ill."
5,Should You Insure Your Children?,finance," One of the last things you ever want to think about is the death of a child, but when meeting with your insurance agent or financial planner, the subject is likely to come up. Child life insurance is a popular product offered by most insurance companies. It can be difficult to remain objective and not let emotion take over when purchasing insurance, and this is especially true when contemplating the loss of a child. Your insurance agent may try to convince you to insure your children, however in most cases, it is not needed. Life insurance serves three main purposes. It provides the beneficiaries with funds to cover the loss of future income from the deceased. It can be used to pay off debts such as mortgages and car loans so that the remaining family does not have to lower their standard of living. Finally, it helps to pay the deceased's income tax and estate tax debts so that more of the estate can pass to beneficiaries. When a child dies, none of these are necessary. A child is, in most cases, a net expense, not an income generator. With the exception of funeral costs, the death of a child rarely results in further expenses or a lack of income. Child life policies are also often touted as vehicles to save for future college expenses. Whole life policies have both an insurance and an investment component. The premiums that you pay every month pay for insurance coverage plus some of the premiums go towards an investment fund. The investment side builds up over time, and the policy owner can borrow against it or withdraw from it, based on the rules of the plan. While it can build up savings for college, there are more financially savvy ways to do it. You can't control what the funds are invested in or the investment return on the policy. A tax-advantaged college fund gives you more control over the investments and the withdrawals. The main reason to obtain child life insurance is to pay for funeral expenses. The average funeral costs upwards of $10,000 and many families do not have enough in their savings accounts to cover this cost should it occur. The least expensive way to provide for this possibility is with a term life policy. Term life policies are bare-bones, insurance-only plans that pay out on death. They last for a set term, usually 5 to 20 years, without an increase in premium. When your child goes off to college or out into the workforce, you can turn the policy over to him to continue if he wishes. Life insurance is a valuable tool in your financial planning toolbox when used properly, but it can be easy to become over-insured. Insuring your children is often unnecessary and those funds can be better utilized in other savings vehicles."
6,Life Insurance: The Importance of Financial Planning,finance," The availability of insurance products over the Internet can make getting the best possible deal in the shortest possible time seem like the end goal where any type of insurance is concerned. This approach works well for motor and home policies, as these are products which customers buy annually, and so any shortcomings which come to light with, for example, the product basis, or administration processes of the insurer, can be swiftly dealt with at the next renewal by changing insurer and/or policy. Life insurance is a little different. Whilst price comparison and cashback sites may offer life insurance at competitive premiums, ensuring that a policy is fit for purpose is paramount, and this is an area where it is important to consider taking professional advice. Life insurance is designed to financially safeguard loved ones, and policies will normally run for a number of years, with some more expensive types offering the facility to be in place for life. Moreover, obtaining life cover is dependent on health and age. The proposal form will include questions regarding the potential policyholder’s current state of health, and any existing medical conditions. Where the amount of life cover required is relatively modest, and there are no major health issues, insurance is likely to be offered in a routine way, and once in place, and assuming premiums continue to be paid, a contract exists between the client and insurer for the term of the policy. The insurer will ask their underwriters to look more closely at applications for insurance where a larger amount of cover is requested, or where health issues are of concern. To put this bluntly, the insurer is looking at the likelihood of having to pay out a death claim, and where a client is in poor health, the level of risk to the insurer is increased. In response to this they may offer cover with rated terms (meaning higher premiums), or decline the policy altogether. Given these considerations, looking for sound advice and adequate, suitable cover should override purely cost based research. Obtaining the right amount of financial protection, and not over or under insuring oneself, can often be better achieved after taking professional advice, and as part of a financial planning review. Life insurance is, in fact, usually the initial primary consideration in such an exercise. All good insurance brokers will look at affordability with their clients before being able to make any recommendations to address needs, however, the first advice clients are likely to receive will relate to protection, which usually involves the consideration of some type of life insurance product. This might commonly include compulsory cover to insure the investment of a mortgage lender, protection for a family or inheritance tax planning. It is also possible to combine life insurance with critical illness cover. This is something that financial planners may offer their clients the opportunity to look at, and, whilst it will increase the cost, combining these two types of insurance is common, and well worth giving consideration. Everyone’s circumstances tend to change over time, so it may be that once suitable policies are no longer needed, or that it is time to think about different forms of protection or savings. Taking an overall look at your financial situation from time to time gives ongoing peace of mind, and maintaining adequate life insurance is a fundamental part of this process."
7,Are You Prepared for Your Retirement? Most of You Aren't,finance," I read a lot about the lives of women after 50. Being one myself and even though I am a business coach, clearly there are other things going on for us. One of them is our retirement. It's frightening out there and most women do not feel confident. How are you going to support yourself in your older years? One very sad statistic is that 50% of women fear becoming a 'bag ladies'. That's half of all women!! And yet, another statistic says women control a larger share of personal wealth in the U.S. than ever before by 66%. This worry of how to finance your retirement has gotten worse since the recession. Employer retirement plans have gone downhill and many employers have laid workers off to save their own bottom lines. As women, older women, you are resilient, savvy and can accomplish many goals. What can you do now to be rest assured you can support yourself in the years to come? Many women have to catch up on retirement savings, if you have any, because you either stayed at home to raise children, have been care takers to parents, got divorced, being widowed or a myriad of other reasons to not have enough sacked away. For some of you the lack of planning and preparation has put you in a difficult situation. Too many women will work into their 70's so they can supplement their social security. It's one thing to work because you want to, it's another thing to work because you have to. Another statistic: From the 2013 Women, Money & Power Study nearly half of all women have the fear of being a 'bag lady', even 27% who make over $200,00.00 per year. This study also stated that the root of the problem is that most women don't know where they honestly stand financially. So, do you know where you stand? Are you brave enough to really take a good hard look at your numbers? Your retirement depends on it. How late in life you work depends on it. How confident you feel depends on it. In this day and age you have more earning power than ever before. Are you using it wisely? Are you really taking a good hard look and knowing where you stand? This is not a time to put your head in the sand. I read articles all the time of the challenges and fears of older women in their retirement years. I don't want to be a part of this statistic and I don't want you to be either. How are you going to take care of yourself? What is your plan? Are you working now? For someone else or for yourself? Be brave and look at your financials. If you are not 'retirement ready' now or in the next 10 years, what are you going to do about it? It may be time for plan, not a dream, a plan."
8,Tax refunds made simple,finance," The daunting three letter word, tax, can evoke a wide range of emotions. However, it doesn’t have to, as the grass may well be greener on the other side. The confusion around tax refunds is a common occurrence. A tax refund is a repayment of PAYE tax that you have overpaid during the tax year. Statistics show that 1 in every 3 people in the UK is due a tax refund. If you have lived and worked in the UK, you may be due for a tax refund, as a result of certain circumstances. What are these circumstances? You’ve only worked for part of a tax year You’ve worked for more than 1 employer in a tax year You’ve had 2 or more jobs concurrently You’ve been taxed on a basic rate tax code You’ve paid emergency tax in the last 5 years You’ve left the UK before the end of the tax year (6 April-5 April the following year) You’ve been on an incorrect tax code at any point in the last 5 years If you feel that you’ve been in any one or more of the above situations, then you have a very good chance of receiving a tax refund. At this point, you may feel that going through all the hassle is not worth the refund, but it’s more than worth it. You can receive an average of £850 back – possibly more if you haven’t claimed back at all in the last 5 years. How to claim back tax through an agency? You will need to complete the online tax refund form, provide the firm with your employment history details, as well as, original P45 and P60 documents. If you have lost these documents (or you don’t have the original documents) you can use a Statement of Earnings - or an agency will assist you in obtaining the correct documents. Thereafter, the process will be moved forward, you will be kept up to date about your tax refund status, and be will notified about any activity. The greatest pleasure that comes with using an agency is that you can then leave the work to the agency and receive your money after 6 – 12 weeks. Most agencies provide you with an online tax refund calculator. This gives you an estimate of your tax refund, based on the information you enter into the calculator. Don’t let the perceived hassle of claiming tax back stop you from getting what is due to you."
9,What To Take Into Account About Fund Administration,finance," One of the main hurdles of starting a company in this day and age is getting the capital investment together.  Beginning small in a dorm room or in a basement, is in fact what many of today's big businesses started out, where they had little assets.  Nevertheless, those are by far the exclusion to the rule.

11,Avoid Mistakes on Your Insurance Policy with These Tips,finance," More often than not, an insurance claim is held up or rejected because the policy had a mistake upon it. This article has a few tips that will help you avoid making some of the most common mistakes when creating your insurance policy. These tips will help you with any policy, from life insurance to car insurance. Why Aren’t You Reading The Big Print? So many online advisors and articles will tell you to read the small print carefully, but they forget that most people barely even skim read the big print. You need to check your policy. You need to check to see if it has covered you fully. You need to check it for errors, and you need to check to see if anything unexpected has turned up in your policy. That is not to say that your insurance company are trying to trick you, but sometimes either human error, or a misunderstanding, may lead to unexpected elements appearing on your insurance policy. Read the small print too In the past, con artists have tried to place unfavourable conditions within the small print of a contract. Modern and mainstream insurers are unlikely to do this for the fear of damaging their reputation. Nevertheless, it is only prudent to check the small print anyway, just in case you were unaware of a certain clause or policy element. What should you check for? You need to check the simple details such as your address, name, age, etc. You should then check to see if all the details you gave were correct. Have you valued things correctly? Moreover, have you included all relevant information? You also need to check to see if the things you agreed to online (or over the phone) are also included in your policy. The telephone is not your friend If you created your insurance policy over the phone, then you no doubt negotiated a great deal for yourself. However, you should now check your policy for dictation mistakes. Things such as numbers, names and descriptions may be incorrectly noted by the telephone operator. In some accents, a number four may sound like a number five, and the letter N may sound like the letter M. Do not insure for things you do not need Too many people will automatically accept a higher premium for things they do not need. There are people who will insure their life for accidents, which includes accidents whilst driving even though they do not drive. There are people who will buy insurance for household items that they do not even want and would not care to replace. Do not wait to change your policy After agreeing to your new insurance policy, you will have fourteen days revise it or cancel it. So, you must check your policy right away and make any changes as soon as policy. If the fourteen days pass, then you are bound to your insurance policy until it expires. In many cases, the insurance policy will not expire until a year has passed unless you cancel the policy and incur cancellation fees."
12,8 Ways To Reduce Home Insurance Premiums,finance," Having adequate home insurance can be an invaluable safety net when the unexpected happens. Insurance policies can protect against financial losses when an accident, theft or a disaster occurs. Most people recognize the value of having adequate insurance, but high premiums can be a problem. There are some ways you can reduce your home insurance premiums without affecting your level of cover. Finally, calculate how much it would cost to demolish the existing building, and to prepare the site for a new build. This situation could arise if you had a fire, for example, which left your home in an unstable condition. Many insurance companies and brokers can provide you with check lists to help you work out all these figures. Insurance companies need to compete with each other to attract new business or retain existing customers. When your insurance is due for renewal, get quotes from companies other than the one you are already insured with. Sticking with the same company may be more convenient, but spending a little time to shop around can save you money. However, when you compare the offerings from various companies, you need to look closely at the fine print. Companies with low premiums may be offering a reduced level of cover. While you can easily arrange your own insurance policy, it may be worthwhile talking to a broker. Brokers get paid by the insurance companies, so using a broker does not cost you anything. Their specialist knowledge of the insurance market can often bring savings to their customers. Brokers can also offer excellent advice on the amount of cover you should be looking for. You can get lower premiums by increasing your deductible, or excess, level. The deductible, or excess, is the amount of any claim that you undertake to cover yourself. If you have a deductible of $500, and you submit a claim for $700, then the insurance company will have to pay out just $200. While your policy will cover you for damage and theft, you should think carefully before submitting a claim. Making a claim will result in higher future premiums. You may also find that you cannot switch insurance companies in the future because you have had a claim. It may be better to pay for repairs or replacements out of your own pocket rather than claim on your insurance policy. You can get a discount on premiums if your home has state-of-the-art safety and anti-theft devices fitted. Before installing any new security features, ask your insurance company or broker for a list of approved devices. Insurance companies may also insist that your security systems are installed by approved firms if they are to qualify for discounts. Check whether you can get reduced premiums by buying all your insurance policies from the same company. Buying car, health, or life insurance from the company that provides your home insurance can bring savings. Try to keep a good credit record. Many insurance companies will regard you as a higher risk if you have debt problems, and this results in higher premiums."
13,7 Ways to Speed Up Your Home Insurance Claim,finance," Everyone knows you need to have home insurance in case something happens, but trying to get the insurance policy fulfilled can be difficult. It is not uncommon for months or even years to pass before you see any money. When you are dealing with a ruined home, due to a flood or fire, you really just need to get back into your house as soon as possible. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to speed the claim up. You should also have all your insurance paperwork in a safe place. Scanning it and keeping copies online is a good idea in case your paperwork is ruined. Get the authorities involved. In the event of a robbery, make sure you call the police immediately to get the event on record. The police report will help your case go through faster since it is valid proof of robbery. Document everything. You will find it much simpler to file a claim when you have all the proof necessary. Take photos of everything in the home. This will serve as proof of the damages. Make only temporary repairs. If you need to cover a broken window or temporarily mend a door, be sure to take photos before and after. Keep all your receipts for any minor repairs so you can show them to the insurance company. You shouldn’t make any major or permanent repairs until the insurance adjuster has seen the house. In cases where the home is no longer livable, be sure to keep all receipts for hotels. Keep damaged items. No matter what has happened, hurricane, flood or vandalism, do not throw anything out. The insurance adjuster will need to see everything, especially the furniture or valuables that are now worthless due to damage. Hire a public adjuster right away. Waiting to get an insurance adjuster will only slow the process down. When you have someone working with you from the beginning, it can really speed things up and make life easier. While the adjuster will usually charge a percentage of the final claim, you can rest easy knowing that you have someone on your side. It is well worth the fee to streamline the process and eliminate potential roadblocks. Don’t give up. It’s easy to get fed up with the entire process and want it to be over and done with. While settling will end things earlier, it can also leave you with much less money than you deserve. Make sure you get everything that you are entitled to, since it can be expensive to replace belongings and rebuild a home. You’ve been paying for your home insurance for this reason, so don’t give up too early. No one wants to deal with the hassles that come with placing a home insurance claim, but it is necessary sometimes. Hiring a public adjuster can help you get everything done faster, but being prepared will also speed everything up."
14,A Lender Misrepresentation Could Allow for an Injunction to Stop a Foreclosure,finance," We will employ the terms ""fraud"" and ""misrepresentation"" generally, however you should notice that these phrases may have significantly unique legal definitions in various states. By way of example, many states have statutes that control debt collection strategies which forbid particular sorts of deception and misrepresentations by credit card companies and by collection agencies that could be related to a foreclosure and also a ""standard"" fraud or misrepresentation suit. Your state could have similar consumer safeguard regulations. As always, should you feel your financial institution has lied or made misstatements to you at any point throughout a foreclosure process; see a legal representative in your state to decide if your particular details will give rise to a offense which could possibly protect against a foreclosure. What misrepresentations a financial institution can make to a person are too varied to number. In essence, when a financial institution says to you it is going to do something and then does something else, it could be a misrepresentation that leads to a violation. As an example, expressions which could create culpability (depending on the facts) could be: a) If a mortgage company advises that it isn't going to foreclose on the home on a specified day and thereafter forecloses nonetheless; b) If your bank provides that the borrower has been approved for a modification or even delivers the borrower with a modification agreement and then fails to modify the mortgage loan; or c) If your creditor affirms that a payment will be applied to the mortgage loan in a specific way and thereafter utilizes it in a different way. There could be numerous probable issues in a fraud or misrepresentation claim. Several sorts of misrepresentations might have to be made in writing so that they are binding. Some representations perhaps may not bring about a misrepresentation. An attorney familiar with these sorts of claims in your area is definitely a critical resource for you if a violation has transpired. Preventing a foreclosure as a result of a misrepresentation regarding a particular foreclosure sale may additionally fail to be a lasting solution. If the bank made a statement that the foreclosure is definitely postponed, yet it is advancing with the foreclosure, a restraining order could avoid that foreclosure, although the creditor would just have to re-post the residence for foreclosure and avoid making any misrepresentations with regards to a future foreclosure. This type of claim might put a stop to the foreclosure, but a follow-up strategy should also be in place to deal with the past due amount. Once again, if you think that your particular bank has made a vital misrepresentation to you before a foreclosure, you need to seek the advice of a legal professional licensed in your state."
15,How to Choose A Zero Percent Credit Card,finance," If you're shopping for a new credit card, perhaps you're considering one with zero interest. If properly selected, zero percent credit cards allow you to carry a month-to-month balance, at no cost, saving hundreds of dollars in interest. Although credit cards often put people into debt, a zero interest credit card can help you get out of debt. The card enables you to pay off your balance faster, without worry. Before you fill out an application, it's very important to read and understand the terms of a credit card agreement to avoid surprise expenses. If you fail to read the fine print, credit cards can accrue unwanted fees, even the cards without interest. The fees are often expensive, increase your debt and prolong the amount of time it will take to pay off the balance. Select a credit card without an annual fee. An annual fee is charged one time per year and the amount ranges from $15 to $300. Rewards cards often charge annual fees, merely for the convenience of owning the card. Paying an annual fee might make sense if the card provides beneficial rewards that you're consistently using, otherwise you shouldn't pay the fee. Apply for a card without a late payment fee. Fees for paying late can cost as much as $39 and lead to major long-term interest expenses. On top of the late payment fee, credit card companies have the right to raise your interest rate, or terminate your zero interest period, as a penalty for failing to pay your bill on time. The interest penalty for paying late usually results in a very high rate and can negatively impact your credit report. Try to find a zero interest credit card without a balance transfer fee. Credit card offers often advertise zero percent for balance transfers, but there's usually a hidden 3% fee, which means you would be charged 3% of the transferred balance. If you transfer a large balance to the new card, you could wind up paying hundreds of dollars from the transfer alone. Owning a credit card with zero interest is great, but the savings won't last forever. If you anticipate carrying a balance after the introductory period ends, it's important to know the future rate of the card. Some credit card companies charge interest rates as high as 30%. Choose a card with a reasonable interest rate, preferably less than 15%. Select a card that includes a grace period. With a grace period, you have an extra twenty five to thirty days to pay off your balance before the interest rate kicks in. Also, there are usually three interest rates noted on a credit card agreement. One rate applies to purchases, while the other rates apply to balance transfers and cash advances. If you're looking for a credit card with no interest on purchases, make sure the zero percent, advertised on the offer, applies to purchases and balance transfers, not only balance transfers. There are credit cards with zero percent APR for twenty one months and other cards with only a six month term. If you plan on transferring a large balance from an interest-bearing credit card, it would be wise to choose a new card with no interest for at least one year, unless you're confident that you're going to pay off the balance before it expires. Typically, credit cards with a longer term of zero interest, require excellent credit to be eligible. If you're paying interest on another card, it is worth applying for a zero percent credit card. Zero percent credit cards don't provide as many rewards and benefits as official rewards cards that charge annual fees, but you can still find a credit with useful rewards that won't cost you money annually. Shop for a card with rewards that you're more likely to use, such as extended warranty coverage on purchases, price protection, double mile rewards, or cash back. You might find that one credit card with a longer term of zero interest provides more rewards than a competing card with a much shorter period."
16,5 Smart Balance Transfer Credit Card Tips,finance," There’s a good chance that a balance transfer credit card will help you if you carry credit card debt. Use a balance transfer card to consolidate debt from your high interest credit cards onto a single low or zero interest credit card. Financial providers offer 0% introductory rates for as much as one year, so you can take advantage of these offers to pay off a sizable chunk of debt. In your search for a balance transfer credit card, you need to keep in mind that they’re not all created equal. To benefit from them, you first have to find the right card and use it the right way when you’re approved. Some companies offer some amazing introductory offers that will not only bring you a little closer to debt free, but also give you some additional rewards for signing on. Here are some tips for smart use of balance transfer offers. Stay Away From Mysterious 0% Periods The best balance transfer credit cards provide the same 0% period to all approved applicants. Some providers cloud their interest free period in mystery, and the card that arrives in the mail could have a 0% period that might be less than you bargained for. Avoid these providers who state – in the fine print – that the low rate period will be based on your credit score. Instead, go with a reputable firm that advertises and offers the same interest free period to everyone. Don’t be Deterred By Balance Transfer Fees All leading credit card companies that offer zero or low introductory rates charge a balance transfer fee. This fee might be somewhere between three to five percent on the amount transferred. The upfront cost might seem like a lot, but is really nothing compared to the money you’ll save on interest over that low interest period. Keep An Open Mind When Comparing Offers Before you start comparing offers, you’ll first have to be honest with yourself about the time you’ll need to pay off the debt. Let’s say you owe $5,000, and plan to pay at least $400 monthly on the debt. You’ll need a 12 month interest free period to pay off that debt without interest. In this case, you’re better off choosing a card with a higher fee if it gives you more time to pay. The goal of the balance transfer is to get as much time as you can to pay off the debt before interest kicks in. Keep that in mind when you compare offers. Keep Your Old Accounts Open Closing credit cards all of a sudden will negatively affect your credit scores. The main reasons for this are it increases your credit utilization ratio, shortens your history and could give creditors the false impression that you’ve maxed out your credit. Keep those accounts open unless you’re forced to pay a high annual fee. Then it might be a good idea to close one or two. Don’t Miss Payments Miss one payment and you can say bye-bye to your zero percent interest rate. Credit card providers stipulate this in their term and conditions, and it’s especially enforced on balance transfer credit cards. The bottom line: Make that monthly payment at all costs."
17,Is The Longest Zero-Interest Credit Card Offer Always Better?,finance," With the battle for credit card customers hotting up, card issuers are vying with each other to make increasingly attractive offers for consumers.  Credit card borrowers are spoiled for choice, and can now transfer balances from one card to another without even paying interest rates on it for up to 2 years. But is it ideal to choose a zero-interest credit card primarily because it offers the longest interest-free period?  Not necessarily, since other factors may influence your choice of low-interest credit card. One of them may be the ""transfer fee"" which is a levy imposed by credit card companies on consumers who plan a balance transfer from older cards.  The transfer fee can vary widely and usually depends upon the amount of debt transferred.  A high transfer fee can negate the advantages of low interest rates.  Make sure that you know what transfer fee your new credit card company will charge before signing up for any contract. Transfer Fee Versus Longer Interest-Free Period Imagine having an outstanding credit card debt of $3,000.  You can transfer it over to a zero-interest credit card that offers you 26 months of interest free credit, but will charge you a higher transfer fee.  Or you can save on transfer fees with another company that has a shorter interest-free period followed by higher interest rates. When other things are almost equal, the credit card with a lower transfer fee will cost less by way of interest, in comparison to one with a high transfer fee and a longer introductory interest-free period.  This is because the extra time of zero-interest is rather short and won't make a big difference in terms of saving money on interest for unpaid debt. How To Avoid Interest One of the major reasons for transferring outstanding balances from your previous credit cards to a zero-interest card is that you will clear any unpaid balance in advance of the date when the annual percentage rates (APR) kick in.  This is why longer zero-interest periods are more desirable. Based on your capacity to repay the debt amount, you may find a particular credit card is better suited to your needs.  By computing your monthly payment dues that will help you clear the outstanding debt before your interest-free period ends, you will be able to compare two options and decide which one is more practical and suitable for you. Avoiding Transfer Fees At the end of the interest-free period, if you find yourself stuck with a lot of debt that is now subject to your APR, you should consider moving the balance once again to another zero-interest card.  But check to see that the card will not charge you a fee for balance transfers. While you may not have to pay a monthly fee with these cards, you will still be charged interest on your debt.  However, the APR will typically be much greater than your interest on credit card debt that averages 17.3%, helping you save money. Before choosing a zero-interest credit card company, make sure to carry out extensive research on the Web or offline, to compare the various features in a range of credit cards.  By using online tools, you can carry out these searches anonymously, sidestepping the possibility of leaving a digital footprint on your credit record."
18,How to Benefit from a Balance Transfer Credit Card,finance," Choosing a 0% balance transfer credit card offer can be an excellent way to cut down your interest costs. It can also be the ideal way to reduce your debt levels very quickly. If you’re happy to use your new card for debt reduction purposes and nothing else, you could find that you can pay off your debts much sooner. Yet there are some traps and pitfalls you should try to avoid. If you’re not careful, it’s possible you could lose all the benefits you thought you were getting by applying for one of these cards. Here’s how to avoid losing all the benefits you should be getting on your 0% balance transfer credit card. 0% Does Not Mean $0 Payments It’s surprising how many people assume that 0% interest means the same thing as zero payments. They think that because there is no interest being charged on their balance transfer amounts that the minimum payment will also automatically become $0. Don’t fall for this. You still have to make at least your minimum payment every month. Some credit card providers have it written into their fine print that if you miss a repayment during the introductory term your interest rate could revert to the normal purchase interest rate, which is usually much higher than your balance transfer rate. 0% on Balance Transfers Does Not Mean an Interest Free Credit Card The advertising spiel for these types of deals makes a fuss of the interest rate being only 0%. This leads many people to believe that they have an interest free credit card in their wallets. They’ll transfer over outstanding balances from other cards, knowing they’re paying no interest on those amounts. Then they’ll go out and pay for purchases using the same card, thinking the amounts they spend will also come at 0%. This isn’t true. You should find that your transaction types are separated on your statement. If you pay for purchases, these amounts will attract the normal purchase interest rate. If you use your card to withdraw cash from an ATM, these amounts will be charged at the even-higher cash advance interest rate. Getting the Biggest Benefits from Your Balance Transfer Card The only real way to pay 0% interest on your balance transfer offer is to only use your card for debt reduction purposes. Then work out how much you need to pay off each month so that your entire balance is cleared before the low rate expires. Before you transfer over any of your balances from other cards, always take the time to do some simple sums. The goal here is to pay off those amounts before the introductory rate ends. For example, if you transfer over $1,000 and you have a 9 month introductory deal you will need to pay at least $111.11 per month off your credit card bill to pay this off before the 0% rate ends. You will also need to be disciplined enough to make sure you don’t use your card for other purposes while you’re focusing on your debt reduction goals. This will stop you from adding to your outstanding balances and help you avoid any unnecessary interest charges."
19,Bank of America’s Better Balance Rewards - A No Interest Balance Transfer Rewards Card That Pays You,finance," There is hardly anyone with a credit card that doesn't know the sinking feeling of making minimum payments— or the pain of missing one altogether. However, getting paid to pay your credit card company isn't a concept that many have had experience with either. Luckily, the concept has caught on with Bank of America and its Better Balance Rewards card. Bank of America is offering $25 every quarter to BBR cardholders who not only make more than the minimum payment each month but consistently make their payments on time. As an added bonus, BBR cardholders that also maintain a checking or savings account with Bank of America will receive an extra $5 each quarter as well. Finally, there is a chance to earn up to $120 dollars of free money per year just for being a fiscally responsible adult. Credit card companies are well-known for punishing cardholders that miss payments but ignoring the good practices of those who manage their debt consistently and responsibly. Bank of America's hope for this type of rewards card is to encourage those who already pay consistently to keep doing so and offer extra incentive for those who are looking to get better at paying on time. Eventually, the bank hopes to grow a deeper, more genuine relationship with its customers that will also help repair its damaged public image. Many consumer credit experts consider the Better Balance Rewards card a breath of fresh air because it provides a combination of benefits that can motivate consumers to reduce their credit debt instead of increase it. In addition to offering no annual fee and a 0% interest rate for the first 12 months, the interest rate is extended to new purchases as well as balance transfers— as long as they are made in the first 60 days of opening an account. Still, BBR cardholders who miss a payment can be subjected to a late payment fee of up to $35 and have the 0% interest revoked. The card's interest rate can then jump as high as 29.99%. Furthermore, once the 0% interest period is over, the interest rate is adjusted to reflect the cardholder's credit score. That's fine for those with good credit. For those whose credit is a little shaky, the number can go as high as 21.99%. As easy as it is to like the concept of getting rewarded for doing the right thing— especially by a bank— consumer credit experts feel those looking for balance transfer cards may do better with credit cards whose 0% interest grace periods last longer than 12 months. Experts also caution that even with all the benefits, the Better Balance Rewards credit card is just a credit card and the ability to eliminate debt is strictly in the hands of the cardholder, not the card itself. Nonetheless, Bank of America feels that it will reach the right customers for the Better Balance Rewards card by offering it as an option to existing customers and approaching prospective customers through targeted marketing. For those who don't qualify for the card through Bank of America, take heart. It is likely there will be enough appeal in the concept that, soon enough, other credit card companies will follow Bank of America's lead, creating a wider, competitive market of rewards cards that genuinely pay."
20,Year 2013 | Last Best Chance To File Your US Expat Taxes,finance," Find The IRS Before They Find You This is the last US tax filing season for American expats to become current with the IRS before new laws come into play that will reveal your identity, location and foreign accounts to the US government. Now is the last best chance for Americans living abroad to become current with your US tax filing. With new US FATCA laws (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) coming online, your local foreign bank will now be required to disclose your personal details to the US government. As if this was not enough, in addition, the foreign government under which Americans reside overseas will be doing the same thing – collecting what was once private financial data from their country’s banks to be handed over to the US government so that the IRS can locate you and your assets. These FATCA reporting laws and accompanying enforcement take effect  on January 1st, 2014. FATCA - One Hundred Ninety Five Countries - One IRS With the unfolding of these new mandates, there are only two possible paths that remain for US expats   – either to file your US taxes and accompanying forms that disclose your foreign assets to become current with the IRS or the United States will do it for you.  How does the US this?  The IRS will complete an assessment of what they believe you should owe (and their assessments are astronomically high) and present you with the bill. Whether you choose to file of your own volition or wait to hear from the IRS, the difference in outcomes is staggering. Amen and Hallelujah - IRS Creates A Sure and Safe Path Forward For US Expats Alongside the enactment of and enforcement of their new FATCA laws, the IRS has set about creating a fair way for Americans who are not tax compliant to come quietly through the side-door all the way back into the fold. They’re giving you one last chance to find them before they find you -and as of 2014 it is a foregone conclusion.  You will be found. As an overture to American expats, IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman, himself, has declared that, ""We are announcing a series of common-sense steps to help U.S. citizens abroad get current with their tax obligations,"" said Commissioner Shulman. ""The IRS is aware that some US taxpayers living abroad have failed to timely file U.S. federal income tax returns or Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBARs). Some of these taxpayers have recently become aware of their filing obligations and now seek to come into compliance with the law."" The IRS’s statement by Commissioner Shulman acknowledges that those Americans who were non-compliant because they were simply not aware of their US tax obligations, and who owe little or no back taxes, will not be subjected to undue scrutiny or ruinous FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting) penalties. Under Commissioner Shulman, the IRS has declared filing three years back taxes is adequate for most US expat tax filers who are delinquent and there shall be no penalties for late FBARs from those who were unaware of the requirement to file. FATCA & The IRS – It Comes To Those Who Wait Becoming current with your US tax filings almost always benefits the individual, whereas conversely, a person who is discovered by the IRS first is always in a worse financial position. First, one must deal with the initial assessment that one has been presented with. Then, there is the matter of filing all of the back returns that the IRS wants you to file – as far back as ten years. The opportunity to claim the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (which typically makes the first $95 thousand you earn tax free) may be forfeited. There are fines, penalties, fees and interest that will have accrued over a span of years. It can quickly add up to sums that are incomprehensible. Liens on personal assets, seizing of accounts and garnishment of wages are all punitive measures the IRS can and will bring to bear. Another important consideration is the amount of time and emotional energy one must spend to bring your affairs before the IRS into compliance. It can take years. Beyond all of that is the possibility that one can have their passport revoked or its renewal denied. That puts one in a nearly impossible position – and one that is not easily rectified until one’s taxes are addressed. Further elements that can come into play that could derail your life as usual is inheritance you may receive, eligibility for social security, or the unwinding of fiscal matters in a divorce. There is no statute of limitations either. In the States, the statute is 10 years. As soon as you leave the States, though, the clock stops and patiently awaits your return. Easy Does It – And You Can Too As daunting as the prospect of filing your US taxes seems – of coming forward and engaging a CPA to help and rifling through all the requisite documents and records that would be required to file, the opposite scenario is far, far worse. In actual fact, the process is much simpler than most expats believe. Once you’ve gotten started the whole endeavor can be easily complete with a few weeks. Now that there’s a clear, safe path forward proscribed by the IRS itself, it only seems obvious that the appropriate solution is to get it taken care of - then enjoy the peace of mind that comes from having ‘sated the beast’!"
