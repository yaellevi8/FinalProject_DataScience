1,EU Travel To The UK Post-Brexit: What To Expect,travel-leisure," Brexit oﬃcially began on Friday 31st January 2020 at 23.00. This was shortly followed by the end of freedom of movement for EU nationals and members of the EU Economic area, according to the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Act (2021). EU citizens are now expected to provide the same documentation as citizens of other countries worldwide, with the exception of Irish nationals, who do not require permission to enter or emigrate to the UK, in line with the Common Travel Area arrangements. Irish nationals therefore do not require a visa, employment permit, or residence permit for travel to the UK. However, these increased barriers to movement have had great implications for trade between the UK and EU blocs, and for the citizens of EU countries. EU citizens who had been living in the UK prior to Brexit were required to apply for the EU Resettlement Scheme to ensure that they could legally remain in the UK after the state exited the European Union. It also meant that EU citizens were required to provide a visa if they were looking to work, study, or join family in the UK. Here, we will outline the changes to immigration law post-Brexit, and what you can expect now when travelling to the UK. Short Stays And Holidays Overall, there has been little change to how EU nationals can holiday in the UK or make short visits for events or festivals etc. However, there are a few changes which may aﬀect the ways in which EU nationals can spend their time in the UK. • Holidays do not require a visa: EU, EEA and Swiss citizens may stay for up to six months as a ‘Standard Visitor’ in the UK without requiring a visa. They may visit the country as many times as they like in a given period, as long as each stay does not exceed six months. • Standard Visitors are not permitted to carry out work for UK companies or as a self-employed worker without a visa: However, according to the Immigration Rules, Standard Visitors may holiday, volunteer for up to 30 days with a registered charity, and study at an accredited institution which is not publicly funded, for up to six months. They may also carry out limited business activities in the UK, as long as the work for the client is conducted outside of the UK. This includes business meetings, seminars, conferences, interviews, briefings, non-commercial talks and speeches, attending trade fairs (though sales are not permitted), and business negotiations, and deals. Business visitors may not do a work internship or sell goods or services without a visa. • By the end of 2024, visitors who do not require a visa for short stays will need to apply for the electronic travel authorisation scheme: Carriers will be required to check permission to travel before boarding. This is to tighten security checks and to make advanced decisions regarding entries to the UK. • Passports are required for entry to the UK: As of October 2021, EU, EEA, and Swiss ID cards are no longer valid for entry to the UK. All visitors are now required to use a passport. Passports must be valid for 6 months following entry to the UK. • End to EU-Fast Track lanes: EU nationals are no longer given priority to board, which means an end to Fast Track lanes at air and ferry ports. This may result in longer border crossings. Visitors may also be required to prove that they are capable of returning to the EU by displaying either a return ticket or proof of financial means. • Travel Health Insurance: EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will remain valid until their expiry date. On expiry, visitors will be required to apply for the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC), which covers pre-existing conditions, maternity care, and emergency treatment. The Immigration Implications The government introduced a points-based immigration system on January 1st 2021, which applies to both EU nationals and global citizens. This move meant that highly skilled workers were given priority for immigration, including workers from scientific, academic, and engineering fields. The oﬃcial policy statement of February 2020 reads: ‘From 1 January 2021, EU and non-EU citizens will be treated equally. We will reduce overall levels of migration and give top priority to those with the highest skills and the greatest talents: scientists, engineers, academics, and other highly skilled workers. ‘We will replace free movement with the UK’s points-based system to cater for the most highly skilled workers, skilled workers, students, and a range of other specialist work routes including routes for global leaders and innovators. ‘We will not introduce a general low-skilled or temporary work route. We need to shift the focus of our economy away from a reliance on cheap labour from Europe and instead concentrate on investment in technology and automation. Employers will need to adjust. 'Citizens applying for permission to work in the UK will now be required to apply for a Skilled Worker Visa, or an alternative option such as intracompany transfer, family member or global talent visas.’ As of 2020, citizens who exercised freedom of movement prior to Brexit were required to apply for the EU Resettlement Scheme to secure their right to remain in the UK. Successful applicants were granted Pre-settled status (limited leave to remain) if they had lived in the UK for under five years, or Settled status (indefinite leave to remain) if they had lived in the UK for over five years. The application period closed on the June 30th 2021. Happy Holidays And Rarer Relocations Overall, travel to the UK after Brexit is still relatively simple for EU-based tourists and holidaymakers, although they will need to present their passport when entering the country, which is not something they were required to do when the UK was subject to the EU’s agreements for streamlined travel. However, those seeking to relocate to the UK on a more permanent basis will face increased barriers and more mandatory barriers that they must meet if they are to be allowed to settle in the country and begin a new life there. But the debate over Brexit and its implications is far from over, with some in the UK calling for greater re-integration with EU and smoother trade and travel relationships between the blocs. This means the current status quo may be liable to change again in the coming years."
2,Touring Tuscany: Where To Go And What To Do,travel-leisure," Tuscany is a historic Italian province which showcases the very best of Italian culture, architecture, food, and wine. Its strategic location on the West coast has meant that it has been colonised many times under many rulers, first by the Roman empire in 351 BC to the Napoleonic empire in 1808. As a small and visually stunning Italian province, which is easily accessible by car, Tuscany makes an ideal destination for keen tourists and has an abundance of historical monuments, picturesque plazas, and traditional Italian food to explore. Here are some of the best places you can visit in the Tuscany area, with details of all the history and culture that this famous province has to oﬀer. Florence Florence is known as the birthplace of the Renaissance period and has been home to some of the most famous Renaissance artists, including Donatello and Michelangelo, whose famous David statue is on display at the Galleria dell'Accademia. The Renaissance influence can be seen in the architecture, and there are many exquisite buildings to visit in Florence, including the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore which features Brunelleschi’s famous dome. If you love a good souvenir, stop oﬀ at the Mercato Di San Lorenzo for a lively, bustling market overflowing with Italian leather goods and nostalgia-inspiring mementoes. And if you’re searching for a true taste of Italian foods, the Mercato Centrale is packed with tasty local delicacies, from quality olive oils to Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a flavourful range of fresh fruits and vegetables. Lucca Located on the West Coast of Tuscany, Lucca is a small historic city which is bustling with culture and art in its own right. Lucca is alternatively known as ‘the city of a hundred churches’ due to its abundance of historical architecture, and became a large part of the Roman empire during 180BC, later becoming an independent state for nearly 500 years until it was conquered by Napoleon in the 1800s. Among its architectural delights is the impressive Lucca cathedral, where visitors can view the shrine of the Sacred Face of Lucca, as well as the Piazza dell Anfiteatro (which was originally a Roman Amphitheatre), and the Aqueduct of Nottolini. If you prefer to be out in nature (and after all, with such lovely sunshine, why not?), the Botanical Gardens of Lucca are not to be missed, and feature a colourful variety of species, with several greenhouses, a herbarium, an arboretum, and an abundance of water features. Pisa A trip to Tuscany is not complete without seeing the iconic Tower of Pisa. The town is busy, and a little touristy, but the tower itself is a true marvel of Italian architecture that must be seen in a lifetime. If you prefer to avoid the tourist traps, you may like to visit the Palazzo Blu, a 14th Century palace which now functions as the art and culture hub of Pisa, or take a cycle trip out to the Marina di Pisa, which is a stunning coastline of bright white pebbles and rugged shores. San Gimignano A picturesque hilltop town founded in the 6th Century AD, San Gimignano has been colonised many times as a strategic location with close access to the Via Francigena. It was involved in long battles against the city of Volterra during the Middle Ages, and internal civil conflicts between the Gulfs and the Ghibellines, finally being conquered by the Ghibellines between 1194-1250AD. The poet Dante Alighieri, known for his famous Divine Comedy (La Commedia) lived in the city in 1299 AD as the Florence ambassador. In 1398AD, San Gimignano came under the rule of Florence, and later, under Napoleonic rule between 1809 and 1814. Following the dissolution of the Napoleonic empire, it was ruled again by Tuscany until Italy was unified in 1769 by Ferdinand III. Today, San Gimignano is a lively town which is famous for its breathtaking towers, frescos, pristinely conserved medieval architecture, and art, which is now a popular trade in the area due to its visually impressive surroundings. Siena Siena was in conflict with Florence in the Middle Ages, and the battles endured for several centuries until Siena surrendered in 1555. Now, Siena is famed for its spectacular medieval architecture, including the Duomo di Siena, which is arguably one of the most impressive Duomos in Italy. Surrounded by rolling Tuscan hills, vineyards, and farmhouses, Siena is renowned for its beautiful valley, the Val d’Orcia, which makes for a breathtaking drive, and for the Palio (horse race), which takes place in the Piazza Del Campo twice a year. Montepulciano A popular destination following the release of Twilight: New Moon, Montepulciano is another living relic of the Italian Medieval era. Embellished with enchanting panoramic views of the Tuscan landscape, Montepulciano is a showcase of Renaissance art and architecture, including - just outside the town walls - the Temple Of Madonna di San Biago, which was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the elder between 1518 and 1548. The Temple was considered so iconic that it was used as a reference for Michelangelo’s St. Basilica in Rome. The Piazza Grande is frequently used as a venue for a variety of cultural events, and the town’s artistic leanings are perfectly captured by the eye-catching array of artisan workshops and historical artworks. While you’re there, try Montepulciano’s world-famous wine, Vino Nobile, which is one of Tuscany’s most renowned wines. You will be able to find it at one of Montepulciano’s many famous wineries, which are an attraction in their own right for wine-lovers and nature enthusiasts alike. Montepulciano is a cultural hub and is home to many artistic and cultural events, including the Bravio Delle Bocci, which is a costumed race across the town in historic dress. The Bruschello Poliziano is a visual spectacle which is not to be missed; a theatrical show playing a range of plays from the folkloric to well-known and loved classics. If artistic blood runs in your veins, the International Art Workshop is another must-see, which runs some of the best art exhibitions and music events in Tuscany. Arezzo Home to its very own Roman Colosseum, Arezzo is a striking city which shows oﬀ the splendour of Tuscany's 15th-century architecture. Take in the views of the Tuscan countryside for one last time from the Medici fortress before you go - the memory will last a lifetime. The town is surrounded by the Tiberina, Casentino, Valdarno, and Valdichiana valleys, which gives you dramatic views over Tuscany. Arezzo is home to many famous frescos, including Piero Della Francesca’s artworks in the Church of San Francesco, and is the perfect browsing spot for art-lovers and antique collectors, with an array of antique shops and art attractions. Arezzo also features the home of 16th Century Mannerist artist Giorgio Vasari, which is arguably one of the birthplaces of the Illusionist movement. Vasari’s works, among other famous Italian artists, are also displayed in all their grandeur at the Museo d’Arte Medievale a Modern. Arezzo is a delightful place that perfectly captures the spirit and passion of Italian art and culture!"

4,BOOK A BUDGET SAFARI IN UGANDA,travel-leisure," BOOK A BUDGET SAFARI IN UGANDA Uganda Budget Safaris take you on a journey of the soul to meet the mountain gorillas in the wild, enjoy wildlife safaris including the big Five animals in various Uganda national Parks. Uganda Safaris to national parks including the ancient Rwenzori Mountains to the world’s heritage sites, Bwindi Impenetrable national park famous for gorilla trekking, Kidepo valley national park, the only place in Uganda to see the cheetah etc. Welcome to Dav Safaris, the destination master offering spending safaris in East Africa. We have an experienced team planning private safaris guided by quality local tour experts. Our safaris highlight the top undertakings in Uganda including gorilla journeying, untamed life safaris, mountaineering and the sky is the limit from there. Through long periods of involvement, we have chosen a decent arrangement of spending safari lodges and Camp locales where you can appreciate an overnight remain during your Uganda Safari Tours. Factors To Consider When Booking A Budget Uganda Safari There are not so many factors to consider when booking Affordable Uganda Safari. Below we discussed some of the factors to consider when booking a Uganda Budget Safaris. The Travel Agency One mistake you should never make is going for high profile companies or book through a travel agent. High profile travel companies have made a brand and will always charge you a crazy amount for a tour. A travel agent on the other hand will also want to make a profit out of your safari. The best option is searching for operators online. Alternatively, you can book through these recommended trekking operators. Make sure you book with a company that is based in Rwanda or Uganda. Do not book your gorilla safari with a Kenyan company, Tanzanian company or any company outside Rwanda and Uganda. The local tour operators usually have low operational costs and will give you the best quote. Choosing Destination Uganda is a perfect place for budget safaris if you want to combine both the savannah and the rainforest experience in the same destination without crossing borders. With the many advantages that visit Uganda rewards, being a more fordable option by many is one, less crowds in the park and lodges are some of the other advantages among many. Choice of Accommodation Gorilla safari lodges play a huge part to your safari. We would suggest you book comfortable accommodation. Do not allow your tour operator to book lodges that are too cheap as it will ruin your trip. When you go tracking, you return to your lodge to relax and if you do not feel comfortable with your accommodation then you won’t enjoy your trip the way you should have done. The Safari Vehicle A safari van is usually quoted at $100 per day where as a Land Cruiser goes for $250 – 300 per day. This depends on your tour operator as some operators charge less. Nevertheless, the charge above is the industry standard. Opt for a safari van, super custom in particular if you may. These cars can sometime mean to be more comfortable that land cruisers. Only ensure they are 4 wheel and not 2 wheel drive. Ugandan roads can get muddy at times hence, a 4wd safari car is highly recommended. Number of Days The fewer your days, the less you’ll spend. A five – ten days safari cannot cost the same as a 2 – 3 days safari. If your main aim is seeing gorillas, booking a 3 days Gorilla Trekking Uganda from Kigali is a good option and you should consider it. Bwindi Impenetrable National Park’s proximity to Kigali has made it easier for clients to arrive in Kigali and transfer to Bwindi on the same day then trek gorillas and transfer to Kigali on the same day too. This way, you can see gorillas on a budget in 2 days. Where You Arrive From Arriving from Uganda is a bit costly. Its impossible to arrive and transfer to Bwindi on the same day unless your flight reaches earlier than 0700 hours. Besides we would not recommend this. Imagine sitting on a flight for 6 – 8 hours then you arrive and take on another 8 – 10 hours journey to Bwindi. Either way, you will have to spend a day / night in Kampala or Entebbe then transfer to Bwindi the following day. This is costly because you will have to pay for accommodation, meals, airport transfer plus a few more costs that may arise. So where should you arrive from? Arriving in Kigali and driving to Bwindi is the best option. It is only 4 – 5 hours from Kigali to Bwindi with a stopover. You can arrive and transfer to Bwindi on the same day and won’t need to spend money on accommodation for the first night. These are just a few of the things we take into consideration when planning a Budget Safari Uganda for our clients. Other factors include how to get around, what type of travel documentation is required, if any vaccines are recommended, safety, and many more. Our Uganda Travel Tips that we provide is well articulated and you won’t miss any necessary things or equipment in your trip. In conclusion Dav Safaris is a Ugandan based Tours and Safari Company established to deliver enriching African holiday experiences to tourists visiting Uganda. one of the best leading company in Uganda welcomes you to enjoy some of its offers on Uganda Safari Tours.

People have different tastes and preferences for activities that give them pleasure on safari. Sole travelers love their privacy and prefer to derive pleasure from exploring alone and making their private adventures and discoveries. Other travelers move as couples on honeymoon, dating, in retirement, or for other purposes. The majority of travelers move in small nucleus groups like family, old friends, family friends, or office workmates.  Other travelers find pleasure or by nature of circumstances opt for large group safaris like students on study tours, athletes on sports and games tournaments, corporate or company outdoor working retreats, and faith pilgrims amongst others. Travel companies often make enticing scheduled group safari itineraries on fixed dates to particular destinations with exciting adventure activities. Interested travelers sharing similar interests though unknown to each other join in individual or couple. Some reasons for choosing group safaris; A group safari is a meeting point for new people with different lifestyles but sharing similar interests. The itinerary for group safari gives members an opportunity to make discoveries previously unknown to them Members with limited travel budgets to explore outdoors pool resources together and fulfill their life dreams. Group safaris attract discounts from service providers; travel, accommodation and activities. Group members get pleasure from the same safari at a discounted rate. Corporate group safaris offer relaxation, team build, and strong bonds from a new exciting working environment Group safari is a great way of exploring and adventuring as a team.

Uganda; located in the African tropics rises 621m- 5,109m (Lake Albert and the tip of Ruwenzori Mountains respectively); land distance less than 100km apart. Largely plateau, Uganda island of contrasts and contradictions averages 1,100m above sea level. Uganda's astounding beauty with mesmerizing sightings stretches from landforms and land features, weather, vegetation cover, the indigenous communities’ lifestyles, mammals, birds, and other wildlife features, land, air, and marine features. Uganda is an eco-friendly country with strong support for wildlife conservation and protection and minimal mass tourism to the wildlife places. However, controlled grouping is the only possible option to access some of Uganda's wildlife tourism activities or the best option to get maximum satisfaction from safari. Wildlife safaris; Uganda has a very varied and rich diversity of vegetation and plant species ranging from rainforests, woodlands, wetlands, open grasslands, semi arid, and human plantation estates to open water bodies. This hosts a wide range of beautiful mammals, colorful birds, reptiles and insects, plants, and other wildlife species. A smooth network of roads traverses the entire country giving adventurers an opportunity to explore and discover wildlife species in their natural settings. Group adventurers or individuals descend into the wilderness for game viewing, Mountain gorilla trekking, chimpanzee tracking, bird watching, rhino tracking, nature walks, hiking, and other exciting adventure expeditions. Landforms and land features; Uganda is a true paradise and number one true adventurers’ dream safari destination. Uganda’s wide range of eye-catching landscapes includes block mountains, rift valleys, escarpments, unique craters and crater lakes, waterfalls, hot springs, open savannas, and rainforests, among many others. True adventurers cannot resist the temptation to venture out in groups or individually, explore and make personal discoveries. In some ways, group adventuring is the only option or easiest way to get maximum pleasure from attractions. White water rafting, mountaineering, hiking, photography, and boat cruises amongst others are extremely exciting and adrenaline generating though tedious, tiring, and exhausting. Adventuring in groups gives maximum physical and psychological support, morale, pleasure, and maximum satisfaction. Community settings; Uganda may not be blessed with vast area coverage like other countries, but she is blessed with a rich diversity in people. Uganda has in excess of 50 tribal groupings; each one with different cultural settings. The difference is very visible in traditional social, economic, security, religious, and other activities. Each tribal group has unique homestead settings, traditional ways of taming nature for survival, tools in use, music, dance, and entertainment amongst others. Though, very different in character, Ugandan tribal groupings are warmhearted, welcoming, friendly, have mutual respect for each other, live in harmony, and are proud of Uganda. Cultural exchange group safaris explore the indigenous community lifestyles through music, songs, costumes and dressing, active participation in cultural activities, traditional sports, games, traditional rituals, and ceremonies amongst others. The members on safaris share experiences, create strong external bonds, and widen knowledge across the entire globe. Faith tourism; Christian missionaries first set foot in Uganda in the 1860s long before her national independence. Uganda's population is 45.74millions (2020) with 85% confessing to Christianity of different denominations, 13% are Moslem faithful. The rest are not baptized to any religion and believe in traditional rituals but believe there is supernatural power. On June 03rd thousands of pilgrims from all over the world converge at Uganda Martyrs’ Shrine, Namugongo to commemorate Christian recruits sentenced to death by the cultural king for opposing his orders after converting from traditional religion. Weather and climate: Uganda lies in the African tropics and is among the only six African countries bisected by the equator line. A combination of other factors like vegetation cover, altitude, human activity, and large water bodies amongst others regulate Uganda's weather into a pleasant dream destination with warm temperatures and torrential showers. Uganda has a very pleasant climate with weather conditions experiencing double rainy and dry seasons every year. Uganda is landlocked with no access to the ocean and expansive shorelines, though Uganda has massive flesh water bodies dripping with astounding natural beauty and shimmering white sand beaches. Uganda is a prime destination for group vacations and holidaymaking, study tours, sports, and games. Cost-effective: Uganda is a melting pot with smashing beauty spreading into all corners of the country. With a good network of road network; a mixture of bitumen tarmac and well-paved roads, all attractions are easily accessible all through the year. Indigenous communities engage in organic food production, and supply food items, and other resources to safari camps. Safari camps have easy access to markets for other items. Travelers on Uganda tours can apply for an East African visa that allows easy access to Kenya and Rwanda too. Individuals on group safaris pool resources, share costs, and make an otherwise expensive budget pocket friendly. The group size and budget determine whether to book overland trucks, private buses, minibusses, safari customized land cruisers, or safari customized minivans. Accommodation: Uganda is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty and warmhearted, hospitable and innovative indigenous communities. Most tour and adventure sites are easily accessible with luxury, mid-range and budget accommodation facilities. The campsite and hotel staff are literate, well trained and offer high-quality customer and catering services. Travelers on group tours often share rooms, have access to student centers or camps to minimize costs. Tourism activities, travel and accommodation are very competitive with hard climatic and weather conditions in other continents; June-September and December- February. Group safaris need make appropriate planning and necessary adjustments to offer high quality service, reduce inconveniences, disappointments. Individuals on group safaris have different tastes and preferences. Sometimes, members on group safari come together just for the sake of safari. There is need for tact and experience in arranging group safaris. The choice of company for your group safari makes a very big difference; an everlasting memory or unpleasant history in your life. Members need pay extra attention to age range of group members, budget estimates, destination, interests (often related to age) and size of the group.

7,How to Handle (& Prevent!) Dental Emergencies on Your Vacation,travel-leisure," The temperature is getting warmer and the days are getting longer… summertime must be just around the corner! As a long-time Juno Beach dentist, I know that means peak vacation time is just around the corner too. If you’re using your much-deserved PTO to unwind on the beach, then the LAST thing you want to deal with is a toothache. After all, even a minor one can make trying new foods and sleeping peacefully nearly impossible. Keep reading as I share a few must-know tips for preventing dental emergencies as well as a step-by-step guide on what to do if you do experience one on vacation. First, Let’s Talk About How to Prevent Dental Emergencies If a dental emergency arises while on vacation, you can, of course, find a local dentist like me to help. However, it’s best to avoid these situations altogether to keep your vacation as stress-free as possible. Here are four key ways to help prevent a dental injury during your time off: •	Visit your dentist for a checkup and cleaning beforehand •	Maintain a solid oral hygiene regimen before, during, and after your vacation •	Avoid unhealthy dental habits, like smoking and chewing on ice •	Keep your consumption of sugary foods and beverages to a minimum Oral Hygiene Essentials to Pack in Your Bag Whether you’re going away for a few days or an entire week, it’s important to pack your bag with more than just shoes, clothes, and underwear – you need all of your oral hygiene essentials too! A few staples to pack are a soft-bristled toothbrush, floss, and a travel-sized mouthwash. It’s also a good idea to include some dental emergency-related items, like ibuprofen. Lastly, make sure to include the information of a local dentist. It may seem excessive, but you’ll be glad you did if you end up needing their phone number and address in a hurry! A Step-by-Step Guide to Handling a Dental Emergency While on Vacation Ideally, your vacation will be nothing short of relaxing and rejuvenating. However, if you do happen to experience a dental emergency, then: •	Assess the damage – Dental emergencies include everything from a sudden toothache to a completely knocked-out tooth. So, priority number one is to assess the damage. If you are struggling with a potentially life-threatening symptom, like difficulty breathing or a fractured jaw, then heading to the nearest ER is the best course of action. For all other dental-related injuries, visit a dentist. •	Take action – Once you’ve assessed the damage and determined where to seek help, there are a few things you can do. Gently rinsing your mouth out with water, using a cold compress to minimize any swelling, and taking an over-the-counter pain reliever are a few common actions patients take until their appointment. •	Visit a skilled nearby dentist – Whether you have to go to the ER first or you’re able to head straight to a dental office, it’s important to remember that only dentists can treat tooth-related injuries. The sooner you visit them, the sooner your pain-free smile will be restored. Getting a dental injury likely isn’t on your itinerary. That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen though, which is why it’s so important to be prepared. That way, even a slight hiccup like a dental emergency won’t ruin your much-deserved vacation."
8,How To Save Money On Your Next Vacation,travel-leisure," When you go on vacation, you want to ensure that you are getting the most out of your trip while also saving as much money as possible. You need to keep several key points in mind as you plan your next getaway. From budgeting to planning your destination, these tips will help you save money on your next vacation and ensure that you have an unforgettable experience. Start with your bank account. Regardless of where you're going, it's a good idea to keep an eye on your bank account and make sure you have enough money there for your trip. Preparing ahead of time will make everything go more smoothly once you're in transit. And don't forget about plane tickets—many airlines allow passengers to buy them up to two weeks before departure, so it pays to be flexible with your travel dates. For more info visit here: https://plannay.travel/ Get your insurance in order. If you're an American citizen, you're lucky enough to live in a country that offers excellent health care coverage. That means travel insurance probably isn't as important to you, but getting a policy before going overseas still makes sense. Travel insurance is a rider that attaches to your standard health and life insurance policy; it covers emergency medical services, delayed or lost baggage, lost documents, and more. You should already have travel insurance for long-term trips—unless your employer pays for those costs—but even short vacations require insurance coverage. Simply put: When traveling abroad, you never know what could happen. It's best to be prepared and insured if something does go wrong. Figure out your budget The first step to any successful vacation is creating a budget. You can use spreadsheets or apps, but you also have other options for creating and sticking to a travel budget. For example, your local library may have books that you can take out with helpful tips on planning and saving money for your trip. If you're unsure where you want to go or what kind of activities you want to do while there, a book may be all that's needed—or at least a great starting point. Before booking anything (flights, hotels, excursions), put together a budget and figure out how much money you want to spend in each category (transportation, lodging, meals/drinks). But as always: It's important to be flexible! Buy tickets in advance. The ticket prices for airline travel are constantly changing, and it can be quite a hassle to check constantly to see if you can find a better deal. And then what do you do if you're traveling on a very tight budget? Traveling in advance will give you more time to ensure that your savings will hold up under different economic scenarios. While some people choose not to buy tickets until they're ready to travel, buying tickets three months in advance (or earlier) might save you as much as 50% off your airfare! Determine where you're going Once you've decided to take a vacation, it's time to start looking at where to go. The most obvious place is your hometown: visit friends and family, and enjoy getting away from it all in a familiar place. But if you're looking for something different, there are a few places you can look: these include nearby states or countries with interesting attractions that you may not have visited before. Keep traveling costs low. Traveling isn't necessarily expensive—it just depends on how you go about it. Try to get a good price on your ticket before you buy, and if it's in your budget, splurge on a nice hotel room with a view. Remember: You can always find cheaper tickets (or better hotel deals) around the same time of year. Buy things you need when you arrive at your destination. If you're traveling to a major city or going on a long road trip, buy toiletries, coffee, and other basic items when you get there. You'll avoid paying tourist prices while also getting to experience your destination. The closer to your destination when you shop for these things, the less likely it is that they will melt or be crushed by TSA agents before reaching their final destination. Be flexible with dates or trips. One of the easiest ways to save money on vacation is flexibility. Instead of insisting on visiting a certain destination at a certain time, keep your schedule flexible and be open to different travel dates and destinations. You'll have more opportunities to find deals on flights and accommodations while still getting exactly what you want out of your trip. Plus, with more options comes less stress—and that's what vacations are all about! Use public transportation, and it will save you money! Public transportation is a great alternative for vacationers looking to save money. One of its biggest advantages is that you don't have to worry about paying for gas; plus, if you're going somewhere new, it can be a fun way to discover hidden gems and meet local people along your route. Just make sure you research your transit options before you go to have enough time to get where you need to go!"
9,Blake McCoy on Trips to Add to Your 2022 Bucket List,travel-leisure," The pandemic dealt a big blow to travel bucket lists everywhere. With many COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted, this could be the year to revisit those travel plans. Here is a starting point for travel inspiration so you can begin booking travel accommodations. Stroll Through Amsterdam Home to romantic canals and distinctive architecture, Amsterdam is loaded with character and hospitable people. Do as the locals do and rent a bike to roll through the streets. This picturesque city gets a lot of attention for legalized marijuana and a red light district but offers much, much more. Whether exploring on the water, by bike, or on foot, Amsterdam has proven itself on more than one occasion to be a bucket-list-worthy destination and often serves as a gateway for American tourists to the rest of Europe. Spot Wildlife at Serengeti National Park For an immersive safari experience only found in Africa, Serengeti National Park is teeming with wildlife such as elephants, zebras, lions, and more. This national park is regarded as one of the best safari destinations in the world. The scenery and big game are some of the most awe-inspiring views humans will gaze upon in their lifetime. On my trip with family in 2007, we even took a hot air balloon ride at sunrise over the savannah. Absolutely breathtaking. Eat Tapas Throughout Spain Spain is a global tourism hotspot with unique cultural cities, stunning architecture, splendid flamenco dancers, and unmatchable food. It can be difficult to choose one city to visit, as Spain’s culture is mixed well between the big-name cities and smaller countryside towns. Instead of visiting one spot, embark on a road trip throughout the country’s various regions. Indulge in churros con chocolate for breakfast, pace yourself with tapas throughout the day and drink sangria late into the night after an afternoon siesta. Sail Through Greece Greece’s tourism was among some of the hardest hit during the pandemic. With a hopeful future ahead, the country is now welcoming back tourists. To escape the touristy islands of Santorini and Mykonos, opt for a sailing trip with stops on some of the lesser-known but beautifully inhabited islands. With over 2,000 islands, Greece has a ton of options. Set sail on calm seas and soak up the sunshine by exploring empty beaches. With that said, if you’re looking to party then go to Mykonos but prepare to pay. It’s a global hotspot for the jet-set crowd and prices reflect it."

12,Some Easy Banff Hikes for everybody In the Family,travel-leisure," Banff National Park and the neighbouring Canadian Rockies provide soul-stirring scenery and fresh mountain air. It would be a disgrace to oneself to come here and not do at least a couple of hikes or walk in the wilderness. Every one of these easy treks in Banff and a few more in the area is suitable for all levels of hikers and provides spectacular natural scenery and pure wilderness. These simple Banff walks take place on well-maintained routes and thus are sure to please hikers of all abilities. This climb takes you beyond the first two points of view across Peyto Lake and the hill to a picture of Bow Lake below. It's an excellent simple Banff hike if you want to put your feet up and enjoy the outdoors while still getting a little exercise because there's some elevation gain. However, we prefer other walks in Banff National Park for the effort. This short hike is theoretically not in Banff, although it is located in the Kootenays, just off of the Trans-Canada Highway. It's a gorgeous stroll down a canyon that's often blooming with hundreds of wildflowers in the summertime and snow-covered in the wintertime. The path winds up the canyon, crossing the rapid Kootenay River on several bridges. The track is well-marked and well-maintained, making it simple to follow. The river always has a blue hue since it is nourished by glaciers far above Alpine, which is magnificent during the summer months. It's one of our favourite trails for kids or anybody looking for a low-key day. An easy stroll around Lake Louise all along the north side of the lake is a breathtaking walk. It's quite popular, and getting away from the people around Lake Louise is difficult, but it's well worth it. Well before Covid-19, we adored Lake Louise because it is one of the most tranquil locations on earth, and we avoided crowds like the plague. This short trip follows an ancient dirt road on its way to Rockbound Lake, one of the more popular Banff hikes, but takes a detour to Silverton Falls. The trail follows Silverton Creek till it reaches the overlook of Silverton Falls. This waterfall is 50 metres tall and quite stunning during the summer months. The best feature about this route is that it's very peaceful compared to adjacent Johnston Canyon, so it's a good alternative if you're intolerant to crowds. This is a favourite among the family because it can be combined with both the Moraine Lake Rockpile and is relatively easy with only a small amount of elevation gain. The terrain is tougher, with significant maximum elevation and a short portion that traverses over a boulder field, making it a great rise to the occasion from the Lakeshore Trail. Images of the scree hills as from the Tower of Babel can be seen throughout the trail. The trip begins in an old-growth woodland and ends in alpine grassland and wetlands, with the consolation lakes at the finish. The backdrop of the Ten Peaks Mount Babbel and Mount Fay, crowned by glaciers, may be seen from the lakes. Enjoy the alpine views by taking a tour around Johnson Lake. It's a straightforward climb with an even elevation that provides a fantastic evening or morning walk because it's near Two Jack Lake campsite and not far from Banff town. The trail winds its way thru the forest, providing breathtaking views of the lake and Cascade Mountain, which towers high above. The lake is peaceful and a nice area to take a stand paddle boarding or swimming if you're feeling bold. Keep the eyes peeled for a rope swing. This is a fantastic simple Banff hike only a few minutes outside of town. The trail winds its way around Tunnel Mountain and along the Bow River. Magnificent sights of the Bow and Spray Valley await you as you stroll down the river, including the classic view of the Banff Springs Hotel above the Bow River (called Surprise Corner). The Hoodoos, a collection of tiny spires of rock produced by years of erosion, are also visible along the trail. You'll be surprised at how fast you enter the wilderness, which is practically on the outskirts of Banff. This is a fantastic climb with spectacular views that requires little effort because the Sunshine Village gondola does all of the heavy lifting. Hikers enjoy a wealth of possibilities from the village's convenient base. The routes are surrounded by a sea of wildflowers and are set in an alpine meadow. The classic hike to Rock Isle Lake follows the shores of two lakes, passes through an alpine larch forest, and ends in an incredible viewpoint with views of Kootenay National Park. It is lovely to walk through these alpine meadows, which feel like something from a fantasy."
13,DARK HERITAGE MUSEUMS IN TIRANA: REFLECTIONS ON THE PAST AND TOURIST ATTRACTION,travel-leisure," The Museum House of Leaves and Bunk’art 2 are two new museums located in the center of Tirana that have by now reached many local and foreign visitors. In this context, it is interesting to witness how two museums dedicated to the human suffering and persecution emanated from the former Albanian communist system have become one of Tirana’s major cultural assets for tourism. In this article, in addition to a brief description of these two institutions, we will consider why tourists find these Dark Heritage museums attractive and the potential these places have. Written by: Oriada Dajko The National Museum House of Leaves had been a mysterious building. Built in 1931, the place originally had the function of a maternity clinic. During World War II, and so under German occupation, it belonged to the Gestapo, while, during the first years of the subsequent regime, the building became an investigative center. Covered with leaves, it was then used as a platform from where the communist heads controlled and spied on people for the 45 years through which the system lasted, and acts of torture were carried out in its interior. After the political turmoil of the ’90s, the building was abandoned and for decades had no function, until it opened on 23 May 2017 as the Museum of Surveillance. Nowadays, in its new role, it commemorates the psychological violence and complete control of citizens during the communist period in Albania (1944-1991). Bunk’art 2: the underground past of Tirana Located in the city’s center, with its approximate 1,000 m2, this underground tunnel was hidden from the public eye, and it was part of a bunker project that began in the early 1970s and led to construction of nearly 175,000 bunkers of various sizes across the country. Specifically, the now called Bunk’art 2, was built between 1981-1986 and intended to shelter the Interior Ministry officials in the event of a nuclear attack. Opened on 19 November 2016, the Bunk’art 2 museum consists of 24 rooms, with many of them detailing the history of the Ministry of Interior Affairs between 1912 and 1991 and revealing the horrors of that time. The institution was thus eventually created as a memorial to honor the thousands of people who were executed in the past. The educational programs “Remember to not forget” and “Impression” aim to acquaint the younger generations with the dark characteristics of the Albanian communist past and more broadly raise their awareness about the consequences communist regimes may bring. Particularly, by these educational programs carried out in high schools, students are offered the opportunity to talk with political prisoners of the  regime. By admitting that history is just not only about facts, but it also has a lot to do with perspectives, these educational programs encourage and promote new talents that make a reflection on the past through art. In this way, students get a more in-depth understanding of history, and at the same time they can express themselves or perhaps start the first steps of an artistic career. Moreover and along the same line, the involvement into the museums educational activities of persons who have been persecuted or interned and of their family members, further proves how the untold stories of their suffering in the past today become part of the development of the city’s identity. Overall, we can say that engaging people carrying traumas related with the specified circumstances in the activities of the museum is a form of liberation, allowing the release of suffering and wounds that they have long suppressed within. Besides, their stories can also be seen as a form of liberation valid for the entire society from a long period of isolation and silence, sparkling a desire to heal and reconcile with a difficult past through the open confrontation with its legacies. Nonetheless, an issue of such Dark Heritage in Albania is that many people who suffered directly, and so the relatives of the victims and the people who persecuted them are still alive. In this context, is Dark Heritage becoming a subject that could lead to troublesome debates? To answer, we will turn to a recent study, whose results show that a large portion of citizens do not see the heritage of the communist past as a major problem which Albania is facing today (IDRA & OSCE, 2016). Conversely, and compared to the population as a whole, the persecuted individuals are the ones more likely to consider it as a problem. At the same time, and surprisingly, over a third of the persons who have been directly oppressed think that this heritage does not represent a problem at all (IDRA & OSCE, 2016). In this light, we can conclude that Dark Heritage is not an unequivocally controversial issue as it might appear at first, and therefore turn to the possible beneficial effects that spark from it and especially in relation to the external visitors. The attraction towards Dark Heritage Since people started to travel, they have been drawn “towards sites, attractions or events that are somehow linked to negative historical events where death, violence, suffering or disaster played a major role” (Sharpley and Stone, 2009). Precisely, for the two museums that represent the case-studies of this article, we can separate the tourists in two distinct groups: visitors with personal connection to the related history, that is to say victims and relatives of victims, and general visitors with no direct or indirect connections. Why then visitors who are completely external to these events are attracted to places that speak about persecution, suffering and death? One motivation, condensed in the popular expression “see it to believe it”, relates to participants’ interest in seeing the site out of a need to believe that such atrocities really happened(Global Heritage, 2016). The second reason, namely “learning and understanding”, highlights participants’ interest in past communist systems. The third reason is related to the fact that tourists follow new trends promoted by the media and, in fact, both the House of Leaves and Bunk’Art 2 are mentioned as Tirana’s main attractions in various blogs and magazines about travel and tourism (National Geographic, the Council of Europe, the Nomads Travel Guide and others). As a whole, tourism is understood as one of the ways in which we attempt to approach and understand otherness (Willis, 2014). Under this light, as there is no doubt that empathy is a powerful catalyst for cross-cultural understanding, the issue of human sufferance may then fit better than others into the discourse. Accordingly, we may in conclusion say that you can fully understand otherness and truly feel empathy when you know and understand even their dark side, a powerful driver for social reconciliation this last, on which perhaps we should further invest.

15,Have You Prepared Your Kids for a Survival Situation,travel-leisure," Why is it so important to teach your kids survival skills? As parents and adults, it is your responsibility to teach your children about disaster preparation as early as possible. In the actual world, most individuals who are fighting for their lives aren't doing it alone. You have a family to support to make things even more difficult for you. People have been raising children for millennia without all of the contemporary comforts available to them, and they've made it through just fine. You must devise strategies for ensuring the safety of your children while also doing the many duties necessary for our continued existence. The entire family will rely on you for direction and support to help them survive any tragedy; therefore, you need to be prepared. Teaching children to be resilient in the face of natural catastrophes is a difficult task that will test the patience of everyone involved. The key to ensuring your children have the required survival skills is knowing how to educate them ahead of time. When raising children, safety is the priority. Curiosity might lead children into dangerous situations since they aren't accustomed to being in a survival scenario. Children learn by doing, and in a survival crisis, they would do the same thing they would in any other. Setting boundaries to keep kids safe is one of our duties. What they are permitted to do and what they aren't. However, you also want them to have the freedom to experiment and discover. The instructor is the student! The lower their risk of harm, the more they learn about potentially harmful situations. The easiest way to teach a youngster anything is to turn it into a game. Make the lesson fun for the kids by turning it into a game. As a means of teaching a youngster survival skills, camping is a great option. They will learn the fundamentals of camping, which are the same abilities required for survival. When needed, they'll be ready to go into action. Teach them the fundamentals of protecting themselves. Educate them about the risks they may experience while camping so they are prepared. You should also teach your children how to cope with strangers when camping as a parent. In the long run, teaching your children about survival and how to enhance their well-being pays off. Your children will be able to behave and think more maturely as a result of this instruction. After you teach your children the skills they will need to survive a crisis, they will grow up to be more intelligent people. Preparedness conversations should include the whole family, including youngsters. Explain in a calm and straightforward manner, and be honest while answering queries. To guarantee their long-term existence, focus on safety. If you and your family are separated, teach your children to recall basic personal information about themselves and their family members. Make sure they know to keep away from fallen trees, power poles, and exposed wires. Make sure they know how to alert an adult if they detect the smell of gas. Tell them what to do if they smell gas and how to escape out of the home. As a family project, go through your emergency plans and plan your escape routes. Each youngster should have their own bug-out bag. Keep them entertained with a photo of the family, a toy, a game, a book, or a puzzle. Treats of their choosing may be included. This includes copies of the children's birth certificates, updated photographs, and anything else that might aid ensure the survival of the whole family. Think safety, security, and comfort when it comes to your children. Preparation is crucial for everyone, but particularly for children under the age of seven. The fact that they are children makes them vulnerable to a wide range of tragedies. If you're in the middle of a crisis, your family will need food above all else. In the end, you'll have to rely on emergency food supplies to feed yourself. In the event that these supplies are exhausted, you will be forced to depend on the natural edibles that are available to you for survival. For disaster preparedness, teach your children to consume organic veggies in their meals, making it simpler for them to adapt to new conditions in the event of a tragedy. As a result of doing safety exercises, all members of the community will be more prepared for the unexpected and better equipped to handle the physical repercussions of the crisis. Make running a regular component of your children's fitness regimen. Staying healthy and strong while improving their survival abilities is a win-win situation. Practice! Preparing a First Aid survival pack ahead of time is critical in case of an emergency. When an accident occurs, an emergency survival kit may save a person's life. Children of all ages should be able to utilize these skills to aid themselves and those in need. For those who aren't constantly there to care about them, it's important to teach them how to utilize the first aid kit. To improve their chances of survival, they must acquire the most basic self-defense techniques. Preparation and preparation and preparation and preparation and preparation and preparation are the keys to surviving and surviving and surviving. Your family's safety and well-being depend on having a strategy in place. ""Survival is our Purpose!"""

17,Most Challenging and Difficult Treks in Nepal,travel-leisure," Nepal is an ideal location for a life-changing journey and spiritual cleansing. It's also a popular site for residents to engage in cultural and religious exchanges. Moreover, many trekking and hiking trips are widely offered in Nepal's varied locations. Each of these trips is divided into three categories: easy, moderate, and challenging. During the trek, you will encounter some incredible hiking adventures with a high level of difficulty. We're going to talk about Nepal's challenging trekking trips. The time, elevation, geography, and remoteness of the excursions determine the difficulty level of these treks. You may be asking if the trek to Everest Base Camp is the most difficult. However, let us assure you that reaching Mt. Everest's base camp is not a tough trek. However, these incredibly challenging hiking activities can be found across the Himalaya. Let's take a look at some of Nepal's most difficult trekking trails. Amphu Lapcha Trekking is one among the experiences to go for if you want a difficult and strenuous trek in the Everest region. This trip explores the craziness of Hinku valley and is named after a difficult mountain pass called Amphu Lapcha. The wilderness you'll pass through on the trip is breathtaking. You'll travel to Lukla and then go up the path to Mera Peak. Past Mera peak is the infamous Amphu Lapcha pass. It is a highly tricky pass that must be traversed with the aid of a rope. Trekking over the pass to the opposite side of the valley to Chhukung valley is like a short climbing adventure. The circumstance is not only a long walking experience at a high altitude, but it is also a difficult one. When people think about Nepal, they usually think of Mt. Everest, the country's most famous mountain. The Everest Three High Passes Trek is a three-week trek in Nepal that is not technically difficult but is tremendously physically demanding. Renjo La, Cho La, and Kongma La Passes are the three high passes on this trip that exceed 5,000 meters (16,405 feet). The Everest High Passes trek includes severe ascents and descents, as well as going through high passes and crossing glaciers in certain areas, but you will be rewarded with a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Namche, Renjo Pass, Gokyo Lakes, Gokyo Ri, Chola Pass, Lobuche, Gorakshep, Everest Base Camp, Kalapatthar, Kongma la Pass, Chukkung, Tengboche, and Lukla are all included in this three-pass trek. The Annapurna Circuit along with Tilicho Lake Trekking takes us to the world's highest lake. The Annapurna Circuit paired with Tilicho Lake Trek begins with a drive to Dharapani through the lowland rice fields, steadily climbing height along the Marshyangdi River. It traverses through oak and pine forests until reaching Manang(3597 m.), when it emerges into high-altitude desert land The Tilicho Lake and Annapurna Circuit trek takes you to a lovely community populated by people of all ethnic groups, as well as breathtaking and majestic vistas of the white Himalayas. It is essentially the same as the Annapurna Circuit; however, instead of taking the valley north to Tanki Manang and Yak Kharka, this route goes to the main valley to the west, passes through Khanshar Village (Nepal's Last Village), and treks up to Tilicho Lake, then to Yak Kharka, and finally up to the Thorung La pass at 5,416m. The Kanchenjunga Circuit trek was a long-time favorite of extreme trekkers, but due to the Maoist insurgency, it lost its allure and tourist demand for almost a decade (during the civil war). Kanchanjunga used to be a well-organized (Camping) and hence expensive trek in Nepal. Many Trekking Agencies' guides and owners are similarly unaware of the Kanchenjunga trek track, despite the fact that it is posted on their website.  Kanchanjunga is truly one of Nepal's most magnificent hikes. To trek up Kanchenjunga, a local government-registered guide and at least two persons are required to get trekking permits. Kanchanjunga treks can now be done as tea-house treks, with modest accommodations and limited food options. Dhaulagiri Round Trek is a remote area exploration in the region of Mt. Dhaulagiri, and is one of Nepal's most challenging trekking excursions (8,167m). This trekking trip attracts a few number of trekkers each year. As a result, trekking in Dhaulagiri is a kind of solo adventure. To participate in this journey, you must be extremely fit. Because there are less hikers in the area, you can explore it at your leisure. Although teahouse and homestay accommodations are available for the majority of the journey, tent lodgings are also required. The more arduous the trek becomes, the more tough it becomes for the trekkers. You'll appreciate the region's natural beauty. This is a breathtakingly stunning remote trekking adventure. Because we will be traversing the Tashi Lapcha Pass (5,750 M) 18865 feet, talking about this trek requires quite a bit of technical information. Rolwaling is a hidden gem located below Mt. Gaurishanker and the Everest area. We discussed the lungs-pumping trek earlier, and here is one of them, where we undertake hard climbing, patience, rock climbing, and an adventure voyage. Rolwaling is a trekking zone with spectacular glacial lakes, isolation, sceneries, Sherpa climbers' homes (rolwaling), monasteries, glaciers, and a different way of life. Rolwaling Tashi Lapcha Pass trek begins in Gonggar village, Dolakha district, and ends in Namche Bazaar after passing via Tashi Lapcha Pass. From there, we'll travel back to Kathmandu. Makalu Base Camp Trek takes you to the base of Mt. Makalu (8,481m), another secluded place and challenging trekking trip in the Himalaya. Mt. Makalu, the world's fifth highest peak, is a stunning Himalayan mountain peak. Trekking in the Makalu region takes you to one of Nepal's most isolated trekking destinations. Despite being the world's fifth tallest peak, Makalu has a relatively small number of trekkers trekking the trail in the region. However, the beauty of the mountain and the area that you will witness during the journey will astound you. The adventure is made even more stunning by the clean landscape, unspoiled ambience, and breathtaking views of the mountains. For those of you who believe you've hiked everything, the Nar Phu Valley trek is great for individuals with the time and appetite to explore into some of the less congested rural places, magnificent regions with ethnically Tibetan inhabitants. In the Annapurna region, Narphu valley trekking is a new hiking track. This trek has only been available to hikers since 2003. It is one of the best places in the highlands to see breathtaking mountains. High peaks and mountains, glaciers, secluded villages, narrow valleys, magnificent woods, amazing rock formations, yaks, gompas, and unique Himalayan cultures are all part of the Nar and Phu trek. The Phu is the most beautiful medieval village where you may learn about and enjoy the authentic life of Bhote inhabitants. Upper Dolpo Trek is one of Nepal's most famous remote-area treks, as well as one of the most challenging. This journey takes place in the Himalayan Alps west of the Dhaulagiri range. Beautiful cultural villages and unspoiled natural settings add to the region's tranquility. This is a restricted area trekking experience that necessitates a specific permit to participate in. Along the trail, you can explore the magnificent splendor of Phoksundo Lake. Shey Gompa's cultural treasures, as well as the other picturesque settlements along the trail, add to the overall experience. Again, there will be less trekkers in the area, giving you the opportunity to explore the area in peace. ""Days will be difficult, nights will be even more difficult,"" our guides used to remark, ""but the Ganja La Pass Trek is worthwhile"" and ""must be done once in a lifetime."" Ganja La pass is located in the Langtang region, and the journey begins after a 7-hour drive from Kathmandu in Syabrubesi. We will explore the Langtang Valley, Kyngin Gompa, Chorkari Ri (5,050M), and Helambu Melamchi Bazar on this path. This trip takes you through Tibetan culture, Tamang settlements, and their various ways of life in the Himalayas. We will require technical climbing equipment for the Ganja La pass trek, and trekkers will need to learn basic climbing skills."

1,Successful Tourism Development in Belize,travel-leisure," Successful Tourism Development in Belize The Tourism industry in Belize has already taken off with 2019 being a record year and surpassing the average 400,000 annual visitor threshold. This industry has always accounted for a huge portion of the economy, with Ambergris Caye generating around two-thirds of the total revenue. The government is eager to focus on Ambergris Caye and several other tourist destinations to attract foreign investment and build a good reputation for the country. The government needs to work hand in hand with tourism developers, such as Michael Beggs to build luxury accommodations and bring awareness to the country as a leading travel destination. The tourism demographics have been changing within the last few years from the young “FIT” travelers to older refined guests in need of comfort and style. The older guests are ready to spend large amounts of money and they are skipping flights to the Maldives and Bora Bora and opting for shorter flights to Belize, where they enjoy similar vacation environments, such as world-class diving, water sports, natural beauty, historical ancient ruins, sunny tropical weather, and incredible marine life. The Accommodations Speaking of the accommodations, several luxurious hotels and resorts have existed on the island for many years, however like almost all the products on offer in Belize they are traditional condo hotel models, Belize’s tourism product has unfortunately developed as a factor of finance restrictions and available capital. Michael Beggs, the Managing Director of Alpha International Development, claims that destinations take many years to build the right products to attract the right customers. Belize has incredible opportunities for astute investors looking to develop the right products for a growing market, however careful planning and doing proper arm’s length market and feasibility studies is imperative to avoid the pitfalls of overcapitalizing or even worse under capitalizing a project. Several new projects with major hotel brands have finally arrived in the country, either recently completed like the Autograph Collection by Marriott™ or in planning such as the Marriott Beach Resort on Ambergris Caye… One of the key elements behind these developments is that the Developers are willing to and have spent the money using world class Architects and project consultants, such as Rafael Amuchastegui at RAD Miami, arguably one of the leading luxury resort architecture firms. Key Tourist Attractions in Belize Belize is among the leading travel destinations in the world, and it provides many spectacular and captivating attractions along with a variety of fun-filled adventures and activities. Overall, Belize has a sub-tropical climate that makes it a perfect vacation destination throughout the year. The temperatures range between 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperatures are low between November and January every year and highest between May and September. Once the home of more than 2 million Mayas, Belize stands as the heart of the ancient Maya world. The Maya civilization left a permanent mark on the landscape of the country. The Maya's legacy is evident in many ancient structures like pyramids, temples, agriculture, science, mathematics, and palaces. The most famous Mayan sites are Xunantunich, Altun Ha, Santa Rita, Caracol, Cahal Pech, Barton Creek Cave, Lamanai, Cerros, Nim Li Punit, and Lubaantan. If  you love wildlife, you should be happy to know that Belize has a very low population density. It has little industrial development and the commercial activities are very slow. The upside of this is that the country has a lot of lands covered by tropical rainforest and bush allowing wildlife to flourish. The locals and the government know that wildlife is an important tourist attraction and they have therefore been attracting wild animals and birds. Expect to see jaguars, howler monkeys, tapirs, scarlet macaws, and many other animals. “The country has almost 40% of its landmass in protected areas, reserves and parks, with a commitment to have 30% of its marine areas under protection by 2030”. Michael Beggs is a veteran of the hospitality and hotel development industry for over thirty years, specializing in project feasibility, project design and development, market analysis, hotel marketing and operations, luxury real estate sales and marketing, and hotel technology. Furthermore, he has worked around the globe and consulted in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, Central America, Africa and Europe.

For those that can afford it, it makes sense to book a dedicated lodge out on Turneffe Atoll … Whatever your choice is, the simple fact is that most of this pristine fishery is unfished…Only the few brave souls who charter a liveaboard with the right guides dare venture up into Payne’s Creek or explore the islands and backwaters of the Northern and Southern Lagoon Systems. In Belize the average fisherman books a lodge or a guide and gets to fish the same areas fished by hundreds of anglers before… The reality is over 80% of Belize’s fly-fishing potential is yet untapped, there are numerous national parks, sanctuaries and other areas that have had little to no fly-fishing pressure at all… I have fond memories of cutting my way into the northern lagoons of Ambergris Caye almost 17 years ago, where I found eager Bonefish that had never seen a fly and Juvenile Tarpon that hit everything, I threw at them… The west side of Ambergris Caye has some traditional white sand flats with Bonefish that have adapted in color to their environment. Bonefishing in Belize is however far removed from the white sand flats of the Bahamas or the Seychelles, it’s more akin to the bay of Biscayne, dominated by grass and marl flats. Big bonefish are rare in Belize but can be found as singles or small pods of 2-3 fish working the weed grass in 6-10 inches of water on an incoming tide…These fish have developed a darker green back compared to the sand flats grey backed bones and are harder to spot! They require a longer leader with a light fluorocarbon tippet and a lightly weighted fly that sits hook up, no bright colors, light tans and olives work best. My number one fly for this environment was the “Missing Link” in smaller sizes…This fly makes very little noise as it impacts the water and an extremely accurate presentation is required, usually within 36- 48 inches in front of the fish, letting it sink before a gentle light strip is required. This fishing is some of the most rewarding I have experienced as it requires extreme focus and requires incredible patience and precision. I have fished almost every area in Belize from exploring the back lagoons of the Bomba River or fishing for snook in the Sibun River basin, to the flats of Savannah but the area that holds the most intrigue for me is exploring the little-known backwaters of the Northern, Southern, Sapodilla and Western Lagoons, this area is full of creeks and backwater mangrove lined channels with over 9,000 acres of sanctuary that has had little to know fishing pressure and I believe will become a great Tarpon and Snook Fishery, with the additionally exciting possibility of finding Bonefish and Permit in the shallow bays that surround this incredibly large and unspoiled fishery. This area had previously been inaccessible and with the construction of the new Coastal Highway that is now well under way, combined with environmentally friendly developments like Coconut Point that are finally opening this area up to new possibilities…Has me readily tying flies and eagerly looking at buying my next fishing boat…"

The park provides one of the few public beaches on the islands and is a popular destination for locals and visitors alike. What is Vanderbilt Beach Park? The Vanderbilt Beach Park is an artificial beach located in the San Juan Islands, Washington. It was created by dredging sand from the bottom of Commencement Bay. With a large grassy area, picnic tables and a large man-made lagoon, it's a great place to go for a walk or take your dog for a swim in the salt water. The park provides one of the few public beaches on the islands and is a popular destination for locals and visitors alike. The History of Vanderbilt Beach Park In the 1890s, a local man named George Vanderbilt owned all of the land on the north side of Commencement Bay. He planned to create a resort on his land as a way to capitalize on the potential tourism industry in the San Juan Islands. In order to turn his property into a functioning resort, he created a plan to drain and fill in 9 miles of swampy bay with sand dredged from Commencement Bay. The project required an enormous amount of sand and was not completed until after Vanderbilt's death in 1942. A total of 1.7 million cubic yards of sand were dredged from Commencement Bay and then pumped onto Vanderbilt's property, creating what would eventually become known as Vanderbilt Beach Park. In honor of George Vanderbilt, this new beachfront became known as ""Vanderbilt Beach."" Originally called ""Sand Point,"" it was renamed after George Vanderbilt by Hermann Oelrichs Jr., who had inherited approximately 500 acres of coastal property from his father Hermann Oelrichs Sr. What makes the park special? One of the most striking features of this beach is the lagoon. This man-made body of water was created in the 1970s to provide a habitat for sea life that would not otherwise exist in Commencement Bay. The lagoon is home to sea lions, seals, and other marine life. The park also features an artificial sand dune which allows visitors to walk down to the beach without getting their feet wet. Another unique feature is the fact that it does not allow motorized vehicles on its premises. The Vanderbilt Beach Park encourages people to get out and enjoy nature by foot or bike instead of car, which makes it a more eco-friendly destination. Where can you find the park? The Vanderbilt Beach Park is located at the end of Bay Road on Orcas Island. Why is it important to protect and care for the park? The Vanderbilt Beach Park is a relatively recent addition to the island. It was created in 2004 by dredging sand from Commencement Bay and pouring it into the natural lagoon on the east side of Lopez Island. The park is popular for its beautiful scenery, family-friendly atmosphere, and saltwater lagoon-- it provides one of the few public beaches on the islands. But as more people enjoy this wonderful place, care must be taken to protect it. Please adhere to these regulations when visiting Vanderbilt Beach Park: Always follow posted regulations Do not litter Do not feed ducks or other wildlife Do not disturb wildlife or plant life Do not pick any flowers or plants Do not build structures or dig holes Conclusion Vanderbilt Beach Park is an Atlanta icon. It’s also one of the only two remaining saltwater beaches in the city, and is a favorite spot for Atlantans to escape the heat. It is important that people care for the park, understand the history of the park, and know how to get there. The future of Vanderbilt Beach Park is uncertain, but with your help it will continue to be a place for Atlantans to enjoy for generations to come."
4,Introduction to Sea Turtle Hatchings,travel-leisure," With nature being a great source of wonder to its surrounding inhabitants, one natural phenomenon that captures the hearts of children and adults alike is that of sea turtle hatchings. Sea turtles are one of the most beloved creatures on this planet, but this obsession with them has also led to shrinking numbers of their population. This is why yearly sea turtle hatchings are so important - because they allow these creatures to repopulate and begin their lives in the ocean. How Do These Sea Turtle Hatchings Work? Each summer, pregnant female sea turtles return to the beaches they once hatched from in order to find a nesting spot. After locating a perfect location, much like a human would look for their ideal doctor or hospital, the sea turtle digs her nest and lays her eggs, which generally takes up to a few hours. However, the mother doesn’t stick around for much longer. Instead, she returns to the ocean, leaving it up to fate whatever happens to her eggs. For this reason, many environmental activists and volunteers have taken measures to preserve and protect these eggs from predators and human touch so that each sea turtle has a chance to make it into the ocean once hatched. The sea turtle can lay up to 100 eggs, which remain in the sand for about 60 days. What many may not know is that the temperature of the sand often decides the gender of the hatchlings. Cooler sand will generally produce more males, while warmer sand produces more females. When the time has come to hatch, the sea turtles generally hatch at the same exact time, as if they had some secret code passed along from egg to egg that told them when to emerge. It is then time to make their way towards the ocean. During this time, they make themselves vulnerable to spying predators and curious beachgoers, which is again why many conservationists keep a close eye on these turtles from the time they were put in the nest until the moment they go out to sea. For this reason, many sea turtles will often wait until nighttime to hatch. Those that make it out often flock to the open ocean or collections of brown seaweed, sometimes swimming for up to 48 hours until they reach this destination, where some spend their first years hiding, growing and maturing. Witnessing a sea turtle hatching is one of the most memorable experiences an individual can have, but they must also be sure to keep their distance so as not to disrupt this natural process."

Regardless of your budget, when you are traveling in Africa keep in mind that you are much richer than the majority of local people around you. While most people are honest, the sight of a tourist with cash to spare and cameras dangling is too tempting for some. To avoid being fodder for con-artists, petty thieves and opportunists keep some of the following safety travel tips in mind when visiting Africa. Travel Tips to Keep You Safe During Your Trip to Africa Travel Light It is always a good idea to carry one bag rather than a number of bags. This is to ensure you don’t incur extra costs when it comes to airline luggage charges but also avoid the stress of looking after so many bags. Get Vaccinated Health matters should be treated with the seriousness that they deserve. It is always advisable to take the necessary vaccinations and anti malaria tablets as you travel around. Also, don’t forget to follow the COVID-19 regulations in your destination city.

It is advisable to have an extra local bank card, mostly prepaid cards. Most African countries have prepaid cards that you can simply walk into the bank to purchase. Load it with the amount you need. Apart from saving you some currency conversion fees, it is safer than carrying cash or you bank ATM card. Using Money Belt Money belt is a way of announcing yourself as “Hey, I’m a tourist with money waiting to be ripped off”. If you have to use it, wear a flat money belt that fits underneath your clothes. Use this to keep your credit credit cards, passport and travelers checks safe. Keep copies of your documents Make a copy of your passport, ticket, credit card and traveler check numbers. Put these in your main luggage so if you do get robbed of the originals, you still have all the information for insurance and replacement purposes. Always carry a lock Safes in hotels are not always safe (ironically) so use a lockable pouch or bag to put your valuables in if your hotel has these facilities. Use combination lock instead of keys. Because if you lose your keys, you’re screwed. Don’t be a lone nightcrawler Don’t walk alone at night especially in major town and cities and stick to well lit areas even if you are walking with a group. Taxis are available in every African towns and it’s worth the extra money to be safe. Don’t be afraid to get lost Don’t look too obviously lost even if you are. You can always walk purposefully into a shop, bank or hotel to ask for directions or consult a map. Don’t be afraid to ask for directions It is perfectly fine to be lost. Don’t be too shy to ask for directions. Enter any hotel even if you’re not staying there, and ask for directions from the staff. They will be happy to help you out. Be vigilant Watch your belongings and pockets very carefully at busy bus stations, train stations, markets and bazaars. Learn basic phrases in the native language Learning basic phrases like “hello” “how are you” “how to I get to the bus station” and “Thank you” is very important. It will make your communications with the locals easier as they will appreciate that you tried. Stay in Vacation rentals Stay in vacation rentals like hostels, shared apartments among locals. They’re mostly cheaper and the experience of living like a local is fun. More so, you get to live among other expats who share same interest. Use vacation rentals websites to book your accommodation. Ask for recommendations Ask your host or roommates for recommendations on the best food, cheapest attraction and fun activities in the neighborhood. Pre-book your flights Book your flights 2 to 3 months in advance to get the best deal on flight ticket fare. Don’t pay cash in advance for services to be delivered Whether you buying items or searching for services advertised on social media, do not pay cash before delivery. Many ads on the internet are not what they seem, make sure you buy or book online and pay with your prepaid card or any form that gives you confirmation of payment. If it is not delivered or service not rendered, you can file a dispute and get your money back. Eat street food How do you get to experience a place without eating the street food? Street food is part of the culture and you don’t wanna miss out on that. Most of the local delicacies are made and sold on the street. If kids are eating it, then it’s healthy for you. Try new food Don’t be rigid and don’t ask too much questions. Just put the food in your mouth and savor every bite of it. If you’re too rigid, you might miss out in some delicious local cuisines. Locals don’t eat out all the time, neither should you You can learn the local’s diet by the type of food they buy. You should go grocery shopping and cook your own food. It is cheaper and healthier. Avoid eating or shopping close to a tourist attraction Merchandises and restaurants near a tourist attraction are always pricey. You can get the same or more quality products and/or food two streets away at more pocket friendly price. This will save you a few buck. There you go, use my top travel tips and have the best trip to Africa and beyond. Feel free to add what I may have missed in the comment section."
7,Why You Should Try Traveling Alone At Least Once In Your Life,travel-leisure," Solo travel is defined as travel undertaken by a person travelling without another individual. There are plenty of reasons to do so, but an integral part of solo travel, according to most people who partake in it, is that it teaches you about yourself and how to be comfortable with yourself. By exploring new places and meeting new people, solo travellers learn more about themselves than they might if they were always hanging out with their friends or family members. It's also a fun way to discover new hobbies and rekindle old ones. It’s a great opportunity to provide you with a fresh outlook on life, leading to self-growth and self-discovery. In our modern society, we often get wrapped up in our image, so it can be a nice change of pace to go out and travel without worrying about how you appear to others or what people think of you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with travelling with a friend or loved one—it's just as fun! But it's always a great idea to see things from a different perspective from time to time. Different Types of Solo Travellers Solo travel is no longer reserved for gap year university students and retirees—it’s increasingly becoming a lifestyle choice. And it’s not just about vacation - more people are choosing to study or work overseas without company too. We all have unique circumstances, goals, preferences, requirements, hopes, fears - and what works for one person may not work for another. Whatever your reason for wanting to take some time alone, taking some time to prepare can only enhance your experience. Here are 5 tips to make the most of your journey: Don’t be afraid to meet new people: Solo travel is a great way to meet new people, and it’s a shame that many first-time solo travelers end up staying inside their hotel room out of fear. If anything, going out of your comfort zone will help grow as a person. So don’t shy away from other travelers or anyone who could make for an interesting conversation partner. You never know who might share something with you that ends up changing your life forever! Enjoy yourself: Let’s face it – solo travel can be terrifying if you aren’t prepared for it mentally beforehand, but there are ways to make things easier on you. Start by choosing a destination that interests you and do some research on the local area so that when you get there, you can enjoy all it has to offer! Understand that not all places are tourist-friendly: Make sure to always let your hostel or hotel know where you’re going and make friends with other travelers if possible. For the best experience, try travelling to a destination that hasn’t been taken over by tourists. These kinds of places can be fun for a day or two, but there’s really no long-term value in eating nowhere but chain restaurants or visiting nothing but shops owned by huge corporations. Don’t be afraid to break plans if something comes up: Since you won’t have anyone else around to make plans with, it can sometimes be scary to break plans if something suddenly comes up, but that shouldn’t stop you from listening to what your body needs or doing whatever is necessary to maintain a balance between work and play. It’s also worth reminding yourself that if you get uncomfortable, you can always head back home! The point of solo travel is listening to yourself and learning how to keep yourself happy, after all! Learn how to be comfortable with yourself: This is perhaps one of the most important lessons for solo travelers because it’s so often overlooked! Being able to be comfortable with yourself is essential for enjoying solo travel because it forces you to learn how to occupy yourself when there’s no one else around, and it can also help strengthen self-confidence over time. What are you waiting for? In a society where everything from our romantic relationships to our friendships and work are guided by an underlying set of rules, there’s something liberating about allowing yourself to go it alone for a period of time. The only thing stopping you from exploring a new part of the world is you - and that’s what makes it so worthwhile."
8,How Travel is an Educational Tool,travel-leisure," There is never a bad excuse for wanting to take a trip. Travel is an exciting way to see the world and take a break from one’s everyday routine. However, travel is also an excellent educational tool for a variety of reasons. Even though schooling, books, the internet and other resources exist to educate individuals, travel is still one of the best forms of learning because it incorporates personal experience into the mix. Continue reading to discover a few of the educational benefits of travel. You Learn History It seems that no matter where you travel, you cannot escape a location’s history. Whether taking a weekend trip to Washington D.C., a holiday across the pond in London, or even a desert trip to Arizona, all these locations share a common trait: they all have a substantial amount of history. You’ll quickly find that this trait applies to all travel destinations around the world. We cannot escape the traces of our ancestors and the people who trekked the lands before us. However, this opens up educational opportunities wherever we go. Even though you may have learned about a historical event in history class, nothing beats actually visiting the land and seeing a landmark in person. Whether you traveled to an area to intentionally study history or not, the chances are that you’ll learn a mini-history lesson no matter where you travel. You Learn New Talents One of the best ways to experience a new culture is by taking a local class on your trip. This might look like taking a pasta-making class in Italy or learning how to take care of elephants in Cambodia. These experiences take you out of your comfort zone and grow your talents in new and exciting ways. This doesn’t mean you’ll return home making this a new hobby of yours, but it is a great way to learn new things in an immersive cultural class. This hands-on learning can often be more influential than textbook learning and will likely be a core memory for years to come. You Learn New Languages Traveling to new foreign countries gives you an excuse to learn new languages. This doesn’t mean that you’ll become fluent in various tongues, but knowing some basic phrases can help you get by in another country. Even though you might take a language course already, actually immersing yourself in the culture that speaks that language is a whole other story. In most cases, a language is best learned when you are placed in that culture and able to converse with others. Communicating with native speakers is a great way to put your skills to use and learn from them."

12,Wedding Car Decoration Ideas As You Head Off on Honeymoon,travel-leisure," It has always been a tradition for the couple to get married, celebrate with friends and family, have breakfast with the guests and then hop in a wedding car and set off on honeymoon. While traditions change and some couples don't go on a honeymoon immediately or they only go the next day, you still want that memorable send-off after your special day. Decorating the wedding car is a common practice that tells everyone you are “just married.” This is often the first drive you have as newlyweds and it's exciting. Decorating the wedding car makes the moment more special. You can decorate the car on the way to the reception or on the way to your honeymoon. Normally the groom's men would be responsible for decorating the car, but you can decide how you want it done. If you are the best man or one of the groomsmen for an upcoming wedding and you're looking for inspiration for the wedding car decoration, then you may want to consider a flower garland, rather than the traditional “just married” sprayed on the back and sides of the car. A green garland can be draped over the back of the car. It can add a modern twist to a traditional experience. Another option is rather than spraying the car, have a fabric sign made. The sign can be any colour with any font. You can make it elegant or fun. This can be tied across the back of the car and doesn't cause damage to the vehicle when covered in paint. One of the most classic wedding car decorations for post weddings are tin cans, this ideal has been used for decades. Tin cans are iconic and are fun for everyone watching as the couple makes their way down the street with tins causing a noise behind them, causing everyone to look. Cans can be done at home using clean and empty cans with the labels removed. Use a strong string or cord to ensure that they remain in place. Bright flowers with long ribbons are another fun way to decorate the wedding car for the honeymoon. It's whimsical and will add colour, especially when used on a white car. The flowers and ribbons can be selected to match the wedding theme, or even the bride's bouquet to make it more special. This is an elegant way to dress the car, adding that special touch. A fun touch to wedding party transport is if you have arranged for your guests to travel to the wedding in a bus or your wedding party to travel together, then you can add a banner on the side of the vehicle that tells everyone who they are, such as using a modern hashtag. So having a large #wedding on the side of the car is a fun added extra that can be removed easily once they have all been dropped off. It's also a fun keepsake for you or any of your wedding parties. Helium balloons have grown in popularity, you see them as a number sitting on a restaurant table for birthdays and you get those that come in letters. Tying letter balloons on the wedding car is a great way to add a fun message, such as “Hitched,” “Cheers,” or any other fun message you can add. Decorating the wedding car is fun and can catch the couple off guard, but always ensure that you choose something that will not damage the car and can be removed easily.

13,5 Top Tips to Get You Upgraded on Flights,travel-leisure," For many travellers, paying up to £5000 for a business class ticket in order to fly in greater comfort simply isn't an option.  However, what very few people realise is that most airlines will upgrade passengers from economy class for free - if they meet certain guidelines.  In this article, I will pass on some of the things that the check in staff look for and require so that you can take advantage of the loopholes and get your upgrade for free.  These five top tips come direct from the check in staff of some of the best-known airlines, and are considered by many regular travellers to be the holy grail of getting something for nothing. Tip Number 1: Look the part.  Make sure that you are dressed smartly when you travel.  There is almost no chance of getting a free upgrade if you are wearing shorts and a scruffy t-shirt, so at the very least, check in wearing a shirt and pants.  there is no need to go overboard and wear a suit - unless you really want to.  The key is to look smart, but not like you're trying too hard. Tip Number 2: Turn up early.  The check-in staff know exactly how many passengers are travelling on a particular flight well in advance, so if there are seats to spare in business class, they will know straight away. Tip Number 3: Be Polite.  Put yourself in the place of the check in staff.  Would you reward a person who gives you attitude and starts shouting the odds, or someone who is pleasant and gives them the time of day.  There may be 250 people in the queue behind you, so make them remember you.  Flirt, smile, use their name, be nice, and you may well get a pleasant surprise. Tip Number 4: Be a Frequent Flier.  If you join an airline's frequent flier programme, you are far more likely to be at the front of the queue for an upgrade, as the airline will want to reward you for your loyalty.  Even if you do not fly regularly, go to the airline's website and join their programme online.  It will only take a minute or two, and is well worth the time. Tip Number 5: Ask.  They say that if you don't ask for something, you won't get it, so make sure you do - but do it at the right time.  If the check in staff look stressed, and no amount of charm has elicited a smile, don't bother to ask them, wait until you get to the gate.  If the counter staff have responded well, when they ask you if you have any specific seat request, be cheeky and say ""First Class"" to them.  It might just work."

15,The Four Great Chinese Festivals - A Traveler’s Guide,travel-leisure," Like other major cultures, the Chinese observe and celebrate many festivals throughout the year. Among all celebrations, none are considered as important as the Four Great Festivals. These being: •	The Lunar New Year •	Qing Ming •	Duanwu Festival i.e. the Dragon Boat Festival •	Zhongqiu Festival i.e. the Mooncake Festival With the exception of Qing Ming, you’re in for a visual and gourmet treat, if you’re visiting Chinese cities during these festivals. Note too that all four festivals are celebrated using dates of the lunar calendar. Thus, their corresponding dates on the Gregorian calendar vary each year. Typical Gregorian Calendar Date: Late January to Mid February Actual Lunar Calendar Date: First fifteen days of the Chinese Lunar Calendar The most important ethnic festival for the Chinese, preparations for the “Spring Festival” typically begins a month before the actual dates. Overnight, shops will put up glitzy red and gold decorations. Before long, Lunar New Year bazaars and food fairs will appear all over Chinese cities too. Larger cities will furthermore host elaborate festive light-ups and cultural performances. Come the Eve, Chinese cities shut down to allow families to gather for the all-important Reunion Dinner; this, the equivalent of Christmas Eve or Thanksgiving dinner in the West. Cities thereafter slowly return to business with the arrival of the New Year. Home visits, festive fairs, and public performances such as dragon and lion dances will be the norm till the fifteenth day. The short of it, visiting Chinese cities during the Lunar New Year season is a visual and cultural extravaganza. Naturally, you’ll have a plethora of colorful festive foods to try too. Typical Gregorian Calendar Date: April 4, 5, or 6 Actual Lunar Calendar Date: First day of the fifth Chinese lunisolar term Also known as the Tomb Sweeping Festival, Qing Ming is the most solemn of the Four Great Chinese Festivals. Chinese families would gather to clean the graves of ancestors and offer incense. Often, food items would also be used during prayer rituals. These dishes would then be left at the graves. As Qing Ming falls on the first day of the fifth solar term of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, it typically happens on the 4th, 5th, or 6th of April. Coming to associated foods, there is no famous Qing Ming dish although the green Qingtuan glutinous rice dumpling has been popular in China in recent years. Lastly, Qing Ming is noted for its association with the ancient Hanshi (cold food) observation. The name Qing Ming itself means “clear and bright” too. Typical Gregorian Calendar Date: Late May to Mid June Actual Lunar Calendar Date: Fifth day of the fifth lunar month More commonly known as the Dragon Boat Festival in the West, Duanwu began as an agricultural ritual but evolved into a commemoration of Chinese cultural heroes. Particularly, the patriotic Qu Yuan from the Warring States Era. Symbolized by the eponymous Dragon Boat races and the consumption of triangular, glutinous rice dumplings known as Zongzi, Duanwu also marks the beginning of summer on the Chinese Lunar calendar. Interestingly, this culturally significant festival was not a public holiday in the People’s Republic of China till recent years, although celebrations have never stopped. With the virtues celebrated by the festival still regarded as among the most important in Chinese culture, it is likely Duanwu will continue to be celebrated for a long time. The rising popularity of Dragon Boat Racing as an international competitive sport further ensures this. Typical Gregorian Calendar Date: September to Early October Actual Lunar Calendar Date: The fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month While more commonly called the Mooncake Festival in the West, Zhongqiu actually means “Mid Autumn” in Chinese. An ancient festival with agricultural and historical roots, Zhongqiu is today most heavily associated with the myth of Chang’e and the moon. In Chinese mythology, the beautiful Chang’e was forever separated from her husband after ingesting an elixir of immortality; she “flew” to the moon. Her heartbroken husband, Houyi, then honored her memory by offering Chang’e’s favorite fruits and cakes before the moon. Jump forth to today, modern mooncakes are said to resemble the cakes offered by Houyi. On and around the actual festival, Chinese children also carry lanterns at parks and gardens. Finally, the Mid Autumn Festival is considered the most romantic Chinese ethnic festival. Many young Chinese couples thus opt to marry during the eighth lunar month."

17,How London's event venues are bouncing back post-covid,travel-leisure," It’s no secret the business of events has been hit hard these last 16 months. Being the first sector to close and the last to reopen has naturally presented huge challenges for all the businesses within it. And whilst some were able to be dynamic and start supplying alternative markets, others with less flexible products were left with few options. The epitome of this is event venues. Institutions with business models based entirely on people gathering together suddenly found themselves without any incoming business as of March 2020 (even earlier for some), and it’s been a turbulent time ever since. Now as we enter into July, we’re approaching what will hopefully be the final, official green light to welcome people back through their doors – free of restrictions. But it hasn’t been as simple as picking back up where things left off. London offers one of the broadest variety of venues of any city in the world and each one requires a unique plan for reopening in a safe and practical way. So with that in mind, how are London’s venues bouncing back post-covid? A central, business-focused events venue: Congress Centre is a large-scale venue in the West End specialising in business events like meetings, conferences, and exhibitions. They’re well-priced, convenient, and pre-covid would be busy most days of the work week. They’re also housed within the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). Ruby Chagger, conference and sales manager at the venue, shared what their experience has been: “I’ve been working in the event industry for over 20 years, and nothing compares to the experiences from the last 16 months. No one imagines their industry coming to completely halt overnight and we were suddenly hearing words like ‘economically non-viable’ about our roles. I know many people in the events industry feared for their jobs without a clear idea of when business could restart.” “Fast forward to today, we’re still limited in what we can do with social distancing measures in place, but we’re already seeing a number of bookings come in for the final quarter of this year. The government’s roadmap has been a big driving force in restoring confidence and the general consensus seems to be that final restrictions will be lifted by September at the latest. We are receiving bookings for nearly full capacity (400-500 seats) for later in the year, so I feel event planners are looking to the future optimistically.” “We’re hosting some smaller events the next few months letting us generate some income until we get back to normal, and are also fortunate to have a background as a filming location so have been making the most of our connections in that industry.” “Gearing up for indoor events again has been an exciting but frustrating process; guidelines changing repeatedly and confidence being restored and lost again last autumn have been the biggest obstacles. However, whilst we’re looking forward to finally using all the protective equipment, screens and signage we bought last year, we’re definitely more excited for the final day we’ll need it!” A popular weddings & occasions venue: 10-11 Carlton House Terrace is a Grade I listed Georgian Townhouse near Buckingham Palace with some impressively regal interiors to rival it. It’s a luxurious setting and frequently sought after for weddings and special occasions like private dinners and parties. On the business side, they also host conferences, meetings and more recently, virtual and hybrid events from a brand-new, dedicated studio. Catherine Owens, head of venue sales & marketing at 10-11 Carlton House Terrace (pictured above) shared: “Our experience as a venue in recent months has definitely been mixed; facing plenty of challenges throughout but also finding pockets of positivity. Not every venue had opportunity to do so but we opened for some small events last summer and this is proving to have been beneficial as we officially start to re-open.” “It gave us chance to ensure our venue safety processes had been thoroughly tried and tested, our staff were familiar with all the operations and logistics required to manage events safely, and we had a clear blueprint for a smooth reopening this time around.” “As and when public health guidelines have allowed for it, we’ve hosted events like meetings and micro weddings, as well as more filming productions than ever before since this type of work has been able to go ahead since last autumn. We also made sure to secure the relevant accreditations to prove our commitment to good hygiene and safety practices, and all protocols will remain in place with the official government guidance.” “In our experience, we’ve seen significant appetite for events from the very first week [commencing 17th May]. We’ve hosted four different events already and have seen a massive boost in interest including: a 170% increase in wedding enquiries, a 230% increase in wedding bookings this year from 2019/20 and a 130% increase in all enquiries year-on-year.” “Things aren’t quite there yet - all of our business remains domestic, capacities are still small, and there are still questions around cancellation and postponements – but companies and clients are clearly keen to get back to live events. There are many playing it safe booking into the autumn when there should be more certainty, but are therefore hopeful for a return to pre-covid business levels in the coming months.” A historic venue with sports grounds: The HAC is a large Georgian manor house with the largest private grounds in the City of London (around 5 acres, if you were wondering). It’s well hidden from the busyness of the City and home to the Honourable Artillery Company, who provide Guards of Honour for visiting members of the Royal Family and other high ranking officials. The venue’s Director of Events, Rowan Kitching, shared what they’ve seen from their perspective: “Since business events have recommenced, we’ve been hosting socially distanced dinners and lunches at the venue’s private members restaurant, as well as two weddings during June. That’s on top of the annual London Concours event – an automotive garden party displaying some of the world’s rarest and most precious cars – which uses our large private garden space.” “Now as we enter Q3, we’ve seen a big jump in demand for commercial bookings, where the majority have been for outdoor summer parties and bookings to use our sports grounds. Most spikes in bookings have happened in-line with government announcements. For example, we saw bookings increase by 60% in February 2021, returning to pre-pandemic levels, following the reveal of the Government’s covid roadmap. Ever since then, they’ve remained consistent with slight fluctuations as restriction dates have changed.” “Providing any government guidance and roadmap plans are only minimally adjusted from now on, we are really confident in a strong return for events. For us, we’ve seen our outdoor spaces almost fully booked beyond the end of June, into July and September. Meanwhile, bookings for indoor events indicate people are ready to resume normality from Autumn.” “We do anticipate people leaving it much later to book their Christmas parties this year, but ultimately it will depend on confidence nearer the time as well as any risk of further restrictions or lockdowns being put in place this winter. But whatever happens, we’re prepared for it!” The consensus: Whilst restrictions on gatherings and events aren’t going anywhere just yet, things are starting to look promising for much of London’s event scene. People have clearly regained their confidence in meeting face to face and the rising demand seen by these venues in the last few months reflects that. How well they bounce-back from here will be mainly dictated by any more shifts to the last roadmap date, currently set as the 19th July. Further delays would limit the business venues can hold and prevent the chance to start recovering properly. So, like with much else from the last 15+ months, only time will tell exactly how well London’s venues bounce back post-covid!"

19,Top Activities to Try in Rhodes Island,travel-leisure," No words can describe how I felt when I finally arrived in my dream destination – Rhodes Island. It took me two years to plan this trip and now that it is happening at last, I just can’t believe my eyes. So, I made sure that I didn’t waste any minute of my stay there and booked as many activities as my body and my pocket allow. Gaze at the Sunset in Monolithos Castle Monolithos Castle can be found at the westernmost edge of the Island and according to my friendly guide, it is the best spot in the area if I want to watch the sun set in the sparkling Aegean Sea. The steps leading to the castle were a bit slippery but I soon forgot about my ordeal when I finally got a glimpse of the majestic sun going down the horizon. It was a comforting experience for me, to be honest. Scuba Diving I am not really a fan of scuba diving but this soon changed when I gave it a try during my visit in Rhodes Island. The expansive size of the island and the captivating geology of the coast made it a paradise on earth for many scuba divers. I was told that the island got plenty of interesting sites for diving. Others are exclusive for the seasoned divers but beginners also got some options to choose from. Rock Climbing Beautiful and adventurous are the best words to describe my rock climbing experience in Rhodes. Blood was rushing through my veins while grasping the rope. My senses were stirred while I take in the wonderful sceneries all around me. Stand Up Boarding I also head out to Rhodes Island’s east coast and there, I mustered my courage to try stand up boarding for the very first time. It was such a fun and thrilling experience as I watch the majestic cliffs off Stegna coast. The view was truly astonishing, a perfect way that made the paddling more than worth it. Swimming The plethora of beaches is what Rhodes Island is best known for so don’t be surprised if I got my fill of swimming. The island has glistening waters that will beckon you to come and take a dip for a few minutes or even hours if you are up to it. Wind Surfing in Prasonisi Windsurfing is one of the most unique water activities that I tried my whole life and I was lucky enough that Prasonisi in Rhodes Island is popular for it. The windy climate of the southernmost part of the island makes it attractive to athletes every single day. Boat Trips The Mediterranean and Aegean Sea surround the entirety of the island. This means that if you have always wanted sail off and ride the seas, boat trips are the best things you can ever do during your stay in the island. I didn’t miss the chance to try the short trips along coastline as well as the longer trips to nearby islands. The whole experience was truly out of this world."
20,5 Best Things to Do in Rhodes Town,travel-leisure," Popular for having 300 days of wonderful sunshine all year round and originally the home to one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, Colossus of Rhodes, this vibrant island right off Turkey’s coast is a place hard to resist. If you have been planning a once in a lifetime trip in Greece, here are the 5 best things to do in Rhodes town that you should never miss out! Rhodes tours will surely be incomplete if you don’t get the chance to visit them. If Rhodes’s crown is the Old City, the Palace of the Grand Master is no doubt the beautiful gem sparkling atop the crown. A walk around this imposing structure from the 14th century with its mosaics, sculptures, exquisite marble, architecture and art that date back to the ancient times will give you an idea of how life was like during those days. This is one sight you should visit if you are in the Old Town and is also among the best things to do in Rhodes Island if you also happen to be a fan of palaces. Take note, however, that the palace is often closed on Mondays so best to plan your visit considering this schedule. Don’t forget to drop by the Archaeological Museum as well if you are a history buff. When you feel hungry after a day of exploring the palace, check out Angela Castle where you will be served with real authentic Greek dishes in a quaint tiny courtyard. For those who love to stroll around Rhodes Old Town and its cobbled streets, make sure you let yourself get lost in the Street of the Knights. Originally a place where knights gather prior to an attack, strolling the street is among the most unique things to do in Rhodes Island if you love to get a slice of history. During the bygone days, the knights were divided based on their birthplace and as a result, there used to be seven inns that depict seven languages. Even though only four of these inns remain today, you will surely feel a rush of nostalgia once you step on the street. If you want something yummy, drop by at Ta Kardasia and fill your tummy with one of the island’s best moussakas. Despite being the Old Town of Rhodes’ highest elevation, ‘’Roloi’’ Clock Tower is almost unnoticeable at first glance. To get there, turn right at the end of Socrates Street to the tourist Orfeos Street and after several meters, you will find this clock tower that can be traced as far back as 1852. What is amazing is that this clock remains working to this day. It was once used to show Turkish time to the Greeks as the Turks implemented strict rules for the public. They determined who can enter and leave this strategically critical city and when they can do it. Today, you just need to pay an entrance fee to climb this tower. There is a steep wooden staircase that will lead you to the top. From there, you can admire the stunning view of the Old Town of Rhodes. This structure dates back to the 3rd century BC and preserved in the ruins of the site are important antiquities,  along with a network of subterranean sanctuaries. Antiquities such as the restored ancient Stadium of Diagoras and the Odeon, the small marbled theater which today hosts musical and theatrical performances. Do not forget to visit the caves of Nymphaia, the Gymnasium and the Library. On the hilltop dominates the ruins of the Temple of Apollo, the god of the Sun. Walk to the edge of the hill and admire the panoramic view of Ialisos bay, the tukish coastline and the city of Rhodes. Ideally schedule your visit in the afternoon hours, as it s not so hot and because of the magnificent sunset view the area offers. Rodini park is apparently the world’s oldest park and just a short distance away from downtown Rhodes where you can go for a walk, a peaceful and perfect way of ending a long and tiring day. A pleasant blend of manicured and overgrown, the park is filled with thick vegetation and charming trails that will lead you to ancient aqueducts, quiet pools, babbling brooks, and drinking animals. The grounds serve as a home to a group of peacocks that are not shy and if you are lucky, they might even flaunt their famous plumage. Since there are no hours of operation or entrance fee at the park, you can always go there whenever you need to soothe your mind and body surrounded by nature. To reach Rodini Park, you can walk approximately 3 km or take a bus from the central bus station. There are also Rhodes transfers companies that can take you to the park."

0,Vacation Plans,travel-leisure,
1,"Cafe's, Grills, & Places to Chill",travel-leisure," Over the weekend my wife and I decided to get out of the RV for the day since the weather was nice here in Central Texas. We had been talking about a few options the week before about what to do and we agreed that we would go and check out Dinosaur Valley State Park in Glen Rose, TX. Glen Rose is located approximately 54 miles south-southwest of Fort Worth, and it is located approximately 90 miles north-northwest of Temple. We drove up for the day and had a great time. Some of the attractions were closed due to the super weird weather we have been having in Central Texas lately. We were able to walk through the Dinosaur Trail that has numerous species of life size dinosaur statues along with plaques that give their names and information. We also did the “geocache” mining where you get to sift through a bag and/or bucket of sand and find gemstones or small dinosaur bones and petrified Dino-poop. The dinosaur track trail was closed due to weather as well as the fossil dig. All in all, though, it really was a lot of fun and highly informative. It’s a great place to take your kiddo’s. Also, if you want to stay there, they have an on-site RV park, but it is a little expensive. I suppose that is to be expected however since it is located in a tourist area. One of the things that I really wanted to see while we were in the area though was the “Creation Museum” that is located about a mile and half down the road from the Dino Park. If you have ever contemplated Creation vs. Evolution, this museum has some very compelling evidence supporting creation. (I have always been a firm believer in Creation) I do not doubt that evolution does play a significant role in the laws of nature though as all things do evolve and change with their environments but that is a topic for a later post. The creation museum has plaster casts proving that both man and dinosaur co-existed at the same time. This museum also has a full-scale model of Noah’s Ark as well as a piece of wood that was found in the mountains of Ararat in which the Holy Bible says Noah’s great ark came to rest. This wood was tested, and it was discovered that it was saturated with “pitch” as described in the Bible. For more information about “pitch” check out this link… https://creation.com/the-pitch-for-noahs-ark Now, I don’t know about you, but the fact that this museum actually has a piece of what can ONLY be the great ark that Noah built was pretty impressive for me. There are so many interesting items on display at this museum. I highly recommend that you make this a must see if you are in the area. After we left the Creation Museum, we decided that we wanted to eat an early dinner at one of the locally owned restaurants. We decided on a quaint little place located in the middle of Glen Rose on the town square. The place was called “Blackies on the Square”. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted with a smile and “Welcome in” by the staff. The restaurant has a “shotgun” style layout with a full-length bar on the left and an arrangement of very eclectic seating on the right. Behind the bar there are 5 big screen televisions mounted on the wall each playing a different channel. (Mostly Sports). The staff was very friendly, and we learned that our server is the fiancé of the owner’s daughter. He told us that it was a family owned and operated restaurant. The building and décor looked dated but very well preserved and my wife asked how old the building was. The owner was sitting two tables down and he told us that is was built in the early 1900’s. We looked at the menu and decided that we would order the “Deviled Eggs” as our appetizer and we ordered the “French Dip” sandwich to share. The deviled eggs were topped with crumbled bacon bits. I would never have thought to do this on my own, but I was impressed with the combination. The French Dip sandwich was the perfect choice for us after our fun and excitement at the dinosaur park. It was delicious and was not too filling. Best of all, our meal was very reasonably priced and the ambiance and friendly atmosphere of this small and quaint little place on the square was fun and relaxing. I give Blackies on the Square 5 stars. Another must see / stop and enjoy if you are ever in the Glen Rose, Texas area."
2,How Kirby Taxis Helped During A Time Of Crisis,travel-leisure," When the pandemic hit early in 2020 it is fair to say that most of us weren't prepared. As lockdown went into effect across the UK many of us were forced to work from home. We couldn't see our loved ones anymore if they didn't live in the same household as us and leaving your home for anything other than essential shopping became enforced by the government. This effectively meant all travel around the city by taxi came to a stand still. A once thriving industry of taxi drivers, like so many other industries became obsolete. However, Kirby Taxis decided to put it's drivers to good use to help with some of the new challenges which arose when covid-19 crippled much of our day-to-day activities. When those high at risk were told to stay home Kirby Taxis in Leicester used their vehicles to transport much needed groceries and hampers to those who needed it most. Using protective measures, put in place to protect both the drivers and those receiving care packages, Kirby Taxis was able to safely deliver across Leicester. Once delivery services were able to catch up with the demand placed on them and these services were no longer required Kirby Taxis went back to doing what they do best: offering an affordable, reliable taxi service in Leicester. While airport shuttles have remained an option throughout the pandemic there has been very little use of them, for obvious reasons. Now, as things slowly get back to normal, Kirby Taxis is ready to serving people across Leicester, happy to have helped in a time of crisis."

5,An Adventurous Journey To The Mesmerizing City Of Middleton,travel-leisure," The earth is a beautiful creation, and I am very thankful to be in it. All the places, landscapes, locations, cities, towns, or countryside are just so mesmerizing. And in this beautiful world, is a very small and pretty city called Middleton in Wisconsin County in the United States of America. I visited here for my honeymoon with the love of my life. We had an excellent experience, the people were so warm and welcoming, the river nearby, not much of a crowd- a peaceful city. It is a perfect getaway from the bustling city life. Middleton is a city that has so much more to offer. It has some of the best restaurants, shopping places, luxurious hotels, and accommodations that will give you the feel of a home. Some of the best places to visit in Middleton while you are visiting are- •	National Mustard Museum. •	Capital Brewery. •	Middleton Area Historical Society. •	Pope Farm Conservancy. •	Lakeview Park. The best months to visit Middleton are June, July, and August. The weather is pleasant with the summer sun shining bright and clear above the head and the temperature is very convenient to go around the city. The streets are very beautiful with vibrant colors in suburban architecture. People here are very friendly and open that it is easy to communicate. We hiked up the trail in the Pheasant Branch Creek Conservancy. It is a green forest with a small natural spring following which meets Lake Mendota. And on the way, there are some Native American Burial Mounds. In all, it was a very refreshing experience and we end our hike at the beautiful Parisi Park. We had a hearty meal at one of the famous restaurants- Otto’s Restaurants & Bar. Some of the best restaurants that Middleton has, that you can try during your stay are- •	Villa Dolce. •	Craftsman Table and Tap. •	Dhaba Indian Bistro. •	Sofra Family Bistro. •	Eno Vino Wine Bar &Bistro. I have tried all the places and they served amazing food, a complete justice to the taste buds. The costs are not very high, pocket-friendly places to eat. Middleton not only have hotels but some amazing Bed and Breakfast with a great price range. Easy on the wallet, but top-class on the comfort and services. You will have full privacy and the entire house to yourself or a room, as per your requirement. We have stayed at a bed and breakfast, as I have never stayed in one before. The host was very cordial and efficient. The breakfast was delicious with wide varieties. We stayed in Middleton for 10 days and each day was like a new splash of happiness and surprises. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Middleton. We promised each other to visit Middleton next year on our first anniversary and that too we will only travel with Spirit Airlines Reservations. We are glad because it was not only the destination that was good but the journey was also amazing. It was so comfortable and hassle-free. I will always cherish each day I spent here. I would love to bring my children here someday and show them this beautiful city. This is a great family vacation destination. With lots of memories and eagerness to visit again next year, we bid goodbye to the wonderful city of Middleton."
6,Places You Need To Visit In Scotland That You Have Probably Never Heard Of,travel-leisure," When planning a trip to Scotland you want to make sure you see all the top attractions listed on TripAdvisor or in your guide book.  After all, if it is a once in a lifetime trip you want to ensure you see all the best places and attractions. Maybe you have a friend that has been before and insists that you must visit Edinburgh Castle and then climb Ben Nevis.  When planning a trip, they are all great ways to start. However, at The Hairy Coo in Edinburgh, we love Scotland so much that we want to introduce you to some less commonly known places that are just as great to visit. We believe so strongly that they are worth visiting that we have included them in our award-winning Scotland Tours. Top 5 must-see places in Scotland that are not on your radar: We include Stirling Castle in some of our tours as it is simply amazing and one of the largest castles in Scotland.  It sits proudly on a large crag or rock above Stirling and offers amazing views from the ramparts. The interior and history of this castle are just as fascinating and impressive as the views from outside. Whether your visit this castle for a few hours during one of our tours or take a leisurely day trip to Stirling we think you will love it. A kelpie or water kelpie is a creature from Scottish folklore that is usually described as a horse-like creature. Since 2014, you can view 2 stunning 30-metre-high kelpie sculptures near Falkirk. They watch over the gateway to the eastern entrance of the Forth and Clyde canal. Whether you see them from a distance or stand directly underneath them, visit them during the day or lit up at night they are always worth a visit. In Scotland, ‘cairn’ is a word to describe a stack of stones.  A cairn can range from just a small memorial marker to a large ancient building. Clava Cairns is an ancient Bronze Age sacred site about 4000 years old which was used as a cemetery.  The sites contain a range of prehistoric burial monuments and the remains of a medieval chapel. A short visit here gives visitors a chance to learn a little about early Scottish civilisation. The Hairy Coo's 2, 3 and 5-day tours of Scotland include a trip to the Clava Cairns. Beautiful waterfalls and some of the tallest trees in Britain reside here. The Hermitage is located near Dunkeld about 15 miles north of Perth. It is definitely one for nature lovers! You can visit the folly of Ossian’s Hall and safely watch over the waterfalls.  You may even see salmon leaping in the Autumn or spy a red squirrel scampering about the trees. We visit the stunning Corrishalloch Gorge on our 5-day tour of Scotland.  It is located in the North of Scotland about 20km south of Ullapool.  The River Droma rushes through the 1-mile long deep gorge. Its name is Gaelic for 'ugly hollow', however, we don't know who named it because it is truly beautiful and well worth a visit. You can take a short walk to a Victorian suspension bridge where you can gaze down over a series of crashing waterfalls. The Hairy Coo tours include many more fascinating and scenic places as we always want everyone who chooses a Hairy Coo tour to experience the best of Scotland.  So before you create your Scotland trip itinerary, remember to find time to visit some of the lesser-known places.  The best way to do that is to join a tour taken by a Scotland expert."
7,Pressure on Camping and Caravanning Sites to Invest in their Facilities,travel-leisure," Glendale has seen a surge in new business enquires from camping and caravanning sites for its range of nationwide landscape and grounds maintenance services as sites across the UK gear up for a bumper summer “Staycation” season. With self-catering cottage prices set to rise by an average of 35% this year compared to 2020 and bookings for the summer up by 98% according to James Starkey chief marketing officer for holidaycottages.co.uk, the demand for summer UK accommodation is likely to outstrip demand breathing much needed confidence and enthusiasm into the UK tourism sector. The increase in demand combined with the imminent arrival of guests more accustomed to international holidays has not only pushed up prices with the promise of increased revenues, but it has also put pressure on camping and caravanning sites to invest in their facilities to match this higher level of expectation. Glendale has seen a 95% increase in the level of enquires from camping and caravanning sites looking to undertake significant landscaping and grounds maintenance work to keep the sites pristine. Specifically, sites are requesting tree management services, commercial grass cutting and invasive specials control alongside general grounds maintenance. Feedback from the clients of Glendale suggests this surge in activity is a mixture of confidence that this year will be one of the best on record in terms of revenue and hence more budget is available to make investment in the grounds, and, during the lockdown many sites either put on hold the regular maintenance work or carried it out themselves resulting in pent up demand for landscape work required to get sites ready for opening in April. Matt Gavin, Head of Commercial Sales & Development at Glendale commented “the demand from the camping sector started as early as late January when confidence started to rise at the prospect of a roadmap out of Covid Restrictions. Since the government announcement was made regarding lockdown potentially ending late June, the level of enquires about our landscaping services has surpassed all expectations and targets and we are all looking forward to a very busy spring and summer indeed”. Glendale offers an all-encompassing green space management service at a national and local level. They are skilled designers, suppliers and distributors of grounds maintenance, tree management, landscaping, landscape architectural services, planning consultancy and woodland management activities, tackling these, and various other green space management tasks, for public and private sector clients across the UK.

9,Who knew San Juan could be this fun? My experience all jotted down for you!,travel-leisure," First things first, I am not your super-cool travel junkie who live on red bulls and adventure. I am a regular boy in my twenties who loves my 9-5 job, my dog Bruno and my middle-class upbringings. Now, don’t get disheartened. I have my moments, Okay! Alright then, let’s get this show on the road. Everyone has a travel bucket list, I had one too. I decided to check off San Juan, Puerto Rico from it. After long nights of googling deals and offers on flights and hotels, I booked my two-way flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico. San Juan does not need any introduction. The city gracefully flaunts colonial architecture, tropical climate, traditional cuisine and breathtaking landscapes. I figured the city could be a sweet escape from the busy monotonous life. The gorgeous city took all my worries away with its scenic beauty and spell binding beaches. In my research, various experienced travel bloggers talked about San Juan and how it important it was to know the airport you are going to land at. Pay attention to check the airport closest to your preferred destination, before departure. San Juan has two international airports- Fernando Luis Ribas Domenici Airport (SIG) which is commonly known as San Juan Isla Grande Airport among locals and frequent travelers. San Juan Luis Munoz Matin Airport (SJU) which is commonly known as San Juan International Airport. It is the busiest and largest airport in Caribbean. For U.S citizens no passport is required for Puerto Rico. The airport is located 8 miles east of Old San Juan. The airport has myriad of duty-free, apparel and souvenir shops. I had already made my booking at Condado Vanderbilt Hotel and scored such a good deal on it, just by doing my research prior booking. First thing I did after exiting the airport was to look for a taxi that can take me to the most popular food joint nearby. Food has always inspired me to explore more and more. A casual banter with the vibrant locals made me more aware of indigenous culture of the city. Despite being a part of USA, San Juan has preserved its Spanish roots and is illuminated by its Spanish Culture and cuisine which the locals call, ‘cocina criolla’. The first thing I ordered was Mofongo, a meat or seafood- filled mound of plantains which was heavenly to say the least. The food has drawn inspiration from Europe, Africa and native Taino People.  I got my share of Caribbean delicacies on the islands. The cafes, Island restaurants serve everything from local to Italian cuisine with vegetarian and vegan friendly options available as well. Next stop was to see magic. I am serious. Ever seen water glowing without the Instagram filters? Me neither. In Puerto Rico I did! It is a scientific phenomenon known as bioluminescent bays, in layman terms- glowing water. Tourist from all over the globe rush to the beaches of Puerto Rico to experience this beauty. Being a water baby myself I couldn’t help but marvel at the waters glimmering in starless night. I was clapping like a five-year-old boy who had just seen her first magic show. Strange looks from onlookers brought me back to reality. It’s been a month since I came back to my regular life, don’t get me wrong, I love my life but sometimes when things start to get overwhelming, I close my eyes and imagine myself standing on the beach, barefoot, watching the waves rising to touch my feet and assuring me that it’s going to be a good life. I hope you had as much fun reading this article as much as I did writing it. Stay safe."
10,Travel Tips To Make Your Vacation Planning Easier,travel-leisure," Many people spend their vacations traveling at home or abroad and consider that it can be a difficult experience to remember all those little details before leaving home, and during the trip, they thought it was very well planned. This is where some travel news and tips can be most helpful. It usually helps to make a list of necessities and then divide it into what needs to be done before closing that door at home and what to remember when traveling to your destination. Here are some valuable travel tips to include on your lists. It is no secret that when young people go on vacation with their friends, alcohol consumption is high, and partying is the main pastime.

Whether you are traveling abroad to Paris, spending spring break in South Padre Island, Texas, or taking a summer trip to Las Vegas, Nevada, it is important to stay safe and aware of your surroundings at all times. By following a few small travel news and tips and keeping in mind a few things, you can make sure your vacation goes smoothly and you have a great time. • Do not carry all your valuables in one place. Divide your cash, bank cards, credit cards, and traveler's checks in different locations, either in your pockets or in your luggage, if you keep it on your person in case of lost luggage. That way, if you are robbed, you may not lose everything at once. • Drink bar soap and toothpaste powder instead of liquids and tubes to simplify things for security clearance. Buy sample size items if possible. • One of the best travel news and tips suggests that you pack as much as you can in plastic bags because they are kept cleaner and visible to those who feel it is necessary to go through your luggage at airports, etc. They are also useful as an emergency umbrella. • Traveling with a flashlight or torch is common, but don't let those batteries run out if the light accidentally turns on. Rotate the batteries before storing and then turn them on again when you reach your destination. • Shoes must be placed in plastic bags to keep other items in your luggage clean and odor-free. You could put a pair of socks inside each shoe for easy packing. • When flying, especially on a long flight, keep all necessary medications along with your important documents nearby in air baggage. It may also be helpful to carry a clean change of clothes when on long flights."
11,What to See on Your Visit to Bangkok,travel-leisure," Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, is a popular tourist destination and a good way to get to see the sights here. It is the most populated city in Thailand, the hub of South East Asia, one of the best sight-seeing places in the world. Although some may think that the most popular sight-seeing attraction is the temples, there are many other things that are worth visiting in Bangkok. You can visit the museums in Bangkok. These are more than enough to fill up your short trips to Bangkok. There are a lot of attractions in the museums like the National Museum, the Fine Arts Museum, the Medical Museum, the Science and Technology Museum, the National Zoo, etc. If you want to see the sights and monuments of Bangkok, just take it easy and book a sight-seeing tour so you don't miss any of the landmarks. There are a lot of tourist agencies that can help you plan for such tours to Bangkok. If you are looking for budget tours, there are cheap tours available as well. There are many types of sight-seeing tours - from historic, to ones that show the infamously seedy areas of the city. You can choose from the museum tour, adventure tour, train tour, trip to Phra Nakhon, explore the natural beauty, visit the temples, shopping, and many more sight-seeing tours. The different tours are suited for different age groups, so you can easily find one that suits your tastes. Bangkok also has excellent public transport - the BTS skytrain or the underground.  Notice I didn't mention buses or taxis.  The roads are typically clogged with traffic - if it's not a Sunday (when the roads are quieter), the skytrain or underground are your best bets. If you DO take a taxi, they're prefectly safe and most drivers speak reasonable English.  Thankfully these days it's very unusual for a driver to quote you a price rather than use a meter (they MUST, by law, use a meter - if any driver quotes you a price, refuse the price and walk away/get out of the taxi). If you have some extra days to kill in Bangkok, consider going out to the suburbs like Samut Prakan - the pace is slower and the air is cleaner there...and believe it or not, the BTS Sky Train goes all the way out to these suburbs.  Also consider going down the eastern searboard to Si Racha or Pattaya if you want to find a beach.  Having said that, the better beaches are in Pattaya and further south.  Bang Saen beach is the closest to Bangkok, but for that reason, it's packed on the weekends with ""Bangkokers"" - and to be honest, it's not the best of beaches.  If you want beaches with silky white sand, then consider Koh Samet or Hat Nang Ram.  You're looking at a 3 hour journey outside of Bangkok, but if you have days up your sleeve, they're highly recommended places to visit and escape the city."
12,Just Some of the Sights You Can See on Your San Francisco Trip,travel-leisure," If you're planning to visit San Francisco, then let me tell you straight: you need at least a week in order to see all the sights and sounds of this beautiful city. The city's a much different area than it used to be, due to all the development that has taken place. It is also much more visually appealing than ever, and it has a long history. As with all cities in the west, San Francisco will never run out of interesting places for you to see, so if you tire of the city life, you can always try camping in one of the national parks outside the city as an alternative. They are becoming more common these days. That being said, San Francisco hotels offer a whole host of exciting features that you can take advantage of when you stay there. Yes, if you want a more luxurous vacation, then hotels in San Francisco are the place for you. Many hotels include spas, some of which offer everything from massages to facials.  If you need to detox your body or simply unwind and relax, then San Francisco hotels have plenty of options. Maybe you prefer the art galleries? If so, then the San Francisco will spoil you. Just off the top of my head, you can visit the Anglim Gilbert Gallery, Gagosian, the Eleanor Harwood Gallery, the Jack Fischer Gallery, the Rena Bransten Gallery, Anthony Meier Fine Arts and Berggruen Gallery.  I did say you'd need a week in San Francisco...maybe I should say two weeks! If you are in the mood for a nice hot bath, then the Santa Clara Hot Springs is the perfect place for you. They offer so many different types of treatments and even provide treatment for pets. They also offer services for individuals as well. One quirky kind of tour you might consider is a ""tech tour"" - you can visit the campuses of Google, Apple and Facebook on such tours.  I always think these kinds of tours are interesting since you get to see a more ""everyday"" side to a city and its surrounding areas. Even though there are so many tours on offer, don't forget the golden rule of travel: walk as much as you can.  Walking means you get to really take in the sights and sounds - it forces you to slow down and see the location in a more ""natural"" way.  Walk a little off the beaten path too - sure, you'll want to tick off the usual tourist attractions, but for me the real magic is found in the ""everyday"" areas that you visit - to see how the locals live. That's not all, San Francisco has some beautiful beaches for you to enjoy. What's more hotels in the city offer packages for couples and families? So, whether you are heading to San Francisco for a few days or staying there for a few weeks, you can enjoy all the options that they have for you."
13,Coach Charter Rentals & Bus Hire Sydney,travel-leisure," Sydney... after more than 12 months of COVID-19, outbreaks, clusters, social distancing and lockdowns, private bus companies have done it tough. An almost forgotten sector of essential services has seen many family-run bus companies shut their doors for good. As we are seeing zero cases in NSW, lockdowns easing and life very slowly becoming back to some normalcy, it is time to take advantage of low prices for charter buses and supporting local businesses by taking advantage of the local beauties Sydney has to offer. Although precautions are still in place, it should not stop you for enjoying a day out with family and friends or utilising a charter bus service for any social upcoming event. What are some of the benefits of hiring a charter bus? Private Transport: On planes, trains and public transport there will always be people you do not know and during the easing of restrictions, it's still everyone's responsibility of keeping each other safe. On a private Sydney Charter Bus service, you can be assured your vehicle is properly sanitised, you have access to hand sanitiser and can ask the driver to wear a face mask if it makes you feel more comfortable. On private transport, the cost of the bus can be shared with the group making it less expensive compared to taxi's and ride sharing. Hiring a charter bus may seem discouraging but it's simpler that you'd imagine. Trying to coordinate schedules with taxi's and ride sharing can be more hassle than it's worth and it makes sense to charter a bus to take the group in one sitting and everyone arrives at the same time. The booking process is simple and done in 5 easy steps. The Comfort Level: Like any automobile, there are different levels of comfort from leather or cloth seats to the type of seat, leg room and conveniences such personal A/C, reading lights and curtains. Some of the top level in luxury coaches have wi-fi, USB charging ports and video monitors to enjoy a movie or presentation during your trip. Minibuses can bring a secure, weatherproof luggage trailer for the stowing of luggage while the coaches have undercarriage storage and overhead parcel racks for hand luggage. Efficiency: When you charter a bus, it can do multiple pickup locations so all the passengers do not have to make an additional trip in their car or on a train or taxi to the pickup location and at the end of the service then do the same home. It saves on the environment and it also allows the passengers peace of mind knowing they have a designated driver. Flexible: On Sydney Charter Bus tours, you are not tied down to a schedule. All itineraries are flexible and tour locations and be added or subtracted without penalty. It could be a simple drive-by a historical site or a short ""stretch of the legs"" photo opportunity at any one of Sydney's breathtaking locations and lookouts. The day is about enjoyment and having fun with family and friends. Long Distance Travel: Booking a charter bus compared to a train or plane for those long-distance travels or bus tours makes perfect sense as you don't have to worry about flight delays, lost luggage and actually getting lost in the hustle and bustle of airports and train stations. You don't have to worry about booking seats so you can sit with your family and friends with the possibility that you may not get to sit together and making joint bookings for the group does not always work out the way you had planned. Booking a private touring coach eliminates all the potential mishaps and has added advantages of multiple stops for photos, meals, comfort stops and spontaneous stops at scenic locations to enjoy this vast land that NSW and Australia have to offer. See our Services page for more information. What types of buses are there? While there are many types of buses to choose from the most common types are: Take a look ar our bus and coach fleet on our website. Micro-coach: 9 seater (becoming phased out in 2021) Minivans: 12 & 13 seaters Minibus: 20 & 21 seaters Mini Coach: 24 & 25 seaters Standard Bus (School bus): 40+ seaters and allows standing passengers Standard Coach: 34-65 seaters Luxury Coach: 34-65 seaters Bus Charter, Bus Hire and Bus Rental. What is the difference? A charter bus is vehicle that is reserved for private use booked for a group travelling together with a common destination. Bus hire is exactly the same a bus charter... booked for hire with driver for a private group with a common destination. Bus rental is a person renting a bus or coach off the bus company so they can use their own driver and rent the bus on a per day rate just like renting a car. Luxury Coaches and Standard Buses: A standard bus (also referred to a school buses) do not usually have seatbelts and depending on the age of the bus may not have air-conditioning. They do allow for standing passengers but have no compartments for luggage. These standard buses are often referred to as ""people movers"" as they allow for 50+ seating and 20+ standing. Luxury coaches are sleeker and more modern with a range of comfort and safety options that the standard bus doesn't have such as seatbelts, personal A/C, reading lights, relining coach seats, leather seats, video monitors, toilets, overhead racks for small bags and items and luggage bins for suitcases. There are even star ratings in the luxury coach range with five-star luxury coaches offering a power supply, USB inputs, Wi-Fi, personal heat/cool outlets and fold-down table with cupholder. You can always discuss your options with the bus company to suit the requirements of the group. Why not take a look at our fleet for bus and coach options. What are the Seating Options in Buses? Charter buses come in a range of different sizes and seating options from the small 12 seats up to 65 seats and everything in-between. Your group may only be 20 passengers which would comfortably fit in a 21 seater minibus but you may want each passenger to have a double seat for their comfort or social distancing in which case you may want to book a 42 seater coach with all the luxuries of a modern coach. Your group may need some privacy and work on their laptop's whist the bus in in service so upgrading to a luxury coach with power options may be a benefit for your company. Eating and Drinking on a Charter Bus: NSW law states there is no food or drinks allowed on a bus (unless for medical reasons) except water. Alcohol consumption is not allowed on a charter bus and during COVID-19; restrictions and social distancing for venues are enforceable and as soon as a passenger is allowed to consume alcohol on a charter bus the pus becomes a venue where social distancing rules apply. NSW has party bus services that allow alcohol but with restrictions in place they were limited to the capacity of the party bus and when the bus may have carried 30 or 40 party goers they were limited to 5 or 6 in the party bus which doesn't make much of a party. If you want to eat on a charter bus you will need to contact the service provider and request that you'd like to eat on the bus. Generally, snacks are permitted but hot meals are discouraged as the smell gets into the A/C and stays for days. Any hot food spilling onto cloth seats becomes stained and bus companies will have to charge a cleaning fee. For long distance travels the bus can make comfort stops for meals and toilet breaks. Sleeping on a Charter Bus: Most coaches will have reclining seats that allow for relaxation and sleeping but like an aeroplane it can be quite difficult to have a solid sleep. If your journey is a few hours or more and you feel you may want to sleep then it's best to prepare for comfort by bringing an inflatable neck pillow and a light blanket. Some minibuses have reclining seats also but the mid-range 20 seaters do not. Stowing Luggage on a Charter Bus: In the coach range of charter buses there will be undercarriage luggage bays for large suitcases and other large items that would not fit under the seat or in the overhead racks such as prams, golf clubs, surfboards, boxes and any other oversized item you may bring. Minibuses can tow a luggage trailer that is weatherproof and secure. Luggage trailers come in different sizes depending on the passenger capacity of the bus. Allowing every passenger 1 x large suitcase and 1 or 2 small carry-ons means a 20 seater minibus will pull a luggage trailer large enough for 2 suitcases and a 12 seater pulls a smaller 12 suitcase capacity luggage trailer. In cases where a coach has too many suitcases and risks being over weight and over loaded then a second coach may be required or a luggage truck that takes just the suitcases only. This is usually applicable for transporting cruise passengers that need 2 or 3 suitcases each plus carry-ons. Additional Stops / Additional Pickups and Drop-offs All good charter bus companies will offer comfort stops enroute to any destination and for long distance travel these stops are planned in the itinerary. Additional or random stops may incur an additional fee depending on the length of time it takes. Usually, a good bus company will allow stops for toilet breaks and allow an additional non-scheduled drop-off proving it is enroute. When the bus is on a freeway there are not too many places to pull over with the safety of passengers as a top priority so it is unlikely to stop unless it is a designated rest stop or refuelling station. Having to pull off the freeway could mean 20 or 30 minutes before finding a route back on to the freeway which either becomes part of the overall days charter time or additional time which could be added to the cost. Planning and Booking your Charter Service: Planning a tour itinerary, a corporate event or just a social outing can be enjoyable and a team effort but it can also be frustrating as roads and traffic are constant shifting patterns of delays and closures. Booking restaurants, wineries, events and the general logistics of planning events can be difficult when not knowing the local area and its traffic patterns, peak hours and which roads are accessible for your bus. Most people rely on online maps to give estimates of the time it will take to get to the event and back but there are other factors to consider. All the passengers showing up on time is a rare event in the charter bus industry and it is typical for buses to be at least 15 minutes past the departure time because of late arrivals. With traffic snarls and even the alighting of passengers and gathering of personal items can be longer than you plan so it is always best to allow 30 minutes extra in travel time to have that buffer for delays and it is always best to arrive 10 minutes early than 30 minutes late. Obtaining a Bus Quote: The more information you provide the charter bus company about your event, the better understanding the bus company has to provide an accurate quote. Take the time to consider all options and don't be afraid to ask questions no matter how trivial it may seem. It's best to get all the answers so there are no misunderstandings on the day of the service. What the charter bus company requires for quoting: Departure date/s Departure time (or an ETA you wish to arrive by) Pickup Location/s Destination/s Return departure time (or ETA you wish to be back by) Return locations/s Additional waypoints forward or return Total passengers Amount of luggage Special requests or requirements Bus type preference Additional information Logistics: Once your bus quote has been received and you are happy to use the company, it's time to get the service booked and locked in. Once the bus company has received your booking it's time to work out the logistics of the service. You want to make sure your pickup location and destination have access for the bus size you require and the last thing you'd want happening is the bus not being able to go any further because of a narrow road and you and your passengers having to walk to the bus which could be a short 2 minutes' walk or a long 10 or 15 minutes' walk so best to sort out logistics so you potentially do not have any hiccups on the day. Some of the potential hazards for buses and coaches are narrow streets, hairpin bends, dead-end roads with inadequate turning areas, tree lined streets with low overhanging branches, road weight limits and many more potential hazards but there are also other factors to consider like clearways coming into effect, no stopping zones etc. A simple solution to a lot of issues is to have the pickup at the rear of the location as with Sydney traffic and especially in Sydney CBD a request to pick up out the front of the premisses maybe a easy pickup but if blocked or a clearway or some other issue it could take up to 20 minutes for the bus to go around the block and during peak times could be longer so it is very important to sort out the logistics of pickups and drop-offs prior to the service. Mini Bus & Coach Choices: With COVID still fresh in people's minds, many clients and businesses may choose to upgrade to a larger bus just to allow some social distancing and give the passengers some peace of mind. The bus hire company will be able to help choosing the right bus for your requirements. Over long distances you may want to upgrade from a minibus to a coach for those comfortable coach reclining seats, personal A/C and personal reading lights. Personal Belongings: It is best (where possible) to take all bags and belongings with you in-between services as any good coach company will sanitise the bus in-between shifts and you don't want your personal belongings getting potentially spoiled. It is always good practice to allocate a team leader with any type of group and this person can be the last off the bus and take in visual inspections to see if anyone has left anything behind. The driver will also provide this check but more thoroughly once he/she gets back to the depot and hand in any lost property items which will be registered in our Lost Property Register and we will contact you to arrange a safe return. Amenities: Most 40+ seater luxury coaches with have a toilet for passenger convenience but there are a lot of coaches in Sydney that do not have toilets and some coach companies choose to use the toilet as storage and lock it (out of service) to passengers. For long distance journeys the coach company may utilise the restroom for passengers and some may offer regular comfort stops. Always check with the coach company before booking. The use of toilets on coaches brings OH&S policies up as any heavy vehicle having to perform an emergency brake during transit with the toilet occupied makes it a hard decision to close the toilet off to passengers whist bus is in motion. The Last Step: Once your charter bus is booked and confirmed, it's time to prepare for the journey. It is always best to print the booking itinerary to a PDF document and email to the other passengers so they have a better understanding of the service ahead and all the instructions regarding pickup location, waypoints, comfort stops and destinations. If it's a long-distance journey then remember to bring water. If any passengers have special needs or requirements then make sure the charter bus company is aware.

17,5 Questions About Visiting Japan You’d Want Answers For,travel-leisure," Japan is one of the most exotic and accessible travel destinations in the world. That said, if you’re visiting alone or for the first time, there are a couple of things you should know before hopping onto a plane. The following are answers to five common questions asked by first-time visitors to the Land of the Rising Sun. Many Japanese city-dwellers, especially those in the tourism industry, are able to at least speak Basic English. However, it would be foolish to expect many to be as fluent as Americans or Europeans. Away from the larger cities, you will also find it increasingly hard to be understood if you speak only English. This will be the case even with service staff. Thus, it is prudent to at least know some basic Japanese phrases when in the country. Words and phrases such as those for “excuse me,” “thank you,” “where are the restrooms,” “help,” etc. When visiting small towns and locations away from major travel routes, you might want to equip yourself with phrase cards too; these to show to locals. Ensure that these cards are written in the Japanese language and not Romanized translations. The latter will only invite bewilderment. Japan is one of the safest countries in the world, perfect for solo travelers and families alike. This, however, doesn’t mean it’s crime-free. For travelers, what’s important to note are the following: Red-light / party districts such as Tokyo’s Kabukicho are best avoided late in the evening. While they aren’t particularly dangerous, you might encounter rowdy groups of drunk men. Touts could also be aggressive in their attempts to get you to visit questionable establishments. Like anywhere else in the world, it is foolish to venture into dark alleys and deserted parks at night. Like anywhere else in the world too, you should not head into the wilderness alone, in a small group, or without a professional guide. Sexual groping on crowded public transportation has been an issue in Japan for decades. Women might want to avoid crowded subway and bus services during peak hours. Japan is beautiful all year round, with a myriad of activities and attractions to enjoy each season. That said, you might want to avoid the months from June to September. Apart from the Japanese summer notorious for being extremely warm, this is typhoon season. When a particularly violent one hits, entire cities could be locked down. Public transportation will also come to a standstill and there is often the risk of floods. The weeks from early October to mid-December are correspondingly the best travel months. Other than gorgeous Autumn foliage to enjoy, the weather is typically clear and dry. The Cherry-Blossom viewing weeks from March to mid-April could be delightful too. However, do note that these weeks could experience frequent showers. It is also common for there to be sudden but brief cold weather during these weeks. Naturally, this greatly depends on your interests. Generally speaking, the following are considered the best attractions of Japan. Famous Japanese castles such as Osaka Castle, Matsumoto Castle, Nagoya Castle, etc. While there’s usually not much to see within the keeps, their majestic exteriors are wondrous to behold. World-renowned Japanese gardens such as Kanazawa’s Kenroku-En, Tokyo’s Rikugien, etc. Natural wonders such as Matsushima and Yakushima. Historical temples such as Tokyo’s Senso-ji, Kyoto’s Kiyomizue Temple, Nara’s Todai-ji, etc. Visually stunning Shinto Shrines such Miyajima’s Itsukushima Shrine. Modern architectural wonders such as Tokyo Skytree. Crowded as they might be, immaculate service makes all Japanese theme parks a joy to visit. Medieval-themed ones could also be great fun for travelers fascinated with samurai and ninjas. Japanese-style bathing, whether at a rustic hot-spring or an elaborate public bath, is an experience not to be missed. Historical marvels such as the stunning Golden Pavilion in Kyoto, the Great Buddha of Kamakura, and so on. There is also, of course, Mount Fuji. Japan’s tallest mountain often hides behind fog, but a full glimpse of it is a sight few would soon forget. Japanese society has various taboos. For foreigners, the most important ones to know are: Do not wear your shoes indoors. Change into the slippers provided. When at a hot-spring or public bath, clean yourself before entering the main pool. Do not enter if you are still soapy. Do not engage in anti-social or dangerous behaviors such as littering, talking loudly on public transportations, jaywalking, etc. Refrain from talking on handphones on public transportation. Switch your gadget to vibration mode too, known in Japan as “manner” mode. Naturally, be respectful at temples and shrines. It is not a must, but some basic knowledge of Japanese history and culture will also make your visit vastly more meaningful, and enjoyable. Lastly, use online services such as Google Maps to pinpoint the locations of your hotels, etc. Japanese roads are often confusingly marked, and English signs are not always available. You should also use a service like Hyperia.com to determine your travel routes if you are using rail transportation. On this, note that many Japanese train stations have very similar-sounding names, but could in reality be miles apart."

20,5 Ways to Spice Up Your Japan Travel Itinerary,travel-leisure," The world's foremost crossroad of the East and West, and a pop culture powerhouse, there's never any shortage of enjoyable things to do in Japan. The following are 5 unique ways to spice up your Japan travel itinerary if you're still unsure of how to enjoy yourself when there. Yokai is the generic Japanese name for ""supernatural aberrations,"" with such otherworldly creatures widely feared in the past. Thanks to popular manga series like Gegege no Kitaro, though, many Yokai are today widely regarded as ""kawaii"" i.e. cute. The most popular ones have even received new life as tourism mascots. Which means you can go about the whole of Japan hunting for them! At Kyoto’s Ichijo-Dori street, there’s an entire street adorned with quirky statues of them. Elsewhere, Yokai are frequently used to decorate souvenirs, travel attractions, and even transportation facilities such as train stations. As long as you don’t mind their “unusual” appearances, a Yokai hunt will definitely bring you many laughs and great photo opportunities each day. Japanese Shinto shrines count amongst the country’s most unique architectures. The problem though, unlike Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines are typically rustic, with no elaborate statues or carvings. Simply put, they could all start to look the same after a while. On the other hand, all but the smallest Shinto shrines sell Ema, these being small wooden prayer plaques for visitors to write wishes on. While most are similar in shape, all feature different illustrations representation of the shrines they are sold at. At popular shrines, they could even be sold as iconic objects. For example, Kyushu’s Dazaifu Tenmangu has Ema in the shape of gourds. Kyoto’s Fushimi-Inari Shrine, famed for its red torii tunnels, presents its ema in the shape of mini red torii. In summary, a Japan travel itinerary based on going about Japan checking these out could be great fun. If you’re a gamer, you’d surely know that Japan is one of the world’s leading producers of video games. Many Japanese video games also feature astonishing virtual reproductions of actual Japanese cities, historical or modern. Keen to learn about the best attractions in Tokyo? Atlus’ Persona 5 is practically a travel guide. Undecided on whether to stop by Fukuoka or Nagoya? Sega’s Yakuza 5 painstakingly depicts the downtown area of these leading cities. Vice versa, visiting the locations these games are based on could be delightful, positively a thrill if you are a fan. The pictures taken at these spots will also be much celebrated by the international gaming community. In other words, you could be a star in related social media communities overnight. Japan is well-known for its Bento, these being elaborate and beautiful meal boxes. Widely sold throughout Japanese cities big and small, the Bento that’d delight travelers most are also undoubtedly Ekiben. These being meal boxes sold at train stations for consumption during long-distance train rides. As dreary as the description might be, Japanese Ekiben are gorgeously presented and meant to showcase the seasons, nearby travel attractions, or culinary specialties of the cities they are sold at. Affordable and with a wide variety to choose from, they could even be described as the best choice for visitors new to Japanese regional cuisine. Needless to say, Japan’s high standard of food preparation ensures that even the cheapest Ekiben will be a satisfying meal. Few other countries love Ferris Wheels as much as Japan. Huge, gorgeously illuminated ones perfect for romantic evening rides are found throughout the country. For visitors who prefer shorter rides, many larger cities also have smaller Ferris Wheels right in the heart of downtown, some of which are part of retail complexes. Nagoya’s Sunshine Sakae and Osaka’s HEP FIVE are the most famous examples of this. A Japan travel itinerary centered on such atmospheric rides will thus ensure many beautiful moments. As well as the opportunity for lovely cityscape photographs."

1,Which way will tourism go after the pandemic?,travel-leisure," Travelling and adventures have been among the main needs of mankind. Over the years, civilization has changed from travelling by foot, horses, camels to travelling by ships, trains, cars and finally airplanes. In the past, people travelled without a visa, for example, until the early 20th century Western Europeans moved from one country to another without visas and passports; these became necessary as travel documents only in the 20th century, after World War I. Tourism sector If in the previous century a traveller required a stamp in a passport, in the 21st century the trend is changing toward an electronic visa. According to the World Tourism Organization, in 1980 the travelling categories were as follows: ‘traditional visa’ (75%), ‘no visa required’ (20%), and ‘visa on arrival’ (5%). In 2018 the category ‘no visa required’ remained approximately at the same level — 21% whereas the level of ‘visa on arrival’ category increased up to 3 times. In 2018 every 10th traveller received an electronic visa, as a result, the level of the ‘traditional visa’ category decreased to 53%. The increase in the e-visa numbers in the 21st century is not surprising in that the traditional visa issue procedure is tedious for travellers and costly for states. The number of electronic visas out of the total number of issued visas is on the increase, despite obstacles such as the adaptation of the visa issue procedure and creation of informative web-sites. According to the World Tourism Organization data, during 2012–2018 the use of e-visa increased 5 times. Tourism in Azerbaijan Around 25 countries worldwide issue e-visas to foreign visitors. However, each country has its own e-visa application procedure. The e-visa system was established in Azerbaijan in 2016, and over 3 years it has produced satisfactory results. For example, in order to apply for an e-visa to Azerbaijan a visitor needs to follow 3 steps: to fill in an application form on the website — evisa.gov.az, pay for a visa and finally download it. Owing to this easy procedure, the number of the e-visas out of the total number of issued visas to Azerbaijan has increased dramatically. According to the State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in 2018 2.849 million foreigners entered Azerbaijan. This statistic includes all traveler categories: with ‘traditional visa’, ‘no visa required’, and ‘e-visa’ (about 24% of the visitors). In 2019, 29.2% of foreigners used an electronic visa, which indicated a 36% increase out of the total number (925 827) of issued e-visas. These statistics have promising implications for the whole world. Tourism and covid 19 It is noteworthy that tourism is one of the sectors that has suffered most due to the pandemic. Restrictions on travel introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to hit the global tourism hard, said UNWTO in its report in October. For the first eight months of 2020 the tourism industry showed a 70% fall in the international arrivals. According to the newest UNWTO World Tourism Barometer, the international arrivals plunged 81% in July and 79% in August, traditionally the two busiest months of the year and the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer season. The drop until August represents 700 million fewer arrivals compared to the same period in 2019 and translates into a loss of US$ 730 billion in export revenues from the international tourism. This is more than eight times the loss experienced back during the 2009 global economic and financial crisis. OECD now estimates that in 2020 the international tourism numbers will fall by around 80%. Tourism after covid The COVID-19 pandemic has changed human behavior and preferences in general, and in the tourism industry in particular. In the future, after the pandemic ends, we can expect a surge in the international tourism numbers. It is predictable that the simplicity of the e-visa procedure will be one of the major triggers in traveler attraction."
2,How ASAN Visa has changed tourism in Azerbaijan?,travel-leisure," In recent years, Azerbaijan has become one of the favorite destinations for regional tourists. After successful implementation of the oil strategy, Azerbaijan has started developing the other sectors of the economy where tourism is playing a very significant role. Beautiful nature and rich history expressed in the restored monuments along with developed infrastructure, including fashionable hotels built all over the country, have been instrumental in tourist attraction. The next step was to simplify the visa application procedure, hence in 2016 “ASAN Visa” system was established. Today the application procedure for a visa to Azerbaijan consists of only three steps such as filling in the application form on the website - evisa.gov.az, paying the fee, and finally downloading an issued e-visa. It should be noted that the electronic visa is available for citizens of 94 countries. The e-visa is a single entry visa, valid for 90 days, and it allows a visitor to stay in Azerbaijan for up to 30 days. The processing period for a standard e-visa application is for up to 3 working days.  It is also possible to obtain an express e-visa within 3 hours and the e-visa service is available regardless of non-working days and public holidays. The easy visa issue procedure makes a positive impact on the development of tourism in Azerbaijan. Let us take a quick look at a recent statistic: according to the State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan 2.849 million foreigners visited Azerbaijan in 2018. This number includes the traveler categories with traditional visas (visas issued through embassies), e-visas as well as visa exempted travelers. Considering that in 2018 the “ASAN Visa” system issued 681 thousand e-visas, about 24% of foreigners traveling to Azerbaijan in the same year used “ASAN Visa”. In 2019 the number of foreigners who visited Azerbaijan was 3.170 million and about 29,2% of them used “ASAN Visa”. This indicates that the “ASAN Visa” is increasing its share in the number of foreigners traveling to Azerbaijan. In the first half of 2019 the number of issued visas in comparison with the first half of 2018 increased by 61%. Since 2016 (the new visa system launch date) the number of foreigners who visited Azerbaijan has risen by 41% whereas during 2013-2016, the number of foreign visitors remained almost the same. It is noteworthy that the pandemic has had a severe impact on the tourism industry in Azerbaijan. Considering the fact that the World Health Organization declared the global pandemic of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), the issue of electronic visas via ""ASAN Visa"" system and other visas upon arrival to the international airports of the Republic of Azerbaijan has been suspended to prevent the virus spread on the territory of Azerbaijan. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed human behavior and preferences in general, and in the tourism industry in particular. In the future, after the pandemic ends, we can expect a surge in the international tourism numbers. Implementation of e-visa systems will positively contribute to defining tourism destination preferences."
3,Why celebrate Christmas in Armenia,travel-leisure," Armenia is the first Christian country in the world adopted Christianity as a state religion in 301. But how did it happen? In the first century, two of Christ's twelve apostles, Thaddeus and Bartholomew, came and spread Christianity in Armenia and that is why the Armenian Church is not a Catholic but Apostolic. Hence, Christmas in Armenia is celebrated not at the end of December, but on January 5-6. Let's imagine how special and original it will be to celebrate Christmas in a country where people are in a mood you were a week ago, when you were hurrying in a Christmas shopping or somewhere else to get ready for the most beloved holidays, meanwhile you are celebrating the Christmas in one of the best pubs or restaurants of Yerevan. But besides mood and abstract things I want to represent you the highlights of the advantages that is why it is worth to celebrate your Christmas in Armenia. The museums are open during Christmas I think museums are one of the most important touristic objects.Where else can one easily get acquainted with the culture and history of a country if not in museums? And during Christmas Holidays, the chance that museums in EU countries will be closed is very high. This is one of the reasons why you should visit Armenia. Besides, that is true not only about museums but also about other touristic attractions. Low Prices of Hotels during the Christmas period It is not a secret that the prices of hotels rise during the high season and decrease during low season. And what days are considered as a high season I think is not a secret. In Europe, these are the warm summer and spring months, and the days of Christmas and New Year period, the winter period in the Arabian warm countries when people are running from cold countries to find the sea and the sun. But everything is different in Yerevan and Armenia during Christmas days. Last days of December are considered the low season, and the prices are cheaper in those days here, and the reason you already know. In Armenia, the holidays begin in 1st of January and last until January 6, before the Armenian Christmas. So we recommend you to visit Armenia during the Christmas holidays and save your money. The tours are cheap as well The same logic in this case. Low season and affordable prices. But why did we mention tours in Armenia as a separate sub-paragraph? The point is that Armenia has more than 2,000 years of history and the most interesting places dedicated to history and culture are mostly out of Yerevan. In order to reach sightseeings of Armenia, you need to take tours or take a taxi. For example, there is a pre-Christian pagan temple of Garni. Can you imagine a building that has more than 2000 years of history? And at the same time was one of the most beautiful buildings of that time. These points can still be continued to mention the reasons why it is worth to celebrate Christmas holidays in Armenia. The Armenian people have always been famous for their warmness and hospitality, there are so many legends about this. Here is a suggestion: If you want to fill your holy days with love and warmness then visit Armenia. Besides, you will find a very original country for you. The culture and architecture of this country are not like to the European nor Asian but is unique and looks like only Armenian. Decreasing graphic of coronovirus. The last strong outbreak in Armenia was in October, after which the situation was stabilized by Armenian specialists; now the numbers are decreasing day by day, 300 cases a day. And if we take into account that the population of Armenia is only 3 million, the rate of the virus is unlikely to rise again."

Heavy-duty frame: Choose an umbrella in which the frame is made out of heavy-duty material like metal, aluminum, or tempered steel.

6,Fishing Pole Setup Beginners with 3 Easy Steps,travel-leisure," Fishing pole setup beginners is essential for the new fisherman like me. From my childhood, I was curious about fishing. My father was an expert about fishing. There was a river near our house, and every weekend I saw my father went there for fishing. He also brought me with him and helped me to set up my fishing pole. So last autumn, I and one of my friends tried to recreate those memories. But unfortunately, now we have no pond near our house, and also we are not experts about anything related to fishing. So at the very beginning, I had to learn how to set a fishing pole. In this article, I want to share my practical knowledge vs. my bookish knowledge with you, and it will be helpful for you who are beginners. Fishing Pole Setup Beginners: 3 Steps Firstly, know that fishing pole is a noun. According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, it means Fishing pole is a long pole made of wood, metal, or plastic and a hook at the end of the pole used for catching fish. Depending on individuals' expertise, fishing can be an interesting simple game or a funny, difficult task. For fishing, you have to learn how to set an important task. You need to remember some key elements when you set up your pole, no matter how and which fish you want to catch. It would help if you had to follow some basic techniques to ensure your rod is powerful and decoy successfully. Don't be fear if you follow the right gear. You will be master in it with no time. In this context, I will show you step by step guide for the fishing Pole Setup. So let's begin without further to-do. Step-1: Assembly Rod and Reels: First, you have to identify all of your fishing equipment. You have to learn how to terminology your tools before starting assembly them. The handle and the part you will hold is called grip. The most flexible part of the rod is called a tip located on the top of the rod. The thick part of the rod is known as the butt that is closest to the handle. You need to learn the name of the tools of the fishing pole. Avoid any scratch. You need to dirt free all the fishing pole parts with a clean cloth. Dirt can destroy the parts of the pole. To extend the life of the pole, use a swab to clean it regularly. As a beginner assembling a fishing pole may seem complicated but not difficult. You will have pieces of rods. Screw up the upper piece rod to the lower pieces gently; don't force the elements to join. Usually, the joint between the pieces is known as a ferrule. To attach the rod, ferrule needs to be inserting into the female ferrule. You need to remember. Stop immediately if your rod doesn't come together, and don't force it. Read the manual carefully if there is any lock system or ask somebody (peer) who knows it properly. Now insert the reel into the female opening reel known as reel seat, which can be found over the butt end. Remember not to overtighten the reel that may cause damage to the rod. Most beginners' reels hold 6-12lb, but I recommend starting with an 8-12lb monofilament line. Step-2: Threading Time: Gently pressure on the reel's bale arm, and it will help lift up the bale arm to the other side of the reel.  Remember, don't force excessive that may cause damage. Most rods have four to five eyelets. Start thread from the eye line closest to the reel and ending to the top of the rod. And also, make sure not to miss any eyelets. Once finishing threading into the eyelets, pull up the end line back to the standing line and twist it several times. There are many types of knots you can use to tie your line to your spool. It will create a hole where the thread will put into and tugging until the line is uptight while cutting the extra line. To close the bale arm simply needs to move it in the opposite direction as previously moved it. Keep the line tight when spooling the reel. Step-3: Lure Attaching: First, you have to choose your lure. Choosing a lure may depend on the weather, types of water, types of fish, etc. Choose the color of the lure based on different weather like cloudy, stormy, or sunny. On the basis of fish and water, choose the type of lure. Remember, in the muddy or dirty water through your spinner or spoon lure may help create their vibration. But in clean water, these advantages can turn into your disadvantages. If you are looking for an all-purpose lure, try a spinner. Set up the fishing pole is almost done. For attaching to the lure, choose the right kind of hook. Holding the hook with your thumb and pointer finger, insert the thread into it and pull it. Then twist it 5-10 times and using the fisherman knot. Then loosen the thread and put it into the hole by the eye of the hook. Similarly, do with the second hole—usually, no need for a bigger hook. Final Words Fishing is an exciting game, and it needs huge patience in every step. Back in these days, there are not many choices for setting up the fishing pole. But for the blessings of science, we now have thousands of options. When I was a beginner before heading out on the water, I just needed to learn some basic steps that helped me learn the fishing pole setup beginners. I hope this information will also help you to become more confident and ready to get out for fishing."

If you are worried or disgusted by any of these things you should check into the country you want to visit and see what the standards are. This can also help you not get in trouble if you flush toilet paper in a country with systems that aren't built to handle that level of bulky waste. Personal Hygiene Needs Many countries don't offer the same personal hygiene items or have them made from different items. This can be shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and many other things as well. For women, many countries don't use tampons or use much older pad types, making it important to pack your feminine hygiene items before you go. Language Barriers The biggest consideration should usually be how much of the language you know and how much you want to interact with people. While you will likely learn some words while you are there, expecting to come out of a summer trip fluent is foolish and will set you up for disappointment. If you don't speak the local language, make sure that someone in your group or where you are staying does in case of an emergency. Time Off How much time off is provided is always going to be important no matter where you go. If you have big plans to travel and take in the scenery, it sucks to find out that you only have one day off a week. Most programs will list the amount of time that you have off and if you want more you can usually e-mail and work out arrangements before you depart. This is also important if you are used to a set schedule and the work you are doing will be different. Overall going abroad is a great way to meet new people and try new things. A little bit of forethought can make any trip amazing."

A T+ ticket is also valid for the RATP buses and the Paris Tramway, where you can change between the two, again valid for 90 minutes. Yet for Noctilien night buses, 1 T+ ticket is valid for those with two digits like bus line N01 and 2 T+ tickets are needed for the three digits like bus line N144. A T+ ticket will not provide access to the Paris Airports and when travelling further than Zone 1 like using Paris RER trains, then a ticket must state the destination. If you are on holiday in Paris for a few days, then you can obtain a Paris Visite pass that allows unlimited travel on the Metro, the Paris tramway system, buses, RER and Transilien Trains. You can obtain a pass for 1 day or for 2, 3 or 5 consecutive days allowing you to travel within Paris and the nearest suburbs in tariff zones of 1 to 3. Alternatively, for visiting tourist attractions like Chateau de Fontainebleau or for getting back to one of the Paris airports, then you would need a Paris Visite Ile-de-France Region ticket, which covers all the zones from 1 to 5."
19,How To Travel In Style And Not Spend A Fortune Along The Way,travel-leisure," Traveling is probably one of the most popular activities for many of us. Spending money on physical goods is one thing but spending it on experiences will enrich your life. No matter if you travel within your country and exploring some hidden gems or traveling abroad, you will meet new people, try new cuisines and come back fully recharged. However, many people say that they don't travel because it takes money to travel, especially if you are not into backpacking traveling, staying in hostels and hitch-hiking. It doesn't have to be that way, though. You can travel in style, without paying a fortune. Here I will give you some tips. If you have always wanted to visit a certain place, you should plan your holiday when there aren't big happenings in the area and when the low season takes place. For example, if you plan to visit Rome next year, you are definitely to avoid going to Rome near June 12, as the Euro 2020 opening match between Italy and Turkey is scheduled. Also, from June 12 onwards until July you are recommended to omit the other 12 cities and countries which participate in the competition unless you are a football fan, of course. Or, if you plan to go to some popular holiday destinations like Turkey, Greece and Spain, you are advised to book well in advance, at least... What's more, such countries are pleasantly warm and not quite busy in the preseason, which is the first half of June or even the end of May. Buying an airline ticket (or any other ticket) and booking an accommodation is usually the 2nd and 3rd step in your trip planning. For that purpose, I suggest using the aggregator Kiwi.com, where you can find cheaper tickets if you are willing to have connected flights, (compared to having the shortest routes with direct flights and buying directly from the airline. The same applies to booking a place to stay. You can directly visit any hotel, but I suggest that you also use the aggregator services such as Trivago that enables you to get prices for different hotels at one place. There are even dozens of startups which will rebook your airline and hotel reservation if the prices drop. These include Pruvo, Service, etc. Besides booking a flight ticket and accommodation, you can also book tours online and save money, instead of doing it on the spot. Check out the services like GetYourGuide.com, Musement, etc. Once you arrive in a new city, you probably don't have much information on what to do unless you did your research before. That's why it is always good to check the review sites like Tripadvisor and similar for the things to do and see, depending on your preferences. As soon as you land at the airport, maybe you don't even have mobile net, so can not use some ride-hailing app but even if you can even when ordering via ride-hailing app and use some well-known brand it can happen to pay more (being driven in longer routes) if they realize you are a foreigner. And probably they will realize that within 10 seconds of the ride. Because of lack of mobile net, many tourists pick the first taxi at the taxi stand. That is probably the biggest mistake you can make, leaving bad memories of your holiday. If you want to travel in style and pay slightly more than a regular taxi price, consider pre-arranging a meet-and-greet service with a limo service provider. Your flight can be delayed but your driver will still wait for you free of charge. In addition, you will know the exact price of your transport(ation) as well as the vehicle that will come to pick you up. Those range from the economy to premium class vehicles, including the Mercedes-Benz E-Class or S-Class, or even V-Class if you are traveling in groups. There are several good global limo service and airport transfer brands, and it is quite safe to choose the 1st or 2nd one you get in the organic Google results for limo service. This is how I chose services Limos4 and UrbanBCN for my airport transfers, depending on my location. Another service that you can take into account as part of your travel is a service that will help you store your luggage while you are exploring the city. For example, imagine that you came earlier to your place of stay and you cannot leave your luggage there. Instead of waiting for a few hours to get into the apartment, you can leave your luggage nearby and immediately start sightseeing. That is especially handy when leaving your hotel which is not near any tourist area and you have a flight back in the evening. Instead of leaving the luggage at the hotel lobby, come back for it and then go to the airport, you can leave your luggage in some more convenient place that will be helpful after you have finished seeing the sights. Some popular services for that are LuggageHero and Stasher. I hope that some of these tips will help you save on your travel but not on the quality of your experiences. Enjoy traveling!"

1,Moshe Montifiori Street Jerusalem,travel-leisure," Six Jerusalem neighborhoods - Mazkeret Moshe, OEL Moshe, Zichron Moshe, Bnei Moshe, Kiryat Moshe, and Yamin Moshe-are named after the most famous Jew of the nineteenth century, Moshe Montefiori. But not only did Jerusalem perpetuate the name of this remarkable man in the names of its neighborhoods, but almost every Israeli city also has a street named after him. My story today is about Moshe Montefiori, and also about the love that changed not only the fate of one famous person but, perhaps, changed the history of our country. The history of the Montefiore couple began, as well as the history of many Jewish couples with ... matchmaking! Although the matchmaking was unusual-Moshe Montifiori was from a Sephardic Jewish family, and Judith-his fiancee – from an Ashkenazi family, both were scions of famous families, so the engagement immediately attracted attention. Montefiore-descendants of Jews expelled from Spain settled in Italy, in the city of Livorno, where Moshe was born in 1784. Soon the family moves to London. Moshe-Moses grew up in an aristocratic environment, in a rich family, but not without some oddities. One of his relatives was the first Jewish officer in the British army, a man of advanced views and a well – known industrialist, while the other – William-was a clergyman of the Church of England. Moses grew up a Bohemian representative of the ""Golden"" youth, loving luxury and entertainment! He did not study very hard, but had a commercial streak and excelled in stock trading and became one of the twelve ""Jewish brokers"" of the city of London, and together with his brother founded a banking house that quickly gained a good reputation. During the Napoleonic wars, Montefiore volunteered for the national guard, where he rose to the rank of captain in 4 years. He had an impressive appearance, height under 1 m. 90 cm. In 1812, at the age of 27, Moshe married Judith Cohen... a Playboy, a reveler who loves a luxurious life finds himself under a Hoopa with a woman who is almost a year older than him, an invalid due to childhood illness, an Ashkenazi Jew from a religious family that observes all Jewish traditions. But then a miracle happens – the forced marriage turns into true love, and Judith for Moshe becomes not just a faithful wife, but also a source of inspiration, a loyal friend and colleague for many years. For 50 years they have been together, supporting each other, crossing continents, changing social norms, helping disadvantaged Jews around the world. In 1825, Montifiori left the stock exchange at the peak of his career and began his work as a philanthropist supporting the poorest part of the Jewish population in various countries. It was Judith who pushed him to take this difficult step. Together they made 5 dangerous trips, which Judith described in her diaries. In 1827, the couple visited Jerusalem for the first time, and Moshe subsequently came to Eretz Israel seven times to personally deal with the problems of the local Jewish communities. Montefiore was from the very beginning as opposed to the idea of Hanukah-donations for which Jewish communities existed. Instead, he suggested developing production to enable Jews to earn their own living. At his expense, the land was leased for Jewish settlements, and Jews were trained in agricultural work on a citrus plantation purchased for them near Jaffa. But most of all, Montefiore's activity is connected with the development of Jerusalem.it was with Its support that the first district outside the Old city was purchased and built – ""Mishkenot Sheananim"". By the way, the original name of the district should have sounded like this - ""Kerem Moshe and Judit"". A mill was built nearby (recently restored). In addition, Montefiore showed a deep interest in the Holy places, thanks to him, the tomb of Rachel was put in order and the Western wall in Jerusalem was strengthened. Moshe lived 100 years and died in 1885. He lived a long life and managed a lot! Over time, the name Moshe Montifiori becomes a symbol of patronage, gratuitous assistance, and support for the Jewish people. It is no accident that almost every Jewish city has a Montefiore street, in memory of this wonderful man and his love, which gave him the strength to live a bright long life.​ Legends from the life of Montefiore was famous for his wit and the following story is told about Him: at a dinner party, he found himself sitting next to an aristocrat, an ardent anti-Semite. This man told Montefiore that he had recently returned from a trip to Japan, which was notable for the absence of ""pigs and Jews""there. Montefiore immediately replied: ""in that case, you and I should go there to make up for both."" Another case is known when a newspaper mistakenly printed his obituary, Montifiore replied to the editor: ""Thank God, I am still able to hear such rumors about myself, and read it with my own eyes without glasses."""
2,Jerusalem my precious,travel-leisure," Jerusalem There are many cities in the world, big and small, noisy and quiet, for business and leisure, but there is not a single city in the world that looks like Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the cradle of three religions – Jewish, Christian and Muslim. Its atmosphere is saturated with the rich and ancient history of the universe and the birth of humanity. Only in Jerusalem can you feel the power of history and the vulnerability of man to time. In this city, you can see how the ancient past and the turbulent present touch. ""Jerusalem, you are a city built to unite all» This is what king David called the capital of the Jewish people and their state in Psalm 122. What makes Jerusalem so special in our eyes?Bible researchers have counted 70 names of Jerusalem: The city of David, Ariel, Jebus, Salim, Zion, and many others. Under its main name, Jerusalem is mentioned 820 times in the old and New Testaments! (For comparison: Hebron-78 times, Beit El-69, Shiloh – 40).Various hypotheses have been made about the origin of the city's name. ""Yerushalem"" is divided into two words: ""IR"" (or ""ieru"") and ""Shalem"". ""Ieru"" may be derived from the verb ""to see"". ""Shalem"" in Hebrew means ""whole"", ""self-sufficient"". Another version of ""Jerusha"" - inheritance, ""El"" - B-g – ""inheritance of G-d"" is also common» The capture of Jerusalem was carried out by David apparently in 1002 BC by his own retinue without the help of a tribal militia, which provided the captured city with the status of Royal property. Having taken possession of the city and successfully defended it from the attacks of the Philistines, David could rightfully call it IR David – the city of David and move to it from Hebron the capital of the United Kingdom.And most importantly, David founded the dynasty of Israel's kings – from now on, the true king of Israel must be from the house of David, i.e., be his descendant. By moving the Ark of the Covenant to the city, David also made Jerusalem the religious center of the Kingdom of Israel. In Jerusalem, as we know from the Bible, on mount Moriah, Abraham had to sacrifice Isaac, his long-awaited son – this circumstance could not but affect the choice of David, known for his spirituality.But David could not build a Temple – he is not the right person for this mission. He can choose a place for a Temple, create a plan, and raise funds to build it, but he is denied the honor of erecting such a sacred building, because ""he has shed much blood and waged great wars."" His son, Solomon, the wisest of men, must build the Temple. And he builds it in a Holy place on mount Moriah. The temple became the only sanctuary for the entire country – from now on, all the sacrifices in Israel and Judea were offered only in one place – the capital of the Davidic dynasty. It was an amazing move, uniting the people politically and religiously. The construction of the Temple fully established the authority of the Cohen priests who performed services and the Levites who guarded the Holy place. The post of high priest remained one of the key positions in the politics of ancient Israel. The time of Solomon's reign was a Golden time for the Kingdom. The wisdom of Solomon became a byword, and about his masculine strength there were legends-Solomon had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. But after his death, the United Kingdom was divided into two warring halves: Israel and Judah.Israel United 10 tribes, and Judah two-Judah and Benjamin. In 723 BC, the Kingdom of Israel was invaded by Assyria; most of its population was taken captive and settled in small groups in various areas of this vast power. This is how the first Jewish Diaspora began - these 10 tribes are considered lost. But Judea, with its capital in Jerusalem, continued to exist until 586 BC, when the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the first Temple on 9 AB and took the Jews into Babylonian slavery.But after 70 years, a Second Temple was built - by Jews who returned from Babylonian captivity after the permission of the Persian king Cyrus. Jerusalem again becomes the ideological and religious center of the Jews, their stronghold and pride. The Kingdom of Israel is captured by Alexander the great, then there was a short period of rule of the Hasmonean Jewish dynasty. The Hasmonean dynasty ruled Judea for more than a century (from 164 to 63 BC), the last period in history when the state was ruled by a Jewish dynasty.From 63 BC, Judea became a vassal of Rome, and in 40 BC it was divided into Judea, Samaria, Galilee, and Perea (Zaiordanye). The Temple, and Jerusalem itself, reached its peak of beauty in the time of king Herod. Despite their violent activities, Herod did not enjoy the support of the people. He was not of the house of David, and, as we have already said, the true king of Israel should only be of the house of David!Discontent with his brutal rule is brewing among the people, and, as a result, the rapid growth of Messianic sentiments – the Messiah must come and deliver the people from the hated foreign rule. The Messianic movement reached its apogee at the turn of our era… Jesus of Nazareth-everyone knows that. We will talk about him, his time and his deeds in more detail on our tour later, but for now we will return to the history.As Jesus predicted, the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 ad by the Romans and has not been rebuilt since. It was destroyed on the same day – 9 AV. This day is still celebrated throughout the Jewish world by fasting... mourning for the Temple. After the destruction of the Temple, 1940 years passed. Let us now recall these years of estrangement. In the history of the city, they are divided into 5 main periods. for convenience, we will round up some numbers: Roman-Byzantine period-more than 500 years. Metropolis-Roman, then Byzantine Empire. Muslim Arab period-about 500 years. The main metropolis is the Caliphate of Baghdad. The Christian period of about 200 years. Semi-independent Principality of the crusaders. Muslim Mameluke period-about 300 years. Metropolis-Egypt. Muslim Ottoman period-about 400 years. The Metropolis Of Turkey. The secret of the longevity of Jerusalem, its extraordinary resilience on the steepest turns of history, probably lies in the fact that it had the amazing fate to embody the spiritual aspirations of almost half of humanity. Everyone who comes to this city experiences its extraordinary aura; the believer consciously surrenders to the charms of the Holy City, the non-religious person is amazed at the almost physical contact with the flow of history, with its myths, which in Jerusalem become a living reality.​ It is very easy to fall in love with Jerusalem. If you trust the city and let it lead you through its tangled streets, you are guaranteed an unforgettable experience."
3,The Best Times For Safari In Kenya,travel-leisure," Here is a brief outlook at how the seasons affect the best times for safari in Kenya. Each month is different in terms of the best time to visit Kenya. We have different tastes, different ideas of how we love to travel. Here is how the year turns out in terms of doing safaris in Kenya all the year round. The best times will depend on what works best for you safari holiday, and what time you can actually get time to enjoy it. Other factors to consider are the budgets involved and how deep you want to dip in your pockets. January to February, dry and dusty January is a dry month, it is a great time to do safari in Kenya. This period continues through February to March.  Most of the parks are relatively dry, but it is good to note that seasons have shifted from the normal we know due to the effects of global warming. Abundant wildlife can viewed with ease mainly because the glass and other fauna are usually shorter awaiting the long rains. It is a time that has more travelers too. The hotels have more occupancy at that time. Due to the abundance of wildlife, it is one of the best times to safari in Kenya. March, Month on the edge Although March is on the edge, it is a wonderful time to do Kenya safari.  Rains can sometimes start in mid-march toward the end of the month. All in all, the first showers reduce the dust and in the same process turn the short grass into luster green carpet. The short green grass is very good source of proteins for the small sized antelopes like the impalas, gazelles, dik diks and other smaller antelopes.  These grass plains are great for the preying animals like the cheetah and leopards.  The cheetah prefers the open grasslands and if grass is shorter, the better. There are fewer travelers, which make it great time because of the quietness and less vehicles in the parks or at sightings. It can sometimes be really rainy, but not as much as in April. April-May, wet and muddy This is a time that most would avoid to do safari in Kenya. It is the heavy rain season, and it can get really murky. It is a time that the rivers really get full to the brim. Most game drives are done only along the main roads. The smaller game routes are to be avoided completely. Fewer and fewer travelers venture into the adventures in the muddy terrains. Now, the best part is that it is the cheapest season throughout the year. This is because the rains stop safari goers from going to Kenya and many would prefer to wait till the next months. June, the month of expectation In June, mostly the heavy rains have stopped or subsided, but drivers need to be careful because the drifts along game drive routes could still be muddy. Besides, sometimes the grass is so high such that it can be hard to make proper judgement as you can’t see far. It is one of the most beautiful periods with all the green around you. It is slightly harder to sport the cats because of the vegetation, even though you know they are there. Early morning drives comes in handy as cats prefer being on the roads to avoid getting wet from the dew. Still, there are fewer clients meaning fewer game vehicles in the field. Towards the end of June, sometimes it gets busy, but not as much as in the following month of July. July- August, People migration and one of the best time to visit Kenya This is mainly the best time for safari. This is because of the wildebeest migration. It important to note that sometimes the migration starts in mid-June, and can be late as mid-July. We have seen several instances where this scenario has repeated itself. But it is guaranteed that in mid-July, the migration is already in Masai mara, making it the best time to safari in Kenya.  Every sighting in the field, there are many tour vehicles, tourists trying to get glimpse or best shots of whatever is being watched. The hotels are usually very busy too.  These months coincide also with school holidays worldwide, giving parents ample time for family time out. September, time for the migration dust to settle As the migration starts to head back to Tanzania, so do the people-migration start reducing. September has much less travelers all over the country. The season slowly starts to go down, even though the wildebeests are still there in the Mara. All other parks have much less safari goers. This is usually a great time because the masses have already left and kids heading back to school. It is one of the shoulder seasons to take advantage of. October-November, shoulder season Shoulder season. One of the best time for safari in Kenya. It is relatively quiet all over, from the parks to the hotels. Being shoulder season, hotels register about 20-40% capacity. Take advantage of the shoulder season if you are tight on the budget. December, time to wind up the year, and one of the best time to visit Kenya December comes with several Kenyan holidays including Independence Day. Then Christmas holidays come in, followed by Boxing Day. At the End of the month comes the New Year. From mid-December, it is a high season and there are many travelers coming in for Christmas holiday safaris in Kenya. The prices change drastically in the hotels, so plan accordingly. Wildlife is abundant and can be viewed with relative ease. ."
4,What Visa to Issue for a Foreigner for a Short Trip to Russia?,travel-leisure," According to the Russian Federation regulation, foreign citizens going to visit the territory of Russia must have a travel document – a visa. This does not apply to the citizens of those countries with which the Russian Federation has an agreement on visa-free regime. The visa allows one to move freely across Russia during the period of visa`s validity. Many foreign citizens planning to come to Russia for a couple of weeks want not only to see the sights, but also to visit their relatives, friends or significant ones. For such occasions, one of the options may be to issue a private or guest visa. However, not everyone knows that this is a long and complex process. A citizen of the Russian Federation must apply to the Federal Migration Service (FMS) at the place of registration with a request to issue an invitation for a foreign citizen to enter the Russian Federation with a private visa. They must also provide proof of their financial status and pay a fee. The process can last for a whole month and not always be decided in favor of a foreign guest. However, there is an alternative and much easier way to visit Russia – get a tourist visa. It is intended for short trips for the purpose of tourism and allows a foreign citizen to stay in Russia for up to 30 days, with a single or double entry. Its obtaining does not require any complex manipulations or steps. The main document for obtaining this visa will be a tourist invitation. It consists of a voucher and confirmation of the reception of a foreign tourist. Any travel company that is officially licensed and registered in the Unified Register of Tour Operators, can issue it. The process does not take much time. One needs to fill out the application form and indicate all the necessary information. Usually it is citizenship, name, date of birth, and data about the future trip – dates of entry and exit, cities to visit and address to stay. After filling out the application, the ready document is sent automatically to one`s email address. In addition to a tourist invitation to apply to the Consulate for a visa, one will need: a passport, recent color photos 3,5x4,5, medical insurance, and a completed visa application form. For any additional documents that may be asked for, it is better to clarify at the Consulate in advance. Usually it takes no more than 14 days for the Consulate to issue a tourist visa."

6,Traveler's Guide to Rome,travel-leisure," One of the most beautiful areas in the world. Whether you’re going to hire a Rome travel guide or not you’ll experience the very cradle of human civilization, its many landmarks are a joy for the eyes to behold. The Eternal City remains unrivaled when it comes to the sheer aesthetic supremacy of its antique structures and its impressive, widely-venerated history. It doesn’t come as a surprise then that Rome has claimed the #2 spot on the top travel destinations in the world. With a climate mild and rainy in winter rather than full of snow, many find Rome the perfect place to vacation during any time of year. If you aren’t one for weather, the history will definitely appall you. You do not need a Visa if you’re only staying for 90 days or less. Experts recommend visiting Rome in the off-peak months between October and March to avoid the summer rush. During the summer it gets crowded and the prices go up. If you can, try to    book a hotel near or within the centro storico or historic district. Today I will be your travel guide. Be sure to make a list of locations you intend to visit within Rome beforehand to save you time and money. The public transportation can be iffy at times, but still reliable. Private tours are a great way to get around and at the same time soak up the local culture. Another great way to economize is by taking the TramBus system, that goes around the city and provides a fascinating tour of Romes neighborhoods. Also, don’t forge to think about ticket cost along with how you get there. But don’t worry we got you covered in a later section. The Coliseum is probably, next to the Vatican, next to the Parthenon, next to the Sistine Chapel, next to the Roman Forum; the best structure to visit in the city.(I just can’t pick one, LOL!) Your transit can tour the premises or you on your own or join those conducted every hour by guides dressed as Gladiators. Operating hours vary throughout the year, so you will want to call in advance if at all possible. But if you want to see something massive, visit the Circus Maximus. The Roma Pass is another part of Rome’s public transportation system, we’ll talk about it later but keep an eye out for it. As we discussed buses may be a more affordable option, and you can get closer to the culture, you might want to try them for our next stops. Check out the civic center of Ancient Rome where political, religious, and economic activities took place. Many of its columns remain standing among the ruins even after 2000 years, displaying the intricacies of Roman architecture. The Forum started out as a patch of grass between hills where politicians, philosophers, and alike met and discussed. But with many things in Rome, it evolved into a beautiful display of ancient sculpting and craftsman ship. The enormous arches and never-ending halls put you in a olive oil fussed daze. In between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, the nature itself is awe-insipiring. Admission is free, opens at 9 am and closes an hour before sunset. If you want, you can spend a little more to get a personalized guided tour complete with audio pedestals where you can learn more. One of the most popular spots to visit in Rome is, of course, the Vatican. In addition to its religious importance, the Vatican has a fine collection of sculptures, paintings, books, and many other artifacts that chronicle the Catholic Churchs history. You can view St. Peters Basilica, marvel at Michelangelos Pieta, its detailed masonry, or the papal catacombs. Move on to the Vatican Museum where even more magnificent antiquities are housed, not the least of that are Egyptian mummies from B.C. era. The Vatican as many know is the smallest country in the world, city right inside Rome. jason swaby If pressed for time, skip everything else and proceed to the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo, primarily, was known as an excellent sculptor so when Pope Julius II commissioned him to paint the Bible on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, he thought it was a ploy by his rivals who thought Michelangelo, not being a full-on painter, would yield mediocrity and embarrass himself. Of course, we all know it didn’t quite turn out that way. In fact, the Sistine Chapel is probably the most recognized piece of work from the Renaissance period. 7.The Circus Maximus The Circus Maximus was a valley between the Aventine and Palatine hills, used as a chariot racing stadium by the Romans during ancient times. When it was originally used it was mere dirt and stone, but as time passed and it became a popular spectacle to see they build a wooden, and eventually stone stadium. At it’s height, it could seat 200,00 occupants which was simply ahead of its time, and still a marvel to this day. It’s dimensions are a staggering 550 meters long, by 80 meter wide.  During the fire that wiped out three fourth’s of Rome’s population this was the only form of entertainment and was enjoyed by everyone. This stadium is often called the Coliseum’s true BIG brother. It was the largest architectural structure of ancient Rome.  You have to see it for yourself to believe it, its even more remarkable thinking about when it was built. One of the most famous aqueducts of all time, Parco degli Acquedotti is also a must stop any tourist bus.  Many locals advice tourists to take a bike ride through and enjoy the scenery. the bike ride will work up an appetite so don’t forget to bring snacks for a pick nick. While eating take some time to check out the large pillars and broken down structures, try to imagine yourself there in ancient Rome, when the pillars would all have been standing. That would be a site to see. The large one hundred meter high trees and kilometres of open grass remind you, you’re with nature. Roma Pass This next one is less of a place to go and more of a must have. The Roma Pass has two main options, The Roma Pass 48 Hour, and The Roma Pass.

9,25 Africa safari myths and misconceptions,travel-leisure," While there are some places that are hot like Ethiopia, Botswana and others like Mali, it will be wrong generalizing Africa as a hot continent. The equator divides Africa into two and cuts across Kenya, Uganda, Congo and other countries. All the countries touched have equatorial climate that have almost similar temperature ranges all year round. These temperatures are very comfortable and far from the purported hot. This is should not stop anyone from enjoying a safari in Kenya. The wildlife habitats and sanctuaries in Kenya are not the same. Each ecological system is totally different from each other. For example Masai mara in Kenya is totally different from Samburu national reserve. The animals are totally different species too. While in other parks you would see the masai giraffe, in Samburu you meet the beautiful reticulated giraffe. And this is a totally different species that cannot interbreed with the Masai giraffe. Their habitats are also different and very interesting. This is one of the most exaggerated facts about Africa. While the past hasn’t favoured the image of Africa, it is today a place you can visit comfortably. Like everywhere else in the world, common sense applies and that means it is always good to seek advice from the locals about where safety is an issue. Travelling at night is not recommended, or walking in dark alleys at night. Night life in the big towns is relatively active, but always consult with your agent about what and what not to do. The worst you can do is to not consult. We have seen acts of terrorism in the whole world, and Africa should not be judged based on that. Another grossly misconceived fact. The truth of the matter is that African has many natural bugs. What is exaggerated is that the bugs are all over. That you turn this way and you meet thousands or hundreds of bugs, so untrue. There are bugs, yes. Are they everywhere?  No. In the natural areas, the parks and reserves, expect to see some insects and different types of flies that are part of the natural ecology. Without them, there would a deficit in the natural balance. What is important to note is that most of them are not dangerous at all. But if you afraid of bugs or allergic to some like bees, some repellent would do. But do not exaggerate the use of these chemicals either. At night you hear lots of insects busy going about their business and this adds to the natural African sound. I have done many safaris with children. I love to teach children about nature.  I have had many questions about coming with children to Africa. There seems to be a huge misconception about taking children to Africa. You should not let this dissuade you from enjoying a safari with your children to Africa. Let the children see the animals in their natural habitat and learn a thing or two about them and about their conservation. That way we create a future generation of friends of nature, who will be the tomorrow’s’ conservationists. But apart from that, let children enjoy being out in the wilds. Consult your Kenya safari travel agent to have your trip specifically crafted such that you will have an itinerary tailor-made to fit the ages of your children. It is with good reason to fear the animals. After all they are wild animals unlike the beloved pets, cats and dogs we have at home. Some of them like the elephants are massive, and playing with such strength is stupidity of the highest order. There have been a few cases of animals attacking people, but what we need to remember is that animals do not attack anyhow. Unless their paths have been crossed and their safety grounds disturbed, they never attack you. They are not wanton killers. We make sure that the animals are respected and keeping enough distance when viewing them. Not because they might attack, but because it is the right thing to do, to respect them, and not to allow any off-road driving. You would expect anyone coming to your home to respect you, and same case should apply here. Expensive is a relative term….let me explain in very simple terms. When you travel in first class, and I travel in third class, we eventually get to the same destination. Right? Thank you. It isn’t the same case here though. Depending on your budget, you can find a service that fits your pocket. With some patience and consultation, you will eventually land a safari that is affordable. Take time; evaluate the lodges given in your itinerary, read review until you are finally comfortable. Just because your friend or work mate did a million-dollar trip doesn’t mean you do it the same way when you can’t afford it. But be careful when you go too on the budget. There are some figures that will not change for example park fees, which is a government fee whether you are in a 6-star boutique camp or budget camping.  Remember, whether in a 5-star lodge or 1-star hotel, we could be watching the same lions at the sightings. So don’t let budget limit you from enjoying nature, especially when it is the one thing you love. Safari is not about the big five. Should I add ‘only’? No… Many firms advertise safaris with the big five in mind. In return you want to come and see the big five. Sure, they are interesting but these are a tiny portion of the animals available in the Kenya safari reserves and parks. In fact they are such a tiny fraction as much as they are hyped. They are great on camera and woows the adventure, but there couldn’t be those animals if what is around them isn’t there. For example leopards and cheetahs would not be there if the small antelopes were not there. It is important to see beyond the big five and understand the natural balance that makes up the ecological system complete, thereby making your Kenya safari much more of a memorable adventure. Roughing it is just one of the ways of enjoying your Kenya safari. Just the same way that some like drinking coffee while others prefer tea, the way you enjoy your safari holiday depends on your style of doing it and your budget. You can choose from a variety of camps and lodges and enjoy your safari your way. While camping or roughing it up has its own advantages, it doesn’t have to be it to make your adventure a real one. However you choose to enjoy your trip, at the end the day what matters is you enjoy your holiday, enjoy nature with your loved ones, whether in five star lodges or camping Who said? Many previous adventurous have written a lot about safaris in Africa. They were not wrong. But what most have written about is their personal experiences. You will agree me that one time safari to Kenya doesn’t make you the greatest expert about Africa. But that doesn’t make the opinion wrong: it simply is one person’s opinion from the experience. Safaris are not for hardened travellers alone. On the contrary, there are many safaris that very comfortably arranged and even avoiding extraneous drives or long hours. You don’t need to do your game drives like filming for the national geographic. Have your safari custom-made, and work with a company that give you flexible game drive hours so that you can have the maximum adventure without overdoing the drives. And above all, you don’t need to mark everything as ‘seen’ to make your Kenya safari complete. How children enjoy nature depends sometimes on how we as parents do enjoy nature. They don’t necessarily have to love nature as much as we do. But what we can do is teach them to appreciate nature and all what is in it. Bring your children for safari and work with a company that encourages children to be taught about nature. It doesn’t have to be boring for them. Have your itinerary crafted in a way that fun time is mixed with the game drives. Fun-filled nature-like classes, both in the hotel ground and in the vehicle during game drives, and it will not be boring for them. Unless you are planning to join the national geographic crew or Jonathan Scot, you don’t need to go crazy buying those huge lenses that you would barely know how to use. If you have to, buy or borrow a simple camera and practice a little bit how to balance the lights, light angles and all those combinations that make a great photo composition. Don’t expect to shoot award-winning photos without some practice. Furthermore, todays mobile phones come with relative advance camera parameters that you can actually use to capture those memories. A great camera isn’t a necessity at all, what is necessary is the right mind set to go out and enjoy a great holiday. Besides, who said you must take photos? Some of the most lasting memories are the ones in our minds, and most of the times, it is what you will remember. And those are stories we tell, as we remember them. A safari can range from a half in Nairobi National park or 20 days all over Kenya. There is no limit to how many days you can do a safari. It doesn’t have to be many days as many have stated. What is agree is the fact that to experience much, yes do need a couple of days, but there’s no limit to the number of days. It will be wrong to feel under pressure just because someone else did 12 days, yet you can afford time for 2-3 days. You will still have a great adventure and enjoy the beauty of nature. The fact is, it is recommended to take a guide, especially if it is your first time. To have a feel of it, it is great to move around with someone who has knowledge of the place especially with in the reserves. Some parks are manageable without a guide, especially Kenya wildlife service managed parks. This is mainly because the tracks are marked and you can always read the sign posts and be directed where you are want to go. Off course you may get lost here and there, but eventually the signs will guide you. The reserves are a completely different thing. The tracks are not marked and in some places like Masai Mara, there happens to be too many tracks. But if you have great sense of direction, you can manage and always ask other safari drivers and they will help you out. Basically, you don’t necessarily need a guide, but it is highly recommended for first timers, even if it is for a day. I have seen many a times communications to the effect that it is a one-time experience. How so untrue…. It is an experience that is actually fun-filled and very educative. More than 30% of the safaris that I do are actually repeat clients. And this is actually a way of life especially for nature enthusiasts. It is not a one-time experience as many have put it. Nature has no end, the more you travel, the more you love. And if you crazy about that wild wild thing, you will be at home in the wilds of Kenya, because no matter how many times you do it, you will never get enough of it. That is what it looks like for a person seeing it for the first time. The two males intertwine their necks almost in a synchronised movement. To a keen first timer, you will notice that it is actually beyond romantic movements. Besides that, it is two males, so it can’t be romantic after all. These intertwining moves are actually a fight that sometimes can be so intense and may even kill each other or one of them. So next time you see those two giraffes, it is mostly a fight that is sometimes seen next to a female in season. This is one of the most common myths that almost all safari goers believe. It is a myth that is so famous that it is almost believable. The truth of the matter is that these ugly looking creatures are so advanced in their survival tactics and very capable of making their own kills. And they do these quiet often. Their position in the balance of the ecosystem is so important such that at of the day, you get to see a very complicated survivor, who is capable of making their own kills, despite what myths revolve around them. The reality on the ground is totally different. Males are such good hunters despite the myths. Whether in the pride or lone rangers, they do hunt and pounce on any opportunity that presents itself. For example, during the migration, the wildebeests roam almost everywhere; the males grab the opportunity and grab them anyhow, sometimes without eating much. In addition, when the young males are kicked away from the pride their father, they have to survive on their own and making own kills. So they have to sharpen their skills of hunting for them to survive. By the time they manage to have their own prides, they are already good hunters. Since my childhood, I have been hearing this myth many times and I grew up know that porcupines are one species that I was not to play around with. There are so many African myths that were meant to make children be afraid and refrain from doing some things. Porcupines never shoot their quills; they only make it harder for the prey to hunt it when they roll into a protective ball. When you hear the word Africa mentioned, what comes to mind? The continent Africa has been related to dirty and disease infested black continent. While this was probably true decades back especially the disease part, today the continent has some of the most beautiful clean places in the world. Yes there are some places that could do with some face lift and cleaning, but let’s not exaggerate about the dirt and diseases that have been associated with Africa.  A lot has been done over the years and the health sector greatly improved. In fact, in Kenya you get world-class hospitals. Africa has now some of the most advanced technical advancement rate than many developed countries. What is happening now is that Africa and Kenya especially is actually jumping the learning curve that many western countries went through. Institutions of higher learning have advanced so much such that today we have very advanced technicians in all almost all corners of Africa. Kenya has taken so many steps in this direction and has seen the country supplying manpower to other African countries. Don’t come to Africa expecting find a dark continent, you will be in for a big surprise. If it is just arranging for your flight, go ahead and do it. When it comes to combining the components of what comprise of your safari, you are better off in the hands of a local experienced agent or operator. Your best gamble is with the ground operators who have knowledge of which lodge does what or where it is located in the reserves and parks. They know the quality too of these properties and in addition, they know the best guides. Besides, you can share your ideas of what you want or how you want to do your Kenya safari and the itinerary will be crafted for you. You will receive, review it until you are satisfied that that is what you want to do. And if something goes wrong, you have the agent for solution. It doesn’t matter what kind of clothes you wear on safari. What is important is you dress comfortably and according to the weather. Early in the morning, it is sometimes chilly, but by the time it is 7.30am, it already starts to be comfortably warm. Long sleeved light clothing is great for the morning, but not winter clothing. It is good to note that some codes of dressings could be frowned at, for example too short skirts. While minding the weather, it is also good to mind the people especially where communities don’t like body parts exposed. You do not need khaki clothing for your Kenya safari, just be comfortable in your dressing. Africa is not a country. It is a continent with 54 fully independent countries. Having been to one African country, don’t assume you have seen it all. Each country is totally different from each other, and with different traditions, ways of life and even governance. In addition, some are coastal desert like Namibia, while others are ever green tropical regions like Uganda. Many people before travel think that Africa is one big country, and nothing could be so far from the truth. If you ever pay to go and pet animals in any African country in the name of conservation, think again. The fact that you are already patting them should tell you that something is already grossly wrong. Wild animals are never meant to be pets to be patted. The animal that you will be patting must have undergone something drastic in its life for it to change from a wild animal to animal that accepts patting. Do not confuse patting them to conserving them."

More than 30% of the safaris that I do are actually repeat clients. And this is actually a way of life especially for nature enthusiasts. It is not a one-time experience as many have put it. Nature has no end, the more you travel, the more you love. And if you crazy about that wild wild thing, you will be at home in the wilds of Kenya, because no matter how many times you do it, you will never get enough of it. That is what it looks like for a person seeing it for the first time. The two males intertwine their necks almost in a synchronised movement. To a keen first timer, you will notice that it is actually beyond romantic movements. Besides that, it is two males, so it can’t be romantic after all. These intertwining moves are actually a fight that sometimes can be so intense and may even kill each other or one of them. So next time you see those two giraffes, it is mostly a fight that is sometimes seen next to a female in season. This is one of the most common myths that almost all safari goers believe. It is a myth that is so famous that it is almost believable. The truth of the matter is that these ugly looking creatures are so advanced in their survival tactics and very capable of making their own kills. And they do these quiet often. Their position in the balance of the ecosystem is so important such that at of the day, you get to see a very complicated survivor, who is capable of making their own kills, despite what myths revolve around them. The reality on the ground is totally different. Males are such good hunters despite the myths. Whether in the pride or lone rangers, they do hunt and pounce on any opportunity that presents itself. For example, during the migration, the wildebeests roam almost everywhere; the males grab the opportunity and grab them anyhow, sometimes without eating much. In addition, when the young males are kicked away from the pride their father, they have to survive on their own and making own kills. So they have to sharpen their skills of hunting for them to survive. By the time they manage to have their own prides, they are already good hunters. Since my childhood, I have been hearing this myth many times and I grew up know that porcupines are one species that I was not to play around with. There are so many African myths that were meant to make children be afraid and refrain from doing some things. Porcupines never shoot their quills; they only make it harder for the prey to hunt it when they roll into a protective ball. When you hear the word Africa mentioned, what comes to mind? The continent Africa has been related to dirty and disease infested black continent. While this was probably true decades back especially the disease part, today the continent has some of the most beautiful clean places in the world. Yes there are some places that could do with some face lift and cleaning, but let’s not exaggerate about the dirt and diseases that have been associated with Africa.  A lot has been done over the years and the health sector greatly improved. In fact, in Kenya you get world-class hospitals. Africa has now some of the most advanced technical advancement rate than many developed countries. What is happening now is that Africa and Kenya especially is actually jumping the learning curve that many western countries went through. Institutions of higher learning have advanced so much such that today we have very advanced technicians in all almost all corners of Africa. Kenya has taken so many steps in this direction and has seen the country supplying manpower to other African countries. Don’t come to Africa expecting find a dark continent, you will be in for a big surprise. If it is just arranging for your flight, go ahead and do it. When it comes to combining the components of what comprise of your safari, you are better off in the hands of a local experienced agent or operator. Your best gamble is with the ground operators who have knowledge of which lodge does what or where it is located in the reserves and parks. They know the quality too of these properties and in addition, they know the best guides. Besides, you can share your ideas of what you want or how you want to do your Kenya safari and the itinerary will be crafted for you. You will receive, review it until you are satisfied that that is what you want to do. And if something goes wrong, you have the agent for solution. It doesn’t matter what kind of clothes you wear on safari. What is important is you dress comfortably and according to the weather. Early in the morning, it is sometimes chilly, but by the time it is 7.30am, it already starts to be comfortably warm. Long sleeved light clothing is great for the morning, but not winter clothing. It is good to note that some codes of dressings could be frowned at, for example too short skirts. While minding the weather, it is also good to mind the people especially where communities don’t like body parts exposed. You do not need khaki clothing for your Kenya safari, just be comfortable in your dressing. Africa is not a country. It is a continent with 54 fully independent countries. Having been to one African country, don’t assume you have seen it all. Each country is totally different from each other, and with different traditions, ways of life and even governance. In addition, some are coastal desert like Namibia, while others are ever green tropical regions like Uganda. Many people before travel think that Africa is one big country, and nothing could be so far from the truth. If you ever pay to go and pet animals in any African country in the name of conservation, think again. The fact that you are already patting them should tell you that something is already grossly wrong. Wild animals are never meant to be pets to be patted. The animal that you will be patting must have undergone something drastic in its life for it to change from a wild animal to animal that accepts patting. Do not confuse patting them to conserving them."
11,Why Should you Travel to France,travel-leisure," Why travel to France? Can we travel to France and take an exotic trip? Before starting my crossing of France on foot, I had the intuition but I didn't imagine how this trip to France would be the most beautiful of all my trips. Here are the 6 good reasons to visit France and some ideas for getaways for a weekend or more to discover its regions. For years, France has been the world's leading tourist destination. People envy the Eiffel Tower, Mont-Saint-Michel, and the Loire castles. They come to ski in the Alps, bask in the beaches of the Côte-d'Azur, taste the French art of living ... Everything the world envies is there, right before our eyes. It would still be a shame not to take advantage of it, right? Take an exotic trip to France! Of course, it is possible! You can find everything in France. Reliefs worthy of the Mongolian steppes (welcome in Cézallier), valleys drowned in thicker fog than in Scotland (welcome in Creuse), forests as far as the eye can see with the false air of Canada (welcome in Morvan), d 'ancient volcanoes, some high peaks, islands, turquoise blue waters ... On the choice side, there is only the embarrassment! Discovering the gastronomy of a country, for me, is one of the most joyful aspects of the trip. As such, a stay in France is an absolute must. Local products, regional specialties, local wines and barrels, alcohol from behind the fagots ... We rediscover the iraty ossau in the Basque Country, the Armagnac in the Gers, we are surprised to love the farçou and to take apple cake of land… Shopping has never been so pleasant. For the balance, exercise! The hiking trails are made for that ... More than 60,000 kilometers of hiking crisscross the French countryside and mountains. Some such as the GR20 (the great crossing of Corsica), the GR10 (the great crossing of the Pyrenees) or the GR65 (the Camino de Santiago de Compostela from Puy-en-Velay) have gained international renown. Others, more confidential, allow you to discover the regions of France on foot by following marked and maintained routes. By the day or over several weeks, hiking is one of the best ways to travel in France in immersion and closer to the territories. Maintaining a friendship thousands of miles away? Personally, I never succeeded. Distance is the tragedy of all friendships linked to the other side of the world. In France, on the contrary, your new friends are within the train or car range. For a weekend and a country getaway, you’re back together to pick up the thread of your discussions. Thanks to my trip to France, my circle of friends has grown and I hope to be able to cultivate these new friendships for a long time. Speaking a foreign language can be part of the charm of the trip. There’s something fun about being understood by gestures or drawing when you don’t have any other language. But when it comes to expressing specific ideas, having a real conversation with nuances, or - worse - humor, language quickly becomes a barrier. Spending your holidays in France allows you to stay within the same language community without restricting points of view. Viewed from Occitania, Brittany, the Alps or Provence, France offers different visions. With the added bonus of the flavor of the accents and the different expressions specific to each region."
12,What Makes a Good All Around Stand Up Paddle Board?,travel-leisure," The sport of stand-up paddle boarding offers something for everyone. Whether you're a man, woman, teenager, or a small child, getting out on the water on a SUP is tons of fun. The problem is that paddle boards are generally very large and often expensive. Because of this it is difficult to purchase one paddle board for everyone in the family. So, what can you do? Well, you can get a paddle board that is good for just about everyone. You can purchase an all-around paddle board. An all around paddle board is going to be good for most water conditions and most people. That way you can get one board to leave at the beach house or the lake house and everyone can use it. That is the advantage of getting a paddle board that is suited for generally all conditions. Rigid vs. Inflatable SUP One of the first questions you're going to need to answer when looking for an all-around board is if you should purchase a rigid or solid paddle board, or if you should purchase an inflatable SUP. Some of the advantages of a solid or rigid SUP are performance and stability. Solid paddle boards are in a large variety of different shapes and sizes, kind of like traditional surfboards. There are many different molds to choose from. Due to the materials used to construct a rigid paddle board they have a more stable feel, especially if you are surfing even very small waves.  Solid boards are generally not as thick as inflatables and they have no flex to them thus making them more stable on the water. Of course, the downside of a rigid paddle board is storage. They take up a lot of room and you have to find a dedicated place where you can keep the board away from the elements in a cool dry place. And inflatable SUP simply has less restrictions to it than a rigid. Inflatables are great if you don't have storage space, because they can deflate and then roll up into something as small as the size of a backpack. If you are traveling to the beach, then an inflatable is just about the only way to go.  A solid paddle board is just too difficult to strap to the top of your car and drive for a few hours to get to the beach. If you are planning on paddling on a river that has even a little bit of white water rapids, then your only choice is an inflatable. You would never want to take a solid paddle board on a river with the possibility of bumping onto rocks and damaging you're bored. Whereas an inflatable can just simply bounce off of the obstacles and rocks. Basically, most people choose an inflatable paddle board over a rigid as the choice for the best all-around for adoption. Other Considerations Weight of the Board: If you want a board that is going to be fun to use for the most amount of people you're going to have to consider the weight of the board. Obviously, a solid paddle board is going to weigh more than an inflatable. and the larger the board is the heavier it will be, for instance a 12-foot board is going to be heavier than a 10-foot board, because there's simply more material to it. This is another reason that inflatable paddle boards are often the better choice over rigids for a paddle board that will suit everybody's needs.  Kids, teenagers, women, and men all have the strength to carry and pilot an inflatable board. Board Length Another important consideration when choosing an all-around SUP is the length of the board. Why does this matter? Well, the length of the board determines what types of conditions the board was created to be used for. Short: Under 10 ft long is considered short for a paddleboard. Boards of this length are usually better for surfing and also for kids to use. Medium: The medium is usually the best length for a SUP.  Medium size would be in the 10 to 12 ft long range this range is going to be the best for an all-around board that everyone can use. Long: A longboard would be something in the 12 to 14 ft range a 14ft is a very long length for a paddleboard. Something this long is purpose-built for either long touring or racing type of vents, generally not great for all-around purposes. Width: the last thing to consider is the width of a board. Paddle boards can range anywhere from 25 in to 36 in wide. It is no surprise that the ideal width for all-around purposes is a board in the 30 to 32 inches wide range. This is also the range that the vast majority of inflatable paddle boards fall into. Thickness of the SUP: You will also want to consider the thickness of the board. Solid or rigid boards will have a thinner profile because of the materials it is constructed with. Inflatables are usually thicker than rigids. Inflatables are usually in the 4 to 6 inches thick range. The benefit of a thicker board is that you are higher up off the water so small waves would generally not reach the top of the board. A thicker inflatable board will also be good for things like SUP yoga. That is the trade-off. A rigid will be easier to use for most people than an inflatable in terms of the thickness of the board. Now you know what to look for when you are deciding what type of SUP to get. The best all around SUP is going to be one that has the most benefits for the most amount of people. Most people will choose an inflatable SUP that is medium in length which can be used by just about all of your family members."
13,Exploring More Botanical Gardens Located in the United States,travel-leisure," In almost every state in the United States of America, you can find a Botanical Garden to visit. These gardens are full of a vast variety of plants, flowers, vegetables, fruits and herbs. Many are beautifully ornamented acres of land to stimulate every sense. Some of the gardens we have already discovered include: Missouri, Chicago, New York and Atlanta.  Today we are going to see what San Francisco and United States Botanical Garden in D.C. have to offer. San Francisco Botanical Garden spans a vast 55 acres of extraordinary beauty which showcases over 9,000 different kinds of plants from all over the world. There is a nominal fee to get in, but the garden has reopened since the Corona virus shut them down. For the summer months of June-August you will find several plants highlighted.  For example, in June, the candelabra tree which is a critically endangered conifer tree from South America is the primary focus. It resembles an evergreen tree and is evidenced to have been around for close to 200 million years. Due to extensive logging of this rare tree, it has become even more endangered. It also produces edible seeds that are so desirable that they are usually eaten before they can be dispersed and create new trees. In the month of July, the Holmholtzia glaberrima is in the spotlight.  This beautiful flowering plant is also called the stream-lily or flax-lilly. It sports large panicles of white or pink flowers and only grows one seed leaf and is usually found in Australia, New Guinea and South Wales. August cameos the Aloe polyphylla, also called the Spiral aloe. The Aloe polyphylla was first gathered in 1915 by western botanists and was not formally described until 1934 by a South African botanist. The beautiful spiral looking growth structure of this plant has made it very desirable, which in turn has put it in the threat of being over harvested; adding to its rarity. The United States Botanical Garden located in D.C. is closed at the moment due to Covid-19. It is planning to reopen and reschedule events and programs that have not been able to take place during this time. They are offering some virtual programs such as cooking demos and online yoga classes. There are many mini gardens inside the space including the beautiful Conservatory, the National Garden and Bartholdi Park. The Conservatory contains the Garden Court; offering beautiful flowers, foliage, food, beverages and much more. There is the Tropics, which is a tropical rainforest that has overtaken what used to be an abandoned plantation.  The dome rises 93 feet tall and has a mezzanine level where visitors can view the jungle canopy from above. The Garden Primeval is a reconstructed Jurassic area that has been landscaped with ferns and other ancient plant groups that are still in existence for over 150 million years.  The World Deserts are is filled with shrubs, grasses, flowering plants and succulents.  Also, showcased is the Medicinal Plants which explores the origins of plant medicine with a collection of plants from all over the world. The Rare and Endangered Species area contains a display of plants and habitats that are rare, endangered or threatened.

16,Lisbon ....... a city that made me fit with tourism and travel,travel-leisure," Tourism and travel are running in my veins, I love airports, and the ""bags"" and their arrangement do not bother me. The adrenaline hormone rises in every take-off and landing of a plane in any city, but unfortunately this feeling has recently subsided, due to the increase in the twinning of cities and the excessive globalization that has led to the copying of cities and their streets, to lose the luster and what makes it unique in its type and shape. Hidden in most cities, there are ""boutiques"" and small independent cafes, and international brands known to have been replaced, and this made me quarrel with travel and tourism for a period of time, until I decided to travel to Portugal, specifically to the capital, Lisbon. There is a popular Lebanese proverb that says: “The nearby church does not heal”, meaning that people go to the farthest church to perform the vow, with the aim that God will respond to their prayers, and sometimes I feel that this thing applies to tourism, so you see people cut hours and hours of travel to countries in The world is far away, and they leave the places nearby for a later time, and this is what happened with me in the matter of visiting Portugal, which I visited for the first time in my life in December, and welcomed the new year. I heard about Lisbon and Portugal, but I did not know that I would find this kind of uniqueness in them. It is a city in which beautiful time has stopped, not paying attention to the trendy wave that is sweeping the rest of Europe, has its own luster, ancient roads paved with stones, its people quiet like the Atlantic Ocean that overlooks it, transportation is enjoyable, its food is delicious, and its prices have not ride the wave of outrageous high prices in Old Continent. This is Lisbon in short, but there is a long way to go Because it deserves it, it is the capital of Portugal since 1256, and it is considered its largest city, and it is located on seven hills, and therefore you find its geography distinguished by hills, flights, and lodges, and for this reason I emphasize the wearing of comfortable shoes, and leaving high heels at home. Lisbon attracts more than 3 million tourists in one year. The majority of visitors are from Italy, Germany and Britain, in addition to many other nationalities. What distinguishes Lisbon most is: museums, beautiful squares, historical buildings, narrow streets crossed by the colorful and colorful ""tramway"", and its average climate throughout the year. London starting point The journey started from London, and lasted two hours and twenty minutes. Lisbon Airport is only a few minutes away from its center. This feature is rarely found in any other tourist city. Taxis are available at very cheap prices, and the trains are very organized, and you can take them directly from the airport, and the Uber application is available, but it is not cheaper than the ""taxi"". The first look at the city starts from the vicinity of the airport, but in Lisbon the magic starts from the middle of it, and as soon as you reach it the feeling of familiarity begins with this city. Stay in Lisbon There are several hotels in Lisbon on all budgets. What is worth noting here is that the prices are very reasonable, and Lisbon is a cheap destination compared to other European cities. The best way to get a good booking is to go online. There are several sites specialized in tourism, where you find many great offers that mix travel tickets and accommodation, such as ""Voyage Prive"" or ""Booking.com"". My choice fell on the ""five-star"" Corinthia hotel, located 5 minutes by car, when you make a reservation do not make the location near the city center affect your choice, and the reason is that the city is small, and all the important landmarks in it are close to each other In terms of distance, as I mentioned earlier, the ""taxi"" is cheap, and the journey does not exceed any destination of 7 euros. Mobility Public transportation in Lisbon is efficient, which makes moving from one place to another easier, and the “metro” is the most used method, in addition to electric trams, public transport buses and taxis. The best and cheapest way is to buy a card that authorizes you to use the electric ""tramway"" and the ""metro"" at the same time, and there are some trams that require a special card, but the price does not exceed 6 euros back and forth. The most beautiful and most important visits If you have time, I advise you to visit the cities near Lisbon, it is worth traveling to, each has its own character, and in the event that the trip is short, I will guide you on the most beautiful visits in the heart of the city, and I advise you to visit the city of Sintra, which is 30 minutes away by train, it is Worth a visit and differ from Lisbon. Tram 28 The electric tram has shrunk in Lisbon, but it is still very much present, and city residents use it for transportation, as it is not only tourist. However, the most famous tram, which cannot start or complete a visit to Lisbon without its use, is tram 28, and the reason is that this route starts from the «Martim Muniz» in the center of the country, and ends in the other part of the city in «Campo Urique»; You can sip a cup of coffee with a piece of candy in a café nearby. This tram is distinguished by its yellow color and its wooden benches. If you want to take it from the starting point at Rossio Square, I advise you to walk to the second station, it is not more than two minutes by walking, instead of waiting in a long line in the first station. The only problem is that you avoid the queue but you may not find a seat. Since the tram empowers passengers to dismount and ride at any time, and from any station, you will quickly find a vacant seat at the next station. The scenes you see during the trip are so beautiful, I can still hear the tram shivering in my ears. You walk the narrow streets, and you see the houses and their residents. There is a strange feeling that I felt there, nostalgia for the Valparaiso region in Chile, and the plateaux of the city of San Francisco, but the charm of Lisbon is strange and unique. I advise you to return by tram at sunset, as there is a station on top of a plateau overlooking all the sights of the city, where coffee and lemonade sellers spread, who benefit from the farewell sun every day. ""Tuk Tuk"" ""Tuk Tuk"" has an important center for movement and tourism in Lisbon. Remarkably, the majority of the drivers are women, and it is easy to tell if a ""tuk-tuk"" is for a woman, through decorations and flowers that cover the ""tuk-tuk"", which can seat four people. This method of transportation is very beautiful, but the prices vary from one driver to another, there is no specific price, so use your own method to obtain a good price. And I agree with the driver to wait for you at the stations where you want to take pictures. São Jorge Castle It is located on a hill in the historical center of Lisbon, and is considered one of the main tourist sites in Lisbon. The castle overlooks the entire city, and visitors can use dedicated sights to enjoy the view of the city, as well as the Tagus River. The castle was built in the Middle Ages. The castle has a rectangular shape, has 10 towers, and has fences, parts of which extend between residential areas. The most beautiful squares The most famous arenas: Rossio and Brasa Commercio; Where New Year's Eve celebrations are held. For the first time in my life, I bid farewell to the year, with thousands of visitors from all over the globe. But the experience was fascinating despite the overcrowding and gravity scrambling. From these arenas and towards Tagus, you reach Alacantara, which was once a marina, and today it has become a distinctive address for café seekers and nightlife. By walking, you also reach Alfama, the historical part of the city, and the ""Fado"", which is characterized by narrow roads and small squares. Cultural attractions are numerous in Lisbon, and are shortened by “Gulbenkian” and other museums, such as the Maritime Museum in the Belém region. It was opened in 1963 and is considered one of the most visited museums in Portugal and one of the most important tourist attractions in Lisbon. The museum displays all aspects of navigation history in Portugal and is managed by the Portuguese navy. The museum includes a variety of collections, such as historical paintings, marine artifacts, many examples of Portuguese ships, from nineteenth century sailing ships, warships, fishing boats, and many royal pearl boats. The Peruvian metro station is a beautiful landmark. It has the tallest escalator in the city. It is a beautiful area in Lisbon Belem, it is famous for its many cultural monuments, in addition to its tower located along the ocean. And translating the name into Arabic “Bethlehem”, from this point Vasco de Gama set out on his two-year journey, discovering the Cape of Good Hope, and the way to India. The tower was built in the fifteenth century by King John II as a defensive position. You can enter the tower and see the most beautiful views from the upper deck in it. This tower was destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake in 1755, and then rebuilt in a smaller form than before. And if the wait is long to enter the tower, I advise you to buy a ticket for the tourist elevator near it, the wait is lower, and the ticket price is about 7 euros for adults. From there, you can see the April 25 bridge and other corners of historic Belem. Belém is also famous for having the oldest known Portuguese dessert shop. You can enter the Fabrica Pastes de Nata, and eat there instead of waiting for a long time. Dessert is a dough stuffed with custard, with a layer of cinnamon, and the taste is wonderful and delicious. The ""Rua Augusta"" arch, located in the Baixa neighborhood of Lisbon, is one of the most famous human-made arches in the world. The arch is a historic building attracting visitors to Lisbon. It was built to commemorate the city's rebuilding after the 1755 earthquake. The Lisbon Zoo, founded in 1884, is considered one of the most important tourist destinations, with around 800,000 visitors annually, and the park is not just an entertainment establishment; But to preserve endangered species, scientific research and educational activities. It includes about 2,000 animals of 300 species, distributed among 114 mammals, 157 birds, 56 reptiles, and 5 amphibians and arthropods. Where to eat and what? In Lisbon you will not need a guide to the best restaurants; Because most of the restaurants are good, and their food depends on fish and seafood. The best thing to do is to walk on your feet, and let it be your guide. If you are a fan of restaurants with beautiful views, I advise you to “La Paparucha”, it offers good types of meat and overlooks the most beautiful scenery. I tried several restaurants in Lisbon, but I found myself more than once in the ""Time Out"" market, as it is a covered food market, which includes a large number of places that offer different types of kitchens, including Peruvian, American and Italian, so you choose what you want , And sit wherever you wish. The idea of ​​the place is very beautiful; Because you can taste more than one dish from more than one kitchen. And don't miss the grilled octopus, served on boiled and seasoned potatoes."

19,Will you Travel After Covid-19 crisis ends?,travel-leisure," As I am writing this blog here sitting in my home away from all the hush outside, the question as a travel agent or frequent traveler is how will be the travel after all this pandemic situation ends. Will it be the same will there any changes or what will be the travel issue airlines and travelers will be facing? So first let me be clear loud and out THIS WILL END SOON. And as per my experience or intuition Travel industry will see a boom after this. Airlines will be sold out of tickets, travelers will be traveling like never before. Why? As all of us, whether its Americans, African, European or Asian we all are currently lockdown in our home, businesses are already shut. We all are craving to go out, to travel to go out to eat as we all took all these things for granted but now we all are realizing what we all are missing. This time we as humans are going through something similar for all of us. This hard time it won't last long but our thoughts our dreams that we all are going through now will remain there, we will be flying like never before as we all have tasted the feeling of being locked in and missing the feeling of flying to be FREE. As airlines have started to come with new guidelines like compulsory to wear masks inside the aircraft or even at the airport, less movement of flight attendants, restriction on refreshments, and adding more as per the need of the hour. JetBlue was first to start the mask compulsory wear followed by Delta Airlines and United airlines. But if see the polls, charts and surveys passengers are still in doubt if they should or not travel. But if we see the travel behavior of US citizens we know how much they love to travel whether it is weekend getaways, Labor Day Holiday, Easter holiday, summer holidays, or Thanksgiving day. People don’t need any special day to go for family visits within the US. So we need to see when states start to open their borders and lift the restrictions, how will the passenger react to the travel industry. I believe and hope they will travel with being more cautious, mostly within the USA for few months, and within the passage of time and seeing how’s airlines and government is doing for passengers safety they will start traveling internationally too, But is too early to believe that it will be that easy, but for now, we can hope to at least start flights domestically. So till then Dream about your next Destination, Cancun Beach with sand on your feet! Ah the feeling is so surreal that I can feel it sitting on my couch right now. So as for now let's stay Home and Fight This!"

1,"Carthage, Tunisia",travel-leisure," An Historical Overview Beneath the layers of time, various manifestations of Carthage can be found. The first Carthage, founded by the Phoenician Princess Elyssa-Dido, brought Africa to the forefront of history. The Punic Carthage of Hannon was queen of the seas and Hannibal's Carthage ruled the world during its shining hour of glory before it too, vanished. Augustus built Roman Carthage as the capital of Proconsular Africa and the Imperial Carthage which was a centre for the arts and learning. The Christian city of St. Augustine was as famed for religion as for its other interests. For a century the city was held by the Vandals and then became Byzantine under Belisarius. Carthage was finally conquered by the Arabs who then abandoned it in favour of Tunis. However, it remained a watchful outpost of the new capital city. Throughout the centuries, this extinct city has been inexorably pillaged as a source of building materials for Tunis and other Mediterranean towns. It has gradually been transformed into an agricultural centre famed for the quality of its produce. The installation of the French Protectorate over the Tunisian Regency enabled the Catholic Church to restore the splendid bishopric of Saint Cyprien. The massive Basilica rising from the summit of Mount Byrsa, known as the hill of Saint Louis, is evidence of this era which has disappeared since the country's independent status. With the advent of the railway line linking La Goulette to La Marsa, which runs through the Carthage area, the district has become urbanised. Thus modern Carthage has been built on the ruins of ancient Carthage. Mount Byrsa and the Museum Mount Byrsa was the Acropolis of Punic and Roman Carthage. Under the French Protectorate, a large cathedral and a seminary for Carmelite priests was built on the hill. The museum of Carthage came to be located in this former seminary. Having been renovated and adapted to its new purpose, the museum brings together, preserves and exhibits collections of archaeological finds from the site. Three major periods have been identified : Phoenicio - Punic;  Romano - African;  and Arab - Islamic. The wide range of objects reflects the particular nature of each age : pottery, stelae, sarcophagi, sculptures, mosaics, inscriptions, ceramics and fragments of artifacts. The Punic Quarter Before entering the museum, visitors may look along the sightseeing route to the Punic Quarter, dating from the III - II century BC. This is a collection of carefully built and laid-out houses on a regular grid pattern which were endowed with all the conveniences and comforts of the age, such as water tanks, drains, plastered walls and tiled floors. At the centre of the settlement planned by Julius Caesar and brought to fruition by Augustus in 44 BC, then expanded by Hadrian and Antonine, the forum covered the plateau of Mount Byrsa, its imposing buildings looming over the entire city. The Amphitheatre The amphitheatre was an essential place of entertainment in a Roman city. All classes of people relished the circus games - fights between wild animals, armed men v animals and gladiators, nothing was TOO bloodthirsty !! The amphitheatre at Carthage, was one of the largest in the Empire, the height of its arches a wonder of the Middle Ages. Nowadays, after removal of many stones, the area is derelict and surrounded by pine trees. The Roman Theatre at Carthage - provides an attractive, annual setting, in July and August, for an international festival of music, singing and dancing, which delights the public. The Antonine Thermal Baths The remains of these baths at the water's edge, were amongst the largest in the Roman Empire. A place where the Romano-Africans developed a taste for physical cleanliness, healthy sports and cultural improvements. 8 columns of 15 metres were necessary to support the massive vaulted roof of the frigidarium (cold pool)."
2,Motocamping with the Affordable Yamaha Super Tenere ES,travel-leisure," The basic adventure bike that fits your budget. For a compact powerful bike with tons of torque, you’re not going to find a more affordable option than the Yamaha Super Tenere® ES. Starting at only $16,299 no other competitor even comes close to offering a base model bike at such a low price. However, the Super Tenere ES does lack some of the bells and whistles that come standard with some of its competitors’ bikes. No Bluetooth or fancy TFT displays grace the Super Tenere ES. But if you’re looking for a powerful bike you can take off-roading or moto-camping high in the mountains, you won’t be disappointed. With a 1199cc 2-cylinder inline engine with 8 valves and a direct overhead camshaft that puts out 110 horsepower, it’s not as powerful as some other bikes on the market, but it handles extremely well and can handle even the windiest roads. With that being said, it’s not exactly a small bike, coming in at a lofty 584 pounds. But the Super Tenere® ES didn’t skimp out on everything to bring down the price. Built with an electronic suspension system that has four different settings and even more, damping presets and fine-tuning adjustments you can have the Super Tenere® ES riding perfectly for you and your current situation. Adding to your comfort further, both the seat height and windshield are adjustable so you can have an ideal riding experience. No more adjusting yourself to the bike, the Yamaha Super Tenere® adjusts to you. Additionally, the Super Tenere® ES comes with a 23L (6.1 gallons) fuel tank that can take you up to 262 miles before you need to hit up a gas station. For moto-campers, this means you can spend more time on the open road or get farther off the beaten path before you need to fill back up. And when you’re out on the open road you can switch on the cruise control for an even more enjoyable experience. If that wasn’t enough Yamaha made sure to equip the bike with LED headlights for a sportier look and added visibility.  And when it comes to safety they really came through offering traction control, antilock brakes (ABS), and a Unified Braking System (UBS). UBS ensures that whenever you hit the front brakes, some brake pressure is automatically applied to the rear brakes as well. This way you don’t front flip your bike and have a really bad accident. Combined with the Yamahas dual 310 mm disc brakes in the front and a single 282 mm single disc brake in the rear, this system allows you to stop as quickly and as safely possible. To increase carrying capacity, the Super Tenere ES includes the optional flexible luggage system which has three possible setups: standard with no top case/side bags, top case installed, or side cases installed.  Unfortunately for motocampers, Yamaha does not recommend using all three cases at the same time due to risk of overloading the motorcycle, so you get a choice of using the left and right side cases which come in at 29 and 32 liters respectively, OR the top case which offers roughly 30 liters of storage and is large enough to fit a full face helmet.  So adventure riders looking to go camping may want to stock up on some lightweight motorcycle camping gear. It’s not the best bike on the market that’s for sure. But if you’re looking for an adventure bike that can take you anywhere and you’re on a budget, you can’t go wrong with the Yamaha Super Tenere® ES. But if you’re looking for a bike with all the added features, you’re going to be disappointed with a barebones bike like this."

4,Why Traveling Will Change Your Life,travel-leisure," Extended travel has become a much more viable lifestyle, since the world has become increasingly connected. There has never been a better time to travel. Most people can do it relatively cheaply, and have access to the infrastructure and technology which makes it possible. Most cultures are adapting to tourism, making it easier to navigate the globe. It’s no wonder why many people are leaving it all behind, and adopting the nomad lifestyle. There is so much to gain from your experiences, whether this is for a short vacation, a year-long backpacking trip or to live abroad indefinitely. We’re going to look at the developmental benefits of travel in this article. We will discuss why travel yields such a huge transformative potential, and how it will change your life permanently. Even though there is so much more to gain from it, how travel causes you to change as a person is the most important aspect of it. What you learn and how you integrate your travels determines the impact it will have on the rest of your life. After learning more about it, you’ll be eager to pack your bags and book the next flight. Let’s look at why. Travel facilitates growth and a shift in identity: You will change a lot when you travel. That’s an inevitable part of it. You are exposed to so many different things including people, cultures, lifestyles, and customs. Through exposure alone, you experience a wider range of situations that you seldom, if ever get back at home. When you travel, especially by yourself for extended periods of time, you really begin to question who you are. This paradigm shift forces you to become more familiar with your own company, but also become less familiar with who you are. This is a huge advantage for your development as a person, as you are constantly surrounded by different influences. Your identity begins to morph much more rapidly as you are continuously challenged. Through everything you experience, you gain insight into your character, personality, programs, and patterns. This awareness allows you to edit them. Building a new appreciation for things: When going home after spending time abroad, people often have a different view of it. Travel and exposure instigate a new appreciation for your home, and the people still there. The people and places themselves may not have changed much. To you, however, they can appear foreign as your understanding of life, in general, has changed dramatically. You will have changed a huge amount as a person, and often don’t realize this until you’re back to where you began. It may be disorienting at first. People often feel like they don’t fit in back at home like they once did. This often causes a cycle where people will have the desire to go abroad again, because their eyes have been opened to the world. They understand how much they can transform through it, and how fulfilling the process of change is. You will experience changes in perception: When you are constricted to one country and culture, you only experience a tiny figment of what’s out there. You find that that you are incredibly limited when you only know your home country. You are fairly constrained to the conventional norms, ways of life, cultural standards and social guidelines. In a way, travel really opens your eyes. When you never do it, you have only been exposed to a very linear way of life. There is no way of knowing how much more you can discover, and how much value these discoveries can add to your life. Through exploring the world, you are likely to discover better perceptions, You will find new ways of looking at things, and experience vast changes in perspective. You may also resonate with different beliefs, mentalities, and philosophies. Travel facilitates open-mindedness and exposes you to a much broader scope of information than you are usually accustomed to. You will begin to see the world in a vastly different way as you accumulate life experience, world knowledge, and wisdom. This is an irreversible change that will continue to fruit in various forms throughout the rest of your life. Travel improves your world knowledge: Your realm of general knowledge broadens as you constantly see different things, meet people and have new experiences. You learn much more about different topics, from geography and economics to social arts and philosophy. This helps you see how the world works as a collective, a little more clearly. Instead of seeing life through a biased national perspective, you see it through an unbiased world perspective. We are usually quite ignorant about the world around us, until we see it through various lenses. You can hear about different things happening through the media and word of mouth, but it’s different because you are not experiencing it for yourself. Being stuck in one country only provides you with a limited set of views. As you are indoctrinated and pushed to believe in national ideals, with propaganda shoved down your throat, you get a very one-sided and biased view of the world situation. You are coerced to believe in views that serve a nationality or collective, but not you individually. By exploring different cultures, economies, systems, and structures, you see how things really are. By seeing the different perspectives of every culture, you are free from the opinions of others, and begin forming your own. You will see that there is no concrete way to do something. There are many perspectives and beliefs about any occurrence happening in the world. You gain the freedom to form your own beliefs without other people and entities manipulate you. This is an empowering feeling. You realize and build upon your capabilities: You will come across a lot of uncomfortable situations and endure a lot of lessons. Some of these lessons will be big, others small. Some lessons will be through failures and mistakes, others through coincidences and luck. Regardless, these lessons are essential for you to become more aware, and to build upon your capabilities. When you are traveling, you are forced out of your comfort zone, and grow much more as a person. When you don’t have the security and safety net of home, you learn to become much more resourceful, competent and independent. You also gain a lot of new skills and abilities. This is because you are forced to overcome challenges and hurdles that you would never get at home. Likewise, you can’t circumvent the challenges like you can at home, because you don’t have the safety net of home. From finding locals who speak your language, figuring out transportation, how to find and book accommodation, and navigate the country you are in. You gain a lot of great new skills that you never knew you were capable of. Travel gives you the kick you need. You are forced to handle all of these challenges on your own. You will understand the transitory nature of reality: The more time you spend abroad, the more you will understand the temporary nature of everything. The unfamiliar becomes familiar, the unpredictable becomes the new norm. Your perception of time changes and the more you encourage this, the more you understand that nothing stops changing, and that life is precious. This is probably the most beneficial trait you can develop while traveling. A new understanding that buds through the endless funnel of experience. Through all the different situations you encounter, through everything beautiful and horrific, you will understand the true meaning of impermanence. You will have changed dramatically and notice it in yourself. The people back home will be getting older. Countries and economies are constantly in a state of transition. Different situations get better and worse, continuously. You learn to stop judging the world around you, and just experience whatever it puts you through fully. When abroad you constantly meet new people, make new friends, partners, try different things, work new jobs and so forth. After a while, you realize how quickly time passes, as your life becomes more eventful when you travel. This can bring about acceptance and inner peace. You become less consumed by time and materialism, and enjoy life for what it is. By understanding the impermanent nature of existence, you feel much freer. The burden of needing to have more time eases, as you allow life to take you to and from each new experience in a state of non-resistance. You will make friends of a lifetime, create amazing connections and find yourself in fulfilling relationships. But each moment passes onto the next, and within the blink of an eye, everything has changed once again. You will find a sense of peace when you accept the ever-changing nature of reality. Travel will make you see it more clearly."

However, it’s not going to leave you wanting for more power when you’re off the beaten path. And it’s when you take it off the beaten path that the BMW F 750 GS really starts to shine. With 7.5 inches (190 mm) of ground clearance and an off-road suspension system, it’s designed to handle any terrain, with the ability to get you deep into the backcountry for that motorcycle camping trip you’ve always wanted to take. Moreover, the F750 GS is equipped with dual floating 305 mm disc brakes and calipers in the front and a 265 mm single disc brake in the rear. So, when you need to stop on a dime BMW has you covered. The one thing the BMW F 750 GS needs to improve upon is the size of the fuel tank. It comes with a 15L (4 gallons) fuel tank, which is small compared to a lot of other adventure bikes. Still, with the smaller fuel tank, you can go up to 186 miles before you need to fill up. Just keep this in mind if you plan on using the F750 GS as anything other than an adventure bike. BMW didn’t change much from the 2019 BMW F 750 GS for the newer 2020 version. But the one change they did make they made for the better. The price. While the base price didn’t drop, all the optional add-ons are now 15 percent cheaper, leaving room in the budget for those saddle bags or other camping gear you may need for your adventure. So, whether you want to splurge for the Pro Riding mode add-on, or either the comfort or dynamic packages, you can now do so for even less money. And add in the fact that the base price is only 10,395 dollars and you’re looking at one of the more affordable adventure bikes on the market. But the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" still rings true. Compared to many other adventure bikes on the market, you’re getting less horsepower, a smaller fuel tank, and a limited number of standard options. Only standard ABS, traction and control, and two ride modes (rain and road) come standard on the F750 GS. With all that being said, if you’re only looking for an off-road adventure bike you won’t be disappointed. Equipped with LED headlights and taillights it’s designed with a sleek and sporty look that won’t leave you disappointed with its appearance. It’s an affordable adventure bike but it can't claim to be the best at anything. It’s a great beginner adventure bike, but if you’re looking for a top-end bike keep looking. However, if you’re looking for an affordable bike to get you off the pavement, the BMW F750 GS might be exactly what you’re looking for."
6,5 must-see countries in 2020,travel-leisure," Experts have raked the entire planet in search of destinations that should not be missed in the months to come. Unforgettable experiences, new trends, renewal for some or places still unknown to tourists, discover the 5 countries of our Best of 2020. A dozen nations claim to be the true earthly paradise, but Bhutan's claim carries more weight than others. This little piece of Himalayan paradise practices a strict tourism policy of ""high profits for a minimum impact"", making tourists pay a high daily rate only to be able to go to its mountains embalmed with pines and punctuated by monasteries. The advantage for the visitor is to be able to take preserved mountain trails, untouched by rubbish, and to meet a people who, thanks to their Buddhist beliefs, have a unique connection with their environment. Bhutan is boxing well above its category in the field of sustainable development: it is already the only country in the world to have a negative carbon footprint, and the kingdom will become the first entirely organic nation in 2020: it can only embellish . In addition, this daily package should limit the number of tourists. Formerly the first line of defense against invaders, the English coast is now peaceful: locals and visitors can carry out more peaceful activities there. Take an invigorating walk on a windswept pier, savor a good fish & chips, admire the marine fauna in the puddles left by the tide, discover the fossils of ancient cliffs, build sandcastles or spot dolphins from beaches picturesque are just some of the activities to do on the English coast. This will be made all the easier since the England Coast Path, the longest coastal path in the world, will be inaugurated in 2020, which should give access for the first time to the entire coast of the country. The ""Best of"" list often celebrates birthdays and airport openings. Celebrating the new name of a country is quite rare. However, this will be the case in North Macedonia, often simply called Macedonia, which adopted this new name after decades of political controversy with neighboring Greece. The agreement, signed in 2018, was a comforting moment of good neighborliness and changed the international image of this small nation in the heart of the Balkans. It is already renowned for its gastronomy, culture and traditions, but adventurers and culture enthusiasts will find other reasons to go there in 2020, with new air connections to Lake Ohrid and the very recent ""High Scardus Trail "", a 495 km trek trail that goes through the most spectacular peaks in the region. In the south of Aruba, the cultural center of San Nicolas (Sint Nicolaas), also called Sunrise City, sees color and creation resurface, thanks to local and international artists who decorate its walls and to spontaneous carnivals prolonging the cheerful atmosphere of its annual festivities. Equally important and worth celebrating, the transition of the whole country to 100% renewable energy in 2020 and the total ban on single-use plastics (bring your gourd, tap water is drinkable) and sunscreens, which destroy corals. With lots of experiences and new accommodation in shared accommodation, a more authentic, more affordable and more sustainable Aruba awaits you, beyond palm trees and pristine beaches. Small, charming, rich in culture, adventure and fantastic wildlife, ancient Swaziland, now known as the kingdom of eSwatini, is one of the most overlooked (and least visited) destinations in Southern Africa. A new international airport and better road infrastructure between it, the reserves and the capital aim to increase the number of visitors in the years to come. Go there in 2020 to make sure you're among the first. The diversity of the landscapes of its parks and reserves offers one surprise after another, whether ziplines, trekking, whitewater rafting or breathtaking encounters with rhinos. Add an atmosphere full of serenity and exciting cultural festivals, and you will have a smile until your return."
7,Strange Things may Surprise you about North Korea,travel-leisure," North Korea isn’t known for many things that aren’t absolutely horrible, which makes its iconic traffic girls a nice change of pace. North Korea, as well as many other places, used humans to direct traffic. In the capital of Pyongyang, young, beautiful, single women were selected for the task. While North Korea can now afford traffic lights on every corner, the women are still everywhere, with about 50 of them working in the capital. ""There’s a rumor that Marshall Kim Jong-un handpicks them himself."" It’s an extremely coveted job. The traffic officers are reported to get better pay and more food than the average North Korean, as well as free housing and health care. They wear crisp, military-style uniforms and stay at their posts in all weather. Kim Jong-il was said to take a ""personal interest"" in the girls, and he bought them all new equipment, including fancy, umbrella-covered platforms to stand on. In general, traffic women are supposedly highly desired by single North Korean men, thanks to their good looks and high social status. When the world discovered that Kim Jong-un and Dennis Rodman were besties, there was a collective shock around the world. But basketball is an absolute obsession with the current supreme leader and his late father. Kim Jong-il was said to have installed full-size courts at most of his palaces and supposedly built a library containing videos of almost every game Michael Jordan played with the Chicago Bulls. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright knew about the late Kim’s love and brought him a basketball signed by Jordan as a gift in 2000. The leader of North Korea The younger Kim, who would have to eventually settle for a visit from Rodman, went to school in Switzerland, where he was said to be ""fiercely competitive"" on the court. And it turns out that North Koreans love basketball so much that they changed it to make it more to their liking. While they play by the rest of the world’s rules in international tournaments, at home they have their own. Slam dunks are worth three points, and a three-pointer is worth four if the ball doesn’t touch the rim. Adding some serious excitement, baskets made in the last three seconds of the game score a whopping eight points. And if a player misses a free throw, they lose a point, a rule that would surely send shivers down Shaquille O’Neal’s spine. ""You already know the end of the story. Boing. Miss."" North Korean founder Kim Il-sung has an almost godlike status in his country. Even decades after his death he’s still officially known as the ""Eternal President."" North Koreans even have their own calendar, based around his date of birth, April 15, 1912. The Juche Calendar of North Korea Known as the Juche calendar, it’s used alongside the Western calendar, so one would say, ""We are now in Juche 108, the year 2019."" Juche, which means ""self-reliance,"" only came into being in 1997 on the third anniversary of Kim Il-Sung’s death. Since then, all North Korean publications have included both years, and every citizen is expected to use it. The government makes it easy to remember, though, since so much is based around the birthdays of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. If a new bridge was being built, the goal would be, for example, to finish it by the 60th birthday of the General. There’s a serious food shortage in North Korea. Part of this is because the Kims spend money on the military and nuclear bombs rather than agriculture, but the country also lacks chemical fertilizer. They don’t have the ability to make their own, and sanctions mean they can’t get any from the outside world. With farmers desperate for help with their crops, there’s a huge market for something called ""night soil."" In other words, they put human poop in their fields. Human Manure Farmers had been using their own families’ waste for a long time, but poop had become such a precious commodity that it made sense to sell it openly. By 2014, Kim Jong-un officially told his people to use human and livestock manure on crops. Since livestock was scarce, the human version was favored. Perhaps trying to make the best of a bad situation, human excrement became known as the best fertilizer, and vegetables grown in it are considered especially yummy. If farming families can’t produce enough poop and they can’t afford to buy any, they’ve been known to steal waste from other homes. Alas, using untreated human poop as fertilizer isn’t sanitary. Many North Korean defectors have been found to have intestinal wormsFeature Articles, including a soldier who had one that was 10.6 inches long. These parasites sap nutrients and lead to an even unhealthier population."
8,The 2020 KTM 790 Adventure R Close Up,travel-leisure," Put a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure R next to last year’s 2019 model and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a difference. But the truth is, that’s not a bad thing. With a 799cc, 2-cylinder, 4-stroke parallel-twin engine that delivers 95 horsepower and 66 pounds of torque per foot, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a motorcycle that outperforms the 790 Adventure R. Especially not priced under $14,000. But what really sets the KTM 790 Adventure R apart is that it’s not just a speed demon. It’s also an off-road menace with all the bells and whistles of a top-end touring motorcycle. Built with LED lighting the 790 Adventure R doesn’t just perform like a top-tier bike, but it looks like one as well. Equipped with the most advanced electronics available the KTM 790 Adventure R gives the rider a choice between a variety of driving modes. Street, Off-road, Rain, and Rally modes are all available. Rally mode allows the rider to pick between 9 different levels of traction control. So, the rider can adjust to road conditions and skill levels for the perfect experience. For touring fans, the cruise control, motorcycle traction control, cornering ABS, and KTM MY RIDE system are must-haves. Furthermore, the KTM MY RIDE system is really what establishes this bike as a 21st-century beauty. Enabling riders to listen to music, take phone calls, and get GPS instructions, it’s a game changer for those long rides. Of course, there’s a reason they call it an Adventure bike. Built with an off-road ABS system, a suspension system that boasts 240 mm of travel, and comes standard with tires that can handle almost any terrain, this is the bike you want when you get off the pavement and into the back country for some motorcycle camping. And with 10.4"" of ground clearance it provides plenty of room, so you don’t bottom out your bike. However, KTM did locate the fuel tank toward the bottom of the bike, a big no-no for off-road motorcycles. To compensate for this the 790 Adventure R has plastic shield’s for added protection, but with a low exposed fuel tank, you always run the risk of damaging it during your off-road adventures.  And with a 20L (5¼ gallons) fuel tank you can drive up to an impressive 280 miles on a single tank. So, no matter how far off the beaten path you want to go the 790 Adventure R has you covered. And whether you’re on the highway or the mountaintop, you need a top of the line braking system to get the job done. That’s why KTM equipped the 790 Adventure R with two 320 mm diameter brake discs in the front and a 360 mm diameter brake disc in the rear. Designed for both power and control so you can load up your camping gear and head out on an adventure anytime you want, knowing that this bike will handle whatever you throw at it. So yeah KTM didn’t change anything from the 2019 model, but did they really need to?"

10,Some Things To Consider When Looking For Single Parent Holidays In 2020,travel-leisure," There are an awful lot of single parents in the UK, the typical figure being quoted as 2 million, but in fact it is more than that. According to the Office of National Statistics, the figure for female single parents in 2017 was 2,416,000, up from 2,089,100 in 1996. That in itself is a hefty increase. However, that is only for female single parents, but the ONS doesn’t seem to supply the male figures. An educated guess would be another 600,000 or so, so in fact the total is likely to be nearer 3 million overall rather than 2 million. That is an awful lot of single parents. No doubt all of them would like a holiday at some point during 2020, but of course there will be many who are struggling and simply can’t afford to go. With that said, it is worth doing whatever you can to save a little because everyone deserves a break, and single parents probably more than most. There may be jobs that you can do online working from home and even if you could only earn, say, £40 a week working a few hours, that would still give you a couple of thousand pounds to spend on a holiday after a year. That way, you could get the break that you deserve. Of course, you still have the problem of being a single parent, so you need to search for ""single parent holidays 2020"" and you will find that you come up with quite a lot of them. There are a number of travel companies that cater to this market, and they are the ones that you need to look for, because they allow for the fact that you have kids and are on your own, so they provide tour guides, creches, and people to take care of the kids so that you can get a few hours away from them on your own. There are a number of myths about single parent holidays in 2020, not the least of which is that you may not be mentally strong enough to deal with it all. It is true that many people do suffer from anxiety or depression, but as one mother said: ""Vitamin D is your friend, as are palm trees and all-you-can-eat buffets, so surely it’s worth a try?"" She suggests taking a few books or downloading some audio books, and take advantage of the Kids Club, and relax and work on YOU when they are playing with their new friends or asleep. It is not bad advice. Some people believe that it won’t be fun, but nothing could be further from the truth. Whatever happens, you and your child/children will get to share and enjoy many new experiences together, even if it is only listening to new birds chirping and seeing different flowers and plants. You get to eat different foods – so much better than the stuff from the takeaway when you are not feeling like cooking on Saturday night -and drink different drinks. Other people believe that their child will have a meltdown on the plane. However, this is very unlikely. Plan ahead. Take the iPad, drawing pad, crayons, and a bag of sweets, and your little one will most likely sit there as good as gold. Talking of travel, when you go abroad, remember to take your child’s birth certificate or any Child Arrangement Orders that you might have because you may well be asked for them at Customs. There is a clampdown on child trafficking, and this could be particularly tricky if your child has a different surname from your own, which is the case with many single parent families. There are a number of travel companies that specialise in single parent holidays or have a specialist department that does. It is well worthwhile going online and carrying out a search so that you can find a company that provides the sort of holiday that interests you in a country that appeals. It is also a good idea to compare prices, because not all travel companies treat single parents in the same way as a couple travelling. Whatever you do, make the time to take that break. You deserve it and so do your kids."

12,Are the wildebeest residents of Serengeti Tanzania OR Maasai Mara Kenya?,travel-leisure," Serengeti is one of more than 20 Tanzania National Parks ( among Tanzania Destinations & Places to Visit ) located in the Northern circuit. One could say it is the extension of the other side of the Ngorongoro conservation area however giving it that name would have been not doing justice to it. Serengeti is well famed and visited with thousands of tourists each year and it was not a surprise that in 2019 it won the award of the best national park in the world. Serengeti earned its name not just from varieties of wild animals including the presence of the big five and the wonderful and scenery it has, but it has a history way deeper than that. Driving to Serengeti via Ngorongoro Conservation Area, you will see the diversity and land gestures drawing the distinct line between them. Along the way, you will notice some people in red wrap-ups holding sticks heading crowds of cattle. These people are known as Maasai belonging to the Maasai tribe one of the more than 120 tribes in Tanzania. They are famous for their nomadic lifestyle grazing cattle from place to place in search of pastures and water and this is how they arrived in Serengeti through the rift valley walking down from Egypt. At a shock on their arrival in Serengeti for the first time in their search for pastures and water, they called it Siringeti meaning a place with no end. Apart from thousands of resident animals, Serengeti is famed for the world’s famous great migration. The wildebeest migration includes Zebras who are silent with the role of a detective agency during the migration. The zebras have the significant role of leading the group due to their excellent eyesight and great memory and route to where it is safe. The migration is estimated to be having 2.5 million wildebeest, 250,000 gazelles, and 800,000 zebras. The great migration is the year’s circle that goes around which can sometimes be affected by weather from time to time otherwise mostly it is similar throughout the years. The migration calendar starts from the southern part of Serengeti which is known as Ndutu plains. This is the special place where wildebeest would breed and cave their calves this would be from late December to Mid-April. Then they will start heading to the western plains where they will last there for few weeks for mating until July when they will be arriving at Mara river crossing over and head to Maasai Mara national game reserve, the cross always takes few weeks. From mid-September migration moves back to Serengeti through crossing the Mara River and in November migration is expected to be near Central Serengeti or arrive at the central Serengeti then heading home for Christmas. Around December migration is expected to be at the southern plains of Serengeti where they normally synchronize birth, thus the migration will last on the southern plains for December until mid of April and start the cycle again. Thus one can see the migration in Tanzania in nine months throughout the year in Serengeti while the wildebeest are a vacation in Maasai Mara. However, there are thousands of wildebeest which are permanent residents in Serengeti..!"
13,Why Visit Uganda,travel-leisure," Uganda's beauty, history, diversity, and friendly people justify its reputation as the ""Pearl of Africa. Why Uganda Uganda's beauty, history, diversity, and friendly people justify its reputation as the ""Pearl of Africa."" Segmented from east to west by the equator and from the north to south by forks of the Great Rift Valley, Uganda lies at the very heart of Africa. With the extensive rainforests of the Congo Basin to the west, Lake Victoria to the south, the semi-arid deserts of the Sahel to the north, and the acacia-dotted savannahs of the vast Serengeti ecosystem to the east, Uganda is a microcosm of African wildlife and environments. Uganda is where we find the Rwenzori, the fabled ""Mountains of the Moon""; Murchison Falls; the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest; and the source of the Nile River. From the naturalist's point of view, this tiny nation is one of the most biologically diverse areas of Africa. With more than 1,000 species of birds, many of the characteristics of the central African rainforests, Uganda is a birders paradise, and nowhere else on the continent can one see such a wide variety of primates with so little effort. It is here that the greatest percentage of Mountain Gorilla habitat remains. Our safari in Uganda provides the traveler with unique opportunities to view this, the largest and most endangered of the great apes in the wild. Chimpanzee, many types of Geunons, and two species of Colobus Monkey abound, giving primate enthusiasts unparalleled opportunities for observation. In addition to primates, Uganda offers a wealth of other wildlife. African Buffalo, Bushbuck, Giant Forest Hog and several species of Duiker thrive in the lush upland forests of Kibale. Lion, Leopard, Uganda Kob and African Elephant are some of the larger mammals that may be found in Queen Elizabeth National Park which also boasts one of the largest concentrations of Hippo in the world. Population:  40 million Language: Swahili and English (official), about 56 tribal languages Religion: Christian 84%, Muslim 12%, traditional & other 1% Government: Dominant party system Capital: Kampala Time Zone: UTC+3 Currency: Ugandan shilling(UGX) Highlights: Lake Victoria, Nile basin, lake Kyoga, Rwenzori mountainous region, Lake Albert, Lake Edward, Lake George, Tropical forest 10 REASON WHY UGANDA IS A MUST VISIT Every traveler knows how the attitude of local people can influence the experience when visiting a new country.

1,10 Wine Tasting Tips and Tricks for Napa Valley,travel-leisure," Over the previous year, I have put in a couple of ends of the week in Napa wine sampling. This has been a serious enjoyment experience, and I have had a brilliant visit manage in my companion, Leigh-Anne, who lives in the Bay Area and has taken a considerable lot of her companions on excursions to Napa. She has been to such a large number of the vineyards and tasting rooms and consistently has recommendations, yet she is in every case very kind to tune in to my solicitations and ensure that we fit in what I need and make some FABULOUS memories. When arranging a Napa wine trip, it very well may be totally overpowering. There is such a lot of that you can see, and yet, you are on an extended get-away, so you would prefer not to be on a tight timetable the whole outing. That is the reason I'm sharing my Napa Valley tips! These tips will assist you with having the best time wine sampling in Napa. 10 Napa Wine Tasting Tips I have taken in a couple of exercises from my excursions to Napa! While these tips depend on my involvement with Napa, they can be applied to wine sampling trips in numerous different areas as well. Here are my main ten hints for making a wine sampling excursion to Napa effective: Regardless of whether you decide to have a plunk down breakfast or get something at a bread kitchen, it is basic to have a full stomach before you begin drinking wine. I am an enormous fanatic of Bouchon in Yountville. There is frequently a long queue at the pastry shop, however it is certainly justified regardless of the pause. Moreover, when we have planned tastings without a mid-day break, I have gotten a sandwich here. Furthermore, it is hard for me to leave without having in any event one macaroon. I likewise suggest eating and drinking water for the duration of the day to remain hydrated, you will express gratitude toward me in the first part of the day. Another of my Napa Vally wine sampling tips is to not make multiple arrangements in a day. My inclination is to plan one in the first part of the day and one toward the evening. For the most part, wineries are open from 10 am to 5 pm. A few wineries are by arrangement just, so it essential to inquire about the wineries ahead of time. Since Chateau Montelena opens at 9:30, on one outing, we began the day there. Notwithstanding the tastings that you have booked, have a couple of different wineries as a primary concern in the event that you have time. On the off chance that you are especially partial to pinot noir and need to taste a greater amount of those, survey a couple of wineries or tasting rooms close to the planned arrangements to check whether you will have the option to taste something that interests to you. On the other hand, it tends to be amusing to take a break in the middle of arrangements by walking around the town. Likewise, look at these thoughts for activities in Napa other than wine sampling. There are such huge numbers of wineries to look over you should attempt to encounter an assortment. Try not to go to all notable wineries or every single little one. Domaine Chandon is a notable winery and is situated close to the town of Yountville. I appreciated the tasting there, however I have additionally delighted in going to little wineries, for example, Whetstone. The two have totally different encounters and it is pleasant to attempt both. Castello di Amoroso is a legitimately constructed thirteenth century Tuscan palace and winery. This can be a pleasant redirection and something else in the event that you are worried about simply going from tasting to tasting. Silver Trident has a tasting room in Yountville that is an association with Ralph Lauren Home. I like home goods, so it was enjoyable to have the option to examine the territory as I was tasting wine. On the tables, they had valuing records for the decorations in each room. Furthermore, the littler things were accessible for buy on the spot. These visits can be enlightening, yet in addition it is critical to not have data over-burden. I am a major enthusiast of the cavern visit at Schramsberg. It is an educational visit and they have an extraordinary history. Moreover, the wine there is delectable! Be that as it may, don't stress all things considered spots you can have tastings without visits, and many don't offer guided visits by any stretch of the imagination. Look at my recommended Napa schedule that incorporates a visit to Schramsberg. You will no uncertainty be enticed to join wine clubs. Most will give you free Napa wine tasting(s), maybe a huge rebate on any wine buys on the day you join, in any case, at that point you are joined to be sent and charged for a few shipments of wine for each year. How would you choose if the club is directly for you? See whether they will send wine that you will like – frequently a few people lean toward a specific varietal and they will most likely be unable to get it as a major aspect of the shipment. What sort of markdown will you jump on wine? Is the expense of every shipment a set sum? I wouldn't pursue a club without realizing the shipment sum. I like being an individual from the Schramsburg wine club since I get wine that isn't promptly accessible, in addition to we get a free wine sampling each time we go. On the off chance that you are neighborhood, it might bode well to turn into a part particularly if there are part occasions that you would have the option to join in. A portion of the wine may possibly be accessible for buy on the off chance that you are a wine club part or are visiting the tasting room. I constantly prefer to pose this inquiry when I am choosing what to purchase and convey home with me. I am not especially attached to deliberately wrapping a container of wine and handling it with my gear just to find that it is accessible at my nearby wine store. Likewise, remember that numerous wineries will forgo the tasting expense in the event that you buy their wine. Furthermore, frequently there is a markdown on the off chance that you join their wine club. In the event that you would like to buy wine to bring home to stock your wine cooler, you should avoid potential risk (for example utilize some sort of movement wine bearer) to ensure the wine makes it securely. Nothing more regrettable than opening up your bag to red wine spilled on your preferred dress. In the event that you plan on purchasing bunches of wine, you may like this exceptional bag (isn't that wine bottle travel sack charming?). If it's not too much trouble note you have to purchase the froth embed independently. On the off chance that you are just going to bring a couple of jugs home, you can purchase this reusable wine sack. Wineries will likewise transport, so you should check with every one for estimating. Shockingly, on the off chance that you have to transport wine globally, it is typically very cost-restrictive. Likewise, the wineries for the most part sell pressing supplies and around, there are stores explicitly for wine shipping. Recollect that you will drink a lot, so have an arrangement before you start. Either have a driver or remain around (Yountville, Calistoga, Napa, St. Helena) with the goal that you can leave your vehicle and stroll to a couple of tasting rooms. We made some brilliant memories at the Orin Swift tasting room in St. Helena – in light of the fact that it is an around tasting room as opposed to at the genuine vineyard doesn't imply that you can't even now have an extraordinary encounter. Be that as it may, on the off chance that you need to go from vineyard to vineyard, you can employ a uber. On the off chance that you haven't pursued uber yet, utilize this connection and you can get a free ride! Another alternative is take the Napa Valley Wine Train. The Napa Valley Wine Train offers a paramount encounter that joins the magnificence long periods of train travel, with top notch food, Napa Valley view and extreme unwinding on board perfectly reestablished vintage rail autos. Napa is home to the absolute best eateries in the nation. It is after each of the one of the most sentimental spots in California. Without reservations, you might be constrained in your alternatives, so it is ideal to prepare. La Toque, the beneficiary of a desired Michelin Star, is situated in the town of Napa and I delighted in a great supper there. Morimoto is additionally situated in Napa and I making the most of their tasting menu. It was a treat to have the option to taste such huge numbers of various things across the board dinner. Moreover, we making the most of our supper at Evangeline during our stay at Dr. Wilkinson's Hot Spring Resort. Try not to stress in case you're not a wine master, everybody can at present appreciate wine. Simply taste the wine and discover what requests most to you. It is alright if it's not the same as what every other person thinks!"

4,"Island in the Sea, my bug out spot",travel-leisure," Living on a coast could provide you with one of the best places to bug out to in the event of a large scale catastrophe where you would need to get out to a safe place.  Offshore oil rigs provide you with almost everything you would look for in a safe place.  Lets look at some of the ""upsides"" to finding shelter on one of these man made islands. Security You are literally out on a small island surrounded by open ocean so there is no chance of anyone walking up or sneaking up on your camp.  There is only one way to get to you and that's by boat and even then, you will see them, giving you time to prepare assuming its during the daytime. If you're there with others, you will need to post around the clock watches.  You don't want boat loads of people showing up un-announced catching you off guard. You will need to figure out a way to discourage people from trying to board your little haven.  Most large rigs come with a boarding platform at the waterline.  You will need to figure out a way to keep anyone from just pulling up, tying off their boat and boarding the rig.   This will not be a problem for some rigs as the docking station below is connected by a stairwell that you may be able to secure. If you reached the rig by boat (which is the only way you would have gotten there) then you will know the access point and what you would need to do to secure it from others.  Again,  safety is the main issue and depending on what brought you there, you may not want anyone else boarding for any reason. If you find yourself alone on the rig then you will have to figure out a way to keep guard at night where unexpected visitors would be your biggest concern (in regards to safety).   You don't want to end up being kicked off your little island by others with the same idea.  Securing the boarding point should be your first concern. It is also highly unlikely you will find any weapons aboard but if you had time to plan, you would or should have brought your own. Shelter If the rig you have found yourself on was a working oil platform and everyone aboard deserted because of said catastrophe to get to their families, you will find that the living arrangements for the crew are quite decent.  There are rooms for sleeping with beds,  a dedicated kitchen stocked with enough food to feed a couple hundred workers and depending on when they left and their last delivery was, you may find you've either got quite a lot of supplies or not much.  Deliveries of supplies are frequent so chances are, you will find substantial supplies. There are showers, toilets and usually a ""community"" room with television and other things to keep you occupied. Some of the largest rigs are up to 40 stories high.  Plenty of room for a group of survivors that are working together.  Platforms are also built to stand very rough seas and weather.  Most can survive hurricanes so that would also be the reason why you will not find many windows on these rigs. Electricity Operations on an oil rig rely on machinery such as generators, pumps, motors and controls that work together to keep the platform running.  If you aren't an engineer or an electrician then you will have a hard time getting these things running. You will want to do whatever you can to get the rig up and running as you will need power to run your desalinators for fresh water.  Without fresh water, your stay on your little island will be short. You will want to get your generators up and running right after you secure the rig.   Then you will need to learn what everything is and how it works. The average drilling platform utilizes 2 or more diesel turbines to power everything aboard and consumes almost 8000 gallons per day depending on what they are doing.  It would be considerably less if you are simply running just the essentials. Some platforms store up to 80,000 gallons of fuel in their main tank.  If you're very lucky, you'll find close to that aboard. Food and Water We touched on this above.   Most rigs house the men working on these platforms and have kitchens.  They are supplied often and carry enough to feed the whole crew so you will want to do an inventory on what food is there and available.  If you are alone you may have enough for months or weeks.  If you are with a group it may be less. There may be a freshwater tank aboard that is fed by the desalinators.   You will need to locate it and when/if you get the generators running, you will need to get the desalinators up and running to replenish the tanks.  There is a lot that goes into the desalinization plants on board.  Some may require chemicals etc.  You would have to figure all this out in order to safely use them but hopefully you would find enough stored to last long enough for you to figure it out. With the power up and running, you should be self sustained for quite awhile assuming you have fuel, food and water. Communications There would be ship to shore radios aboard.  If you have a cell phone, you may also be able to charge and use it assuming there is still service. Here is a list of facilities you may find aboard an oil platform: Sleeping qtrs. Mess Hall/Cafeteria Food Storage Laundry Facilities Recreation Facilities Control Room Crew Offices Boot/Locker Room Heating and Air HVAC Helideck These facilities will help you survive long and short term if you are able to utilize them. You may also find Aviation fuel storage for Helicopters as well. All rigs come equipped with lifeboats and they are very important in case you need to flee and your vessel is incapacitated for any reason. You should also get familiar with the Firewater Pumps.  They are saltwater pumps used for fighting fires aboard the platform.  That would be a very important thing to get familiar with as a fire aboard a platform would be catastrophic. Ok,  lets say you have a plan to make it out to a platform in the case of some major catastrophe and that day comes.  By luck and some good planning, you make it to the marina where you have already outfitted a small craft to take you. You find that very few boats have left the harbor as people are either caught off guard or are just unable to make it to their boats.  Or maybe getting to their boats wasn't in their plan (most people don't have a plan in case of an emergency). So you go to start your engine and find that something has happened.  Your motor will not start.  You try everything possible and still nothing.   You don't panic because you have a backup plan for this instance.   You grab the ""essentials"" bag you packed on board as well as your weapons.  You unload your Kayak from the deck and put it in the water.  You stow the pack and your weapons on it and begin to paddle towards the marina outlet. You know that your target is a platform that sits roughly 5 miles offshore and you are an experienced paddler so the trip isn't daunting.  An inexperienced paddler could make it if they had the will to do so. You make it to your destination, pull your kayak up onto the boat landing below the platform.  You grab your bag and weapons and head up the stairs, taking note of the stairwell leading up and how to possibly disable them to keep others from boarding, or at least make it tougher for them. You make it to the platform and find that it has already been abandoned by the crew.  You stow your gear and work on a way to disable the stairs.   You stow your kayak, find the tool facilities and get to work on making your platform safe from other intruders. After a few days spent getting familiar with the facilities aboard you notice one night that there are lights on at another platform a couple miles from you.   Do you try to signal them?  Try to make contact?  Or stay dark and hope that nobody pays you a visit. My personal view is, try to make contact with them without giving my location and get what info I can from them.   If they are a well organized and stocked group, they could be good allies if you find yourself having to fend off unwelcome visitors.  It could be a backup safe haven if for some unforeseen reason you needed to bail from yours. So, I would try to make contact without giving up any information about my situation or at least  lie enough to make them think twice just in case they realized where I was and wanted my resources as well. Storms and bad weather would be welcome. Bad weather would keep all but the largest vessels away and off the open seas so chances are you will not have to be as vigilant at those times but you will never want to let your guard down 100%. Seafood would be available.  You may find fishing gear aboard and there is an abundance of sea life around these platforms.   You should be able to supplement your food with fish. You will probably find clothing aboard, Including wet weather and scuba gear if you know how to dive. There are a lot of resources aboard these platforms that would be able to sustain you for weeks, months and maybe years so if you are on the coast and have platforms within sight of you and you don't have a bug out plan, maybe this is a good one to look into. ​But be forewarned,  you may find them inhabited by the time you reach them by either some of the crew or me.   Either way, unless you are an engineer, electrician or a Dr., Prepper or a knowledgeable Survivalist you may not be welcomed aboard...… Plan, Prepare, Survive"

10,Do Discount Travel Websites Save You Money?,travel-leisure," With the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and sharper algorithms, our online search results and behaviors are captured and then catered specifically to our interests and needs — including when it comes to booking a vacation. Whenever we enter a search in Google and land on a discount travel booking site, it's our assumption that these deals are made just for us and that they're the best available, but that may not always be the case. According to a study published by Northeastern University, numerous travel booking search engines are guilty of price discrimination or price steering. The study looks at hotel and rental car searches across six popular travel booking sites: CheapTickets, Orbitz, Expedia, Hotels.com, Priceline and Travelocity. Be sure you are signed into your account The study found that CheapTickets and Orbitz presented reduced prices on hotels to ""members"" who are logged into their respective accounts at the time of their search, thereby using price discrimination. Unfortunately, even though some of these practices may seem shifty they are legal in the United States. Orbitz admits that they offer lower prices to those who have accounts on their websites. So, it pays to sign up for an account with these websites and to sign in to your account when searching for deals. Price is affected by what device you search from The study also found that Travelocity personalizes results for mobile users, specifically those using iPhone devices. Users who search with Safari on their iPhones received different hotels in a slightly different order than consumers using Chrome for Android and other desktop browsers. Overall, hotel prices were listed at about $15 (or 5 percent) lower on iPhone devices than other mobile operating systems and desktop browsers, providing proof of price discrimination, where a certain group receives lower prices. Interesting to note that those with more expensive phones are rewarded. What travel booking sites know about you Discount booking sites personalize search results based on your account history and what you have clicked on in the past. If you clicked on or reserved a low-price hotel room, you will receive slightly different results in a much different order, compared to if you clicked on nothing, or reserved an expensive hotel room. Priceline and other sites can customize results to show the properties that an individual is more likely to look for, and more likely book. There’s no foolproof method to ensure you’re getting the best price. Booking sites know a lot about you and we don’t know a lot about them. If you're an ordinary person on the website, you are probably unaware that what you are presented with is based on where you have already been. The prices you are seeing have been curated for you depending on recent clicks and visits, not on what is the best price."
11,How to Travel on a Budget,travel-leisure," Traveling isn’t cheap, and there are some well known rules to saving money, like being flexible with travel dates, staying at Airbnbs, using frequent flyer miles and vacations during the off season. But there are also less obvious travel discounts that may have never occurred to you to take advantage of. By maximizing your travel savings, you will be able to enjoy traveling with greater frequency. Book with a hotel that has just opened For grand openings, many hotels offer discounted introductory rates to fill up empty rooms. Same is true with an airline’s new routes, which will have tons of available seats and almost always cheaper fares. So the extra steps you take with a little Google investigation can reap huge rewards with travel discounts. Google phrases like, ""new hotel Maui"" and when you get the results, hit the ""news"" tab for the latest updates. Hotel savings and freebies If you’re staying at a hotel, you can find little ways to save money, which can really add up. Watch those silly in-room refrigerators. Anything taken from these are about quadruple in price from bringing in your own, or going for a walk down the street to a convenience store. Rather than paying $5 or more for bottled water in the room, grab the complimentary bottles in the hotel gym, or bring in your own six-pack. Most hotels offer free coffee and tea in the lobby, and some type of continental breakfast. More than 30 major hotel chains, however, offer a more robust complimentary breakfast that goes beyond the typical continental. We’re not talking about paltry yogurt and cereal, either. From protein-packed breakfast bowls to freshly made waffles and pancakes, guests can start their day right. In addition to traditional eggs and bacon, there are also a number of healthier options. Major chains like Marriot offer in-room Wifi for free, and others offer it in lounges, lobbies and shared spaces rather than in guest rooms. Some hotels require you to sign up for a rewards program to gain free internet access. Hotels rely on their reputation like crazy. They need those 5 stars in digital land to keep their doors open, so that means they need your feedback, so they often like to reward you for it. If your room isn’t ready for check in, housekeeping did not come, neighbors were partying all night or the gym was closed for renovations, they will often comp you. For the inconvenience, you could get anything from a complimentary breakfast to room upgrades to waived fees (like a resort fee). It’s worth the try. Discount flights and airlines credit cards If you fly often, you are probably already aware of the perks of being a frequent flier loyalty member such as when you fly at least 25,000 miles with an airline, you generally get free, unlimited upgrades. Waived baggage fees can save an average $50 round-trip and better seat choices are also added bonuses. One of the best cards is Citi/AAdvantage Platinum Select World Elite Mastercard with American Airlines. Check out what they are currently offering. If you don’t fly that often, you can still get some of the same benefits by getting an airline’s credit card with the perk of hefty bonus miles just for signing up. As long as you have the card, you will get free checked bags and priority boarding and, of course, miles for every dollar spent, which is true for all major airline credit cards. Whether you continue to use the card for purchases after three months is up to you, but just having it has advantages."
12,Russia travel tips - is it safe to travel to russia ?,travel-leisure," Russia may not be a good choice for the majority of travelers wishing to visit Europe. With its questionable situation of peace and order, especially in the regions of Chechnya, the impression of Communist rule still resides to most, and the frigid climate throughout the country especially during the winter, Russia should be uninviting to most. But that was in the past. Now, though the shadows of the past Soviet still exist, Russia is a place worth visiting. Travelers would not be disappointed by a number of historical sites telling how rich the history of Russia is. There are numerous museums, parks and untouched nature. Visiting Russia can be very costly considering country distance. However, with several online travel companies, the price tag is considerably lower than it was before.

More About Russia Whilst Moscow and St. Petersburg are the country's primary cities, Russia has to discover several side countries. Nevertheless, be careful when flying. Make sure that you know the places you plan on visiting very well. You may have some trouble communicating with locals particularly if you're away on these two cities. But if you can understand the Russian language, you will have no problem at all. Russia is a great country.

During these times the summer is perfect, unlike the usual impression. Russia Travel Safety tips When traveling to Russia you decide to learn as many things as you can. Know the language, the people, the culture, how to get around, and know where the U.S. is. Located at the embassy. Do not carry too much cash and expensive jewellery. Never open your wallets. Use money belt which you can wear around your neck. It is more secure than wallet. Be vigilant when among others, in crowded places such as public markets, public transportation, and tourist sites. Be constantly aware of the pickpockets. If you go from one point to another, don't hail on unmarked taxis and cars. Never share taxi with other people you don't know, as well. If you plan on traveling by bus or train, take additional precaution. If you plan on drinking in public places, make sure that you have someone who remains sober. Any sign of intoxication could attract professional thieves and robbers. Make sure other people at home know your itineraries and contact numbers and your travel document numbers, such as your passport before you leave. If something goes wrong, they'd know where to find you. Make sufficient photocopies of your airplane tickets, passport, visa, and all travel documents. Leave a copy to someone you know, or to your home. Check travel warning and avoid the Ingushetia, Chechnya's North Caucasus, Stavropol Krii's eastern and southern parts, and Dagestan regions. These places could be a tourist hazard. Avoid drinking water from the Tap. Drink bottled water instead. If the bottled water is not available, first boil the water before drinking. All of these might help you safely make it through your trip to Russia."
13,What is Visit Nepal 2020?,travel-leisure," Nepal is often considered one of the best places for travel. It has an amazing Himalayan beauty, exotic multicultural aspects and natural beauty to match. Visitors from all parts of the world come to Nepal by the thousands every year, especially for trekking. As such, the tourism sector of Nepal has a lot of potential for growth and expansion. Acting on this agenda, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) has planned to organize ‘Visit Nepal Year’ in 2020 to attract more tourists to the country. The government has set a target to bring in two million tourists each year by the targeted year. According to Tourism Minister Jitendra Narayan Dev, a secretariat for the Visit Nepal Year will be established shortly to make necessary preparations. Although the MoCTCA had planned to celebrate Visit Nepal Year in 2018, it was put off due to the delay in construction of airports, heritage sites and roads. The 60-day action plan of the Nepal Visit Year unveils that due priority will be given to the early completion of the construction and expansion of the international and domestic airports, heritage sites and other tourism infrastructure in the country. The government has planned to complete the expansion of Tribhuwan International Airport and construction of Gautama Buddha Airport in Bhairahawa before 2020, along with the reconstruction of major heritage sites. The ministry will initiate the process to bring strategic partner for Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) — the national flag carrier. It also plans to take forward NAC’s proposal to purchase two more narrow-body aircraft. Nepal saw a slight dip in the number of tourists visiting here after the devastating earthquake of 2015. After that, the number of tourists here has not seared as high as in the past. So the year 2020 has been announced as Visit Nepal year in order to get the tourism industry of Nepal up and running in full. Nepal's tourism sector is growing. As a result, more and more travel destinations are opening up. Many new trekking trails are being opened. The older ones are also being renovated and restructured so that traveling gets easier. Likewise, the country wise tourism promotion strategy is set to tap the outbound travelers of the neighboring nations to Nepal in the context of rising number of outbound travelers in India and China. Identifying the reasons behind low growth in tourist arrivals, Nepal will then take necessary measures to attract more tourists in the country, according to Minister Dev. He also further said that the air service agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and New Zealand will soon be finalized. The action plan also states that MoCTCA will review the air service agreements with Thailand, Japan, Egypt and China among others. The action plan also includes plans to amend the Tourism Act, with the vision of making it more contextual. It also aims to amend the Casino Regulation, the Travel and Trekking Regulation and the Mountaineering Expedition Regulation. Similarly, Tourism Minister Dev has envisioned upgrading Nepal Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management to a Tourism University with the aim of to narrowing the gap between human resources in the tourism. To establish the Tourism University, the MoCTCA will carry out necessary groundwork like framing the draft law and land acquisition for the university among others. In like manner, a survey will also be carried out by MoCTCA to expand the line agencies of the ministry and the departments to the provincial and local levels. It will also frame a master plan for the preservation of tourist sites. The Tourism Act is set to bring an approximation of about 2 million tourists to Nepal."

8,The Ultimate Motorcycle Camping Gear Pack List,travel-leisure," There’s nothing better than the feeling of being free on the open road! Something about motorcycles makes answering the call to adventure a thrilling necessity - and there’s no better way to do that than to go camping! Camping allows you to reconnect with nature and find balance in yourself. There are few things in life more harmonious than pitching a tent near a bubbling stream and skipping rocks well into the evening. Motorcycle camping, however, requires some adjustments to be made when it comes to planning and packing. Pack Light Before you really start considering what to pack, make sure you stick to lightweight camping gear and compact items that won’t take up too much space or weigh you down. Also keep in mind that many of the items (especially clothes and containers) can be used for at least two purposes. An example would be a stuff sack that holds your cookware can also be used as a bucket or wash basin. Clothing For clothing you want to be prepared for any occasion.  Don't forget rain gear if there is even the slightest possibility of rain where you will be riding. Dress in layers and look for clothing made of synthetic materials as they will normally be thinner and lighter while giving increased performance in addition to keeping moisture away from the skin.  Of course you will want to choose comfortable riding jacket and pants that fit the temperature range you will be in. There are many different styles available made of both leather and synthetic materials for any application. Shelter There are many different ways to set up shelter when motorcycle camping.  While most people prefer to pack a tent that will give a little extra room and comfort, some prefer the minimalist set-up of a Camping Hammock or a Bivy. There are many types of tents you can invest in but remember the larger tents also weigh more when packed and take up a lot more space.  Some tents even have a large vestibule to park your motorcycle in.  When using a camping hammock you will want to consider whether or not you will need one with insect netting and if you are going to use it in cooler temperatures you may also want an underquilt. Sleeping Bag Most sleeping bags are made with either synthetic filling or down.  Each have their own pros and cons and the best choice depends on what sort of conditions you will be experiencing.  Make sure to choose a bag with a temperature rating that is 20-30 degres lower than what you will be camping in.  Remember that those ratings are survival temperatures and does not mean that you will be comfortable in those temperatures.  If you are using a motorcycle camping hammock you may want a sleeping bag that fits around the hammock instead of putting the bag inside the hammock.  With the bag on the outside of the hammock the bags filling is more effective because it does not get compressed. Sleeping Mat Most campers remember a sleeping bag but forget their sleeping mat! Although it may seem like something that isn’t necessary, a sleeping mat is an essential piece of motorcycle camping gear! Having a mat will help to ensure that the ground doesn’t suck away too much of your warmth at night if you are in a tent, and in a hammock it will help give support to the bottom adding comfort and warmth. Cooking Gear and Food Some motorcycle campers prefer not to take food on their journey and instead just stop at restaurants along the way for their meals.  It's a solid plan that helps minimize the amount of stuff you need to carry with you, however some prefer to save a little money by packing freeze dried meals or buying food locally and preparing it at the campsite.  At minimum you will need to bring some type of portable camping stove that has the ability to boil water for coffee or meals, along with whatever type of fuel is needed.  You will also need some type of cookware and utensils.  Look for lightweight motorcycle camping gear for these items as they are made to be lightweight and compact for easy transportation.  Also don't forget trash bags and be sure to pack out what you brought in! Dirty Clothes Bag No matter how well you pack, you’ll need a dirty clothes bag if you want to have an ideal adventure. You won’t want your dirty clothes mixing with your clean clothes - especially your dirty clothes are soaked from the elements! Using a well ventilated bag will allow wet or sweaty clothes to dry out. Find the Center of Gravity Before you start packing lay out all your gear and take inventory of what you are taking before you pack it. It’s important to make sure that you put the heaviest items low and towards the center of your bags and the lighter items on the outsides. This will help to ensure that your motorcycle isn’t thrown off balance when you’re riding. You also may want to consider what items you need to keep accessible for quick stops along the way. Now with all your items packed you are ready to set out on your motorcycle camping adventure!"
9,The 10 Best Destinations For The Motorcycle Camping In The United States,travel-leisure," Do you have your tent ready and maybe your sleeping mat, camping stove, water bottle, and even your freeze-dried food?  You are entirely prepared for a camping adventure, ready to sleep under the stars and relax in front of a warm fire.  There is only one thing to solve. Where to go? Let's Find some of the best campsites in the United States.  With a little more information, deciding where to pitch the tent could be as easy as A, B, C.  Here are some of the best motorcycle camping locations. There is a reason why Yosemite is one of the most popular national parks in our country.  It is simply awesome and most of the park is designated as desert, which means that there are no cars, roads, electricity or anything else.  There are 13 hiking trails throughout the park that offer a wide variety to choose from.  Depending on the season reservations may be required, so plan ahead. If you want to see more ecosystems in a destination, the Olympic National Park is the place for you.  Mountains, glaciers, and even a rainforest are part of this national treasure located along the north coast of the state of Washington.  Equipped with a ring of almost 30 miles through the rainforest, this park also houses the largest Sitka spruce in the world.  There are 16 campsites with more than 900 sites to choose from.  For those less inclined to camp in tents, there are rustic cabins available throughout the year, but book in advance.  They fill up quickly. What is awesome about Zion is that it is big.  Very big… So big that it takes your breath away.  The sandstone cliffs of this amazing park are worth it for themselves, but they add the variety of plants and animals or the beautiful views and the real question is;  What have you been waiting for?  There are lots of hiking paths and trails of all lengths and levels, including the 14-mile trail that leads to the Kolob Arch, which, is one of the longest natural arches in the world.  Another of the very popular attractions is the Subway, a tunnel carved by water erosion that is really something to see.  The Subway does require an additional permit and if you visit during the summer you will need to enter the lottery to reserve a space.  There is no lottery between November and March due to low demand. The park has three main campsites that fill up quickly so do not wait for the last minute.  Although there are many other motorcycle friendly campgrounds in the area. It is advisable to consult the Zion Wilderness Guide before going. The camping in Joshua Tree is not just an outdoor adventure;  It is a rite of passage that all American citizens must complete.  Joshua Tree is the jewel of our National Park system and, although desert camping may seem unattractive, J-Tree is the opposite.  From the unique plant life to the incredible rock climbing to the simple hiking on the trails, Joshua Tree does not disappoint.  The park has nine different sites to choose from, with most of the sites hidden in private, around, or under the giant rocks that make up the landscape.  Some sites require reservations, but many are managed in order of arrival.  Dispersed Camping is permitted, but it is necessary to register in advance to do so. The Acadia National Park is located on Mount Desert Island, one of the eastern United States most glorious national parks.  The Cadillac Mountain, the highest point along the east coast, offers beautiful views after a pleasant walk to the top.  The park has two campgrounds: Blackwoods and Seawell.  You can walk anywhere in the park, but these are the only campsites approved.  Camping outside the campground is not permitted. Another feather on the east coast would be Assateague, where not only can you enjoy nearly 40 miles of beaches along with swamps, forests, and more.  There is even a pack of wild horses that swim and have fun on this barrier island.  The camp is limited to two areas of the sea camp and four on the bay.  During the coldest months, these sites are filled by order of arrival, but during the warmer months, it is strongly recommended to book in advance.  Dispersed camping is allowed with a $ 10 permit, but can only be accessed on foot or by boat. Going west again, we find this paradise for hikers with hundreds of miles of trails through woods,  meadows, and mountains.  The popular Going-to-the-Sun Road is a 50-mile road that crosses the mountains and is worth driving.  There are 13 campgrounds with over 1000 sites to choose from.  Most are filled in order of arrival, but some require reservations.  Dispersed camping is allowed, but only in specific locations and requires authorized permission. Grand Canyon Park is located in Arizona and known to be the grandfather of all the national parks.  Are you interested in hiking all the way?  Wear comfortable shoes and take your time, the routes can be challenging, but there are campsites in the middle and at the bottom.  Reservations are required. There are three other campsites available and they say reservation is required for only two, but given the popularity of this park, it is probably not a bad idea to plan ahead.  Camping outside the park is allowed with a permit. Don't let the name scare you.  Stunning landscapes dotted with large rock formations and grassy meadows show that the Badlands are anything but bad. There are two campsites to choose from: Cedar Pass and Sage Creek.  The first offers some services, while the second is primitive. To the south, we find this not-so-small national forest that houses numerous swimming beaches, thousands of acres of water and more than 400 miles of hiking trails, including the Ozark Highlands.  At 218 miles, the Highlands Trail is the longest and best known of the many forest trails.  A trip to Blanchard Springs is also essential to explore the living caves.  With more than 23 campgrounds that combine for more than 300 sites, the Ozarks can handle almost anything they want.  Primitive camping is allowed throughout the forest, which means that the number of places to pitch a tent is almost infinite."
10,Why choose a Serviced Apartment over a Hotel?,travel-leisure," There are several accommodation options you can choose from when you travel, with the most common ones being hotel and services apartment accommodations. As such, one of the most common questions when traveling is whether to book a hotel room or seek a serviced apartment. Both options have their benefits and demerits that you must consider when choosing one, but in most cases, services apartments have the most advantages. One of the advantages of serviced apartments is space when compared to hotel rooms; they are bigger and therefore more comfortable regardless of whether you have a lot of luggage or not. Even if you're traveling with others, serviced apartments will have enough room to accommodate all of you. Serviced apartments also have more amenities for those who wish to use them. Kitchens and living rooms are usually added to the bedroom, and this makes it easier for those who want to cook their meals to do so. The living arrangement found in serviced residence also means that you'll feel like you never left your own home. If you're having a family holiday, then you'll enjoy staying at the apartments better than you will a hotel room. Another reason why serviced residence is better than hotel rooms is affordability. Most of the time, good hotels cost a lot of money. When compared to serviced apartments, the latter is a lot cheaper if you consider the level of quality you get. The apartments have better facilities ranging from the lodging area to the kitchen area. These are usually offered at competitive prices, which means that you'll end up with the most cost-effective option. The fact that you can cook your meals at the apartments also adds to the cost-effectiveness because it helps you save a lot of money. Also, you can also get a personalized experienced at the apartments. You have the freedom to change what you don't like or add something that you like but has been omitted. This can sometimes be difficult in hot rooms because of the availability of many guests. Since Serviced residence gives you more room, you can entertain your guests without worry. You also don't have to worry about security and can enjoy staying there for a short time or long duration. The apartments usually have security measures such as alarms and cameras in addition to the management that is hired to ensure the safety of the guests. You can control who comes and goes as well as your privacy. Although services apartments have many advantages, you still need to ensure that you end up with the best possible option. If you're traveling to Kuala Lumpur, The Maple Suite serviced residence is the best option for you. The apartments have been made with luxury and comfort in mind, and they have the highest quality modern finishes. It is conveniently located near the CBD, which means that you'll be able to access whatever you need quickly. Some amenities include a swimming pool, sauna, gym, and a playground for those who have children, among many others. Nearby facilities include shopping centers and entertainment joints as well as restaurants if you decide to eat out. Staying at these serviced apartments will ensure that you get the best experience during your holiday."
11,Three Reasons You'll Want to Fly With Just a Carry-On Bag,travel-leisure," Are you considering flying with only a carry-on bag? If you are, then this is a great article for you because I always, mostly always, now only fly with a carry-on bag. This is a new-ish thing for me though. I used to always fly with a carry-on AND check in a piece of luggage, whether I was flying short haul, long haul, two nights or seven, I would always take a carry-on and check in a piece of luggage, even if it was just a small case. But then not too long ago I got chatting to a fellow jet setter who was telling me that she had switched to flying with just a carry-on and all the joys of doing so and she suggested that I should give it a whirl too and so I did. And well it's fair to say that I am too converted! When I travel I'm all about organization and ease, I have this image in my mind that I will strut around the airport and board the plane with the grace and glamour of a Goddess. My reality? Well, lets say that's an image that I'm still working towards but its true to say that flying with a carry-on has me a little closer to my dreams. Here are my top three reasons why I think you might consider flying with just a carry-on bag..... Number One Checking in luggage with most major airlines can really bump up the prices of your flight. Obviously prices vary between major airlines but in general they range between $15 - $25 per bag per flight. If you are a couple looking to fly a-round trip, you are potentially looking at an extra cost of $100 on your flight which I'm pretty sure we'll both agree that's $100 we'd rather keep for vacation spends! Number Two You will save unnecessary wasted time waiting to collect your luggage at the conveyor belt.  OK, it's not a great deal of time, or is it? I've wasted a whole hour before waiting for luggage at the conveyor belt and let's be honest it's never a nice experience. Everyone edging around this small space, watching the luggage move on past, and there's always that one person who stands right in front of you at the wrong time, or you stand yourself next to the family whose children have spent 5 hours on a plane and have no patience to wait around any further and who can blame them. I can definitely think of better ways to spend my time, and anyway do Goddesses wait for their luggage?! So yes, for me its Goodbye conveyor belt and Hello Pina Colada! Number Three The key to traveling successfully with just a carry-on bag is to make sure that you take the time to pack smart! What does packing smart mean? Well it means learning the art to minimize and organize! Let's divulge: MINIMIZE: The key to minimizing is to think in advance about what you are going to wear and how you can utilize each item of clothing that you're packing. I know this is obvious but do you do it? Before your next trip take some time to sit and think about how many days and nights you're going away for and actually plan each outfit for each day and night. And then look at your outfits and think about how you can wear each item more than once. I know it sounds like a bit of an ordeal but actually it is quite fun to do and you'll be so pleased you did when you've less to pack and then of course less to wash, dry and iron when you get back. ORGANIZE: My most favorite way to organize any travel bag is to pack with packing cubes. If you haven't used them before or even heard of them before then you are in for a treat. Packing cubes are independent bags, generally made of nylon and in the shape of a cube, hence the name. They are a great packing tool that will keep you super organized.The idea behind packing cubes is that they will keep your clothes compartmentalized so that you can find everything you need easily but they will also help you to maximize every inch of your bag because they will compress your garments creating more space in your case, which is exactly what we are striving for with our carry-ons. They also make it easy to unpack because you can slip your packing cubes straight from your travel bag and into your drawers and then you can head straight to the pool, beach, mountain, restaurant or conference, whatever waits ahead for you. I've found that I generally only need 3 packing cubes to fit into a carry-on bag, they come in sets of different sizes so you can determine which is best for you depending on which style of bag you travel with. Switching from checking in a piece of luggage to just my carry-on was a relatively easy transition for my weekend getaways. It took a little more adjusting when it came to a 7 night break. I was just so used to packing in a certain way, which really translates to packing too much, but with a desire to give it a go and a little focus on packing smart, I'm pretty sure you will learn to love it just as much as I do. Here's to traveling our beautiful planet with grace and glamour."

13,How to travel with a pet to Vietnam,travel-leisure," We may have pets, but when it comes to unconditional love, they’re the masters. There’s no better way to visit Vietnam than with your world's best friend - your pet. For you to travel with a pet to Vietnam without any worries, you have to have some information beforehand. You have to be aware of several formalities expected from you before your arrival in Vietnam. You need to prepare your pet for the trip, and there are ways you can do that. It can be a complicated procedure to navigate, but with proper planning and enjoyable time, you’ll be able to smoothly and safely handle it. Here’s what you need for your Vietnam travel with a pet. Vietnam Regulations for Traveling to Vietnam with a Pet Here’s an exclusive guideline for dogs and cat travel. Your pet won’t get quarantined if it meets the following requirements: Your dog must have been vaccinated with rabies for at least 30 days before your travel to Vietnam and not exceeding a year. You’re then required to download the veterinary certificate and then filled by an accredited veterinary doctor to certify the pet’s health and that it’s free from parasites excluding any other human transmissible disease. The governing authority of your host country responsible for the animal export and import should endorse the Vietnam International Health Certificate forms. Together with the endorsement forms, be sure to include a copy of the Rabies Certificate With all the above procedures, your pet will have their passports and can successfully enter Vietnam. Remember to carry some form of identification of ownership for your pet whenever you’re traveling. Failure to do so means you won’t be able to enter Vietnam. If you desire to visit Vietnam with your pet in an effortless and fun way, here are some things you need to know. Have a Pet Crate It could get pretty much uncomfortable if you abruptly introduce a pet crate during your trip to Vietnam more so if it’s a long-distance one. One trick you could employ is to train your pet a few days before your journey. You can start by placing the bottom of the crate at a place where it likes to rest. Once it’s comfortable, you can introduce the top container and then the door. You could then make some short trips within your locality until it gradually gets used to it. Once you do this, it’ll travel with ease. Beware of the cost If you’re traveling by car, there won’t be any extra cost for your pet. However, if you’re traveling by plane, there’s an issue with the price. Different airlines have variations in their prices. Indeed, check them out before your trip. Contact your Carrier You could find out whether you can travel to Vietnam with your pet on your airline’s website. Preferably, I’d recommend you give them a direct call two days prior. Then, find out if they accept a trip with pets. If you’re using a car or bus to travel, then it’d be more manageable. Have a Name-tag It’s a quite unpredictable traveling with pets, and a name tag will be beneficial to help with identification, or in case it goes missing. The name-tag should have details of the pet’s name, flight number, and contact information. Remember to also put a badge on the pet collar as a precaution to getting lost. Conclusion Traveling with pets in Vietnam can be a challenge. But if you prepare early enough, you’ll have a good trip. I hope you find the information in this article useful for your impending Vietnam travel. All will be well with proper planning and have fun!"

You can even get a roll-on that looks the classic shape but opens up into a fully sized garment bag. So our next step to choosing our perfect carry-on bag is to consider what you're going to pack in it and what is it that you want to be able to access quickly and easily. For me I like to travel with as much ease and grace as possible, so I need a carry-on with plenty of pockets, this helps to keep me organized, meaning I can find everything I need, promptly. Have a think about how and what you like to pack and most importantly what you like to be able to access easily and effortlessly. This will help you to make sure that the bag you choose will suit your traveling needs. When considering how much to spend on your carry-on, things to consider may be how much you think you'll use the bag, if it's just for a one off trip, then a cheaper bag will be fine as you don't need it to withstand the test of time, but if you do want it to last a while then you will need to spend a little to get the quality in return. If you don't mind too much about the material of your bag then that will help to keep the cost lower but if you prefer your bag to be leather then of course you will need a bigger budget. If its just a case of what's left in your bank account at the end of the month then pick your type, style and size and choose a popular nylon material and you will be more than satisfied with its quality as it is naturally durable and hard wearing. WHICH BAG IS FOR YOU? I hope you've enjoyed this article I hope my top tips have helped you gain a little clarity as to which carry-on bag is best for you and I wish you a safe and happy trip. Bon Voyage."
15,Moving to Spain?,travel-leisure," Despite the fact that Spain is merely a few hours away from the UK by flight, there are actually quite a few things to consider when moving abroad to one of the many beautiful cities in the country, such as Barcelona or Madrid. We’ve collected some of the top considerations for you to make. It’s warmer! Thanks goodness First of all, the fact that Spain is warmer than the UK won’t have escaped you, but make sure you actually consider this as part of your packing process. In areas where it does get extremely hot during the summer, you’ll need to have the right clothes and furniture to match the lifestyle in a hotter climate. Equally, don’t forget that it does get cold as well in Spain, which is a very large country with varying climates depending on the region you are staying. You might also want to visit the Alps on a holiday, so don’t forget your winter gear for this. We recommend bringing items that are light and breathable, yet still appropriate for work and more formal events. As an expansive country much larger than the UK, Spain’s climate varies from region to region. In the North, it has a temperate climate, with mild winters and warm summers. In the South it gets extremely hot. You can also experience the cooling effects of the Ocean in Central Spain, which experiences extremes of both hot and cold. The cost of living in Spain It’s generally slighter cheaper in Spain than the UK. Part of this is the strength of the pound against the Euro, but it is also the fact that certain of life’s simple pleasures in Spain cost less, such as meals and alcohol. This can help you save more than you normally would be able to in a city such as London, for example. It’s worth remembering however that Spain is still in Europe, so prices will only be reasonably lower than you are used to. You will still have to budget a large portion of your income for things like accommodation and transport. Work and income Are you starting a new job? Or perhaps creating your own business that you will run from a Spanish city? Whatever you are doing, working in Spain will require a great detail of research and planning before you can make it work. As well as overcoming any language difficulties, you should consider the differences in workplace culture and how your employment and visa status impact things like your national insurance or your British pension. It is also worth looking into taxes that need to be paid in Spain. Speak Spanish? If your Spanish isn’t great, sign up for some classes before you go, to understand the basics. This will go a long way and you shouldn’t simply rely on the fact that English is spoken by many in the country. Even if you are going to be moving to an area with many British expats, like Costa del Sol, you will find that at least speaking a bit of Spanish will help, and if nothing else, is a show of respect to the locals. Transportation For Europeans looking for removals Spain, the most common method of goods transportation is by road. There are several expert removal companies who will be able to handle the packing and moving of your items through to Spain from the UK, however, check the company’s reputation before you commit to any. There will be a number of transport options for Spain removals where’re you items are either delivered as part of a shared truck load with the belongings of other individuals, or transported privately. This will impact the cost of the process, but there is usually an option to fit every budget. If you are still looking to save money however, you can always consider driving your items to Spain yourself in a rental van! Or simply cut down on the items you need and bring it all in your luggage?"

When you get to understand the different types of tents and their composition, it becomes easier to select the tent of your choice. You, therefore, receive ultimate satisfaction that will make you enjoy every of your camping adventure. Below are the common categories of camping tents: In their standard shape, dome tents compose of the most straightforward structures. However, most of these tents are extended ones. Some of the examples under this category include: a) The central dome which mostly contains symmetrical extensions on both ends. Such types include: Personal tent- a one-room tent Coleman Montana 8- a three-roomed tent Coleman red canyon 8 tent b) Extended dome types containing asymmetrical extensions. Examples here include: Coleman Carlsbad 6 tent- a screened tent Coleman Evanston 6- a screened tent- with a screened room attached to the main tent The advantages of a dome tent are that; they are simple to pitch, are lighter than other tents, and contains a reasonable amount of headroom. The disadvantage is that the sizes are limited, and they tend to attract wind. Just as the name suggests, this type of tents are stretched out with poles that create arches. They almost always consist of equal heights beside the tent’s main axes. They contain plenty of headroom. Examples include the tents with inflatable air beams, rather than the classic poles. For family camping, the majority of the tunnel tents contain several rooms. However, these tents do not stand freely; you must support the front and rear sides properly. Laterally, the tent is very stable, but still has several delicate lines on the side. Examples under this category include: Eurohike Buckingham Elite 8 Coleman Rocky Mountain 5 Vango Stanford 800 XL Other types of tunnel tents contain the internal triangular pressure bands, for instance, the Vango air beam tents. The advantages of tunnel tents are that: they have equal pole length, are lightweight, and have proper space to weight proportion. The disadvantage is that the middle part can remain sagging, can quickly move with strong winds, and must be pitched perfectly to avoid shakings. They compose of simple tent designs. Initially, they were made of canvas, supported by a steel pole on both sides. This type of tent contains poles that hold it up from both ends.

Such models do not have aluminum of plastic poles; instead, they need to be blown up either by mouth or an air pump. These types of camping tents are still developing. Therefore, based on the manufacturer, their durability varies significantly. The advantage is that an individual can set it up without help since they are easy to inflate, and they do not require metal poles. The disadvantage is that they are mostly smaller in size, yet heavier. You must also have an air pump since inflation via mouth may be difficult."

19,"Flying by private jet is not an indulgence, reserved for of the social elite",travel-leisure," Since of late, flying by private jet or executive jet has become increasingly popular in the world over. Similarly, air charter specialists have capitalized on this boom by tailoring services offering private jets and executive jets to a wider spectrum of the market. There are many reasons for this. Contrary to popular belief, flying by private jet is not only a luxurious and exclusive experience, it is also significantly more convenient and efficient as opposed to flying on commercial airlines. As the industry in which air charter specialists operate in continues to evolve, flying by private jet has become considerably more economical and accessible for both individuals and corporations alike. The benefits that flying by private jet affords a passenger are many. Chief amongst this being convenience. Unlike those on commercial airlines, passengers opting for private jets do not have to go through long lines at check-in and immigration and wait at baggage carousels to collect their belongings once their journey ends. Air charter specialists offer end-to-end service to their passengers i.e. passengers need only to arrive prior to their departure. Their baggage drop-off and emigration processes are exclusively attended to, before they are whisked away in luxury and comfort to the tarmac and on to their waiting jet. CONFIDENTIALITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF PRIVATE JETS Many private jet customers value confidentiality and the ability to stay connected, especially when travelling for short business trips. Almost all private jets are well-equipped with amenities that they would need whilst flying. Additionally, the flexibility that private jets afford are unmatched by commercial airlines, who may offer comparable luxuries in their first and business classes, albeit at fixed schedules. An extended benefit of this is valuable for travelers on business engagements that last less than a day. As private jet schedules can be tailored to requirements, business travelers need not book hotels and could easily attend to their engagements and leave straightaway to their origin. The overall freedom when flying in a private jet is what has enticed the well-heeled to part with extra cash and to fly via air charter specialists over the last few decades. At present, the versatility and freedom of flying by private jet has improved by leaps and bounds. Coupled with increased affordability, wider exposure of services and an increase in disposable income amongst the wealthy and middle-class segments of society, the popularity of flying by private jet is set to soar to greater heights in the time to come.

1,Your Beginners Guide to Smoking a Cigar the Right Way,travel-leisure," Smoking a quality cigar has become a novelty. But the steps involved can be overwhelming and somewhat complicated to a person that's new to smoking cigars. In this article we will discuss how to properly smoke a cigar and the steps involved from beginning to end. Either way you look at it, there is a certain type of vibe that comes with smoking a cigar. A certain type of energy if you will. It's not as simple as pulling out a cigarette and taking robotic puffs to satisfy a craving. Instead, smoking a cigar requires a certain type of etiquette. Almost ritualistic. There are unspoken rules. There are specific tools designed to enhance the experience. To appreciate the steps involved with smoking a cigar lets start from square one. Choosing the cigar. If it's your first time smoking a cigar I highly recommend you start with a longer, more thin cigar. The reason is simple. Short, stout cigars are typically much more powerful in taste, which can be overwhelming for an unseasoned smoker. Now that you have chosen your cigar, it is time to examine your cigar. Feel it. Smell it. Appreciate the craftsmanship that went into creating this work of art. Be sure to double check that your cigar is made of 100% tobacco, you don't want anything else. When you're examining your cigar you should check for bumps along the whole barrel of the cigar. The barrel refers to the cigar from end to end. The cigar should be even throughout. Also, be sure to check the tobacco. Examine the color. There should not be any discoloration in the tobacco. Now, before you indulge in your selected cigar you have to cut off the cap of the cigar. Whatever you do, do not bite off the cap. I repeat, do not bite off the cap of the cigar. Especially if you are smoking with people who are experienced cigar smokers. Instead, use a cigar cutter to chop off the cap of the cigar. You're not cutting off the whole cap either. There is a specific part you will be cutting. The details of cutting a cigar is another article within itself. You can use a single blade, but it is better if you use a double blade guillotine. Now that you have cut your cigar is time to light it up. Please use a cigar lighter during this step. Regular gas station lighters will not make the cut here. The best choice is to use a cigar torch lighter to fully ignite the flavor and smell of the cigar. Once your cigar is lit, it is time to smoke. If your cigar has a band wrapped around it you can remove this piece after a couple a puffs. It is important to note that when you smoke you should not be inhaling the smoke. Inhaling the smoke can make you sick, especially if it's your first time smoking. Rather, you should be holding the smoke in your mouth and savoring the flavor. As your cigar continues to burn, the intensity or flavor of the cigar may change depending on how the cigar was made. The cigar may have its highs, and it may have its lows. Kind of like a story. If you drink alcohol you can compliment the cigar with a glass of bourbon or cognac. Your choice. You now have a brief guide on how to properly smoke a cigar. Now go and show your friends how to truly smoke a cigar with class. Adan Ramirez has always been interested in cigars and sharing his knowledge of cigar culture to those interested. He currently helps run a website where they sell cigar accessories. Shop their selection today. You can visit their site today at http://www.MyCigarAccessories.com"

It is an ancient place; its hilly distances are punctuated with distended elephant-battered girths of massive baobabs that live for a thousand years, and the combination of ochre-red earth, pale russet grasses and parched paths of wide sand rivers fulfill images of ancient African landscapes. Ruaha’s unusually high diversity of animals is a function of its location, which is transitional to the acacia savannah of East Africa and the miombo woodland belt of Southern Africa. Wildlife in Ruaha National Park The Great Ruaha River is the centerpiece of wildlife safaris to Ruaha, characterized by groups of impala, waterbuck and other antelopes that risk their life for a sip of life-sustaining water. The impressive array of large predators is boosted by lions, cheetahs, both striped and spotted hyena, as well as several conspicuous packs of the highly endangered African wild dog. Grant’s gazelle and lesser kudu also occur here, alongside the miombo-associated sable and roan antelope, and one of East Africa largest populations of greater kudu. A similar duality is noted in the checklist of 450 birds: the likes of crested barbet, yellow-and-black bird occur in Ruaha alongside other species such as the yellow-collared lovebird and ashy starling. Best time to visit Ruaha For predators and large mammals, dry season (mid-May-December); bird-watching, lush scenery and wildflowers, wet season (January-April). The male greater kudu is most visible in June, the breeding season. Safari to Selous Game Reserve from Dar es salaam Size: 29,816 sq km (11,512 sq miles). Location: Southeast Tanzania, 450 km (285 miles) southwest of Dar es Salaam. Drive from Dar es Salaam to Selous takes approximately 5 hours The Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania is the world’s largest game reserve – 4 times the size of the Serengeti and covering an area greater than Switzerland. It is located in the Rufiji River basin and includes grasslands and forests. It possesses a diverse landscape from hot volcanic springs, sporadic lakes, channels from the Great Rhaha and Rufiji rivers. The Rufiji River, with its lagoons, sandbanks, lakes, and the surrounding forests and woodlands that make up the Selous create a very unique and unusual safari environment. Wildlife in Selous Game Reserve The Selous has a broad range of big game: buffalo – the largest population in Africa; Nyasaland gnu; brindled gnu; hartebeest; Greater Kudu; sable antelope; eland; reedbuck; bushbuck; waterbuck; warthog; zebras; giraffe; and wildebeest. Safaris in the Selous are famous for the elephant, hippopotamus and rhino (although now few remain) populations. Also: lion, leopard, the spotted hyena, and hunting dog are in abundance; cheetah are rare; there are over 350 species of bird and reptiles such as crocodiles and various snakes and lizards. There are many elephants, lions, zebras, and other wildlife in the reserve. Best Time to visit Selous Game Reserve Accessible year-round. The dry season, June-August. Wet season November-March. December- February. Safari to Udzungwa Mountains from Dar es salaam Size: 1,990 sq km (770 sq miles). Location: Five hours (350 km/215 miles) from Dar es Salaam; 65 kms (40 miles) Southwest of Mikumi. Drive from Dar es Salaam to Udzungwa Mountains National park takes approximately 6 hours Located west of Dar es Salaam, the Udzungwa Mountains National Park rises up from the western edge of the Selous Game Reserve. The Mountains are the largest and most biodiverse of a chain of a dozen large forest-swathed mountains that rise majestically from the flat coastal scrub of eastern Tanzania. Known collectively as the Eastern Arc Mountains, this archipelago of isolated massifs has also been dubbed the African Galapagos for its treasure-trove of endemic plants and animals, most familiarly the delicate African violet. Udzungwa mountains is not a conventional game viewing destination, but, it is a magnet for hikers. Wildlife in the Udzungwa Mountains Although not an ideal destination for a wildlife safari, the Udzungwa Mountains offer visitors the opportunity to view several species of primates and endangered birds in a beautiful African rain forest. Vervet monkeys play high in the forest canopy, and small forest antelope can be viewed at the right time of day. Of six primate species recorded, the Iringa red colobus and Sanje Crested Mangabey both occur nowhere else in the world – the latter, remarkably, remained undetected by biologists prior to 1979. Botanical diversity is exceptional, and the park is host to a large number of endangered bird species. Ornithologists are attracted to Udzungwa for an avian wealth embracing more than 400 species, from the lovely and readily-located green-headed oriole to more than a dozen secretive Eastern Arc endemics. Four bird species are peculiar to Udzungwa, including a forest partridge first discovered in 1991 and more closely related to an Asian genus than to any other African fowl. Undoubtedly, this great forest has yet to reveal all its treasures: ongoing scientific exploration will surely add to its diverse catalog of endemics. Best time to visit the Udzungwa Mountains Possible year-round although slippery in the rainy season. The dry season is June-October before the short rains but be prepared for rain anytime. Safari to Saadani National Park from Dar es salaam Size: 1,100 sq km (430 sq miles) Location: On the North Coast, roughly 100km (65 miles) northwest of Dar es Salaam and a similar distance Southwest of Tanga. Drive from Dar es Salaam to Saadani national park takes approximately 4 hours Saadani National Park is the perfect union of beach and bush, the only wildlife sanctuary in East Africa to boast an Indian Ocean beachfront; it possesses all the attributes that make Tanzania’s tropical coastline and islands so popular with foreign sun-worshippers. The park is a good choice for visitors based in Dar es Salaam, who don’t have time for longer safari vacations to the more remote parks around the country. Saadani is easily visited on a day trip or short weekend holiday from Dar es salaam. Its elephant population frolics in the sands and sometimes ventures into the crashing surf, which alone makes a Saadani safari more special and unique. It is also the one place where those idle hours of sunbathing might be interrupted by an elephant strolling past, or a lion coming to drink at the nearby waterhole! Wildlife in Saadani Surprisingly, a wide range of grazers and primates are seen on Saadani safaris or walks, among them giraffe, buffalo, warthog, common waterbuck, reedbuck, hartebeest, wildebeest, red duiker, greater kudu, eland, sable antelope, yellow baboon, and vervet monkey. Herds of up to 30 elephants are encountered with increasing frequency, and several lion prides are resident, together with leopard, spotted hyena and black-backed jackal. Boat trips on the mangrove-lined Wami River come with a high chance of sighting hippos, crocodiles and a selection of marine and riverine birds, including the mangrove kingfisher and lesser flamingo, while the beaches form one of the last major green turtle breeding sites on mainland Tanzania. The Wami River, which passes through Saadani and empties into the Indian Ocean, hosts a large population of hippos, crocodiles, flamingos, and many large bird species. Elephants are often viewed bathing and playing on Saadani’s beach, especially in the early hours of the morning. Best time to visit Saadani Generally accessible all-year-round, but the access roads are sometimes impassable during April and May due to the heavy rains. The best Saadani safari game-viewing is in January and February and from June to August."

7,Top 5 popular tourist places on the island of Lombok,travel-leisure," The Indonesian island of Lombok offers many attractions, both natural and manmade, which will not let you get bored while traveling in Bali. Rinjani Mount is one of the main beauties of the island. Climbing Rinjani, where the picturesque volcanic lake is also located, does not require special skills, as the slope of the mountain is smooth. However, one should keep in mind that the height of the mountain is 3,726 meters, and therefore the climbing will take at least one day. Then you will need to spend the night there and go down. We recommend contacting local travel agencies offering hiking tours. You can climb the mountain accompanied by a guide and porters. You can choose a convenient program of the tour. For example, according to a simple program, you can climb to the edge of the crater to the height of up to 2,700 meters. For lovers of hiking there are offers that are more eventful: climbing to the crater, relaxing by the lake and hot springs, and then climbing to the top of the mountain. The cost of such services starts from about 111 dollars. Another tourist destination is the Narmada Water Park, founded as early as in the XIX century by the royal dynasty. Narmada is a landscape architectural object of majestic size. On a large area, there are many attractions. For example, you can visit the Hindu temple Pura Kalasa, which is a monument of architecture. Probably, the fountain of youth, wrapped in a shroud of mystery, will attract your attention. The islanders sincerely believe that the water from this fountain can give a person eternal youth. After seeing all the wonders, you can visit the familiar modern water park, where you will not be able to get bored. One of the most famous beaches of Lombok — Kuta beach — is located in the south of the island. Many tourists point out not only the wonderful natural landscapes surrounding the beach, but also an active nightlife full of entertainment and fun. Another beach loved by the island’s guests is Senggigi beach, which is less popular than the sands of Kuta, but is also able to provide a comfortable rest for everyone. In addition to the beaches popular with travelers, there are plenty of quiet corners with clean soft sand and gentle waters where you can sunbathe and take air baths in complete solitude. Mayura Water Palace is of historical significance — in the past it was the center of the political life of the island. Now, being close to the bustling business district, it attracts tourists with traditional Balinese architecture. The buildings of the palace complex are located around a large pool and are immersed in the greenery of a picturesque garden, enclosed by a low wall of natural stone. A separate Bale Kambang pavilion, which can be reached via a small bridge, was used as a courtroom, and negotiations took place here. At the end of the XIX century, the palace was almost destroyed during hostilities between local residents and the Dutch conquerors. Later a huge park with statues and fountains was made there. The park has become a favorite leisure area for citizens; you can visit it from 7:00 to 19:30, entrance is paid. There are several Hindu temples on the island, but Pura Meru, built in 1720, is considered the largest. Giant drums, which stand in the outer courtyard of the temple, call local Hindus for ceremonial services with their loud sound. In the courtyard there are 33 beautiful statues dedicated to gods such as Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu. Before you enter the temple, you should leave a donation. The guard standing at the entrance will certainly make an entry about this in a special book. Lombok is a fairly big island, so it’s impossible to see around and explore all its wealth in one day. Visitors come here frequently to admire the natural beauty. Therefore, there are less tourists than in Bali, however, we can assure you, that the rest on the island of Lombok will be good and full of interesting adventures and new discoveries!"

10,8 Tips to be a savvy dental tourist and enjoy your dental vacation in Vietnam,travel-leisure," Planning for a travel trip overseas is always overwhelming, let alone planning for a dental vacation to a busy country like Vietnam. Problems and concerns that bug you when you arrange your trip, like the flight tickets, destinations to visit, where to stay or where to play, are now only a small proportion of your dental trip. If you’re currently devastated because of the amount of information to gather, this article will surely help you to plan your trip to Vietnam with practical knowledge and help you enjoy your vacation afterward. Tip 1: Do your homework The first tip to plan a dental vacation to Vietnam is to do all the homework. There are many dental clinics throughout Vietnam from North to South, so you have to do the research about clinics frequently mentioned in order to eventually choose a suitable clinic for you. If asking suggestions from an acquaintance isn't an easy way since they may not know much about the country, the internet is always available. You can take time and scroll through the dental forums about Vietnam and find the information on the clinics you already know about. Another option is to read the detailed information from the dental tourism facilitators’ website. They often list out top-notch clinics along with the information about the facilities and technologies of the clinic at once. Always remember to ask details about the treatment plan of your case. If you have any questions about the plan, whether about whether it's suitable or mentions the suggestion of your dentist, don't hesitate to ask. Facilitators and clinics are more than glad to respond to your questions. Tip 2: Ask for cost breakdown Finish asking about your treatment plan? Then it's time for you to ask even more questions, but about the price. Remember to ask for the cost breakdown of your treatment plan. Find out what your fee includes, and what's not. This way, you will have an overall view of what you're being charged by the dental clinics and make sure there's no extra fee just because you're a foreign customer. Tip 3: Make sure you get the best care Getting the best care is really important since if not, chances are you will face a lot of dental risks. In some cases, when you receive the materials from the locals, the dentist in your home country may have no idea how to maintain them when you need it. Therefore, make sure you check out the standardized material approved by the FDA (The Food and Drug Administration is a federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services) so that they can be recognized and approved globally. You should also examine the clinic’s facilities carefully before booking an appointment. Just take them into consideration if you want the get the best care! Tip 4: Does the dentist offer a translator? Vietnamese dentists do go through several English courses for dental terminology in medical universities. However, some of them are not so comfortable communicating in the language or find it hard to discuss and explain the in-depth treatment plan. As a result, you should ask the clinic beforehand whether they can communicate in English or they ready have translators in their clinics. This way, both you and your dentist can get a better understanding of the other's requirements. Tip 5: Buy dental tourism insurance Dental tourism insurance is always highly recommended when you decide to go for a dental vacation. The insurance will help you lower, or even prevent, the extra cost in case of treatment-associated risks (complications) and schedule risks. If you're going to do a complex dental procedure, there are certain risks you may occur post-procedure. When you occur these complications, it's your dental tourism insurance's job to save you from having to pay an extra-large amount of money just to treat the complications. Another inevitable situation is schedule risk. You may have some urgent works right before you’re about to get onto the flight. Or maybe your diagnosis online is not the right treatment anymore when the dentist has a closer look at your teeth, and you have to extend the plan. Dental tourism insurance will also have you rearrange your treatment schedule without a large extra-fee. Tip 6: Be smart about your itinerary All dental trips are not created following the same template. It has to be flexible and sometimes can be delayed because of your dental situation. Remember that you should have a backup plan in case anything happens. Knowing where and when to go is necessary. The destinations and the accommodation should be convenient for your checkup schedule which often lasts about 2 to 3 appointments. The dentist may suggest you not to physically exert yourself too much, so you should choose activities wisely to participate in and plan thoroughly to get the most out of the dental vacation. Whatever you do, make sure it prioritizes your health and your safety first. Tip 7: Ask for a functional dentist You should not choose the general dentist, make sure that the specialty of the doctor matches your dental problem well. For example, if you need an implant, choose the implantologist who has undergone intensive implant training. In order to choose the right dentist, you should ask directly the clinics or the consulting services. They will be able to provide you with the certification or accreditation of the doctors. Tip 8: Third-party opinions Sometimes, PR or marketing information can distort your thinking by displaying so many glamorous advertisements. They normally bias one or two clinics to attract you to come. So you will need a third party to evaluate fairly which clinic or dentist best suited to your requirements and preferences. You should check out international consulting services or accreditation organizations (cgr.com, whatclinic.com) and local facilitators such as lotusdentaltravel.com. They show the fair ratings and reviews of many top-notch clinics in Vietnam. These are reliable sites as the clinics or any marketing teams cannot manipulate the evaluations. Here you are, 8 tips to help you become a savvy dental tourist. Again, planning for a dental vacation is necessary, you should plan everything out to fit into your budget and your condition. Don’t forget to enjoy yourself with the recreational activities in a foreign place to help your dental treatment much more relaxing and fascinating. You deserve that!"

Just be sure to cut off the extra strap length or secure it tightly to avoid a safety hazard. Don’t let the bugs ruin your moment as you enjoy stargazing in the tranquil night from your tent, bring mosquito repellent with you. Most importantly, you need to wear the right clothing and safety gear as you hit the road – helmet, long pants, gloves and motorcycle jacket and shoes. When packing your clothing consider the temperature and the weather. Ideally, you should check the weather forecast ahead of time so you can choose the appropriate clothing to pack. See to it that you choose a good campsite on a higher ground which is flat, free from ant hills and creepy grasses and overall the most comfortable ground you can find. Nothing makes a motorcycle camping experience more trouble-free than making sure you are always prepared. Knowing the basics of outdoor cooking is a good start for your outdoor adventure survival. Plan recipes you can cook outdoor that only require minimal preparation and least amount of cookware. Whether you are an experienced motorcycle camper or if it's your first time, following these simple rules will go a long way to helping you achieve a fun and trouble-free motorcycle camping adventure!"

14,Are Boating Holidays the Best Holidays?,travel-leisure," If it’s true that ‘how we spend our days is how we spend our lives’, it would be just as accurate to suggest that ‘the way we spend our holidays is how we’d like to spend our lives’. Indeed, our preferred choice of holiday reveals a lot about the things we value in life. Families who head out camping, for example, are probably more inclined towards nature than the thrill seekers who descend on the Vegas strip each year. Similarly, couples who road trip to the Lake District are clearly more interested in seeking out some peace and quiet than couples who snap up a package holiday to Ibiza. Hopefully you get the point. With so many different kinds of holidays available to satisfy all tastes and dispositions, it would be tough to make an argument for there being a ‘best kind of holiday’. Then again, tough arguments are the best and most fun kind of arguments to make, so I’d like to throw one out there now. Specifically, I’d like to contend that boating holidays are the best kind of holidays. Here’s why. A holiday on board a boat is one without limitations. Forget being tied to one place, with a boat you can quite literally take off and explore somewhere new in a moment’s notice. You won’t have to contend with the usual travel irritations, either.  No, there’s no such thing as congestion and jaywalking pedestrians out on the water. Cruising from one destination to the next, you can enjoy a series of attractions without having to plan and follow a lengthy itinerary. How long you decide to step off the boat remains entirely up to you, of course. Fancy an entire afternoon in the pub or even a whole day walking around the mainland? No problem- just moor up and enjoy your time exploring. Naturally, there’s no hard and fast rules on board a boat. If you’d rather just kick back, you can do that. Mooring up far from anyone -or in the midst of things if that’s what you prefer- you can simply enjoy the on-board facilities without troubling yourself with plans for a day out. Did I mention that boating holidays are also appropriate for all ages? For big and small kids there’s water toys to enjoy, for teenagers there’s water sports, and for the older cruisers there’s sun loungers and saloons to unwind with. If you’re still not convinced, I’d wager that you will be once you discover that boating is something that can be enjoyed regardless of experience- it doesn’t matter if you’re not a seasoned yachtie, there’s companies out there who will be happy to train you up before seeing you off on board one of their boats. Ultimately, hiring a boat and exploring with your friends and family makes for an unforgettable experience. Quite literally the captain of your own destiny, you’re afforded the rare opportunity to do and go exactly where you please. What’s more, the diverse range of waterways which exist around the world mean that there’s somewhere for everyone to enjoy."
15,Seasonal hiking in New Zealand,travel-leisure," New Zealand has four very distinct seasons and there are unique and beautiful aspects to each time of year. There is no bad time of year to visit New Zealand as long as you’re prepared for what the season brings. New Zealand weather can also be quite unpredictable, so it pays to have a rain jacket and sun hat handy! Spring hiking in New Zealand In New Zealand, spring is September, October and November. This time of year is the start of our walking and hiking season. It is one of our favourite times of year and it’s not hard to see why. Weather-wise, temperatures in spring are relatively mild making it the perfect time to head out hiking. It can be quite fresh in the morning and evening, but there will be plenty of sunshine during the day. In saying that, the weather in New Zealand can be a bit unexpected, particularly at the start of spring during September. Warm sunny days can turn to rain and sometimes even snow so it’s best to be prepared. Waterfalls are an added bonus of hiking during spring. A lot of our hiking trails wander past waterfalls which are at their best in spring with a bit more rainfall and snow melt after winter. Milford Sound has some particularly impressive waterfalls which only get better with the rain. Summer hiking in New Zealand Summer in New Zealand is in December, January and February. Generally this means long, warm, sunny days. In saying that, we have been known to get snow on Christmas Day and a hot sunny day on Boxing Day so anything can happen! January and February are the warmest and driest months with temperatures between 23-28°C. It’s not common for temperatures to rise about 30°C across the country, making New Zealand summers great for hiking. Our dry climate and fresh breezes will help keep you cool, even on the hotter days. You’ll come across streams, lakes or the ocean on a lot of New Zealand hikes so there is often somewhere nearby to cool off! Autumn hiking in New Zealand March, April and May are the autumn months in New Zealand and the changing colours make this time of year especially beautiful. The temperatures drop a bit to around 18-23°C and the long days make this an ideal time of year for hiking. March is one of the best months for hiking with settled weather and plenty of daylight to hit the trails without the summer crowds. Daylight saving ends in April when we move our clocks back and you notice the days starting to get shorter. This does mean the mornings are lighter with sunrise around 7am, and sunsets around 6pm at this time of year are particularly amazing. Temperatures start to noticeably cool down in May, when the South Island sometimes gets a bit of a snow if a cold front comes through. It can also drop below 10°C during the day so it pays to be prepared with a warm jacket and some extra layers. You can feel the oncoming winter in late May with shorter days and cooler temperatures, ready and waiting for the ski season to kick off! Winter hiking in New Zealand Winter in New Zealand is during June, July and August. This is the time of year when some Kiwis will hang up their hiking boots and replace them with ski boots! Cold weather runs the length of the country but in the whole scheme of things, it isn’t too extreme. There are still hiking trails around for well-equipped experienced hikers. You just need to be prepared for the conditions whether it’s the cooler weather or snow and ice on the trail. The North Island has reasonably mild winter temperatures between 10-16°C. You might see the occasional frost inland and some colder nights – cooler nights are common across the whole country. The far north doesn’t get very cold at all with temperatures staying up around 15-16°C throughout winter. Make sure to pack your woollies for the South Island. The weather down south is more extreme with frosts and snow across the mountains, sometimes even down to low levels. Temperatures will generally sit below 10°C but blue-sky days and snow-capped mountains make this a pretty magical time of year. So when is the best time to go hiking in New Zealand? Hiking in New Zealand is something that you can do all year round, but spring, summer or autumn would be the best with longer days, milder temperatures and more settled weather. Some hiking trails are closed over winter with variable conditions on the trails due to snow, ice or heavy rainfall so make sure you check this out before coming if there is a particular hike you’re set on doing."

18,Top 4 Reasons for Backpacker Travel Insurance Claims,travel-leisure," Backpackers are largely made up of young travellers and statistics show that they account for one-fifth of all international travel in the tourism industry. A growing percentage of these travellers are now getting backpacker travel insurance before they start out on their journeys. They have begun to realise that when going on such long travels, it is better to be safe than sorry. As much as one might try to avoid it, there are times when these travellers do have to claim their insurance. Some claims, however, come up more frequently than others. Here is a list of the top 4 reasons why backpackers end up claiming insurance: This is by far the most common reason why backpackers claim insurance. The residents of the UK have the NHS, which helps keep medical bills in check. However, there are a large number of countries that do not have such medical support systems. In fact, many countries offer only private healthcare. What this means is that medical bills can skyrocket. And if you are on a budget, that could mean the difference between life and death if you have a serious injury or illness and cannot afford to pay for treatment. Backpackers tend to stay within their budgets by hostels or other cheap accommodations. There is therefore the risk of their belongings being stolen. Backpackers can even end up losing their belongings when they are out and about. While losing your clothes is not such a big deal, losing more valuable items like money or electronics is a much more troublesome. Besides the financial hit, most travellers – especially backpackers – are digitally connected nowadays. Bookings, routes and other information critical to their travels is on their smartphone or tablet. Backpacker travel insurance covers losses, so while you may not get your belongings back, at least you can recover your costs. According to the 2018 Tourism Survey, there has been a 22% rise in travellers visiting new destinations. However, some countries have been marked as more dangerous to travel to than others. And the number on this list has been growing in recent times. What this means is that while you may have planned to visit a particular country, unrest there could lead to you being forced to avoid travelling there. If you have to do so, then your travel insurance will cover you for the money you because of these unexpected circumstances. There are tons of stories about how people have missed their connecting flights for no fault of their own. There are also times when an injury or illness may have forced you to stay in one place longer that you had planned. This means that you would need to re-arrange your schedule – re-book flights, accommodation, and so on. Travel insurance helps you recover a large part of your costs, thereby taking out some of the stress and added expense on your trip. If you are planning a backpacking trip, ensure that you make a detailed schedule of what you plan to do so that you can get the right kind of backpackers travel insurance to give you the buffer you need on your journey."

Choosing which One is Need to Motorize: If you already have a bike, that’s great, but you should make sure it is suitable for the amount of power you will be mounted on it. Don’t worry, most bikes are, the most important factor to look for is how sturdy the frame is. It has to be sturdy enough to not bend over time when a powerful motor is mounted on it. A sturdy frame is not expensive at all. The cheapest bikes usually have steel frames, more expensive ones probably have aluminum frames. The ones to be careful about are the expensive carbon fiber frames. If you have one of those you have to be a little bit more careful about which type of e-bike kit you install. A front wheel hub motor is putting the most pressure on the frame (front fork), a mid-drive or rear wheel motor is preferable if you have a light but weak carbon fiber frame. To summarize this; A sturdy steel frame – You can choose any kit you want. A good aluminum frame – You can choose any kit you want but beware not to get a too powerful one if you choose a front wheel hub motor (750-1500W).

As long as you have a sturdy front fork there is not much to worry about. Easy to install – Anyone can follow the instructions. Low cost – The best electric bike kit if your wallet gets to decide. Fits most bikes – Most bikes have a standard mount size. If it is a bit too narrow you can often bend it in with a little force. Shorter wiring – Most wires go from the front wheel to the handlebar. Don’t forget to fasten the wires to the frame. Can lose traction when it is slippery – There is not as much weight on the front as on the rear wheel. Can damage the front fork mounting slot – Won’t be a problem if you either have a sturdy front fork or choose a 500W motor or less. You can also get a torque arm to support the front fork. A rear wheel conversion kit puts less pressure on the frame and is still relatively simple to install. Easy to install – Anyone can follow the instructions. Low cost – The best electric bike kit if your wallet gets to decide. Good traction – When the motor is at the rear it becomes a bit back heavy and gets better traction Better handling – Rear wheel drive gives you more stability and a smoother ride Fits most bikes – Make sure the bike’s mount size matches the Ebike kit. Steadily mounted – A rear hub motor has good support from the frame. Can be a bit difficult to mount the gears – It can be hard to fit all the gears in place after mounting the hub motor. Longer wiring – Fasten your wires with zip ties or an equivalent neatly to the frame of the bike. A powerful motor may lift the front – Only a really powerful motor and a back heavy bike can do a wheelie. A mid-drive conversion kit is probably the best but also most difficult to install. Good traction – The motor drives the chain and back wheel where most of the weight is Better handling – Rear wheel drive feels more smooth and easier to handle Steadily mounted – The frame supports the motor well More effective motor – It uses the existing gears of the bike for power efficiency Low gravity – Low gravity gives you better handling and balance Does not fit all bikes – Make sure the measurements are correct for the attachment point More wear on the chain and gears – As it is using the existing chain and gears for efficiency there is also more wear Susceptible to damages from gravel and curbs – As the motor rests below the bike it can get hit by rocks flying up or high curbs Expensive – Cost a bit more than a hub-motor but truly is the best electric bike kit out there. There are other motor types such as Friction-drive, Internal motors, and All wheel drive motors. The ones above are the most common and certainly the best motor types for this purpose. It is not easy to choose the best electric bike conversion kit between the ones that are listed, but I am certain you will find one that is perfect for you. When buying an Ebike kit the saying ""you get what you pay for"" is certainly true. Especially when choosing between batteries.

18,6 Things to Do in Vilnius in the Summertime,travel-leisure," Vilnius attracts more and more tourists every year and has already become one of the most popular capital cities in Eastern Europe, especially among long weekend travelers. Even if you are going to spend only single day here, you still might have a great time and all you need to do is plan your trip in advance. So for everyone planning to visit the capital city of Lithuania in the summertime, we have a list of top 6 activities to attend while being in Vilnius. These activities include sightseeing UNESCO heritage sites, admiring nature and contemporary art, lying on the beach near lakes, having a cup of coffee while enjoying panoramic view and finally tasting dinner cooked from local seasonal products. Keep reading and find out more about things local people recommend to do in Vilnius during the season of summer holidays. Let's take a walk It is always a good idea to start your stay in Vilnius by joining free walking tours arranged daily by Lithuanian guides (Vilnius with Locals Tours). To see most of the attractions of the city, you should consider taking part in two-hour Old Town & Užupis tour. Vilnius Historic Centre is one of the UNESCO world heritage sites and is preserved for its Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance and classical architecture while Užupis district (self-declared Republic of artists) is full of art shops, unexpected installations and has an atmosphere of freedom and bohemian spirit. On the other hand, if you want to see Vilnius from a different perspective, then you should step outside from the city centre into the periphery and find lesser known and sometimes even hidden from tourists places. It is the best way to get acquainted with not so shining but the real face of Vilnius during free alternative Vilnius tours. These tours show modern street art objects and everyday life of Lithuanians while visiting station area and Naujamiestis district. A moment to relax After a walking tour you might want to take a seat and enjoy some coffee to get energized for the rest of your day. A lovely place to do that is Subačiaus street panoramic viewpoint with café in the neighborhood. Here you can admire the panorama of Vilnius and see Gediminas Castle, Hill of Three Crosses, TV Tower, church spires and many more in the distance. An information stand will help you spot all aforementioned objects. However, if you prefer the city bustle, then you should visit Pilies street which is aligned with the oldest buildings of Vilnius and is full of outdoor cafés, restaurants, souvenir shops and people rushing around. Enjoy the nature The greatest place in Vilnius to spend a wonderful afternoon surrounded by nature is Vilnius University Botanical Garden. The bloom of rhododendrons starts in May but some of the species delight us till the end of June. Nevertheless, the main adornment of the garden are peonies and roses. They fill the air up with light aroma and surprise visitors with the variety of colors and abundance of blossoms. In addition to this, the perfect calmness, murmur of the old trees and singing birds supplement the picturesque landscapes of flower fields. The best time to visit Botanical Garden of Vilnius University and familiarize with local flora is in the beginning of summer, but this place is not the only one that can amaze every nature's lover. A place where nature and art merge Park of Europe (Europos Parkas) is another remarkable green site in Vilnius, yet it is an outdoor museum of modern art as well. There you can find a collection of over 100 sculptures under the open sky created by artists from countries all over the world (among them are such artists as Dennis Oppenheim and Solas Le Witt). What is more, Europos Parkas was established in 1991 to denote a spot where geographic centre of Europe is located (as determined by the French National Geographic Institute in 1989). Thus while walking in the park, you will officially be in the middle of Europe! Lie on the beach Not far away from the Park of Europe there is one more worth visiting place - Verkiai Regional Park with Green Lakes. So when you will get tired of excursions, you might want to rest just like most summer tourists do. In Verkiai Regional Park you can simply lie down on the beach and refresh yourself in the water of six Green Lakes. There are also basketball and volleyball courts for visitors who prefer active leisure. You may rent a boat or participate in jogging, too. This way enclosed by beautiful surroundings you will feel the relaxing vacation atmosphere, just don't forget to sample some homemade ice-cream or delicious local drinks. Taste Lithuanian cuisine After the intense day you will definitely want to fill your belly with yummy food. For this reason, the last but not the least thing you must do in Vilnius is to taste local dishes. If you think that Lithuanian cuisine consists of only black bread, zeppelins and potato pancakes, then come to Sweet Root in Užupis and their chefs will prove you are wrong. This restaurant is one of the most popular spots to taste seasons-inspired cuisine. When choosing ingredients owners of the Sweet Root focus on locally sourced produce that grows in Lithuania at that particular time of a year. Large part of the products are from their own garden, forests and meadows. The rest arrive from trusted Lithuanian farmers. We hope that these top 6 things to do in Vilnius during the summertime will make your trip planning easier and you will experience pleasant holiday while spending as much time outdoors as possible. If you still lack of ideas about what to do and see in Vilnius, Lithuania or you would like to be guided through your stay here, then ask for help and leave all the organisational tasks to friendly and professional local guides.

Camping along our route at the Tugela Mouth is a glorious and amazing experience but it is worth noting some precautions ahead of time in the event of being caught in severe weather storms, malicious theft or even fire. We have put together some handy tips to stay cautious and help you stay safe in the event of the following happening whilst staying at our camping site. Targeted Criminal Activity We cannot predict or pre-empt if theft or robbery will happen in remote or camping areas but we take safety seriously, but it is something we all have to be mindful off. Restricting the amount of cash, fancy gadgets or valuables you carry is best for starters, so as to reduce the worry that theft could bring or entice temptation for robbers to strike your tent or caravan. Fire Outdoor fires at campsites are synonymous with this lifestyle activity, however things can go wrong very quickly if weather becomes too strong or windy, or if items that are flammable accidentally catch fire. Be extremely care with campfires, gas stoves or braai stands or even technology with batteries in them. We just never know what can occur in the blink of an eye, so it is best to err on the side of caution especially when exposed to the elements for when you do not have fire blankets or extinguishers to put out fires fast. Shelter If you are venturing to our campsite, please ensure that you have safe and weatherproof tents or caravans when camping out. It is advised that you have a tent that is pitched securely, can zip up safely and can protect you from the wet or windy weather too. Caravans should be well secured, braked properly to avoid rolling or movement. If you are operating stoves or other appliances be certain that is safely secured and meets the regulatory standards to avoid any disasters. Appliances should also be switched off when not in use. Sanitation Whilst outdoors sometimes nature calls and we go back to basics but hygiene and safe sanitation is just as imperative as having access to communications whilst away from main land. We have the right facilities to ensure hygiene is of paramount importance for life’s necessary habits like showering or using the loo. Drinking Water Do ensure that you carry your own water for your hikes, washing and drinking. Whilst water quality may differ in parts of the region - we advise that you take precaution in carrying your own water in case of emergencies, and for late at night where you may not want to leave your tent. Weather South Africa’s weather can be unforgiving sometimes and when exposed to the elements under the wide open sky it can certainly cause some chaos, if not as well equipped and prepared.

1,10 Must-Do Experiences on an Australia Vacation,travel-leisure," Sure, Australia has plenty of must-see attractions. But a great vacation isn’t just about the tourist spots. Those little local or cultural experiences make all the difference when experiencing a new country, particularly one that has a lot in common with home. Here are ten uniquely Aussie experiences we can recommend to first timers and return visitors alike. Some are routine, while others are signature Aussie encounters locals should get around to, but never do. Either way, consider this your ""other"" bucket list for a great Australia vacation. North Americans have started to catch on in recent years, as more and more Aussie baristas have introduced this stronger, smoother latte-style beverage to independent cafes across Canada and the United States. Oh, and Starbucks sells something they call a cough ""flat white"" too. But none compare to a flat white ordered from a good independent café in Australia. If you’re downtown in one of the state capitals, a line-up of local office workers before 10am usually signals a winner. But the two essential flat white experiences one can have as a visitor are sipping one in one of Melbourne’s fabled inner city laneways, or overlooking the ocean in a Sydney beach suburb. Just be warned that if you’re also visiting New Zealand, they claim to have invented the drink first. So, in the interests of trans-Tasman relations, let folks in both countries keep their version of the story, and just enjoy your coffee. Like the flat white, it’s not for lack of effort. But if there’s a better meat pie than one you can pick up in an Aussie bakery, I’ve not yet found it. Despite numerous attempts to franchise and mass-market the humble Aussie meat pie, the best pies are usually sold fresh over the counter in suburban, or better yet, country town bakeries around Australia. This makes them an ideal snack to break up a long road-trip on your Australia vacation. Whether it’s mince, steak, chicken, veggie, cheese, curry, or a mix of the above, this Australian favourite is not to be missed. Just don’t skimp on the tomato sauce, and whatever you do, don’t call it ketchup. While Australia can be an expensive country to visit, many of its best attractions in the big cities are free. That includes the famed arcades and laneways of Melbourne. Shopping, dining, and coffee are all local obsessions, so you’ll probably spend a good amount of your Melbourne CBD (Central Business District) time roaming the intimate alleys and passageways that connect the city’s main streets. Melbourne’s street art is almost as famous, earning comparisons to cities such as New York and Berlin. So take your time enjoying this underground aspect of the city’s fierce creativity. Looking to splurge on a truly memorable day out? Enjoy a touch of Sydney’s glamorous side and go out on the water. Many of Sydney Harbour’s most picturesque coves and nooks take some effort to reach by land. A harbour cruise can not only get you there quickly, but offer you the best views as well. In addition, there may be nothing more ""Sydney"" than a barbecue lunch overlooking Sydney Harbour, either on land or on the water. Sydney Opera House and Bridge, Sydney, Australia Cruise beautiful Sydney Harbour You’ll find farmers’ markets in pretty much any Australian city. For the most part, they’re much the same as farmers’ markets anywhere else. But the Queen Victoria Market or ""Vic Market"" in Melbourne stands head and shoulders above the rest. Serving the country’s culinary capital, this historic landmark is the city’s favourite spot for fresh food, artisan meats and cheeses, wine, and a whole lot more. It’s also a nice spot to pick up souvenirs for friends and family back home. While Sydney’s tastes might run a little upscale these days, this is still a beach town at heart. Easy access to crisp, tasty, unpretentious fish and chips is a necessity, particularly in popular beach suburbs like Bondi, Coogee, or Manly. While we don’t recommend combining this with your flat white overlooking the ocean, you certainly wouldn’t be the first to do so. No visit to Australia is complete without a taste of its Aboriginal culture. The traditions of various Aboriginal nations vary widely in different parts of the country, meaning you can engage with authentic Aboriginal culture almost anywhere on your Australia vacation. It may mean taking a dreamtime walk, enjoying a traditional dance performance or hunting demonstration in Kuranda rainforest, taking a guided walk around the base of Uluru and learning about its sacred connection to the Anangu people, or, if your timing is right, seeing a performance by Bangarra, Australia’s indigenous modern dance company. Australia’s Aboriginal culture is endlessly diverse, and so are the opportunities for visitors to engage with it in a respectful and enriching manner. Whether it’s the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Central New South Wales Coast, Bondi Beach, or beyond, Australia’s east coast offers a seemingly endless choice of beautiful white sand beaches. It’s worth getting up before dawn on at least one day of your Australia vacation to watch the sun rise over the Pacific. Let the steady crash of waves on the sand be the only soundtrack to this truly magical Australia experience. Surfers walk along the Gold Coast beach at sunrise, Queensland, Australia Surfers walk along the Gold Coast beach at sunrise Some wine snobs may turn their noses up at the ""new world"" tastes of Australia and New Zealand. Good. That means all the more for you. The big three Australian wine regions are South Australia’s Barossa Valley, the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, and the Margaret River region of Western Australia. But you can find smaller wine regions all over the country, including McLaren Vale, just outside of Adelaide, Victoria’s Yarra Valley, and Queensland’s Granite Belt. Take an organized day trip from the nearest big city, or add a couple of days in wine country to your self-drive Australia vacation. If you’re going all the way to Australia, you’re going to want to see the unique Australian wildlife. Whether it’s at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo, the Irwin family’s Australia Zoo on the Sunshine Coast, an encounter in the wild on Kangaroo Island, or on a bush safari outside Melbourne, there are plenty of ways to see Australia’s most iconic creatures. You might even splurge on something truly unique, on your Australia vacation, such as a dive with whale sharks on Western Australia’s Ningaloo Reef, or hand-feeding wild dolphins at Brisbane’s Tangalooma Resort. Feeding Wild Dolphins at Tangalooma, Australia. Virgin Australia launched over a decade ago and instantly changed the way people fly. Today, Virgin Australia represents a new level of style, sophistication and professionalism.

The buildings in art nouveau style, shining glitter on the dresses from the storefronts and stylish people around, this neighborhood has its own mood, for sure. Cihangir Located between Taxim square and the port, this neighborhood is definitely one of the most attractive areas to walk.

Besiktas You have probably heard this name if you are interested in football because this district is home to the famous Turkish soccer club Besiktas. Cafes, bars, markets, shops, and parks, if you want to see the real local life, come here. Ortaköy This neighborhood is located right by the Bosphorus and is famous for its street food. To be honest, this is quite a touristic place that is usually noisy on the daylight. But it still worth to visit if you are traveling along the Bosphorus. Bebek Expensive waterside apartments, a bay with yachts, fancy restaurants and cafeterias - this place is perfect for a bike ride or a walk along the seaside. Büyükada It’s the largest of the nine Princess islands in the Marmara Sea. It’s a perfect place to chill and enjoy the nature. You can come here on a ferry (city water transport) from at least all the main Istanbul ports. It’ll cost 10 TL or around 2$ Moda You couldn’t say that you see Istanbul entirely if you didn’t visit the Asian side. Located in Kadikoy district, Moda is the most popular place among the youth, open-minded and artistic people. This area is full of small and cozy hipster cafes, bars and vintage shops. So, where to stay? If you travel to Istanbul for 1 week or less, it would be great for you to stay somewhere around Galata, Taxim or Sishane metro station as you could easily get to the main attractions. But if you are planning to stay more, check Beshiktash, Cihangir or Kadikoy. Both of these neighborhoods have a great infrastructure and are not so touristy and hectic as Sultanahmet or Taksim."

The ""adult campers"" or 17+ year olds of the camp are trained to lead like our camp counselors acting as mentors to their mentees or younger campers. They are encouraged to flex their leadership abilities, learn first aid and CPR, and also advise the younger ones. This is an invaluable skill and certification that can be added onto their CV to improve their chances of employment for the young school leavers. A medical doctor is also always on standby should there be an emergency and is also under constant surveillance for the safety and wellbeing of all residing at the cabin park making it their prime priority.

20,5 offbeat things that you can do in Istanbul?,travel-leisure," My arrival in Istanbul was very indifferent. The aesthetic environment of this place left me asking for more. Never would have I imagined this place to turn out such a perfect spot for me. There are a lot of attractive places to visit in Istanbul, but this time my heart wanted something else. Places like Grand Bazaar, Hagia Sophia and Galata Tower are too good to beat, but this time I wanted to visit some offbeat places. I asked a lot of locals about this and to my luck they were a great help for me. You can also set your feet on these offbeat places in Istanbul and to make that cheaper, and you can book your flight tickets to Istanbul on Cheapbestfares. So here are some of the best offbeat places that you should definitely visit during your next trip to this city of Turkey. 1.Basilica Cistern When I stepped in the city, I was busy visiting the famous places and didn’t have a clue that all this time I was walking over an ancient cavern. I got familiar with this place once a local taught me about its existence.  After knowing about it, I was given the direction which led me to a dark passage, and on the other end of the stairs, I found myself standing in a water reservoir which was built in the 16th Century. There is still some water left here even after it is shut for a long time. You might find some fish swimming in it but worry not, you will have to walk on the wooden planks to go to the other side. The place is a bit dusky and gloomy but trust me there are no ghosts. 2.Prince Island Istanbul is always crowded, and you would definitely want to relax a bit away from all the hustle- bustle of the city. And I found just the place that would serve the purpose for you. Prince Island is an offbeat place located in the outskirts of the city away from the crowd. The local people visit this place during the summers as the Island is accessible using the ferry. One can find beautiful monuments, some residential houses, tasty cafes, and some historical buildings here. You would not find even a single motorized transport so, it is quite serene here. The chilly wind coming from the sea, a bottle of beer and tasty food. Sounds perfect? 3.Ferry Ride Now exploring Istanbul is usual when you walk the streets. I was so thrilled as soon as I got to know that ferries can give you a city tour. It is something really different and thrilling. Later on, it turned out to be a better way of exploring the city. But remember one thing, there would be many boats in the water that would charge you a lot, instead of taking those ride to opt for the usual ferry. They are cheap and flexible as well. For saving more money, you can definitely book the flight tickets from Cheapbestfares. 4.Jewish History We all know the fact that Turkey is a Muslim dominant country, but it has a very long history of Jewish settlement. Once you are here, don’t get stuck to the Muslim monuments because the place has a lot of else things to showcase. You can take a short tour of the land of Jewish heritage. Turkey served a high number of Jews during the 1400s. And during the year 1492, the number of Jews living in the city increased because Spain expelled all the Jews from their country. 5.Galata Bridge I love fishing, and this is the reason I visited the Galata Bridge over and over again. Each day you can find a lot of fishers catching fish from this bridge. Even if you aren’t interested in fishing, the sight alone turns out to be fabulous. You can have a light time watching people trying to catch fish and return home barehanded. Now, these are the things that I loved doing, and you won’t find many people doing all this. But if you wish to enjoy the time as I did, book your air tickets now on Cheapbestfares. So get going and book it now."

1,Are You Getting Into A Licensed Minibus?,travel-leisure," Are you getting into a licensed minibus? How you ever given any thought as to whether the minibus you're getting into is licensed? Would you insured if god forbid there were to be an accident and the driver of the bus was at fault? Maybe some care and consideration should be given before stepping into an unlicensed minibus or coach—as you may just be getting into one! But how do you know if a coach/minibus is licensed? Without being completely brazen and asking; there are a few subtle ways you can tell. Licensed coach/minibus operators must display their license in the window of the vehicle. This license looks very similar to the old tax disc and how that used to be displayed. And what does this license look like? There are three different types of license a coach/minibus operator can have: Restricted, standard national and standard international. Restricted: The restricted license is an orange coloured disc. This license allows the operator to run a maximum of two minibuses at a total of 16 seats for each one in the UK. No coaches are permitted on this license. Standard national: An operator with a standard national license can run minibuses and/or coaches in the UK. A blue disc will be displayed in the window to indicate this. The number of buses they can have on the road is granted by the traffic commissioner and is ultimately subject to certain criteria: The size of their operating centre, financial standing, a competent transport manager, etc. Standard international: This license is the same as the standard national and requires similar criteria—however, it is permitted for international use as well. The standard international can be verified by a green disc in the window of the bus. Is there anything else is immediately noticeable? The operator must display their business address somewhere on passenger side door. This piece of text tends to be more subtle; but it is certainly visible and it is also a legal requirement. A competent and licensed coach/minibus operator WILL have their address displayed on their vehicles. What other requirements are there for a licensed operator? The list is quite extensive for the number of requirements that is mandatory for keeping buses legal on the road, so let's highlight the key factors aside from the above! Drivers' Hours and CPC: By law, drivers of minibuses and coaches must follow the drivers' hours regulations which you can find HERE. These hours are recorded onto the tachograph fitted inside the bus. Each driver has their own unique drivers' card which is similar to a driving license; but it has a chip in it which stores all the data from the tachograph. The information on the driving hours is kept by the operator and the transport manager. Professional drivers must also undertake 35 hours of period CPC (certificate of professional competence) training every 5 years. On completion of the 35 hours of training, drivers will receive their CPC qualification card. This card is a legal requirement for any professional driver who wishes to drives for hire and reward. Safety Inspections: Minibus and coach operators must have their vehicles regularly inspected at regular intervals by a competent person/garage. These intervals should be either: 6 weekly, 8 weekly, 10 weekly or 12 weekly. The age of the bus, condition and mileage it covers will be determining factor for how often it should be inspected. Usually if a bus is over 10 years old, it should be going in every 6 weeks at least. Daily walk around checks: Before a vehicle is driven away for the working day, it must be checked over by the driver to ensure it's in a safe and roadworthy condition. This is called: The daily walk around check. The driver will inspect the vehicle and check to make sure things such as: tyres, lights, windows, seat beats, etc, are all in working order. A defect book should always be kept inside the bus which the driver must fill out and sign if he/she has found any defects. Any such defects are to be reported to the operator and rectified at once. Are there any exceptions? There is an exception that makes you exempt from all the hassle of obtaining an operators license. This is the section 19 permit: This is used voluntary organisations that don't make a profit from the public, such as: Churches, charities, sporting or educational groups. The driver is still required to have relevant license to drive the bus, but tachographs, safety inspections, and all the rest of it doesn't matter. Seemingly, the number of criteria that is required to legally have a licensed minibus/coach operation can look daunting. Maybe this is the reason a lot of people choose to get a minibus and ignore the requirements. There a substantial amount of time and effort that goes into it; but most importantly: It is to keep you safe! I have attached various links throughout this article with plenty of information on each section."

Food is also a means of connecting with home while adapting to the changing palate over time and takes into consideration the appetite of the local community. The following countries have practices that maintain different styles of etiquette associated with their cuisine which are inherent to the heritage and are connected to the importance of the culture. Italian dining culture is renowned around the world in connection with a revelatory outlook on life’s pleasures, including delicious hand-made pasta. While certain rules of Italian dining have become well-known over the years--such as never ordering a cappuccino after noon--the true art of Italian dining etiquette becomes apparent in the leisurely pace of service and the respect Italian chefs and customers give their food. The various kinds of pasta and array of sauces do not contain an over-indulgence of herbs and instead contain a minimal list of ingredients meant to accentuate the specific flavors of each item used. Tortellini, for example, a handmade pasta resembling a naval and often stuffed with cheese or meat, is typically served in a small portion in a broth or with a sauce like pesto, marinara, garlic and sage, or creamy mushroom. The serving size is indicative of the respect diners pay to the cuisine who believe too many additional ingredients detract from the overall flavor. Instead of overindulging, they choose to appreciate the deceptively complex flavors in front of them which are crafted from simple ingredients. All of this and more goes into appreciating the craftsmanship of the handmade dumpling. Not only does a tortellini dish encompass the integrity of Italian cuisine, it acts as a symbol of the reemergence of the slow Italian meal that accentuates the joy of a good, lasting culinary experience. A variety of procedures around Japanese meals make them a ceremony of culture Japan is a country known for its reliance on, and connection to etiquette that supports a civilized and courteous society that believes in good manners in order to demonstrate respect. The various components of Japanese dining etiquette rely on the different contexts of a meal. During formal occasions, Japanese sit on a reed mat in a kneeling position while they sit cross-legged during a casual dining experience. Contrary to western standards, they slurp their soup during the meal to show the chef appreciation of the noodles. While proper dining manners may help you avoid embarrassment or from offending someone during the meal, the culture dictates that customs of dining can also enhance the particular flavors of the meal. As one of three national food traditions recognized by the UN for its cultural significance, Japanese cuisine stimulates pride in its preparation and joy in its consumption with each dish arranged and presented after a great deal of thought. Instead of thinking in terms of four seasons, Japanese cuisine can inhabit dozens of seasons in a single year all depending on the freshest ingredients at a given time to enhance various tastes. Throughout the year there is great variance on the plate such as bitter ingredients in March or sweet items in October. Japanese cuisine often looks deceptively simple but side-sauces and additional flavors like wasabi or ginger add diversity when used in small quantities. It is important not to overpower the initial seasoning of the main dishes. However, the initial joys of Japanese cuisine stem from a simple act of gratitude before the meal. Saying itadakimasu before eating, which translates to ""I gratefully receive,"" shows respect to those who have made and served the food. The attitude of appreciation establishes a comfortable and lasting environment allowing the host, servers, chefs, and guests to indulge in the pleasures of the experience. Eating is a crucial component of French culture and has resulted in a plethora of rules meant to respect dinner guests, hosts, restaurant chefs, servers, and customers. Many of the rules placed upon the dinner table date back to Louis the XIV but have since become common in French dining custom, whether out at a restaurant or while eating at home. These rules apply while indulging in one of the country’s over 400 official cheeses or sitting down for a large lunch as opposed to a heavy dinner. The main component to any French meal is time. The average French citizen spends more than 45 minutes at lunch each day which is a reflection of the importance of savoring your food and finding the delicate flavors of each dish during a proper meal. The importance of different courses and taking the time to appreciate the array of options in a starter, main, dessert, and possible cheese plate highlights the importance of the culinary arts in French culture and its ability to bring people together. The portion sizes are often smaller which make it easier to finish each course. This allows the diner to enjoy every bite while appreciating the pleasure of accompaniment. A slow meal in France symbolizes life’s pleasures with cuisine made to look beautiful, smell great, and taste divine. Whether in a private home or at a chic restaurant, beauty stems from elegance. For instance, the simple idea of a well-set table according to French culinary custom has the desired effect of slowing down a meal in order for family members, dinner guests, or restaurant patrons to better appreciate the meal."

17,Travel to the Land of Perfumes – Grasse,travel-leisure," France has given the world a lot of amazing artistic masterpiece be it in fashion, art, entertainment or food. But France has also given the world Grasse, which is the world capital of perfumeries. When in Grasse there’s aroma everywhere. This little town is where perfumes started orchestrating the olfactory of the humans. History says that the city was not a place for fragrances initially. It was land that was once had a strong business in leather products and tanning. The smell of leather was annoying to the locals and the visitors. Therefore a local tanner named Jean de Galimard decided to invent perfumed gloves for the workers. A while later the aroma was so liked the people of Grasse that scented gloves became a status quo for all the aristocrats. And it was then the world got its favorite brand the Gallimard in the year 1714. Currently, the beautiful city of Grasse has multiple perfumery institutes, museums, and shops that employ near about half the town. Perfumery is the civic exercise that every resident of Grasse indulges in. What else is better if not perfumes? The city is such an expert in perfumes that even while you have lunch and coffee, any random stranger could tell you the best fragrance based on your preference. Grasse also lets you make your perfumes. Maybe this is why Grasse is the sweetest smelling city on the entire planet. With such an international reputation, I had to travel to Grasse sooner. I was anyway visiting Paris for a family occasion, so I figured out a way to plan my one day trip to Grasse. Once I booked my low-cost airline deals to Grasse from FareFerry, I set my tour to witness the mastery of perfumes myself. By the way, the nearest airport to the city is Cannes-Mandelieu Airport. I did not know about this until I called the FareFerry customer service asking them to book airline tickets. They informed that the city hardly 10 miles away from Cannes. God! I was so thankful. Once I reached Grasse, I immediately wanted to visit the famous museums and churches. These are the places I visited. Musée international de la parfumerie de Grasse – I LOVED IT! Having the opportunity to explore the history of perfumes, its cultural and manufacturing process, I left the museum feeling a little overwhelmed. The aroma was too sweet and fruity for my personality. Ah! Nostalgia is still kicking me hard. Grasse Cathedral – Enough about the perfumeries. Since my visit to the museum caused me a nose block, I decided to take a short break before I head the market to buy the perfumes. I wanted to see the historical landmarks of the city. So I visited this Roman Catholic Church. Fantastic view and even this smelled amazing. Visit a perfume store – Grasse lets you make your perfume. I was lost. I wanted to gift my family back to Paris a few of the best scents, so I custom made based on their personalities. I was so overwhelmed by the fragrance and aroma at the store than I had to smell and drink a lot of coffee. But trust me it was all worth the pain. And then I took my flight back to Paris at night. My entire Grasse experience was one hell of a kind because firstly I do not make one-day trips, and secondly, I had never experience France at this olfactory level ever. The city is surrounded by natural beauty and is a place every French culture lover should witness. I wish to come back here and discover the city without keeping the fragrance perspective in mind but to relax and admire the French Rivera."

Most places have air conditioning, so when the harsh Australian sun is beating down, it may stop you getting out and exploring. Fortunately, we have some tips to help you keep your cool on your Kimberley cruise. Remember the Basics The most obvious advice is often overlooked, but the basics of slipping on your shirt, slopping on some sunscreen and slapping on a hat, should be a no brainer. With some of the highest UV concentrations in the world, Australian sunlight can be very harsh. This means that you risk burning and an increased risk of developing skin cancer without adequate basic protection. Minimise the Caffeine and Alcohol While you may be out to have a good time, bear in mind that caffeine and alcohol both act as a diuretic and contribute to dehydration. In fact, if you feel hungover, it is a sign that your body is desperate for liquid. If you do want to indulge, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water. Keep a bottle by your bed and drink some before you to sleep. Be sure to drink a couple of glasses of water when you wake to help avoid feeling dizzy and sick. Eat Little and Often In hot weather, you may find your appetite diminishes naturally, but remember to eat little and often. Large meals can clog the metabolism and make your body use more heat and energy to digest it. Snacking on smaller snacks or light meals will ease your digestion, and if you choose healthy snacks, they are likely to have a higher water content to also boost hydration. Try Some Spicy Foods Luxury Kimberley cruises often provide access to some amazing foods but don’t shy away from those spicier dishes. Spicy food promotes blood flow and circulation, helping your body to cool down at an increased rate. Just go easy on heavier dishes that could make you feel sluggish and bloated. Go Low Tech With so many things to see and do on Kimberley cruises, you’re unlikely to be stuck at your computer for prolonged periods. However, all electronics can generate heat and warm up the air around you. So, consider going low tech; leave most of your gadgets at home and enjoy the wonder of your setting. If you can’t live without some devices, try to use them in a well ventilated area or where you may enjoy a breeze. So, if you do want to relax with your e-reader, find a shady spot on deck. If you’re interested in Kimberley cruises, you should speak to us. We offer a wide variety of trips and cruises throughout the Kimberley, particularly Broome cruises and packages.

7,Considering Cruise Deals - 5 Things You Shouldn’t Do on Your First Cruise,travel-leisure," If you’ve never been on a cruise, Kimberley cruise deals can be both exciting and a little daunting. While you may be excited to get a great deal and explore this fantastic area, you may be a bit unsure about what to expect. So, here we’ll explore five things you shouldn’t do on your first cruise, so you can feel confident to book those cruise deals. Choosing the Wrong Cruise When looking at cruises Kimberley specials can be a very exciting prospect. However, before you get too carried away, you need to ensure that it is the right cruise for you. There are packages to suit all preferences, and you need to look at cruise deals that suit your personality. For example, if you want to enjoy relaxing, soaking up the sun and visiting some sedate swimming holes, an adventure cruise is likely to be the wrong cruise for you. Picking the Wrong Companion While taking a holiday can put a strain on some friendships, it can be a disaster on a cruise. Your misfit, anti social and almost alcoholic pal may be a great companion on a bucks night but is not likely to be a great cruise companion. Likewise, if you want to explore the region fully, sharing a cabin with someone who just wants to sun themselves on deck or relax in the cabin will be a strain. Taking Packing Lightly If you’re a last minute packer, you may need to take a little time to consider what you actually need on your cruise. When you’re cruising the Kimberleys, you may not be able to stop and shop for any items you forgot to pack. Of course, most cruise deals are very informal, so you can plan for lounging in swimmers. However, if you want to explore the area, you’ll need decent footwear, cover up items and changes of clothing. Don’t make the mistake of packing too lightly for your cruise and do a little research to ensure you have everything you’ll need. Hitting the Alcohol Too Hard While you may want to relax and a drink or two can help with this, hitting the booze too hard can be detrimental. You’ll regret the night before if you have a terrible hangover and miss out on a shore trip. Additionally, if you drink too much, the hot Kimberley sun is likely to have an even bigger impact. So, make sure you have plenty of water on hand to stay fully hydrated. Forgetting to Save Some Room for Souvenirs Most Kimberley cruise deals will feature some shopping opportunities in the itinerary. So, you’ll need to make sure that you save some room in your luggage for mementos and souvenirs. It is a good idea to have a collapsible bag tucked in your luggage, so you don’t risk a bust zip when you go a little crazy in the shops. If you’re thinking about cruise deals, you should speak to us.

8,Fishing and Marine Life You Can Enjoy on Kimberley Cruises,travel-leisure," Broome cruises are a great way to explore this vibrant region, but they can also be a fantastic way to relax and ""reel in"" the good times with some world class fishing spots. The Kimberleys feature 52 unique freshwater species with 16 native to the area. This diversity makes it an ideal place for marine watching, so here we’ll explore the fishing and marine life you can expect on Kimberley Cruises. Big Fishing Kimberley coast cruises can provide you with access to some of the most sought after species. While there is a comprehensive list of species, two of the biggest contenders of world class sportfishing arena are right here. The biggest draw for fishing enthusiasts is the Barramundi or Lates Calcarifer. These grow as large as 1.8 metres in length, with 1.2 metres being the average. Adult fish typically congregate around the estuaries. Barramundi can be found in Ivanhoe Crossing, Doubtful Bay, and Collier Bay and you may even find the crew on Kimberley cruises have their own secret spots where you will find some prized specimens. Another prized big fish is the Threadfin Salmon, which may look a little strange, but can provide a delicious treat. Threadfin can grow to 1.7 metres, making them slightly smaller compared to Barra, but they can provide some fantastic sport fishing. Nature Spotting Whether you’re thinking about best Kimberley luxury cruises or an adventure cruise, there will be plenty of time for nature spotting. The Kimberley has an incredibly biodiverse environment with alligators and crocodiles lurking in the shadows and a plethora of bright sponge and coral reefs. Six out of seven oceanic turtle species call the Kimberleys home, and during whale watching season, you can see dozens of humpback pods as they migrate to escape the icy Antarctica winter waters. While global rising water temperatures are a threat to biodiversity, the lack of built up, large cities in the Kimberleys has kept the area almost pristine.  Of course, this means that it is essential to respect the delicate life balance to maintain this beautiful diversity. If you’re not taking any fish to your plate, release them to provide an opportunity for them to reproduce and ensure the fish population continues to flourish. A Fishing Trip of a Lifetime If you want to relax and unwind with a fishing trip, you can be sure of a trip of a lifetime with Kimberley cruises.

9,How to save money on a Disney Cruise,travel-leisure," I love to cruise and Disney Cruise Line is my favorite cruise line and of course my children's favorite cruise too. But a Disney Cruise can be more expensive when you start looking at cruise prices.  I love a good deal just as much as the next person, so that lead me to write this article on how to save money on a Disney Cruise. First, you may think you should wait until a month before the Disney Cruise is going to set sail and catch a last minute Disney Cruise discount.  This is not how Disney Cruise Line operates.  Disney Cruise Line offers their lowest fairs a year + out.  So when a new Disney Cruise Line booking window opens that gives you the best stateroom selection and best rates. I did some Disney Cruise Line pricing to give you an idea of how a Disney Cruise can be less expensive when you book ahead of time.  I priced this Disney Cruise with 2 adults and two kids ages 13 and 9. What does a short Disney Cruise cost?  I ran the numbers for you and here is a three night Disney Cruise: 3-Night Bahamian Cruise from Port Canaveral – September 2019 Sep 6, 2019 – Returns: Sep 9, 2019 Ship: Disney Dream Inside $1,589 Oceanview $1,661 Verandah $1,739 Concierge $3,089 So you can also save money on a Disney Cruise by going on a 3 Night Disney Cruise instead of a 7 night cruise.  Maybe add in some time at Walt Disney World or at the beach in Florida or explore Orlando if you want more than 3 nights for your vacation. Another great Disney Cruise Line saving tips is to book your next Disney Cruise onboard the ship. When you are on a Disney Cruise that is the perfect time to book your next Disney Cruise.  When you book your next Disney Cruise on the ship you will get special on board Disney Cruise Line offers.  Be sure to tell them to add your travel agent to the on board booking to take full advantage of this.  When you book your next Disney cruise on board you don’t have to pick your sail dates.  You are basically just holding a future Disney Cruise with a small deposit.  This gets you a 10% discount and also sometimes a Disney cruise shipboard credit.  When you get back home contact your travel agent so they can help you start planning you next Disney Cruise using the pre-booking you made onboard. The bottom line is you need to plan ahead, book early, be flexible with your travel dates, and book your next Disney Cruise while on board and that will let you walk away with money in your vacation pocket."

11,Advantages & Disadvantages of trekking in Nepal,travel-leisure," In the month June, July and August Nepal endure rainstorm season. Trekking in Nepal in these months isn't abundantly prescribed since the overwhelming precipitation makes the trails sloppy and elusive. Likewise, you may need to experience flight deferrals or wiping out which can manifest regularly amid the monsoon.In different nations, for example, Sri Lanka, the storm isn't an issue at everything except in Nepal it is a marginally unique issue. Advantages: Less voyagers. All things considered off season you can move around in spots like Pokhara without being shoulder to bear with other occasion goers. Be that as it may, there are as yet a couple of guests from nations, for example, China and India to get away from their late spring warmth. Shoddy airfare. Contrasted with going at different occasions in the year, the airfare is moderately shoddy. Be that as it may, for the individuals who would prefer not to fly with Air India, the less expensive airfare enables you to spending plan for a more premium carrier. Better transport. This point is a touch of a risky one as the 'better transport' is as yet confined, hot and sporadic. In contrast with the primary celebration season (September-November) where transport is rare and every one of the things  recorded are about 10x more regrettable. Rainstorm mitigates the residue. In the primary urban areas like Kathmandu and even Pokhara nowadays there is an enormous issue with contamination and when blended with all the residue it is only a bad dream. Simply strolling to work or to the shops abandons you with a sickening cerebral pain. At any rate, in the storm the rain washes away a portion of the residue leaving the air that bit more endurable. Less expensive lodgings with greater accessibility. As there are less vacationers, the inns will readily need to house you. As far as I can tell this has prompted more elite rooms with better administration at a much less expensive cost! Some wonderful days. In the midst of the rain and extraordinary warmth there truly are some excellent days in Nepal in the storm season. You may even get some sunny mornings where you can see mountains circumscribing the slopes out yonder. Disadvantages: No mountains. The executioner con; Nepal is renowned for its rocky perspectives yet in the event that there is no reasonable sky at that point there are no mountains. You may luck out if there is a sunny morning, yet I wouldn't depend on it. However, that is constantly another reason to return to Nepal, isn't that so? No exercises. The storm makes it troublesome for any of the daring exercises to run. That incorporates paragliding, zip-wiring, bungee bouncing, jeep safaris and pretty much anything fun you needed to do while in Nepal. Notwithstanding trekking ends up troublesome and restricted amid the rainstorm because of the wellbeing of the trekkers. Likewise, any water related exercises e.g. boating, sculling and water floating turn out to be rare because of the rising levels and erratic nature of the water. Parasites/Earthworms/Mosquitoes. The initial two I had never experienced coming to Nepal so I was so terrified when I saw them wriggling around attempting to discover skin to jump onto. On the off chance that you do get a bloodsucker or worm connected to you then you can sprinkle salt on them or hold up until the point that they have wrapped up the blood. Neither one of the options is extremely decent so attempt to cover all skin when strolling through more lush territories. Mosquitoes are particularly high amid off season, however fortunately when it has been raining then the mosquitoes seek refuge which implies no chomps. Hard to drive. The greater part of the streets in Nepal are rough and sloppy (and on slopes). In this manner, when blended with water it very well may be a formula for a debacle. This just applies to more country regions yet it implies that entrance to these spots winds up constrained or at times beyond reach. No celebrations. Nepal is known for its variety of Hindu and Buddhist celebrations so on the off chance that you need to come to Nepal for these, at that point don't come in storm. In spite of the fact that there are some neighborhood customs, pujas and love days they are rare and furthermore nothing contrasted with the huge celebration months for Dashain and Tihar. Green verdant vegetables and serving of mixed greens. The storm makes it troublesome for vacationers to eat verdant vegetables and servings of mixed greens and can cause many stomach issues. This even incorporates the little hacked cucumber, radish and carrots that are regularly offered nearby daal-bhat. Vacationers going in storm season will simply need to make a point to maintain a strategic distance from or completely wash these vegetables."

14,Choosing a Fishing Charter,travel-leisure," If you’re looking for a coast side adventure, there’s no doubt that a chartered fishing trip can give you one. Spending a day out on the ocean fishing for kingfish, flounder, and other fish is a day well spent. However, with lots of charter captains along the coast, it can be challenging to pick the one you want guiding your trip. If such is your dilemma, keep reading to know what things to consider when choosing a fishing charter guide. Safety: Any experienced charter guide knows that the weather and the ocean change quickly and may create dangerous conditions. Your guide should put your safety at the top of the priority list, even before having fun. Time commitment: Going on a chartered fishing trip isn’t like going to see a movie. Many charters offer half day trips (4 to 6 hours long) and full day trips (6 to 8 hours long). If you’re an avid fisher and know you'll enjoy a full day of fishing then book a full day trip. If fishing isn’t something you have much experience with and you’ve never been on a charted trip, half day trips are a great pick. The caught fish: The greatest thrill of fishing is getting a bite and reeling in the big one; but what happens when you catch it? Ask any potential guide what their rules are about caught fish. Do you get to keep them and if so how many? Does the guide keep some or all of the fish? Or finally, do they only practice catch and release? Knowing whether or not you want to keep the fish you catch will help you with this decision. The captain: The most critical part of choosing the right fishing charter guide is the guide, or captain, themselves. Don’t be fooled by the size of a captain’s boat, or flashiness of his fishing gear. Just because a guide has great equipment doesn’t they're going to be fun. Look for a captain that’s willing to engage with you through conversation, help you tie knots, and provide any other help you need or want. There are certainly more things to consider when choosing a guide for a chartered fishing trip. However, we hope this short list gives you an idea of the qualities to look for in a guide. Of course, the best way to make a decision is to do your own research."
15,Things that might be odd but perfectly fine to do on this Veteran Day,travel-leisure," The day to honor the veterans of the war has finally arrived. Schools and offices all are closed to observe this auspicious day. It is that time of the year when the American flag is raised with pride to upright the sacrifices and courage veterans performed during their military journey. And to honor them in the right way, here are a few things that might be odd but fine to do on this Veteran Day: Show Gratitude: If there is a military veteran that you know in person, then appreciate their work and honor them by a simple thank you. It would not make any difference to you, but it would mean the world to them. Attend the Veteran Parade: Go outside, participate and cheer amongst the crowd to all those fallen veterans who gave it all to this very soil. Appreciate their high principals that set aside from us civilians and let the empathy do all the cheerfulness. In case you wish to travel back home to participate, then just so you know, Cheapbestfares has low cost flight deals made especially for Veteran Day travel. Last minute flights could also be booked. So just in case you happen to change your mind. Organize a Veteran Meet: What else would be the better way to hear the stories of wars and battles straight from the mouth of the brave soldiers. Let the community you live in know how important it is to have them amongst us. Appreciate: Take a moment all for yourself, and just be obliged for your life, safety and security, that without them no one could sleep safely at night, because they were out there protecting us, our family and more importantly, this country. All these are not odd in any way, but it's just a little matter of courage that sets each one of us aside. Of course we cannot imagine the kind of sacrifices they'd put because of us, but our little efforts could bring the heroes some happiness and pride. Happy Veterans Day to each one of us."

17,Where to Stay in Bali the Best Towns & Hotels,travel-leisure," Bali was inhabited by around 2000 BC by Austronesian peoples who migrated originally from Taiwan through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are thus closely related to the peoples of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west. In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora, and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead. Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name Bali Dwipa (""Bali island"") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning ""Walidwipa"". It was during this time that the complex irrigation system Subak was developed to grow rice. Some religious and cultural traditions still in existence today can be traced back to this period. The Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293–1520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. When the empire declined, there was an exodus of intellectuals, artists, priests, and musicians from Java to Bali in the 15th century. story of Bali - The island of Gods - Everything You Need to Know About Bali, Indonesia The first European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1585 when a Portuguese ship foundered off the Bukit peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the service of Dewa Agung. In 1597 the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali and, with the establishment of the Dutch East India Company in 1602, the stage was set for colonial control two and a half centuries later when Dutch control expanded across the Indonesian archipelago throughout the second half of the nineteenth century (see Dutch East Indies). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast when the Dutch pitted various distrustful Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control. The Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who fought against the superior Dutch force in a suicidal Puputan defensive assault rather than face the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 1,000 Balinese marched to their death against the invaders. In the Dutch intervention in Bali (1908), a similar massacre occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung. Afterward, the Dutch governors were able to exercise administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and Maluku. In the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee created a western image of Bali as ""an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature"", and western tourism first developed on the island. Imperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. Bali Island was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains the Imperial Japanese Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from the comparable weather. The island had no regular Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps Prajoda (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer (Sanur). The island was quickly captured. During the Japanese occupation a Balinese military officer, I Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The lack of institutional changes from the time of Dutch rule, however, and the harshness of war requisitions made Japanese rule little better than the Dutch one. Following Japan's Pacific surrender in August 1945, the Dutch promptly returned to Indonesia, including Bali, immediately to reinstate their pre-war colonial administration. This was resisted by the Balinese rebels now using Japanese weapons. On 20 November 1946, the Battle of Marga was fought in Tabanan in central Bali. Colonel I Gusti Ngurah Rai, by then 29 years old, finally rallied his forces in central Bali at Marga Rana, where they made a suicide attack on the heavily armed Dutch. The Balinese battalion was entirely wiped out, breaking the last thread of Balinese military resistance. In 1946 the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia which was proclaimed and headed by Soekarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the ""Republic of the United States of Indonesia"" when the Netherlands recognized Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949."
18,Marshmallows and Stars: Loving Moms Go Camping,travel-leisure," According to CNN - even teenagers think they use their phones too much. And a great way to get away from technology is on a camping trip. But to go camping you must plan, in particular, if you want to take your children. These tips will help you plan your camping trip. Children will always be more interested in any activity they can participate in. And you will fuel their curiosity by having them plan their camping trip. Have them choose the location and research the history of the area. Use social media such as Instagram to find interesting photos of nature. You can even have them learn how to identify plants and animals they may see on the trip. Camping can be stressful even with the most experienced campers. Such as my friend Teena who woke up to find mice in her camper. Forcing her to sleep in her truck. You can tip-toe into camping with your kids by choosing a nearby campground. And it can be a lot of fun to make the first night under the stars be in your backyard. This way if there is a need to go to potty - they can do in the comfort of their own toilet. Or if a little one is scared by the sounds, they can retreat to their bedroom if it's a must. The last thing you want to do is be out in the woods without your toilet paper. While you may decide to camp near a city or even in a fancy campground with a store, it's better to make sure you have everything you need before you leave. Because we all know things always seem to be more expensive when we must have them than if we bought them ahead of time. Make a checklist of everything you need. And meticulously follow it. Don't forget to pack extra items like batteries and underwear. While you don't want to have people on their phones playing games, surfing the Internet and chatting with friends, use your phone to capture the photos you want. And of course, take plenty of videos. You will cherish these items when you want to reminisce about the trip in the future. I wish we had more photos of camping when we were younger. In particular with little kids on their first campout, pick someplace close by. You don't want to take away from the fun by having them get antsy waiting to get there. While you may not live in a permanent campground like my friend Teena (mountains of New Hampshire), many of us live within 2 hours of fantastic locations. Even here in the DFW metro area - within a couple of hours, I can get you into piney woods. Or the small mountains of southern Oklahoma (Teena would call them large hills, but technically they are mountains). Make sure you check the weather before you leave. Rain and cold can either be the best time to camp or the worst time to camp depending upon how well you prepare for it. If you are traveling in tornado season make sure you have a weather radio and talk over with your family about what to do if you encounter severe weather. Don't forget to check the guides to make sure you don't plant your tent in a flash flood zone. With some careful planning, you can have a fantastic adventure in the great outdoors with the kids. Use the tips above to make the most out of your trip. Your kids will have memories that will last a lifetime! By planning, it's possible to make camping into a fun and affordable family holiday trip.

1,Everything You Need to Do Before You Move Overseas,travel-leisure," Moving overseas is a big life change. There are so many things to think about before you move that it can be easy to get overwhelmed. To make sure you don't forget anything, start organising everything early and use this guide to make sure you're on top of your move! Before you do anything else you need to write down a list of everything that needs to be organised before you move. This will help you stay on track of everything and will make sure you don’t leave anything behind. It is essential for staying organised when moving overseas! One of the first things you need to sort out is choosing a moving company for your big move. This can be tricky as there are so many removalists to choose from that it can be hard to work out who is best. Find someone who is accredited and insurance as this is the best way to ensure your belongings get to their destination in one piece. When you move overseas you need to arrange how you’re going to get there. If it’s a long trip, you’ll probably need somewhere to stay as well. Make sure you book this nice and early as flights and hotels can become expensive if you wait until the last minute. Before you travel you need to see if you’re legally able to. This means ensuring your passport is up-to-date, arranging any visas for the country you’re moving to, and getting any vaccinations you need before you fly. This will save you a lot of stress later on, so sort it out as soon as you start planning your move. If you plan on taking your car with you overseas then you’ll need to arrange an international driver’s licence. You may also need to look at getting your car registered at your new home so that you can drive it as soon as you arrive at your destination. In many countries health care isn’t free or accessible, so it’s important to work out how you’re going to look after your health while you’re overseas. If you already have private health insurance then try talking to them about your options for overseas travel. Some private health providers will cover you while you’re overseas so it’s worth checking before you move. It’s important to say goodbye to your friends and family before you leave so they know you won’t forget them. Keeping connections in place is also important so you aren’t on your own when you come back. Your friends may also know people overseas who you can connect with when you arrive, making your transition into your new life much smoother. If you want your overseas move to go smoothly then it’s important to be prepared. Start organising everything nice and early so you aren’t rushing around at the last minute trying to get everything ready. When you’re more prepared, your move will be much less stressful."

3,Best Places To Live In Placer County,travel-leisure," Placer County is one of the most desirable places to live in in the State of California. Just like in the days of gold rush, dozens of people flock to Placer County today to find a home for themselves and their family. If you want to move to Placer County, these are some of the best places that you can live in. North Auburn: Looking at it from afar, you would almost be tempted to think North Auburn was a picturesque small town out of a Nicholas Sparks novel. The residents are also quite friendly and accommodating and it is close enough to other big towns where you can get what you need that isn’t available in North Auburn. Rocklin: Rocklin is a great place to build a family. It has very quiet and safe streets all over the neighborhood where children can play and have fun. Rocklin may be a boring place for you, especially if you have just moved from a more exciting city, but with time you will eventually get used to it. Loomis: Loomis is also another family-oriented town in Placer County. Most residents note that there is a great shortage of nightlife and other social scenery, although they have several family centered infrastructures like parks and baseball fields. However, you should know that houses in Loomis are typically more expensive than in other places. Roseville: Roseville has numerous parks and greenery around, so it’s particularly loved by people who have a sense of duty to the environment. The cost of living in Roseville is also higher than the average city in California as a whole, although they have rather great schools. Auburn: This is the county seat of Placer County and it’s a really great place to live in. Even though it has that sense of a small town, it is still big enough such that you don’t have to go out of town to get everything you need. Meadow Vista: Meadow Vista is also an amazing place to live in Placer County. Although it is rather prone to seasons of drought, it generally has a nice climate and great weather conditions.

Not only is riding a bullet train exciting, it’s cost effective too — private drivers can be expensive in Japan, but the coverage and reliability of the network allows you to explore the country in comfort and at minimum cost. Pick up a bento box at the train station to eat on board —these meal boxes are made with local ingredients to reflect the area they are from. For example, if you are passing through Kobe, you can expect your box to include beef. The boxes are always very aesthetically pleasing and some even come character-themed for children. Kayak around Miyajima, recommended by Jo: Spend the afternoon on a kayaking tour around Miyajima, a small, sacred island found in Hiroshima Bay in western Japan – a great activity for teenagers. The most prominent feature of the island is its red torii gate, which, though it appears to float in the bay, can be accessed during low tide. Armed with your life jacket and paddle, you can scull across a calm strait of the Seto Inland Sea before reaching the island. After the tour, walk onto the island to explore the town or ride the cable car up 535-m-high (1,755 ft) Mount Misen for views across Hiroshima Bay, if the weather is clear. Visit the Ghibli Museum, recommended by Clio: Just over half an hour from Tokyo’s busy transport hub of Shinjuku, you’ll find one of the most popular family museums in the country, the Ghibli Museum — perfect for teenage anime fans.

The tour starts at the station, where your guide conducts a brief health and safety talk. You’re then led to the nearby town of Hida, renowned for the clean, natural water that flows in small canals and runs through the town — you can usually see koi carp swimming in them. Cycling on, you’re then taken through rice paddies and past thatched-roof farmhouses, with the Hida Mountains rising up in the distance. Take a Taiko lesson in Tokyo, recommended by Laura: Taiko drumming has been a key feature of traditional Japanese music for centuries, and is still used at the large-scale matsuri (festivals) that occur throughout Japan. This lesson is a chance for the whole family to learn about the long history of the instrument, which was also used to motivate troops in battle, and have a go yourself.

Part of this innovation is working on pools in an efficient and sustainable manner. We’ve highlighted how we approach that philosophy in the building, cleaning, and maintenance stages below. Build: When you choose to build your pool with our team, our designers will walk you through the design process and the design options available to bring your ideas to life. Upon installation of every new pool, our team takes care of tasks such as completing new water chemistry, program automation, walking you through your new pool, and completing final plumbing tasks to ensure life with your new pool gets off to a smooth start. In addition to the build of the pool itself, we also offer and highly encourage solar pool heating. This is the most effective way to heat your pool and enable year-round use. Sunshine is our most abundant resource here in Arizona, with Tucson and Phoenix averaging around 200 days of sunshine a year and over 3800 hours annually. We use SolarTech™ SolarSprial™ technology to take those hours of sunshine in our region, collect the solar power where water is heated, and then return it back to the pool… EVERY pool owner in Arizona should know that the state offers a 25% tax credit on any one approved solar device or system up to a maximum of $1000. Items qualifying for this credit include solar pool heating, solar water heating, solar electric (photovaltaic), solar water pumping, and solar day lighting systems. Clean: Keep an eye on the tile just below the coping of your pool. Over time and as the water level fluctuates a bit, you’ll notice a white ring start to form due to build up of materials such as pH, alkalinity, and high calcium concentration. Most pool service and repair companies perform a traditional method using glass beads and that require your entire pool to be drained. We do things a little differently, though. Our advanced and cutting edge method is unique to the southern Arizona and Tucson markets. We use a mobile filtration unit that filters our unique product and saves your water. How does it work? Most of our mix is the beginning states of mine salt, not glass beads. We will only drain your pool slightly, leaving it just below the tile line. Once the tile is fully exposed, we will remove the buildup with our mix through a high pressure system. To finish the job, we use a 5 stage mobile filtration unit that extracts the particles in the white line and then return fresh water to your pool to fill it back up. We take pride in this method not only as a way to save you time and money, but to also take care of our environment and preserve natural resources valuable to the region. Maintain: By this point now, you probably get it. We’re not really about the ""traditional"" way of doing things in the pool business. Bringing the latest and the best to the business to serve our clients, save them money, and protect natural resources is our top priority. What if we told you that we offer a way where you’d never have to change sand in your current pool filter ever again? AFM®, standing for Advanced Filter Material, filters water much finer that quartz or glass sand. It will lower chlorine consumption and require less secondary chlorine reaction products, leaving behind no trichloramine or chlorine smell, and is bio resistant to prevent the buildup of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. On top of all this, filter function remains at a high level for many years with AFM®. this is in comparison to traditional filters which worsen dramatically after their first 6-12 months despite frequent washing. Are you ready to get started building your dream pool or are looking for help from the experts in servicing and maintaining your pool? Give us a call or send us a message today. Our team will follow-up with you to better understand your needs and determine next steps. We look forward to hearing from you!"
16,What are the major difficulties of Everest Base Camp Trek?,travel-leisure," Along with the Inca Trail and Kilimanjaro expedition, the Everest Base Camp Trek is one of the most popular treks in the world. No doubt it should be included in your bucket list. EBC trek is two weeks plus teahouse trek in Nepal which follows the foot print of legendry mountaineers and takes you to lap of mighty Everest. The Everest Base Camp Trekking Trip initiates with an overnight stop in the vibrant city of Kathmandu (the capital of Nepal). The next day begins with an adventurous flight to Lukla, the major gateway to Everest. It takes around 10 – 12 days to reach Base Camp and Kalapatthar and trek back to Lukla (it includes two nights halt at Namche Bazaar and Dingboche for acclimatization). Most of trekkers believe that trekking to the BC of world highest peak via rough mountain terrain is treacherous. But it is not that challenging; with proper preparation and training, you can complete the trek without being the victim of mountain threats. Here are some of the difficulties of Everest Base Camp Trek, you are likely to encounter during your trip: TrekkingRoute The trail route to EBC and back is roughly 130km (80 miles) (starting from and ending at Lukla). It also includes the side trip for acclimatization at Namche and Dingboche. It is roughly 65km one way route to reach BC which takes 8 – 9 days uphill walk and 3 – 4 days of easy downhill walk back to Lukla. Trekkers have to walk around 6 – 8 hours per day which covers approximately 6 – 7 miles. For unseasoned trekkers, the lengthy trekking route might be the difficulty. Elevation and Altitude Sickness The elevation and its related health threat is another major difficulty during your hike to Everest Base Camp. The starting point Lukla is at 2,850m and the final height Kalapatthar is at 5,545m. You will gain 500m – 700m per day during the trek. If you do not acclimatize and rest properly, it is very hard to complete the trek successfully.  We suggest you to stay one more day at Namche and Dingoche followed by the side trips it offers. Weather & Temperature The temperature and weather in high mountains are very unpredictable. It usually drops down to -12 degree Celsius in mid-November. Though the nights are below freezing level, day remains sunny with clear blue sky and excellent views. It is for high season – autumn and spring. If you are well-prepared with proper gear, temperature might not be come in your difficulty list. Flight Cancellation and Teahouse availability As we know the weather of mountains are highly unpredictable, the flights to Lukla are prone to get delayed that may last for few hours or even for few days. Better to get few spare days to compensate such delays and cancelation. As EBC hiking is popular mountain trek, there are large flock of trekkers visiting the area in high seasons. The teahouse numbers are limited at higher altitude which might create difficulty; if you are travelling without booking the accommodation in advance. We suggest you to engage in physical training few months prior the trip. Cardio vascular exercise, weight training, running, swimming etc. are best exercise to boost your strength and endurance capability."

8,How constant currency fluctuation affects your tour plans,travel-leisure," There are many things that influence travel trends, and one is the travel and tourism industry itself. By studying survey results and research, travel media may set trends. They may do this by promoting some destinations over others. If you are making travel plans at the moment, you will be having a look at packages offered by tour companies or agents. If this is the case, you will see how some destinations are being boosted not by one or two tour companies but by most of them. There are many factors that go into these travel trends set by travel media. The global economy also has a significant influence over travel trends, as do currency exchange rates. So travel trends will shift depending on how much travellers can spend and also the exchange rate of their local currency to the currency of their holiday destination. Before you go on holiday or decide on where to travel to, you will check foreign currency exchange rates. If you are travelling from London to a foreign country, you would want to have an idea of current exchange rates London. So how do these constant currency fluctuations affect your travel plans? Appreciation The appreciation of the British pound has positive effects on British travellers looking at foreign destinations. If you are planning outbound travel from London, you can visit the Monex International UK website to view the current exchange rates London. Say you are planning a holiday to Thailand. Today, you may get 42 Thai Baht for a Pound, but if the value of the Pound rises, you will get more Baht per Pound. If you don’t live in the UK but are planning to travel to London for a holiday with family, the appreciation of the Pound will make you reconsider the destination. When you convert your local currency to Pounds according to current exchange rates London, you’ll be receiving a smaller amount than before the appreciation of the Pound. Depreciation What happens when the value of the Pound decreases? For British travellers, this means more domestic holidays. When the Pound falls, you will receive less during conversion to foreign currency. You can go to a money exchange UK with the best rates, but you will still be getting much less that what you would have prior to the depreciation. Since those travelling for pleasure wouldn’t want to spend more than the usual for their travels, tour companies would also promote more local destinations. So if you are from the UK, you may want to think local when the Pound isn’t doing well. The depreciation of the Pound is good for those travelling to the UK for a holiday. Tour groups will promote the UK and sell it as a popular destination. If you are visiting London, you can go to Monex International UK for the best money exchange UK rates. Planning and budgeting For the regular traveller, currency fluctuation is only a concern when converting currency. If you are planning a holiday, you are bound to make flight and hotel reservations well ahead of time. If you’ve opted for a tour package, you would have had to make a payment weeks in advance. So currency fluctuations won’t have a huge effect on how much you pay to a travel company or for flights and hotels. Your travel plans will be affected by currency fluctuations while you are actually on holiday. Currency exchange rates London may change during your stay, and this is especially noticeable if the fluctuations are significant. If you are lucky, however, constant currency fluctuations won’t be major and will thus have little effect on any foreign currency exchange you will be required to do."
9,Ideal check-list for your trip to UK,travel-leisure," There are two types of travellers; those who plan and pack way ahead of time and those who wait until the last minute. If you are someone who plans holidays and packs at the very last minute, then you may often find yourself forgetting important things you should carry with you. From clothes to locations of foreign currency exchange centres like Monex International UK to a copy of your passport, there are a number of important items to keep with you before heading off on your trip to the UK. Since lists are the easiest way to make sure you aren’t forgetting anything, here is the ideal checklist for your trip to the UK. Baggage Once you make flight and hotel books and get all your travel plans in order, the first thing you’ll want to do is determine what kind of luggage you will be taking with you. Before you do anything, check the maximum luggage weight your airline is giving you. Which baggage will be checked in and which will be carryon? What to pack Deciding on what to pack is always tricky. What shouldn’t you forget and what should you leave behind? Clothes are one of the most important things when packing. What will the weather be like in the areas you’ll be travelling to during that time of the year? Will it be warm? Is rain expected? Will it be cold? The clothes you pack depend largely on the weather. If you plan on a fancy dinner or two during your holiday, pack at least one dressy outfit. Items like a scarf and a jacket will also be useful during your trip to the UK. When it comes to footwear, comfortable walking shoes will be ideal when sightseeing and exploring the area by foot. If your travel itinerary is packed with many sightseeing tours and places to see, it’ll be best to wear comfortable footwear. You will also need to pack toiletries. You will need the basics like toothbrush, toothpaste, lotion, and shampoo, but need not carry around an entire bag full of toiletries and cosmetic products. Hand and face towels and sanitary products are a must-take too. If you’ll be staying in cities and towns, you need not worry too much about running out of toiletries. You can always buy them at local stores. Electronic devices One of the main items on a checklist for your trip to the UK will be electronics. You will want your phone and camera with you, and chargers. A power adapter will come in handy too. You will also want to make sure that roaming is activated for your mobile connection. You may not always have access to WiFi and it is advisable to always have a way to contact family or friends during an emergency. You may also want to download offline maps so that you will never get lost during your trip to the UK. You may also want to make note of important places like your country’s embassy and centres for money exchange UK. Travel documents The main thing you will want to make sure of is the expiration date of your passport. Passport renewal isn’t something you will want to deal in the midst of finalizing travel plans. It’s also better to have a copy of your passport with you. Depending on the country you are travelling from, you will need to have a valid visa. Necessary travel documents like valid passport and visa, flight and hotel details and travel insurance are important items on your checklist. Money matters How much cash should you carry with you on your trip to the UK? It’s risky to carry too little and it’s dangerous to carry too much. Depending on the expenses you expect, like meals not covered by the tour package and shopping you plan to do, prepare a budget for your holiday. You need not convert all your cash at a money exchange UK. If you are going to be staying in cities and large towns, it won’t be difficult to find a foreign currency exchange centre close to you. Further, to know the exact rates on any given day, you can visit reliable website like Monex International UK. This way, you can get current exchange rates London. Finally, don’t forget to keep your bank and also family and friends informed about your overseas travels."

Think of it as a trip you are well prepared for as it is this history that is taught in nearly every school at some point. Just in case you did not learn about it, the name Byzantium was bestowed upon this land in 660 BCE by Megarean colonists. Inevitably, Constantine the great traveled here and named it the new capital of the Roman Empire. This occurred around 330 CE. It was then that the city became known as Constantinople. In Latin, Constantinople means the city of Constantine. It wasn’t until the Ottoman period that it was first referred to as Istanbul. This article will guide you on your journey through Istanbul, pointing out MOST of what there is to do and see in the area as well as what to eat and how to spend your time should you so choose.

This section will explore the best delicacies for you to try while venturing through this new country. When starting your day in Istanbul, why not grab a real Turkish breakfast? For a traditional Turkish breakfast experience, you can expect sliced tomato, cucumber, tea in place of coffee, bread, cheese, olives, etc. While it might be quite different from any breakfast you have had in the past, it is quite tasty and healthy. Double bonus! As you traverse the plains of your journey throughout the day, you of course are going to want a snack. Meze presents a wide variety of options all throughout the city. Meze is what Istanbul locals refer to as a cold starter—like an appetizer but served entirely cold. They are placed in the center of the table and shared by the group. Different Meze options include chili tomato paste, grilled eggplant salad, grilled eggplants with yogurt, and artichoke. When it comes to lunch, try some of the infamous kebabs available here.

14,Visiting Western Australia’s World Heritage Listed Sites,travel-leisure," Whilst Australia is home to thousands of beautiful places, a handful have been recognised further for their brilliance and have been awarded a World Heritage Listing. Selected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as holding cultural, historical or scientific significance, World Heritage Listed Sites are most definitely worth a visit. Within Western Australia, there are three World Heritage Listed sites: Shark Bar, Ningaloo Reef, and Purnululu National Park. Each of these magnificent sites holds different significance within Western Australia, but all share a common astounding beauty. Purnululu National Park Spanning almost 600 000 acres, Purnululu National Park was officially classified as a World Heritage Listed Site in 2003. The Park was listed due to its geological brilliance – geologists claim that the examples of cone karst found within the Bungle Bungle Range are unrivalled across the globe.Purnululu National Park is found about 300-kilometres south of the town of Kununurra, and offers a range of exceptional tourism experiences ranging from camping to bushwalks to guided tours and scenic flights. One of the most comprehensive and stunning ways to experience Purnululu National park is on Aviair’s Bungle Bungle Wanderer day tour, which operates from April through to October. This tour begins with a thrilling scenic flight departing Kununurra which touches down at a remote airfield in the Purnululu National Park. You will then be met by your local guide, who will guide you on walks amongst the famous eroded towers and black and orange banded domes, as well as walks into both the phenomenal Cathedral Gorge and awe-inspiring Echidna Chasm. After a fantastic day of walking and exploring, you will take a return flight to Kununurra, passing over the fascinating Argyle Diamond Mine. There is also the option to stay the night at Bungle Bungle Savannah Lodge, located within the Park, or else add a scenic helicopter flight into your itinerary to gain intimate views of the Bungle Bungle Range. No matter how you choose to explore Purnululu Park, it’s obvious why it has been listed as a World Heritage Listed Site! Ningaloo Coast Further north, you will find the breathtaking Ningaloo Coast, home to the famous Ningaloo Reef. This reef is one of the world’s longest near-shore reefs – at some beaches, you can swim a mere ten metres into the water before finding Ningaloo Reef. The World Heritage Listed Site spans over 600 000 hectares and is home to beautiful and fascinating sea life. Of course, the Reef is also renowned for the presence of the world’s biggest fish, the whale shark, which inhabits the Ningaloo coast for large parts of the year. The mind blowing biodiversity of the Reef led to its listing, but its sheer beauty is equally as impressive. Shark Bay The stunning stretch of coast known as Shark Bay is found at the most westerly point of Australia, and is famous for its extensive sea-grass beds, impressive dugong population and its stromalites. The sea-grass beds of Shark Bay are the largest in the world and cover almost 5000 square kilometres.

2,How To Impress Your Boss And Colleagues,travel-leisure," Whether it's an interview for a job, a business or a cocktail party or you've met an employer or colleague accidentally in an elevator, impressing someone in a short time is not an easy task at all.

Arriving with the professional driver will not only make your entrance glamorous and luxury, but you will also arrive on time every time, and you can be sure that you will avoid all the traffic jams. Relax in the backseat of a comfortable car. Read newspapers, listen to your favorite music, or even better use the free Wi-fi and prepare for you meeting. Chauffeur driven cars Melbourne offers you full corporate package, and this kind of service was never more affordable. Once you make a good first impression, other steps are not too hard. Show that you are really inclined to work in the team, as you probably wrote in your biography. Help your colleagues, create a sense of community and facilitate yourself and others in the business environment. Not only you will be in a better mood, but everyone will work much easier if you can count on a colleague's support, and your increased efficiency will surely not remain undetected. Being part of a team means being among the same, which does not mean that you have to drown in the mass; If you have the skills to lead a team, this may be your advantage to give as part of the group a lot more power than you could as an individual. If one of your colleagues has done something wrong, do not run the boss immediately. Instead, help your colleagues’ correct things and create an ally for the black days when you're wrong. Boiling the boss will only lead to your colleague having problems, and there will be no rewards for you. The boss, among other things, could see that you are not a team player, which in no way favors you. Pulling your head and confirming everything your boss says might seem like the right choice, but you're risking your boss thinking that you do not have your own opinion. If you think it's wrong, say it, and if you reasonably argue your opinion, your boss will respect your commitment to the business. Of course, try to choose the time and place where your boss will not look stupid in front of others when you tell him why he is wrong. Perhaps your boss will not notice and explicitly boast the fact that you are at work always on time, but be sure to notice any delay. Five to ten minutes makes a big difference, and if you come earlier, you may have the opportunity to have a cup of coffee with him while there is nobody else, and then you can mention a couple of your ideas while you casually chat with him."

4,Taking Care of Camping Tents,travel-leisure," You have everyday camping equipment like sleeping bags, camping stove, campfire equipment and of course the tent.  We all know that a great outdoor adventure starts with the tent. Therefore it is important to know the proper way to care for your home away from home.  Most camping tents are portable and small enough to be compacted and transported by one person.  The best tents are made of sheets of material that drapes over or attaches to a frame.  This material is durable and waterproof fabric that is easily attached to aluminum poles that are foldable. Typically, it is also important to know that camping tents consist of a sheet of fabric of similar material draped over or attached to a frame of poles. Some of the new camping tent models come with durable waterproof fabrics and foldable aluminum poles. Even though camping tents are manufactured with tough, rugged, and durable features, they are not maintenance free.  Mother nature can sometime make camping harder than usual. So to make them last longer you need to take some extra care by keeping the quality of your tent up to speed.  It’s very important because a tent is often the only thing standing between you and surviving when things go wrong. Here are some few ideas on how to take care of your tent: Waterproofing your tent is very important. Even though most tent manufacturers disclose to their buyers by tagging their tents as waterproof, and ensuring all the seals and stitches are sealed properly they still need extra care. You should always double-seal them yourself. You can contact the company and get the seam sealer they use and reseal the seams yourself. You can also purchase a spray on water seal to put on the material for added protection. It is always smart to have spare parts when camping such as duct tape, zippers, and material or fabric to make repairs if needed. Make sure to keep an eye out for any damage when taking down your tent and make repairs as soon as possible to stop them from getting any worse. Take caution when setting up and taking down your tent.  Follow all the steps to avoid any ripping, bending, or breaking parts of the tent. Be sure you have packed the correct stakes to use on your tent. Stakes are a huge support system in securing your tent to the ground. Standard stakes are good enough if you are camping during good weather and on firm ground, however, if you are setting up in loose soil, or if the weather is windy, you may need heavier stakes.  This will  help to keep your tent in place. Tension on the stakes are important, so, once you have your stakes pegged  make sure you have correct tension. Setting up your tent in the shade is also important.  Sunlight can damage the material if tents are exposed to it directly. Even manufacturers advise of this. Ultraviolet light will weaken the material and destroy the fabric so always go to shaded area of the campgrounds. Installing a ground cover underneath your tent is also a very smart thing to do. Before setting up any tent it is a good idea to have what is called a tent footprint. This will protect the floor of your tent and help to keep moisture from the ground out. It will also protect the tent floor from dirt, rocks, sticks, and other items that might rip the tents floor. To keep moisture from accumulating from inside the tent, you should make an effort to ventilate frequently.  Condensation builds up when camping more than a few days.

11,Summer Vacationing in Croatia,travel-leisure," The area known as Croatia was inevitably inhabited during the prehistoric period. This is known to be true due to the Neanderthal fossils found dating back to the Paleolithic period of time. In addition, remnants of Chalcolithic and Neolithic cultures were additionally unearthed all over the country. The most impressive of these remnants can be found today in the area of Krapina. Later, Croatia actually found itself hosting settlers from Greek and Rome. The Emperor known as Diocletian actually had a rather large castle put up in the city of Split from which he eventually retired in 305 AD. During the 5th century, Julius Nepos ruled his area from this castle following his escape from Italy. Unfortunately, he was assassinated only one year later. Today, Croatia stands as quite the impressive summer vacation spot, and it is a country that should definitely be on your bucket list as far as places you want to visit. As tensions arose in the country of Croatia under political unpleasantries—they eventually declared their independence on June 25, 1991. On July 1, 2013 Croatia was actually indoctrinated into the EU! For more information on Croatia, visit Tripedia.

Dalmatia is located along a narrow belt that sits on the Eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea. It ranges from the island of Rab to the Bay of Kotor located in the south. Dalmatia gets its name from an old Illyrian tribe known as the Dalmatae who once resided there.

Greece is in fact an amazing place to visit but not just for the beaches, nightlife, and Mediterranean feel. Are you a fan of art or architecture? Perhaps both?

At one point between 1823 and 1834 it was actually the capital city of the ‘Greek state’. It is a seaport town with a whole lot of water traffic as one might expect. It is of course surrounded by water making for an excellent place for beach visits and getting some sun and fresh air.

13,The Tale of Eric the Sailor,travel-leisure," Eric was born in the early 1900’s in Copenhagen. Growing up in a rich family with housekeepers and high expectations, Eric never really felt at home. Life was quiet and everybody did what was expected of them. Everyone, except Eric. Longing for adventures, Eric had always been fascinated by the ocean and the tales he himself was told as a child. He wanted to see the world and be free of boring formalities and expectations. One night, at the age of 13, he jumped out his window and ran off, bringing nothing but the clothes he wore and his favourite necklace holding a faith, hope & love charm – an iconic symbol of sailors. Without looking back, Eric boarded a training ship the next morning. And so, he began his first journey at sea. One that would mark the beginning of a new passion and a life filled with countless adventures. At the ship, Eric was trained in basic sailor and seamanship skills and learned what life at sea was all about. And he was loving it. Upon the ship’s return to Copenhagen a few years later, he was called to serve his military service. This, however, was not the place for Eric either. He disobeyed orders and fought the superior, and ended up spending time in military prison. Even after his release, Eric still struggled to fit into the lifestyle of a normal citizen. He realized that there was only one place for him. At sea. Eric quickly found himself working as a deckhand at a freighter shipping goods all over the world. From Denmark across the Atlantic Ocean, his travels brought him to America, the Caribbean and all the way down to South America. Through hard work and a charismatic personality, he earned his place on the ship over the years, and soon enough, he was recognized for his efforts and rose to eventually become the first mate of the ship. His time ashore, he would spend at local bars or with beautiful women enthralled by the stories of his alluring lifestyle. He quickly became known for his way of life and how he rarely passed an opportunity to be adventurous. For instance, he once won a monkey in a gamble while traveling in Brazil. He named it Yogo and brought it on his travels for several years as his faithful companion. Between sailing to Africa, the Emirates and Asia, and living in different countries, there soon was no part of the world that Eric had not yet seen. The only limit was his own lust for adventures. He had a woman in every port and no storm could break him. Around the world, people would tell stories of Eric the sailor and how he had turned his back on wealth and comfort to live life on his own terms. A true sailor. From the bow of the ship, he would stand every night gazing over the horizon. Around his neck, he still wore the same old necklace that had followed him through his adventures since he was just a child. And finally, he felt at home. There are only few who know the whole story of Eric and his journeys. For many years, the tale of the seasoned sailor from Nyhavn has remained a secret of the seven seas. Until now… This is the true tale of Eric the sailor."

16,Joon Ma Living with a Toddler in Seoul—5 Things That Surprised Us,travel-leisure," A few years ago, when my son was two-years-old, we had the incredible opportunity to live and work in Seoul. We discovered so many great things about raising a child in Seoul, including the very safe environment, access to top-notch education, high quality and affordable childcare, and the abundance of kid-friendly historical and cultural attractions and activities. Here are a few other surprising observations we made during our stay. A baby/kid crazy culture. Maybe it’s related to the country’s falling fertility rate, among the lowest in the world, or maybe it’s just the culture, but everywhere we went, people (in particular ajummas, middle-aged Korean women) fawned over our son, giving him whatever gift they could find—from little sweets and toys to even a gigantic eggplant. Taxi drivers would hunt in their car to find something to gift him, like a banana taken from their packed lunch. One shopkeeper cried every time we visited. For our son, it felt like having a million grandmas—the world felt friendly and loving. Adventurous, kid-friendly eating. Korean food may be known for its spicy or unusual (to the Western eye) dishes, but the cuisine also abounds with palate-broadening foods dressed up as sweets (at least in the eyes of our then two-year-old). We enjoyed fishcakes colored pink and white; dried, slightly sweet, chewy squid that shreds appealing in your hands; colorful vegetables wrapped with rice in dried, salty seaweed; rice cakes covered in crushed mung beans or filled with red bean paste (a not-too-sweet treat that I grew up with and my son loves, but my thoroughly Western husband thinks is an insult to the word ""dessert""). With more restaurants per capita (or so I’ve been told by the locals) than any city in the world, not to mention the thousands of food carts peddling street food, you are bombarded everywhere you go with Korean foods—surprisingly irresistible for my young son! Accessibility of outdoor activities. Seoul is known for its incredible growth and development over the past several decades, which has transformed it into a vibrant, bustling city that never sleeps. With 11 million people in Seoul proper, it has almost twice the population density of New York City. However, there are extraordinary pockets of undeveloped wilderness right in the city, including at least eight mountains offering easy access to kid-friendly day trips and hikes. We often spent the day at Bukhansan, located on the city’s northern periphery, which is a national park featuring striking granite peaks, dozens of hiking trails up its three major summits, and spectacular views of Seoul from the top. Be prepared to feel under-equipped as ajummas and ajusshis (middle-aged women and men) race past you in the latest high-tech clothing, carbon fiber trekking poles and cutting-edge GPS gear (no matter how gentle the slope)—but they’ll always stop to ooh and aah over your little ones and offer some nuts, carrots or other snack. Cheap and easy transportation. As a New Yorker, I’m a taxi/Uber addict—and always feel slightly guilty (though not enough to curb my addiction) for spending too much money jumping into a cab instead of taking the bus or subway. No guilt needed in Seoul! While Seoul has a super-efficient, although often crowded, public transportation system, the taxis are so plentiful and inexpensive, it’s easy to travel with your little one and all the gear and shopping bags you're likely carrying with you. And it’s always a good opportunity to practice your Korean. K-fashion for the littlest ones. In recent years, Seoul has become a cultural powerhouse whose influence now extends beyond K-pop, K-drama and K-beauty, to fashion. The focus on fashion, we discovered, even extends to those too small to dress themselves. We saw children wearing miniature versions of their parents’ high fashion styles, and even attending shows during Seoul Fashion Week! High end aside, nowhere else is it so easy or inexpensive to play dress up with your child—even the cheapest markets teem with trendy kid’s fashions (or at least their knock offs). When we first arrived in Korea, we were fresh from Toronto, a wonderful but sartorially conservative city. It wasn’t until we went out one day with Mason in ripped jeans (the victim of too much sandbox play) and mussed hair (some gel fixing a mommy-led haircut mishap) that we set off the street-style fashion meter with universal acclaim!"
17,Joon Ma Rock Climbing and My Four-Year-Old,travel-leisure," Since having my son four years ago, the number of days I’ve spent climbing every year has dropped precipitously—from over 100 days at one point to zero. Climbing has always been one of my favorite things to do with my husband, but these days we’ve substituted playdates and picnics in the park for mountain adventures. Not a bad trade—but still, I’ve missed climbing. Living in New York City and working a demanding job made me appreciate all the things it has to offer: the beauty, the companionship, the physical effort, the mental challenge—even the fear. Raising my son, I looked forward to a time when I could introduce him to the cliffs, once he was old enough. The question then became, ""How old is old enough to climb?"" We’ve taken our son, Mason, to the indoor gym many times but it wasn’t until we saw him clamoring to climb the ""mountains"" in the park near our home, the boulders in Central Park where visitors often picnic, that we felt he was ready. So, one bright sunny day in early Autumn, we rented a car, dragged the gear out of the closet, packed the pack and, after a quick stop at Zabar’s to grab some supplies for lunch, headed upstate to the Shawangunk Mountains, known as ""the Gunks."" Our first pre-climb drive with our son was fun, but noticeably different from the pre-climb drives my husband and I had taken before. Instead of talking about routes to consider and plans for getting in as much climbing as possible, we did sing-a-longs and talked about the various trucks we passed on the highway. Pulling into New Paltz was exciting. A quick stop at the climbing shop was like visiting an old friend. When we arrived at the trailhead, it was early afternoon—a far cry from the alpine starts we aimed for in the past, though seldom achieved. My husband and I, back again at our favorite cliff, now with our son, were ready to embark on our adventure. We’d given a lot of thought to how to give Mason a sense of ownership and accomplishment in our day and the first thing we did was have him pack his own pack. We let him choose a few things he wanted to carry and included a piece of group gear so that he could contribute. Boy, did he look cute heading down the trail with his little backpack! We had a couple of routes on our list to check out but it became clear fairly quickly that our first choice wouldn’t work. A climb called Three Pines was as gentle as we remembered, but the start had a sequence of reaches that were just too big for a little boy barely over three feet tall. We decided to head down the cliff, and soon we were dropping our packs at the base of a rarely climbed corner. The route was steep but full of holds—perfect. There is a moment at the start of any climb when the mood shifts. The drive and the hike in can be casual and chatty, but then comes the time to get on the rock, and the climbing begins. We arranged the gear and my husband, David, started up the cliff to set the belay. After he reached the top and set the anchor, I clipped the rope to Mason’s harness, tied myself in a few feet below him, and we headed up. With my husband’s belay carefully set within eyesight up the cliff and me a few feet below him, Mason started up. He hesitated, a little scared, and balked. For a moment, I wondered whether Mason—my shy and cautious little boy—would have the courage to continue. But with some encouragement, he pushed through his fear and made his first move. Then another…and another—growing more confident as he learned to scan the rock and find the best hand and footholds. Before I knew it, we were halfway up the cliff and I was hurrying to keep up with him. By the time he got to the crux move (the hardest move on the route), he had a smile on his face. We made the belay with hugs and delight. Mason couldn’t have been happier. At the top of the cliff, we settled in to enjoy a picnic at the top of the world. It was a brilliant moment and the proud, ear-to-ear smile on my quiet boy’s face was unforgettable. After our leisurely lunch, we had one last challenge. As climbers always remind each other, the climb is only half done when you reach the top. After double-checking the anchor, I clipped Mason and myself to the rope and we rappelled down the cliff. The first step is the hardest as you trust your anchor and step out over the edge of the cliff. Mason and I held hands as we leaned back into the rope. Once the rope had our weight, it was easy. Down we went, taking our time to enjoy the feeling of total safety on the vertical face of the mountain. At the bottom, we celebrated again, and then it was time to pack the gear and head home. Hiking the mile or so trail back to the car is always a pleasant end to the day: passing other climbers and hikers, trading brief stories about the climbs of the day, and chatting with old friends. Our little guy is shy. He has a difficult time meeting strangers and even balks at saying ""hi"" to the guys who work in our building. But that day, perhaps buoyed by the confidence gained from climbing his first mountain or the feeling of kinship with his fellow climbers—or maybe just the pride of carrying his cool backpack with a couple of carabiners hanging off the webbing—he was right there with us, smiling and bantering with the people we passed. It was a big moment. Since this first trip, we have gone climbing many times—both at the indoor gym near us and back outdoors at the Gunks—and Mason has enthusiastically embraced his newfound identity as a climber. When we’re out at the park near our home, Mason brings his little rope and gear and strategically plots the route to the top of whatever ""mountain"" he is climbing, no matter how big or small. And although that first trip started as a way to introduce our son to a sport we love, we’ve since seen the other benefits climbing has brought to him. Climbing has given Mason a newfound sense of confidence—the confidence that comes from overcoming your fear—of the unknown, of failure, of taking risks—and pushing yourself to try something new and then achieve. It’s also given him a greater well of resilience that has spilled over into other areas of his life—to work at things that are hard, to overcome small failures, and to relish in the challenge. For a shy little boy like Mason, these benefits have been unexpectedly meaningful and rewarding. At school, his teachers have seen him come out of his shell and become a more social and vocal member of his class. Although this is due to more than just climbing, I can’t help but believe that the confidence he’s gained through climbing has played a big part. As I think about our next outdoor adventure—this time traveling to Colorado, one of our favorite places in the world—I think about the proud smile of my son, standing next to my husband, on the top of the highest mountain in the world that day.

19,The 7 Sailing Essentials to Bring,travel-leisure," Spending an afternoon on the open water is a wonderful opportunity to enjoy spending time with friends, family, and nature. Begin preparing for your first boating trip by packing personal flotation devices for everyone on board, and expand to include these items for a safe, relaxing experience. First Aid Kit A first aid kit isn't just good advice for boat owners sailing the high seas. Most larger sailboats are required to have at least once well-stocked first aid kit on board to meet regulations. Essential supplies include bandages, over the counter medications for pain and sunscreen. Motion sickness medications, antacids, and antiseptics are also essential for treating minor injuries. Other must-haves include: A waterproof, floating case to hold your first aid kit and emergency supplies Store flares in your first aid kit to use for medical emergencies Keep towels in a waterproof, floating case to use for more serious injuries Fresh Water A reusable water bottle and plenty of water keep you, and your guests, hydrated on sailing trips, and basic food supplies provide the fuel you need for a long day on the water. Emergency food and water supplies are an excellent option if you want to be prepared for any emergency. Typically, one person needs about a gallon of water per day to stay well-hydrated in warmer weather. Bring more water than you expect to use to prevent shortages, especially in very hot weather and on longer trips. Food and Snacks Freshly prepared picnics and dinners are a delicious way to enjoy a short day trip, but backup food supplies are a must for a long journey. Nonperishable food, such as canned food, is a simple option that remains edible for a long period of time and doesn't require refrigeration. Stocking 2,000 calorie meal bars in your first aid kit is a cost-efficient, space-saving way to maintain your energy levels in a more serious emergency. When you are in port, stock up on fresh foods and replenish your backup supplies as needed to eat well on the water. Chargers and Converters A simple converter transforms your onboard 12-volt charger into a convenient USB port that charges most cell phones, laptops and other devices, such as mp3 players. Even if you don't have service in your current location, keeping your mobile phone charged is recommended for improved safety. Plus, a smartphone, tablet or laptop is an easy backup option for downloading charts and maps. Although it isn't essential, adding an auxiliary cord allows you to easily play music from your mobile phone, or any other compatible device, through the onboard sound system, allowing you to enjoy your favorite songs when you don't have CDs or radio reception. If you don't have a sound system, try bringing portable speakers that work using Bluetooth. Personal Gear Sleeping bags, clothing, rain gear and extra towels keep you comfortable as the weather changes over the course of the day. Check the weather beforehand decide what types of clothing to bring. For example, swimming gear, including a swimsuit and snorkel, allows you to enjoy warm, summery weather. Opt for shoes with water-resistant grips to stay steady on deck, and bring a raincoat to stay drier while sailing through rough waters. If you are traveling on a chartered sailboat, you may not need to bring linens, sleeping bags, or towels. Check with your charter company to decide what type of personal gear is recommended. Personal Documents The documentation you need varies, depending on your route. Bring your passport to travel through international waters, and keep copies of insurance documents, maps, charts and your diver's cards. If you have a skipper's license, or a similar license, keep it with your logbook and other important documents. All paperwork should be stored in a floating, waterproof bag. Tools and Operational Supplies A headlamp, radar reflector, and an air horn are basic tools that improve safety, while extra rope and a basic set of tools are necessary to keep your sailboat in tip-top shape on both long and short journeys. A sharp knife, a utility tool and a lighter are essentials to keep in both your tool kit and first aid kit. Check your lighters frequently to ensure they work properly and bring waterproof matches along in case your lighter fails. From first aid supplies to music and mobile phones, stocking your sailboat with essentials before you leave shore ensures you can handle any situation you encounter. Your checklist can change over time, and longer journeys require more intense preparation than shorter trips. Begin with these basics, and build your own personalized supply list to keep your personal must-haves on hand."
20,Reasons to Visit a Winter Destination,travel-leisure," Many outdoor enthusiasts love traveling in winter, and enjoy sights, sounds, and experiences that summer travelers miss out on.  Most everyone thinks of camping, travel to national parks, swimming and outdoor activities as summer activities, but winter activities can be awesome too.  There are great reasons to plan your outdoor vacation in the wintertime.  Any getaway is welcomed to the average working person and here are a few reasons why visiting a winter destination should be considered. Winter Recreational Activities Winter weather can bring a variety of outdoor recreational activities that summer doesn’t.  Ice fishing, ice skating, cross country skiing and snowboarding are great activities that can only be done in winter.  There are also some year round activities like horseback riding, hiking and hot springs that are great to experience in the winter. Escape the Winter Blues Many people get down and depressed during the long months of winter and after the hussle and bussle of the holidays.  Taking a winter break can lift your spirits and give you a reason to experience outdoor winter activities. Take the time to plan a getaway during these times and overcome the winter blues.  Make some new memories with your family and enjoy a whole new adventure. Transformed Landscape Wintertime can transform any destination.  You can see different species of plants and animals.  Wildlife also behaves differently in the winter months.  Bare trees hold snow beautifully and can make you see the surroundings in a whole new way.  You will be surprised at how different you will perceive the beauty of nature in an unaccustomed way. Less crowded It’s winter and going to a beach may be the best trip ever.  Even the prime areas are less crowded with fewer tourist.  You will experience the authentic feel with the locals and maybe see things that are geared mainly for the tourist season.  You won’t be competing for the best campground spots, restaurants and activities. Even the little things will be better, like less trash, more firewood, less noise, and fewer people on trails.  All these things can make traveling in the winter even more enjoyable. Long nights If you enjoy sitting around the campfire, gazing at the stars, drinking cocoa and eating smores than winter camping with long nights will be a special pleasure for you.  Winter enhances your senses, allows you to see stars that you have never seen and truly enjoy the deep quiet of nature. This tranquility is something summer travelers will never really get to experience. Glamping Glamping is a new form of camping, in case you didn’t know.  It is where stunning nature meets modern luxury. It's a way to experience the untamed and completely unique parts of the world—without having to sacrifice modern comforts like TV and a bed to sleep in.  Glamorous camping is another word for this activity and if you do it in the winter you can have heat!  But don’t worry cause you can still brave the cold weather to roast marshmallows over a fire. Memories for Life You will either love or hate camping during the winter, either way you will come back with great pictures, stories, adventures and unique memories. These memories will last a lifetime and can be handed down for generation.  Making memories is one reason to go camping, winter or summer, and these memories might encourage others to go winter camping.  All winter travelers enjoy their adventures and love to brag about their experiences. I hope you like the reasons I have chosen to encourage you to try visiting a winter destination.  Remember winter activities are awesome and make great memories."

1,5 Ways Hotels Can Save Energy – and Money!,travel-leisure," As you know, running a hotel or B&B is an energy-intensive undertaking. Saving energy and switching to cheaper tariffs can result in significant savings – without affecting the customer experience. Catering for the needs of guests and patrons often leads to high energy consumption, but there are many ways for hospitality businesses to reduce their energy bills with just a few infrastructure adjustments and operational changes. Did You Know? The hospitality sector’s annual energy costs exceed £1.3 billion. Here are 7 simple ways for hotels and B&Bs to save energy: •	Control your heating using timed thermostats and radiator valves. •	Don’t operate the heating and cooling systems simultaneously, by switching off heating when a room reaches a temperature of 21°C, and avoid turning on air conditioning until the temperature exceeds 23°C. •	Save up to 10% of your annual heating costs by servicing your boiler and other heating and cooling equipment regularly. •	Switch to low energy light bulbs, which use up to 80% less energy and often last much longer too. •	Install daylight sensors. •	Install occupancy sensors so that lights are only on when needed. •	Avoid overheating your water - a temperature of 60°C provides comfortable hot water and is hot enough to kill legionella bacteria. •	Insulate your hot water pipes to avoid heat loss. •	Use solar water heating systems for hot tubs. •	Consider fitting spray water taps, which use less hot water and therefore less energy. •	Educate and train staff on ways to improve energy efficiencies. •	Incentivise staff to think of ways to reduce energy consumption across the hotel. •	Use signage and notes to remind guests of energy-saving best practices, such as re-using towels. •	Use an energy broker to compare energy quotes and tailor an energy strategy for your hospitality business. By shopping the market and switching suppliers, you could save up to 40%! •	An energy broker will also be able to tailor an ongoing energy strategy suited to your specific needs. •	They can also give you the information you need to understand, react, and maximise efficiency by identifying discrepancies and areas of potential savings. Saving energy means saving money, and helping to save the environment – all while keeping guest happy, comfortable, and coming back!"

It is good to bring hiking poles if you are not content with uphill stairs. Also brings the sturdy hiking boots, 3-4 pairs of socks and other necessary clothing. Also get water purification tablets and small first aid kit with all necessary medicines. You don’t need to pack a sleeping bag as lodges offers ample of warm blanket but you can bring a sleeping bag liner. The nights will not go to a freezing level until Ghorepani.

3,Life at Cape Flattery Lighthouse,travel-leisure," In March of 1778 Captain James Cook sailed the waters of the North Washington Coast where there was an opening along the coastline. He named the place Cape Flattery because he thought he had been flattered into thinking it was a passage into The Strait of Juan de Fuca. In his logbook he wrote ""In this very latitude geographers have placed the pretended Strait of Juan de Fuca. But nothing of that kind presented itself to our view, nor is it probable that any such thing ever existed."" Ten years later Captain John Meares managed to confirm the existence of the Strait of Juan de Fuca when he visited a small island that sits about a half mile off Cape Flattery. There he met Tatooche, chief of the Makah Indians. He named the island after Chief Tatooche. The chief used the island as his base during summers when he hunted whales and caught salmon. In 1850 William McArthur had just finished surveying the west coast and recommended a lighthouse be established on Tatooche Island. In this way the vessels could enter the strait at night and not have to wait until daylight. In 1854 Congress was convinced to allocate $39,000 to build lighthouses on Tatoosh Island and on New Dungeness Spit. The government had paid $30,000 for all of the Makah's traditional lands except for a small reservation at Neah Bay. The Makah Indians were quite angry with the white people who purchased their land and gave the construction crew a hostile reception. This was because several hundred of the Indians had been killed by an outbreak of smallpox in 1853 brought on by the disease bearing ""Bostons"". During the summer the Indians continued to use the island for fishing and whale hunting. In order to protect themselves the construction crew built a blockhouse of rough-hewn timbers before they started construction on the lighthouse. There was always one member of the crew on guard duty but there were no more issues with the Indians other than a few missing tools and supplies. On December 28, 1857 the first-order Louis Sauter Fresnel lens light was first illuminated in the sixty-six foot tower of Cape Flattery lighthouse. This tower was taller than most of the Cape-Cod-Style lighthouses. Its white light had a focal plane 162 feet above the sea. Cape Flattery lighthouse was the fourteenth established on the west coast. The pay for a lighthouse keeper was poor and the weather conditions were miserable.causing many keepers to resign. In 1861 there was a visitor to the island who saw the rundown condition of the lighthouse. He saw the leaky roof and the moss growing on inside walls. Wind even blew across the chimney causing smoke to invade the living quarters. The keepers were provided with extra fuel and the district engineer was commanded to find a permanent solution. In 1873, after several years of deplorable conditions and inept keepers, the lighthouse dwelling was declared ""not fit to be occupied"" as the walls were moldy all year long. Congress appropriated $18,000 to build a new duplex with six rooms on each side. The rooms in the lighthouse which were formerly keepers quarters were now being used for storage. Some very interesting things happened on this island. Francis James was the first principal keeper. One day he became angry with an assistant and threw coffee in his face. The two men decided to settle the argument with a gunfight. They took three shots at each other, called it a draw and shook hands. Later, another assistant confessed to removing the bullets. Due to the ""frollicking"" nature of the bachelor keepers it was decided that keepers with families were more dependable and in 1894, with families coming onto the island, it was determined that more living space was needed. and the lighthouse was once again made livable. October 27,1900 assistant keeper Nels Nelson and Frank Reif lost their lives in a small boat during a storm. Their bodies were found over a week later on Vancouver Island. In 1900 John W Cowan and his wife and seven children arrived at the lighthouse and stayed on for 32 years experiencing many exciting times. The children attended school in Portland while staying with relatives. They spent the summers at home on the island with their parents. Eventually there were enough children on the island to warrant a school. On February 18, 1911 Cowan saw a vessel struggling in angry seas between Tatoosh Island and Neah Bay. He was able to rescue two navy radio men, but was unable to save three others including his own son Forrest. There is a story, not verified, that a seventy-mile-per-hour gale hit the island in 1921. It blew Mr. Cowan across the island for about 300 ft while he clung to vegetation before crawling to safety. The family's bull was listed as ""lost at sea"". Everyone was very surprised and plied him with extra rations when he swam asho The Cowan family was evidently much beloved . When they left the island after retiring in September of 1932 their fellow islanders were in tears. Second Assistant Keeper Ole Rasmussen was another casualty while returning to the island in a small boat. Heavy swells capsized his craft and he was struck in the head. The weather station was closed in 1966. 1977 brought automation of the light station. A modern beacon was installed to replace the tower's Fresnel lens in 1996 The Makah Indian Tribe now controls the decommissioned Cape Flattery Lighthouse and the island. It is well worth the trip to drive to Neah Bay, get out of the car and hike the o.75 miles to the tip of the cape where you can view Tatoosh Island and the lighthouse. This happens to be the western most point in the continental US. In Port Angeles you can visit the Museum at 207 South Lincoln Street where you can see the fourth-order Fresnel lens that was used at Cape Flattery. The museum hours are Wednesday through Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m."
4,Camping At It’s Best,travel-leisure," Do you remember all the fun you had as kid camping with your parents?  I do.  Let’s look at some great memories of the adventures of camping. Sitting on an old log around a campfire is the best part of camping.  Lawn chairs can come in handy also.  This is the time to relax and enjoy being with family or friends.  You can sing along with familiar tunes or even play a guitar for a sing along.  The radio from your truck can also be great entertainment.  So start packing for the weekend of you life, enjoying the great outdoors. You always want to be aware of where you are camping and your surroundings.  Never trespass on someone else's land and always look for places that are safe. If you are camping in a tent try to find a nice level spot to set up your tent.  If you are camping with a truck bed tent you can camp just about anywhere. Once when I was a young girl my Dad took us camping near a river.  We clear off a spot in the middle of the woods with an ax and he just back the truck right into the spot.  We stayed there a weekend and had the best time.  Those were the days.  Camping at it’s best! If you are camping with children you should always have extra activities to keep them entertained.  Shovels and buckets for playing in the dirt or sand are important to have. Yard darts are ideal for playing and in cause it rains. You can always carry board games when camping and of course playing cards.  When I camped by the river as a kid we would use shovels to build a mud slide down the river banks when we went swimming. This was a blast! It is a rule of thumb that when you are camping take only photos and leave only footprints. Use only natural resources that you need and do not leave any traces that you were camping.  Pick up all trash, extinguish and put out any fire pits. Make the area where you camped look exactly as it did when you found it.  We all know the importance of a campfire.  It makes camping so much fun, so always take caution. Once you have the campfire going you need to get out the supplies for S'mores. S’mores are the main part of any camping trip. Be sure and pack graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows so you can enjoy the the best part of camping. You just toast the marshmallows, then make it the filling to a graham cracker/chocolate sandwich. When you have a S’more, you will want 'some more'--bring enough for everyone to have at least two of them! I have many fond memories of camping. They really help me to remember my parent that are now gone. I hope the information provided here helps you realize the importance of camping with your family and taking the time to get out and take in mother nature. Making it a memorable trip will instill the importance of camping and spending time with family. Remember this is camping at it’s best."

7,12 Multi-Purpose Gear Items For Your Emergency Survival Kit,travel-leisure," Your emergency survival kit should be compact, light-weight, and contain sufficient gear to support you for several weeks if need be. Your kit should contain as many items as possible that serve multiple purposes. Here is a list of the top twelve items, and some of their uses. This is one of the most important item in your kit. While accessories will vary, a good multi-tool may contain pliers, wire cutter, wire stripper, multiple Blades, can/bottle openers, various screwdrivers, nut drivers, scissors, tweezers, ruler, awl, etc. Although not very compact, a machete is lighter than most hatchets and serves more purposes. If you have a machete and a multi-tool in your kit, you will not need a hatchet or a knife. The only function lost with this elimination is the hammer on the back of most hatchets, but sticks or rocks will work just fine for most hammering needs in survival situations. Blades are made of many different types of metals and alloys, in different tempers and thicknesses, widths, lengths, styles, and shapes. Handles are made of many different types of materials in many different shapes and sizes. A good survival machete will have a semi-flexible blade 18 inches or longer that is easy to sharpen, yet keep a good edge with moderate use. Most importantly, the handle MUST be comfortable and fit well in your hand. With a machete, you can perform any task that can be done with a large knife or hatchet. It can also be used to dig or pry, or as a formidable weapon. Install and use a wrist lanyard when chopping or swinging a machete. The most common type of para-cord has a tensile strength of 550 pounds. That is far heavier than needed for most survival uses. The diameter of this cord is 4mm. That doesn't sound like much, but it adds up. Shop around and smaller diameter cord can be found. Cord with a tensile strength of 200 - 250 pounds is quite sufficient and has half the bulk. There is an endless number of uses for para-cord. Use it to erect and build shelters and useful camp furnishings, repair clothing and gear, as a sling for containing and carrying loads, bundles of firewood, boughs, reeds or grass for bedding, pull dead branches down from trees for firewood, boot lacing, belts, snares and traps, ""burglar"" alarms, binding splints, and secure bandages in place, fire starting material... the list goes on. Carry a minimum of 30'. Get a good heavy-duty brand name roll. Use it to repair clothing, boots, tools, and equipment, construct shelters, furnishings, and implements. Use it to relieve hot friction spots on feet to prevent blisters, and wrap around hands for makeshift gloves. Twist into a ""rope"" if needed, which is good for making snowshoes. It also makes a good mousetrap and decent fire starter. A 200' spool of waxed dental floss can be invaluable. While important for maintaining good oral hygiene, it can serve other purposes such as repairing small items, sewing and stitching clothing, boots (or even skin), making tools and weapons, or used as fishing line. This can be galvanized, stainless steel or copper. The more flexible the better. Use it to repair gear items, make snares and traps, and at the fire pit to suspend a pot, meat and other foods over the fire to cook. A grill or ""toaster"" can be made with wire. A black 6-mil heavy-duty sheet 6'x8' or larger. Use as a wind block, lean-to, shelter roof, rain-fly, ground tarp, blanket, poncho, and to protect gear and clothing from rain, snow, and dew fall. Use to collect and store water, make a  solar still. The black color absorbs sunlight creating heat which will help keep you warm and will generate more water quicker than clear plastic when used as a solar still, and it may be more visible to rescuers in certain terrains and conditions. The reflective qualities of a space blanket are ideal for reflecting your body heat back to you, or campfire heat toward you or into your shelter. Used along with the plastic sheet there are many combinations and configurations that can be incorporated to provide shelter and/or bedding. A space blanket is shiny like aluminum foil on at least one side, which is good for signaling rescuers under sunny conditions. Use for lighting, warmth, cooking, lighting fires, or signaling at night. Melted wax can be used for waterproofing leather boots, and thighs, knees, and seats of cotton pants. During ""bug season"" include a citronella candle to ward off insects. If out of water and your mouth is dry, chewing on a clump of wax will generate saliva, and it may help curb hunger pains. The act of chewing helps blood circulation in your head which may result in a more alert brain, which is good in a survival situation. 1 or 2 Gallon-size bags are ideal for packing clothing items, food, toiletries, and other gear items. Use to collect and store water. The 1 gallon-size bags can be worn over socks to keep feet dry, or on your hat or head to keep your head dry. Sandwich bags work great for holding smaller items. Worn-out bags can be used to start fires. Paper towels are good for not only the obvious everyday uses we find for them, but also serve other uses such as; note paper and wound dressing, filtering sediment from drinking water, and toilet paper. Fritos and Doritos snack chips are the best choices. While not the healthiest food available, it will still provide fuel for your body, and much-needed salt which helps prevent muscle cramping. Fritos and Doritos highly flammable. Use 2 or 3 as tender, or light the whole single-portion bag for a quick fire in wet conditions. When assembling your kit, think of other uses an item might serve or other items that might serve its purpose. Consolidate to eliminate the need for several single-purpose items to reduce the weight and space requirements of your kit. Assemble your kit to suit your particular needs, but keep it simple and streamlined with multi-purpose survival gear items and face your next survival situation with confidence."

13,Truck Tents Have Many Advantages,travel-leisure," Camping can have many events that can dampen your adventure other than rain. Let’s look into making these events less of a nuisance by camping with a truck bed tent. Extreme swings in temperature during the spring and fall can be one of the hardest parts of camping. In the spring temperature can remain chilly and in the fall temperatures can drop to below freezing.  Having a tent in the bed of your truck is one way to help combat the cold temperatures. A truck bed works as a great windbreak, better than any kind of material.  Having that solid piece of metal between you and the wind cuts down a lot on a cold breeze. Spring downpours can lead to a very soggy camping experience, which nobody wants. If you are sleeping on the ground it can make for a very uncomfortable night.  The ground can be uneven and wet. Truck bed tents by Napier uses a durable fabric to keep everything dry despite a rainy evening. With a sleeping pad you will be surprised how comfortable everything feels. If you’re a truck owner, there is an alternative to getting off the ground and staying dry. Buy a truck bed tent. Truck Bed Tents Can Save The Day I’m sure you have seen truck bed tents in campgrounds, they have been around for a while now .Older models might have been hard to set up, but new models have gotten much easier to set up and strap into the bed of your truck. These tents are designed to keep you covered from rain and snow, keep you out of the wind, but most importantly, they get you off the ground.  Napier truck tents fit perfectly on all makes and model of trucks available. Convenient, Comfortable And Room to Move I would recommend getting a truck bed tent because they give you plenty of room to spare.  Whether you’re camping with your dog, your wife, or need room for a cooler of beer, these truck bed tents give you plenty of room to sprawl out. If your truck bed or truck bed liner has ridges like so many do, I recommend getting a thick pad to sleep on.  A thicker pad will ensure a much better nights sleep. Simple To Setup And Take Down If you follow the instructions you are ensured to properly strap everything together for a sturdy and safe tent.  Unlike a pop-up tent, these tents are strapped to your truck and depending on what style you get they can also be stakes into the ground. Just keep your instructions handy by putting them in your glove box. These truck tents are an awesome option for taking your truck out and enjoying the great outdoors.  Camping can make for a great weekend trip with your family.  You’ve got sturdy protection with your truck, a comfortable and dry place to sleep with a lot of head room and you’re completely covered from the elements. There are so many advantages with truck bed tents why not get out and enjoy the great outdoors today."
14,Things You Must Have When Camping,travel-leisure," Clean drinking water, Leash for your pet, Flashlight/batteries, Bed clothing/sleeping bags, Food, Toiletries and First aid kit Take along plenty of drinking water. You always need to stay hydrated.  You will need the water to prepare your food and for cleaning up after yourself. You may also need water to wash your hands and feet. It is better to bring along more than you need than not enough. Keep a close eye on your dog while you are camping and always keep him on a leash. Many camping areas have rules about pets. Be sure to keep your pet away from others belongings. There are those who fear dogs. A flashlight is also a must have item when you camp, but make sure the batteries are fully charged or new. Also be sure and have extra batteries in case they are needed. One way to be sure the batteries don't accidentally die on the trip is to put them into the flashlight backwards when not is use. That way if the switch is accidentally left on, they stay charged. This also ensures you never misplace the batteries. Be sure and pack bedding and sleeping clothes. If you are going to be camping a long time be sure and purchase an expensive sleeping bag. It needs to be rated for below freezing temperatures if needed. Extra blankets are a good idea for warmth or for extra padding. Many people like to sleep in warm clothing to help with cold temperatures, so don’t forget your PJ’s. Food is another staple, like water, that is needed when camping.  If you have the place to cook that is the best, but you can always take dried meals and snacks.  If bringing fresh food, be sure that all items are kept cool in a cooler or refrigerator. There are many one dish meals that can be used for camping to make food preparation a lot easier. When you are cleaning up you should always have soap.  Don’t forget to pack soap, shampoo and other cleaning items.  The most important toilette item to pack is toilet paper. There isn’t a lot to say about a first aid kit, except that every camper needs one in case of an emergency.  You can never be to safe. With fond memories of camping people will tell you that being prepared is a must. The information provided here should help make it so that you have a memorable trip as well.  Please keep this information in mind and you and your family will have a great camping trip."
15,Stephanie's Adventures,travel-leisure," LAND BETWEEN THE LAKES Mom and Dad loved to have the family together as often as possible. After the children were married and living from St. Louis to Columbus, MS to Knoxville, TN it became very difficult to arrange family time that included everyone. They began planning family gatherings every Memorial Day in addition to Christmas. About 1980 the family began meeting at a park on Memorial Day weekend. It is amazing this continued because the first Memorial Day trip was at a cheap hotel near Land-Between the Lakes State Park. It rained all weekend. The hotel was uncomfortable and the food was not good. The next year cabins at the Kentucky Dam State Park were rented. These accommodations were better. The weather was good and the food was better. More activities were planned for the grandchildren. My Dad brought his ski boat. Uncle brought a trailer load of games and equipment. These Memorial Day trips continued for several years at Kentucky Dam State Park or Lake Barkley State Park. Later, a Memorial Day weekend was enjoyed in Gatling and at the large Wallace home in Columbus, Ms. GREAT SMOKEY MOUNTAIN TRIP The Smokey Mountain Memorial Day weekend was a tremendous hit with everyone. My uncle brought all his toys. The sons & daughters challenged mammas and the poppas to a volleyball match. Somehow the mammas and poppas pulled off one more win. I think that was the last. We fished in the Pigeon River, bike on the mountain trails, and went tubing in the Pigeon River. We shopped and ate in Gatling. At night, we played games and enjoyed visiting in the big lounge. Trip ideas - Great Smoky Mountains National Park One of the most popular day trips in the Smoky Mountains is to Cade Cove. Plan to spend at least 2 to 3 hours in the Cove where you will want to make frequent stops to view historic buildings, wildlife, scenic views, and maybe take a hike. There is a picnic area with BBQ grills. There are also several areas throughout the Cove where you can enjoy a picnic, but there are no tables. Close to Cade Cove is Townsend, TN which has several great mom and pop restaurants. MONTE EAGLE BAY JAMAICA We resided at the Royal Palms Villa near Monte Eagle Bay owned by Rev. Janet Trout. We spent the days walking the white sandy beach in front of the villa. We looked for shells, soaked in the wonderful sunshine, and went snorkeling on the corals. We shopped at the markets in Coho Rios and Monte Eagle Bay. We golfed at Runaway Bay, Wisdom Rose Hall and Half Moon golf resorts. We watched the locals. At night, we often went to Taney to listen to the steel band, watch the entertainers and the crab races. We visited Plymouth, an 18th century port town, to see the historical buildings and Discovery Bay: Site of Columbus' landing in 1494. We traveled in a rental van. Driving was a challenge since driving is a national sport in Jamaica. Everyone drove on the left side of highway (wrong side) with the pedal to the metal and horns blaring. If everyone went on the van trip, kitchen chairs were added to the van for seating. CRUISES TRIPS This adventures started when I was at Stewart Home School. We took a lot of cruises trip to different places like Canada, Mexico and Bahama. They were a lot of fun we saw different kind of things to do when we were on shore they were snorkeling, deep-sea fishing and much more. We to the Cardinal Ship to all these places. When we were on the ship they were, different kind eating places like buffets with a lot of food. You can even go swimming the pools on the deck and look out over ship at the ocean. They were different kind of shows to see while we were on board. COSTA RICA OF MEXICO Hike in cloud and rain forests, pristine golden brown beaches and active volcano's craters. Get closer than you ever imagine to frogs, monkeys, sloths, birds and wildlife and do something different that you have always wanted to do- yoga, whitewater raft, zip lines, surf, dive, snorkel, and enjoy yourself.

We had the usual things that a wedding has like cocktail hour and dinner and the food was fabulous. They had different things do to while you there. You could go deep-sea fishing, swimming and snorkeling and golfing. The cabins were very nice a decorated they had good service while we were there. BAHAMAS HOTEL OR RESORT! On Nassau Paradise Island, you can board a 45-foot catamaran for a coral reef excursion, explore a shipwreck on a half-day scuba diving trip, stroll the bottom of a shark exhibit for a little face-to-nose time, or even try Snub, which pairs the simplicity of snorkeling with the wonders of underwater breathing. Add in the Caribbean's largest marine habitat and water park at Atlantis, and you'll soon discover a world of wonderful water activities awaits you on Nassau Paradise Island."
16,Alki Point: From a Kerosene Lantern to Lighthouse,travel-leisure," A  wedge shaped piece of West Seattle stretches into Puget Sound forming the southern boundary of Elliott Bay, the first settlers of which were Duwamish Indians. It was first named New York by Charles Terry who operated a store in that location. The place was later named Alki Point. In 1868 Hans Martin Hanson and his brother-in-law Knud Olson purchased the 260 acres of land from Dr. David Maynard. The purchase price was $450. Later Hanson and Olson divided the property with Hanson's portion being the point. Legend has it that sometime during the 1870s farmer Hanson hung a brass kerosene lantern from a post. He did this in order to mark the dangerous shoals of Alki Point for the mariners of Puget Sound who were increasing in numbers. In 1887 the Federal Lighthouse Board decided that Alki Point was extremely hazardous to marine traffic and they replaced Hanson's kerosene lantern with a ""post lantern"". ""Post lanterns"" were used at many locations until a lighthouse could b e built. Because the lantern was on his property, Hanson was appointed light keeper. His salary was $15.00 a month. For this he filled the fuel tank, cleaned the glass, trimmed the wicks and lit and extinguished the lamp daily. He was helped by his son, Edmund, his six daughters, and his niece Linda Olson. Mr. Martin's children inherited his 320-acre farm when he died on July 26, 1900. They also inherited the light keeper's job which still paid only $15. a month. Edmund and his cousin Linda Olson along with Edmund's children kept the lamp burning for another 10 years. In 1910 the U. S. Lighthouse Service purchased the 1.5 acre pie-shaped piece of land at Alki Point for $9,999. A 37-foot-tall octagonal concrete and masonry tower with an attached fog signal building was built on the point. Behind the lighthouse was built two large homes for the lighthouse keepers and their families. In order to protect the buildings from heavy swell during storms and high tides the contractors brought in about 7,000 yards of sand and gravel an d added to the point. This required the service of two lighthouse keepers doing 12-hour shifts seven days a week for which they were each paid $800 a year plus housing. Over the years various improvements were made in the lighthouse system and changes in personnel were made until in 1970, Albert G Anderson, the last civilian lighthouse keeper retired after spending 20 years at Alki Point. All of the light keeping was done manually at the point until the 1980's. Coast Guardsmen stood guard on eight-hour watches, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The keeper turned the airway beacon on one-half hour before sunset and turned it off one-half hour after sunrise. The Chief Lighthouse Keeper's house was occupied by the Commander of the 13th Coast Guard District. The Alki Point Lighthouse was fully automated in October 1984. The modern VRB-25 marine rotating beacon operates 24hours a day, flashing once every five seconds.. An emergency light located on the outside of the tower is operated by 12 volt batteries. Two electric fog horns are activated when visibility drops below three miles. The Coast Guard Museum, Pier 36, 1519 Alaskan Way S in Seattle is where you can see, on display, the old post lantern that was placed on Alki Point in 1887 by the Lighthouse Service. The Alki Point Lighthouse, 3201 Alki Avenue SW, is one of eight lighthouses on or near Puget Sound open to visitors."
17,The History of the Camping Tent,travel-leisure," In any given summer more than 42 million Americans turn to the great outdoors seeking escape from the everyday rat race of life.  To complete this task they go camping. The idea of voluntarily leaving behind a comfortable home to sleep in for the hard ground under the stars is hard for some people to fathom. Cooking food over a smoky fire and fighting off insects are also hard to believe you would do.  But the idea of camping is very appealing to many and that is way we Americans go camping. Here is a short history of tent camping. A long time before becoming our favorite pastime, camping was actually, the way of life. The most important piece of equipment was the tent. Today's familiar shelter was designed by a U.S. Army in 1855. It modeled it’s ""bell tent"" after Native American tee pees, using canvas instead of buffalo hides. By 1911 the first Boy Scout Handbook was published and  it showed 10 different types of tents. After WWII was over in 1945, the post-war economic boom sent Americans to camping retailers and Army surplus stores where they purchase thousands of tents of all styles before heading off to the great outdoors. The first fast-to-set-up freestanding tent was designed in 1959. It featured wooden poles. Metal poles that were lightweight begin to replace wooden frames in 1960.  In the 70’s a backpack-storable tent was designed and it sold 1 million units in just 10 years. The first ""truck-tent"" was developed in 1990 and it was designed to be pitched in the bed of a pickup truck. Today these tents have come a long way with improvements that make camping very comfortable. Technological innovations offer a more pleasing experience and 3.2 million Americans still make tent camping a past time to enjoy and remember. I can relate to the events listed above because I was camping in my backyard at an early age in the 1960’s.  My first tent had wooden poles and it gave me a sense of adventure to be by myself camping in the backyard under the stars.  It is a memory that I will never forget and I encouraged my boys to do the same as they grew up.  As I got older my tents improve with metal poles and material that's waterproof. My places to camp improve also.  I would camp at the river and in the woods near the river.  This made for great adventures to have as keepsakes.  Later on I started camping at a campground near a lake that gave me peace and a sense of satisfaction. Now I still love to camp and I have a truck bed tent that fits my F-150 truck bed.  This allow me to sleep up off the ground and to stay dry way better that in the past. With this kind of tent I can camp just about anywhere my truck will take me.  What a great way to enjoy nature and to make more memories for me and my family."
18,"Marrowstone Point Light and the ""Triangle of Fire""",travel-leisure," Near Port Townsend, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula extends a piece of low level ground known as Marrowstone Point. The point was named by captain George Vancouver after visiting the site in May of 1792 and spotting the clay that can be seen in the bluffs above the point. About October 1 1888 a lens lantern with a red light was mounted on a pole to mark the eastern entrance to Port Townsend Bay. In 1892 the Lighthouse board recommended a large fog bell be installed to warn of the sharp turn in the course when entering for leaving Puget Sound. $3,500 was allocated by Congress on March 3 1893 and a one and one half story six-room keepers house with a fog bell tower was built and put into operation on April 7, 1896. The huge 1,200 pound bell would strike twice every fifteen seconds during periods of fog or low visibility. Seventy-year-old former sea captain Osmore H Morgan was the first keeper. He had spent the prior fourteen years as head keeper at the New Dungeness Lighthouse. His daughter, Nettie Race took over after his passing in 1907. A few months later Axel Rustad was appointed keeper and he and wife Karen took over. They stayed for ten years raising four sons in the keepers quarters. The only water for the family was rain water collected and stored in a 5,000-gallon redwood tank which was located in a shed behind the house. In July 1903 the North Pacific, a side wheel steamer struck Craven Rock off Marrowstone Point in a dense fog. The steamer had 14 passengers aboard who were taken to shore by lifeboats and the tug boat C. B. Smith. Lighthouse keeper Morgan fed and sheltered them until they were taken aboard the steamer Mainlander which had run aground on Marrowstone Point that same morning but was afloat again at high tide. The North Pacific was a total loss as it sank in deep water. In 1907 construction of Fort Flagler was completed. Fort Flagler joined with the guns at Fort Casey on Admiralty Head and the guns at Fort Worden near Point Wilson to form a ""Triangle of Fire"" to prevent enemy vessels from entering Puget Sound Dense fog caused another mishap in August 1908. The 502-foot-long armored cruiser USS Colorado ran aground on Liplip Point the southeast tip of Marrowstone Island. This incident cast light on the need for more navigational aids in Puget Sound.  On October 22, 1913 Congress appropriated $30,000 for improvements. Marrowstone Point received a new fog signal and light in 1914. An experimental acetylene gun was installed in a wooden building thirteen yards northeast of the bell tower and took the place of the fog bell. Mariners were asked to report the efficiency of the gun to the lighthouse inspector in Portland. A new acetylene gun was installed atop a concrete structure just two months later. At the same time, the light was changed from a fixed red to a quick two red flashes every six seconds. The acetylene fog gun was the first of its kind to be used in the United States. Several improvements were made over the years until 1962 when it was automated. In 1972 the Coast Guard transferred the property to the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to be used as a research facility. The keepers house is now used as a guest house for scientists who visit the Marrowstone Marine Field Station. Still standing at the waters edge are the structure that held the light and fog signal and the light tower. The flashing white light is still functioning but the fog signal is no longer being used. The station is now being used as a marine ecosystem health and marine fish health research facility. Fort Flagler is now Fort Flagler State Park . A military museum is located in the park. The Marrowstone Point Light is visible from the park's beach but it is not open to the public."
19,The Lighthouse That Sheltered an Indian Woman,travel-leisure," The New Dungeness lighthouse was the second lighthouse in the state of Washington. It was first lit in December 14, 1858 following Cape Disappointment Light which was first lit in 1856. In 1927 its original 100 foot tower was lowered to 63 feet after several earthquakes and foul weather caused some structural damage making for the concern that it would topple. The lantern room from the decommissioned Admiralty head Lighthouse was removed and then placed on the shorter tower. A revolving Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. William Henry Blake was the first keeper of the New Dungeness Lighthouse and was very highly regarded. The USCG coastal buoy tender WLM-563 Henry Blake which is based in Everett, Washington is named after him. Blake was faithful in his duty to keep the light going for over 10 years as its only keeper. He lit the lanterns every night and tolled the huge bell constantly in foggy weather in order to warn approaching mariners away from the spit. He was well known for his commitment to the safety of the mariners He married Mary Ann McDonnell in 1862 and they had five children: Catherine, Richard, Clara, Mary and Hannah, the first three were born at the lighthouse. A fact about Henry Blake that is little known is how he took in and sheltered a pregnant Native American woman from the Tsimshian tribe. She and several tribesmen had been ambushed by Clallam Indians. The Clallams demanded that he give her up but he refused. The Clallam Indians were later punished and she returned to her tribe. In 1902 a Native American man appeared at the lighthouse to pay his respects claiming that he was the baby she was carrying. In 1873 Henry Blake was replaced by Franklin Tucker who served until December 1882. In 1882 he was replaced by Amos Morgan after being transferred to Ediz Hook Light Station. Amos Morgan kept the light until March 1896 when Oscar Brown and Joseph Dunn served as keepers. The last keepers were Michelle and Seth Jackson and their dog Chicago. In March of 1994 the Coast Guard boarded up the station and soon the United States Lighthouse Society was able to obtain a lease from the Coast Guard. The eight acre New Dungeness Lighthouse historic district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The station is now manned 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by the Society and tours are available from 9AM- 5PM every day. The Sequim, Washington area which includes the city of Port Angeles is a very entertaining and beautiful place to vacation.. It not only provides a lighthouse to visit, you can drive up Hurricane Ridge to take in one of the most spectacular views in the country. While in the area you must take a day and drive out to Neah Bay where you can walk the boardwalk to the northwest point in the continental United States. Another very pleasant afternoon can be spent at the Olympic Game Farm where you can drive through and visit Wildlife up close and personal. You can also board a ferry at Port Angeles and cruise to Victoria BC, Canada."

2,Tips for Ice Fishing,travel-leisure," It's that time of the year again, where the lakes start freezing or are already frozen depending on where you live. So we all know what that means, time to get out all the ice fishing gear and hit the lakes. Here are a few tips to help you be more successful at ice fishing. You always want to make sure you have all the right equipment before hitting the lake. Here are a couple of the more important equipment you need for ice fishing, always have proper winter clothing, back-up winter clothing in case you fall in the water, fully charged cell phone, so if anything happens you have a way to contact someone, if you are out fishing alone. You also need a bucket, ice scoop, auger, bait, tip-ups or fishing pole and you tackle. You want to make sure you always go through your check list every time you hit the lake. Once you are out on the ice, finding the right depth matters. Most fish will generally stay in a specific depth during the winter, which can make it easier to find them. If it is a common lake you have fished regularly during the summer months you will know all the premium spots and depths of the lake. If you aren't familiar with the lake you can hop online and look for a map of the lake and it will show you all the different depths of the lake and you can check out the depths for the species you are looking to fish for. Now that you have found a spot to fish, you can start drilling holes in the ice for your tip-ups, if you have some and a couple of holes to fish from while waiting on your tip-ups to go off. Remember to spread out the placement of your holes. If you put them close to each other you have the worries of them getting tangled when there is a fish on and some people say having them close together loses you chance of catching a fish as there are too much bait in one area. You are ready to start fishing, some people say you ice fish like you are summer fishing, which isn't true. You want to make sure you are going slow and steady as fish don't expend as much energy during the winter months.If you are looking to give your fishing a jump start, you can always chum the hole before you start fishing. Sometimes chumming your hole can actually bring more fish to your area. You can use minnows or wax worms and let the fish go to town. Always have different types of bait with you, as you never know what the fish are looking to eat on that day. If you move your bait or jig too fast, a fish might let it go to save some energy. If you are going to be fishing for bluegills or perch, you want to fish the bottom as they love to feed off the bottom during the winter months. Now that you have a few tips for a successful ice fishing trip. Get off the computer and put those tips to the test. Always remember to be safe and know the thickness of the ice before walking or driving out on the ice. You don't want to start your ice fishing trip having to turn around right away from falling in."

4,"Mountain Bike Riding at Gisburn Forest, Lancashire",travel-leisure," Gisburn might feel like it’s in the middle of nowhere, but it’s an award-winning focus point for all sorts of riders. We hit its rollercoaster trails to find out why As gravel rattles off wheel arches, the long fireroad drive to the Forest Den car park could be straight out of any of your favourite freeride DVDs. That 15-minute journey down twisty dry-stone-walled lanes places it dead centre of the Pennines on the Lancashire-Yorkshire border. That’s half an hour from UK component heroes Hope, who’ve been a big part of the trail building here and who sponsor one of the latest downhill sections. It’s classic Gisburn too. Local heroes Rolling off the fire road and into the tight-packed forest, the first few corners are relatively flat. But then the trail steepens and corkscrews, picking up speed and throwing you into a series of aggressively tight, tyre-growling berms. It’s not just the rapid-fire banked turns you’ve got to be ready for either – I’m trying to keep young local hotshot Joe Flanagan in sight when the next deep-scooped berm fires us into a line of three immaculately crafted tabletops. No blown-up lips or rutted landings here, but rock solid takeoffs topped with neat rolled kickers. While the sudden appearance of these jumps is a shock to me, it’s obviously not to Joe, and he vanishes into the tops of the trees before eventually dropping back on to the last bit of landing slope and then firing up out of sight again. We’re not going to miss the opportunity to play here for a while, so we take the knowingly created cutout back on to the fireroad to repeat the flight-time fix a few more times. Last time we were up here we met two of the main reasons that the Forestry Commission, er, commissioned bits are so sweetly sculpted and radical. Behind the levers of the excavators were the Hemingway brothers. Local legends of anything two-wheeled, front wave Megavalanche riders and frontrunners in the most extreme two-wheeled event we know (Google ‘Erzbergrodeo’ and you’ll see what we mean). Basically, these boys know what serious thrill riding is all about and they know exactly how to deliver it with a digger. Hop it, don’t Hobbit There’s a point when you know you’re getting sketchy, and after some seriously tweaked landings, Joe finally extends his next run into one of the three dropaway exits to this section. Again, these aren’t for the wary – a series of chainring notches on the big lump of rock on the inside lip shows that those riders too scared to commit at speed have been rewarded with some serious teeth grinding and the kind of nearly over-the-bar rear wheel kick that can seriously stain your shorts. Off the drop and you’re back into another stack of seriously tight berms through mossbearded trees straight out of Mordor. It’s line choice not Rings that’s ‘precious’ here though, as you slot through the entry trees and into the 4X style finale to the Hope Line, doubling or rolling depending on your skill level but having a damn good time either way. Backtracking We’re way ahead of ourselves now though, as the whole point of mentioning Hope in the first place was that their marketing star Rachael Walker is the one leading us through the freshly laid car park, past the farmhouse visitor centre at the start of the trail and straight into the ‘Swoopy’ section of Gisburn’s genuinely all-weather two-wheel thrill fest. Low sun flares down the singletrack, blowing up deep puddles like crystal fireworks as we pump and pedal along the flowing trails. Unfortunately overnight storms have hidden some tree-leg treachery and Rachael goes down hard on a big wet root, slamming her knee into her bar end. As much as she tries to ‘WTFU’, she can barely ride as it balloons up fast. So it’s back to base for an ice pack and time for Joe to take the lead round Lancashire’s finest manmade trails. Big fun buffet There’s a hell of a lot to go at here too. Even if you’ve seen shots of sections like Hully Gully, nothing can prepare you for a valley full of berms higher than your house. Rolling through the boulder markers at the top of the Bigfoot slab takes some commitment too, but don’t forget to take a few seconds to stop and drink in the stunning scenery of the surrounding fells and Stock reservoir, and potential views as far as the Lakes or back way into Yorkshire in summer. The full-on DH lines are currently closed as they’re rebuilt even bigger for summer, but the suspension and spine testing slabs of the upper loop, the quarry playground, the root fest of ‘Home Baked’ and the retro balance and balls test that is the North Shore section give a comprehensive skill and fitness workout that feels way longer than 18km. There’s even a thoughtfullyleft-natural sodden swamp and shonky bridge section just after Hully Gully to help you appreciate just how crap riding here would be if it weren’t for all the Forestry Commission investment and thousands of volunteer builder hours that have – literally – been sunk into this place. The ever-changing design of the trail makes it a great place to visit time and again too, as you learn what comes next and how to work your way through it, gaining speed and skill each time. No wonder it’s a popular coaching destination for top skills teachers like Pro Ride Guides and Great Rock. If the riding is good enough to keep us grinning even when sleet is rattling off our faces and feet are too numb to clip into pedals, then it’s certainly worth taking a turn down the Postman Pat roads to find it, wherever you live. We’ll certainly be hitting it a lot more frequently with the rest of the northern test crew in future, whether it’s for merciless kit testing on the relentless rocky sections or just blasting the berms and kickers for fun until we can’t take any more seriously techy fun."
5,What to Consider When Choosing a Tent,travel-leisure," Having a pleasant outdoor experience is what camping is all about and choosing the right tent for your needs in important.  Please consider some of the things that I have listed to help you make that decision. Tents come in various sizes and depending on the number of people you have camping it's a good idea to select one that is manufactured for 2 or more people. Most tent manufacturers size their home away from home with very little excess room.  There is barely enough room for sleeping bags and sleeping supplies. Plus, tents generally don't have much for ""other"" gear, such as clothes, blankets or shoes. Basic styles of tents: (A) An A-Frame is lightweight, freestanding, simple construction with good ventilation. These type tents usually sleep 2 or 3 people. (B) Dome tents have a tent pole frame and are constructed with lightweight fabric. They are quick and easy to set up and use guide ropes and stakes to stabilize the tent. The inside area of these tents are spacious. Dome tents are also use as truck bed tents.  These truck bed tents have good head room and are very convenient. (C) Tunnel tents have fabric stretched over a series of hoops creating a tunnel. These tents don’t have much height and are popular with hikers. They can withstand high winds and inclement weather if staked properly.  They are usually for 1 to 3 people. (D) Frame tents are generally the larger family tent that has multiple rooms for privacy provided by a divider. Screen rooms outside the sleeping area allow extra space for storing gear or extra sleeping area. This type is usually large and utilizes guide ropes to hold the tent during high winds. Because of their size, this type of tent can be bulky and heavy to transport but great for the whole family. Always consider what type of climate you'll be using your tent in. This will help you to determine which material to use for the tent you purchase. For example, if you're only going to use your tent during the warm weather, you'll want a lightweight tent. If you plan on camping in all weather conditions, you should consider a heavyweight tent that can handle hot weather or snow and freezing temperatures. There are also tents that are made for 3 seasons, and could quite possibly stand up to light snow. Having a tent with great ventilation is an important factor. Consider the number of mesh doors, windows and/or a mesh top for viewing the night sky. A cover, or rain fly may be needed due to inclement weather.  Some tents come with a rain fly around doors and/or windows to protect the inside from getting wet. If you think you’ll be camping in wet areas some tents have a tub structure on the flooring which is flooring that continues up the sides of the tent 5"" to 7"" for reinforcement  from the weather. If you're interested in purchasing a tent, do your research to see what amenities you might be interested in so you don't waste your money. Having a pleasant outdoor experience is what camping is all about."
6,Beware The Mighty Rough Skinned Newt,travel-leisure," On a winter's day take a walk in the woods along the north coast. You might accidentally step on a rough skinned newt (Taricha granulosa Skilton) as they are camouflaged by fallen leaves on the forest floor They are encountered most often in rainy or cloudy weather. The newt has a rounded snout and its color ranges from light brown to brownish black or olive on top. The entire underside of the newt is orange to yellow. The skin is rough except for the males during mating season. Their size is 6 to 9 cm snout to vent. Their overall length is 11 to 18 cm. They have smaller eyes than the California newt (Taricha torosa) and their irises are yellow. The rough skinned newt has V-shaped tooth patterns and dark eyelids. During breeding season the males have large swollen vent lobes and cornified toe pads. Their habitat range extends from Santa Cruz, California to Alaska and they are uncommon east of the Cascades. One colony can be found in ponds north of Moscow , Idaho. But it is believed they were introduced there. If you see one of the cute little buggers DON'T pick it up! Their defence mechanism is the toxin they produce from the skin glands. This toxin acts a warning to predators. Generally a human must ingest a newt to be affected by its toxin. But it has been reported that some persons have suffered skin irritation if touched. The eyes are especially vulnerable if touched after handling a newt without washing hands. A person died after eating a newt in 1979.. The toxin that is produced by the rough skinned newt is called tetrodotoxin (TTX). It is also found in puffer fish a a few other marine animals. The toxin has the effect of inducing paralysis by blocking the electrical signals needed for conducting nerve impulses. This has the effect of inducing death by asphyxiation. The only creature that has been able to resist the venom of the rough skinned newt is the common garter snake. The garter snake's resistance is made possible by its ability to gauge the amount of toxin in the the newt. They do this by partially swallowing the newt first. The garter snake is the only known animal that can survive eating a rough skinned newt. The newt has only a heightened resistance to their own toxin. They inject themselves with a bit of toxin each time they release some. Thus they have evolved a protection mechanism against their own toxin. This war between the garter snake and the rough skinned newt is interesting. The snake releases a chemical signature after it eats a newt. This is detected by a nearby newt and it triggers an avoidance response. This allows the newt to differentiate whether a snake is resistant or sensitive to the toxin. Folklore has it that some Indian tribes used ground up newt to poison their political enemies. Members of the genus Taricha from the Pacific Northwest are believed to be by far the most potent. The toxin exhibits a foul smell and will appear in a milky foam on the surface of the skin. The poisonous effect of the newt is only through the digestive tract, a break in the skin or via mucous membrane such as the eyes. That being said, it is safe to handle a newt if you wash your hands thoroughly afterwards."
7,Tips For Tent Camping In A Truck,travel-leisure," Sleep under the stars, on a mountain, near a stream or in the forest,—you can camp just about anywhere you take your truck bed tent. No matter what campground or open area you choose, the outdoors is right outside your tent door. Camping lets you spend the night in remote places and take a break from these luxurious comforts of home. And, as great as it feels to be outdoors, it's much harder to enjoy yourself without a good night's sleep. Here are a few tips to help you when you are camping with a truck bed tent. When choosing tent camping sites, decide which amenities are most important. Do you prefer primitive sites with minimal resources or are you looking for easy access to showers and restrooms? Either way take the time to choose wisely. Get the right bedding and consider what you plan to sleep on. In a truck bed tent you should have a good quality air mattress that fits the bed of your truck. Most people are used to sleeping indoors with total quiet, a mountain of pillows and a huge, fluffy mattress. To get things as close to your normal sleeping habits is a must when camping. You want to be rested for the next days activities. Custom-shaped for your truck, the AirBedz Lite Truck Bed Air Mattress features their patented wheel well cutouts.The optional wheel well inserts convert your air mattress for in-home use. Be sure to wear yourself out. Sleeping in a tent is a lot better after a full day of hiking, fishing, paddling or swimming  than if you just sit around the campfire eating hot dogs all day. Plan on crashing early, since there's less to do outdoors when the sun goes down, and go to bed exhausted. This will help with getting a good night's rest. Even while roughing it, keep yourself as fresh as possible. Nobody likes sleeping in a tent with someone who smells like the trails and has dirty feet. We all know how hard it is to keep a tent clean.  With a truck bed tent it is even harder.  My advice is to have screen tent with a rug set up with you truck tent to help keep you feet clean. Use a cloth to sponge bathe in a creek or use a water jug, or baby wipes. Remember you’ll sleep much better when you're more refreshed. Sleeping in a tent is the worst when you're half in a puddle of water or on unlevel ground. You don't have to risk it or bring a waterproof tarp when camping if you are camping with a truck bed tent. These tips are just a few ideas to help make you truck bed tent camping a great outdoor experience for you and your family."
8,"One Crazy Day On Coral Island In Pattaya, Thailand",travel-leisure," After our nail biting motor bike ride from the Centera Grand Resort to Bali Hai Pier, I was looking forward to the relaxing ferry boat ride to Coral Island. We had our bottle of vodka, some orange juice, & everything needed for a relaxing ride. As my friend Drew & I walked down the pier towards the ferry, a man approached & offered a round trip charted speed boat for 600 baht total ""$20.00"". There would be no relaxing time drinking our vodka on the ferry boat ride, we decided to take the chartered speed boat instead. As we were lead to the chartered speed boat, I noticed the boat definitely seen its better days! There were around 8 additional passengers also heading to Coral Island. We got seated in the front of the speed boat, & were handed some very old life jackets. I noticed some of the passengers giggling & talking with the captain, which I assumed was because of the hot pink colored life jackets handed to us. As we start our trip to the island, it quickly became apparent this was not going to be a relaxing ride. The ocean was choppy, the captain was going full throttle, & our seats were wooden with absolutely no padding. After getting some air off one of the waves & slamming my tailbone into the seat & hitting my forearm into the handrail, I quickly realized I needed to hold onto the bottle of vodka & be very careful it doesn't break. After 20 minutes of hauling over the rough seas & holding onto the bottle for dear life, I thought we reached our destination.We pull up to the side of very large boat & quickly started getting slammed. The captain was having issues securing the lines, which was causing the two boats to slam against each other. After a few tense moments, the captain was able to secure the lines. He quickly rushed most of the other passengers dangerously off the back of the boat onto the larger boat. Assuming this was our destination, we walked towards the back of our boat to climb aboard the larger boat. We approached with the last two remaining passengers, but the captain started shouting & waving everyone back & looked angry. Without giving an explanation the captain gunned the engines towards the ocean. I only grew concerned when I glanced over towards the local Thai ladies & noticed they were concerned by their facial expressions. As we head further into the ocean, I glance over at Drew & attempt small talk. Drew was growing more concerned by the minute & basically ignored my attempt at small talk. As I grow more concerned, the boat suddenly banks left & hundreds of boats & other travelers come into view. We were safe, not kidnapped, & finally about to open the bottle. Finally The Bottle & Relaxation! Upon exiting the speed boat & walking towards the beach, we were greeted by a women who lead us to some lawn chairs. The lawn chairs were placed under large tents along the entire path of the beach. The cost per lawn chair is 100 Baht each ""$3.00"" & this came with one small table. There were food stalls & souvenir shops including a variety of shops offering different activities. At this moment our only concern was getting some more alcohol into our system. We sat down & had some shots, bought some BBQ chicken, & reluctantly agreed to my first & last manicure. I'm not a big fan of people touching my feet & the lady accidentally clipping a chuck of my small toe with the clippers did not help the situation. Besides getting a chuck of my small tow clipped off, which Drew found humorous, Coral Island was a great escape from the craziness of Pattaya. We relaxed, ate some food, went swimming, & rode some motor bikes around the island. When the allotted time came & went for our charted speed boat to arrive, we began to wonder if we were left behind on the island. After one hour passed from our departure time & not seeing the other two passengers, I decided to relax on a lawn chair & watch Drew squirm on the beach. It was around 90 minutes passed our departure time when the chartered speed boat finally arrived. A Perfect Crash To Finish The Perfect Day! After a fun & relaxing day at Coral Island, we were heading back to the craziness of Pattaya. We arrived in Bali Hai Pier & exited the speed boat with only 200 baht between the both of us. We were half-way to our hotel & each 20 baht short for individual motorbike taxis. We decided to put our money together & take one motorbike for 200 baht. Based on the days events, I should have known this would not end smoothly, but sometimes you need to learn things the hard way."
9,Temples Of Chiang Mai Thailand,travel-leisure," Chiang Mai offers great memories, friendly locals, beautiful scenery, and 300 awe-inspiring temples. If you don't have time or the energy to visit all 300 temples, there are definitely some must see temples, which should be on your list. Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Chiang Man, & Wat Phan Tao are beautiful temples located within the city walls & all three temples can easily be visited in one day. Another awe-inspiring temple & most visited is the Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, but this temple requires a journey up a mountain road & 309 step walk to reach the top of the temple. The Temple Of Wat Chedi Luang Wat Chedi Luang is definitely not flashy, shiny, or gold plated, but it's definitely are-inspiring. Built in 1441, Wat Chedi Luang stands as one of the largest ancient structures in Chiang Mai. The temple was a little bit taller until ether an earthquake or cannon fire during the recapture of Chiang Mai from the Burmese in 1775 destroyed the top of the chedi. The temple has 4 sides, each with a staircase guarded by mythical Naga creatures. Midway up the stairs located on one section of the temple, there are beautifully sculpted stoned elephants stand guard overlooking the grounds. Besides the towering & awe-inspiring Chedi, the temple grounds contain two viharns, which are structures used for ceremonies & worship. The first viharn, which is used as an assembly hall is a large, beautiful building with a three tiered roof, & gold plated on the front. Inside the building stands a large Buddha, which dates back to the time of when the temple was constructed. The second viharn is much smaller, but equally impressive & stunning. The entrance leading into the viharn is elegantly decorated with intricate wood carvings & guarded by large Nagas, which are mythical snake like creatures. A Much Needed Break After The Craziness Of Bangkok & Pattaya After spending 10 days between Bangkok & Pattaya, I needed to slow down & take a break. The much needed slow down started with the 14 hour train ride from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, which I highly suggest. Upon arriving in Chiang Mai, I instantly noticed the city was much greener, there were zero skyscrapers, & everything was much more low key. My stay in Chiang Mai was only three days, but I made sure one of those days was dedicated to visiting some of Chiang Mai's awe-inspiring temples. The first day I hired a tuk tuk & was taken to Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Chiang Man, & Wat Phan Tao. Wat Chedi Luang & Wat Phan Tao are adjacent, which provides two stunning temples within a short walk of each other. All three temples should definitely be on your list! Over the course of three days, I visited more than 10 temples. A short walk from my hotel & it felt like there was a temple on every corner. After the craziness of Bangkok & Pattaya, the low key environment of Chiang Mai & its temples, definitely provided a much needed break. The temples of Chiang Mai are definitely worth a visit & something everyone should see if there visiting Thailand."
10,"Ream National Park - Sihanoukville, Cambodia",travel-leisure," Ream National Park is one of 7 National parks in Cambodia & was established in 1993. The park has very little development, offering guests a truly relaxing & beautiful time. The park has a combination of rivers, forests, mangroves, estuaries, beaches, coral reefs, wildlife, and marine life. The entrance into Ream Park is $0.25 - $0.50 cents, but there are other areas of the park that charge additional fees. If wanting to visit Prince Island, the price was $5.00 as of March 2017. There is currently two guest houses, which operate inside & right outside the park. There are a few places to grab a bite to eat or pick up snacks near the airport & naval base. There is only one resort inside the park, which offers a restaurant & bar, but future resorts are being developed. Limited snacks & drinks can be purchased from various beach shacks within the park. There are park rangers, which provide tours & other activities for various fees. Back Roads To Ream Feeling the itch to explore, I had to scratch it & decided on Ream National Park. With little experience riding motorbikes, this would definitely be the longest solo ride. After some quick research on Google Maps, I realized I could take back roads the entire way to Ream!! Even back home in the U.S., I would always take back roads & enjoy the scenic route. The day before the planned excursion, I rented the motorbike, purchased some cool looking sun glasses, & didn't consume too much alcohol. I wanted to get an early start, didn't want a hangover, & didn't want to be tired. The next day, I woke up at 5:00AM & was riding to Ream National Park around 5:30AM. It was a nice morning, didn't feel like the normal oven like temperatures, & barely anyone was on the road. Otres Beach was the furthest I've rode solo, & upon passing Otres, that itch started to be scratched! After passing a small beach town outside Otres, I was greeted by some local cows & knew it was going to be a good ride. After leaving the beach town, & riding another 5 minutes, the paved road turned into a red dirt road. The ride was great, the scenery was beautiful, & the waving locals was nice. Riding into the hills, passing through small towns, & riding along the beach was great! Seeing the sun rise over Ream National Park was epic! My mind wondering, my hand waving, & not having a care in the world, I passed one of my exits. I was hoping to take back roads the entire way to Ream Park, but wasn't paying attention & missed one of the side roads. I could have turned around, but decided to continue with my journey & ride on dreaded highway 4! Having rode most of the way using back roads to Ream Park, this highway portion was very short. I only had to worry about getting crushed by a bus for 5 minutes, before seeing the exit for Ream National Park. Ream National Park The entrance into Ream does not seem like much, but the further you ride the more green you start to see. After entering the park, it became clear I should have done some research because I had no clue where to go inside the park. I followed the gravel road, which eventually led me to a choice ""Straight Or Right"". I decided to turn right, which led me to another gate & $5 fee. I later found out this was a separate portion of the park, which led to Prince Island. Make sure to keep the receipt or you won't be able to enter Prince Island. Like I wrote earlier, it probably would have been wise to do some research. Luckily, I stumbled upon the gate to Prince Island & decided to ride down. There was another gate, but I did not see anyone & rode under it. After slightly lowering my head to ride under the gate, I was yelled at & told to stop. This man crept out from the bushed & began asking for paper. I had no clue what the man was referring too & simply handed over the receipt out of desperation. With a grin, nod, & point towards the beach, the man at the gate walked into the bushes, laid down into his hammock, & kept my receipt. Guess that was my admission into Prince Island. Prince Island & Road To Nowhere Having found this location accidentally, & not knowing it was even here, I was very surprised. The beach was clean, the views were beautiful, & the Island was a wonderful surprise. If wanting a coconut or snacks, there was a small food stall, which offered coconuts, drinks, & snacks. There was areas to sit, & security parking for your bike. Before embarking to the island, I relaxed on a bunch, tried my first coconut, & took in the views. The pier was pretty long in length, circled the entire island, & provided a large sitting area. If wanting to take a small risk, visitors can walk out to a ledge above the crashing waves. This was definitely nice, & totally worth $5. The views from the island are breath taking, & if you arrive early in the morning, you will have the island to yourself. I highly suggest checking out Prince Island if visiting Ream National Park. When it was time to leave, I wanted to find the route, which I originally wanted to take the entire way to Ream National Park. Taking this route would completely remove the highway portion & much more scenic. I rode along the airport & found the road, which should have been the road. After riding down the dirt road for a small distance, I was stopped by water & one angry construction worker. Hot, sweating, gas running low, & pretty confident my way was blocked, I should have given up & took the highway. Not one for easy defeat, I headed further down the main road & found one last turn off. I turned right, followed the beach, & encountered one old looking bridge. I was not 100% certain the bridge would support the bike, but before thinking too much, I continued forward & thought positively. Upon reaching the other side of the bridge, I let out a sigh of relief & continued down the dirt road. As the road turned muddy, then turned into a walking path, & jungle surrounded me, I pushed forward & questioned my decision making skills. What I knew deep down all along, this would not be my road home. I was a stones throw away from my correct path, but blocked by a small waterway. I let out a sigh, took a piss, cursed myself, & headed home."

14,Helpful Fuel Saving Tips,travel-leisure," Be it one of those economical sailboats or luxury yachts that you own, the number one thing that you should learn as a sailor is how to save on fuel. Boat maintenance by itself may already be too much of an expense, so you don’t want to spend any more than is necessary on fuelling one of your many sea outings. So how exactly can this be done? Check out this list of some helpful fuel saving tips that you can use: • Get rid of all the extras weighing down your boat. Similar to cars, an extra-heavy boat will require more fuel to run. Although it pays to be prepared in case of emergencies or extended cruises, there’s also such a thing as carrying too much unwanted items on board. Inspect all the storage spaces on your boat. Get rid of those heavy books about cruising, keep your stock canned goods to a minimum, and make sure that you only have the recommended one tackle box, spare parts, ropes, and tools. Don’t weigh the boat down with sports equipment, cookware, fancy deck chairs or heavy fishing gear if you know that you won’t need them. • Check your boat’s bottom! Newbie owners of luxury motor yachts may not be aware that even just one short sea outing may cause an accumulation of marine gunk at the bottom of the boat. Weeds, barnacles, scum, and similar elements from the ocean add weight and affects fuel efficiency. After cleaning the bottom of the boat, you may want to apply a layer of anti-fouling paint on the hull to prevent plant growth. • Be aware of the amount of fuel your boat is burning. Calculating the fuel consumption for cars is pretty straightforward. But when it comes to boats, there are a few more elements factored in, including the more unpredictable sea conditions. Fuel consumption in boats is usually measured in gallons per hour – while taking in other factors like drag, wide-open throttle, and cruising speed. When you’re aware of the factors affecting the fuel consumption of your boat, you will better learn how to save up on gas. • Fuel up early in the day. Fill up the tank early in the day when the ground is still cold, and fuel is denser, so that you can get the best value for your money. Lastly, regular engine tune-ups, cruising at a leisurely speed, travelling to closer destinations, running with the wind, and avoiding high-rolling seas are the other ways for you to save on boat fuel."
15,Keeping Children Safe on Trampolines,travel-leisure," Trampolines are a type of equipment that provides many memories for children. Parents of children have the responsibility of making sure those memories are created in a safe and enjoyable way. Trampolines have come a long way since their initial creation. Today, there are a variety of accessories that enhance a trampoline’s entertaining experience and safety. The primary appeal of jumping on a trampoline is that it allows its users to jump higher than normally possible. With one accessory, jumping high has a new purpose and becomes even more enjoyable. Specially designed basketball hoops attach to the outer frame of trampolines. Having the hoops attached to the trampoline gives jumpers the opportunity to slam dunk basketballs like a pro. If basketball isn’t your child’s thing, a trampoline tent might be the accessory that adds to their fun. Trampoline tents are enclosures that give your kids a fun and exciting place to hang out and relax. The tents can keep kids out of the sun during hot summer days or provide the perfect place for an outdoor sleepover. Every parent wants their child to have fun, but they also want them to stay safe. The nature of trampolines often leads to painful experiences for children whether it’s a bump on the head or a broken bone. Thankfully, there are numerous accessories that make trampolines a safer place for the kids to play. Nets that encompass trampolines keep young children from falling off. Older and bigger children aren’t always completely safe even with a net. It’s entirely possible for older kids to tear through a net while following; however, nets reduce chances of injury by half. Spring pads are another add-on that makes trampolines safer. Typically made of foam, pads cover the springs and the gaps in between thereby making it difficult for a child to fall between the springs. A final piece of safety equipment is a trampoline ladder. Though seemingly plain and simple, ladders provide a safe means for kids to get on and off of trampolines. Regardless of the accessories a trampoline may or may not have, it needs to be properly maintained. It’s important to frequently check trampoline parts for wear and tear and replace and damaged or broken parts. When properly used and cared for, trampolines are safe and enjoyable. Safety and entertainment accessories enhance the experience of any trampoline allowing for the creation of plenty of childhood memories."

20,"48 hours in Yerevan, Armenia",travel-leisure," Yerevan can be perplexing. Its neoclassical squares conjure Vienna, while its wide boulevards brim with Parisian élan. There’s no escaping the sprawl of brutal high-rises that shoulder its Soviet past, yet recent investment has embalmed the city’s rougher edges with glinting streets, a cable car and arts’ centre, all begging for exploration. Yerevan is known as the Pink City, the volcanic rock (tuff) iconic of its state buildings forming a fondant panorama around the city’s heart. Meanwhile the verdant hills which cup the 13th capital of Armenia provide a setting which masks its many battle scars. Shadowed by the fabled Mount Ararat, Armenia has long been a battleground between Muslim and Christian rule, leading to the death of more than a million Armenians. By 1936 it was under Soviet rule, and by 1991, its independence brought with it economic collapse. Yerevan is in a new dawn: bolstered by its foray into technology and help from wealthy expats, the pride, passion and persistence of its people runs through the veins of the city. A weekend in this manageable and safe city is easy alone or with company, and its big-hearted locals will leave you feeling the great hug of Yerevan long after you’ve left. Day one Morning Start out in Republic Square. When architect Alexander Tamanyan’s plans to create the perfect city came to fruition in the 1920s, ancient Yerevan was razed, making way for this jewel of his architectural megalomania. Though not wholly welcomed at the time, this transformation led to a pleasingly compact city centre. Afternoon Linking Republic Square to Freedom Square is Northern Ave, home to the rotund Yerevan Opera Theatre. The Tamanyan-designed street didn’t open until 2007, following a cash injection from a wealthy expat. Lined with honey-hued buildings, luxury brands and manicured topiary, it aims to welcome the well-heeled traveller to Yerevan. Late afternoon If you’re after a shot of soorj (coffee), then the Cascade area has plenty of cafes with kudos. In warmer months it hosts outdoor concerts and, should you fancy a little alfresco dancing, every last Friday of the month, locals help left-footed tourists giggle their way through the traditional Karin folk dance. Evening Skip the ubiquitous Irish bars and raucous Russian clubs in favour of the more sedate vibe of Yerevan’s first smoke-free nightclub, Eco Pub on Spendiaryan St. Alternatively, a short walk from the Opera Theatre is The Club, a subterranean restaurant, bar and bookshop with giant cloud-like cushions to melt into. Day two Morning An early morning amble among Yerevan’s parks dotted with cherry and apricot trees should help clear the head before hitting the busy intersection of Mashtots Ave and Sarmen St. Dive into the innocuous looking bookshops and you’ll find intricately carved shelves overlooked by gilded ceilings. A few minutes' walk from here, tucked amidst mid-rise houses and wall murals, is the beautifully tiled façade of the 18th-century Blue Mosque – Armenia’s only active mosque. Its graceful white-washed interior and Islamic garden offer a calming antidote to the bustling city beyond. Afternoon To access anything in the upper hills of Yerevan, you’ll need transport. The Wings of Tatev cable car whizzes you across the impressive Hrazdan Gorge to the verdant hills of the 9th-century Tatev Monastery, perched on a large basalt plateau. The best way to reach it is by taxi – they’re cheap at around 600 drams, though some visitors report experiencing a nerve-shredding journey. For the uphill bit at least, the older Ladas struggle to move; on the way down though, gravity is no friend. A final farewell For a last soiree in the city, a meander in and out of Yerevan's cafes, wine bars and restaurants won’t disappoint. While the local food is wonderful, Armenia's taste for international cuisine is burgeoning, from Mexican to sushi. The city now also has its first microbrewery. Based on Aram St, Dargett does a mean apricot beer, and makes a good place for a final farewell. APRICOT"

5,"Todos Santos, Guatemala",travel-leisure," Todos Santos, Guatemala Todos Santos is a small village hidden high in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. Guatemala is a mountainous country with no shortage of dramatic mountain ranges. The Cuchumatanes, however, are in a league of their own; stretching up to 12,500 feet, they are the highest non-volcanic mountain range in Central America and a sight to behold. The Cuchumatanes rise from skirts of humid jungle that gives way to pine forest as they climb upward; near the top, the trees thin into sweeping grasslands, shrouded in cloud as often as not. There, in a steep valley parceled into fields for subsistence farming, is the Mam community of Todos Santos. The men wear traditional traje, or Mayan costume; the most striking feature is their red and white striped trousers. If a man is married, he wears a pair of shorts over his trousers. Married and unmarried men alike also sport hats, traditional shirts, and colorfully embroidered jackets. Todos Santos is quiet for most of the year – it is as quaint as it is isolated, a Mayan community that forges on without the money and attention that come from being a tourist attraction. At least once a year, however, Todos Santos plays host to a do-not-miss event. It’s the villages feria, or annual festival, which takes the form of a drunken horse race on the day of the dead. The story goes like this: when Guatemala was conquered by the Spanish, the Mam villagers of Todos Santos were introduced to horses. They quickly became adept at riding, and were revered for their skills across New Spain. The Spanish disapproved, however, and forbid the men of Todos Santos to ride. So, in protest, the villagers of Todos Santos established a horse race during their feria that is still happening some centuries later. Although the Mam population of Todos Santos is nominally Catholic, the version of Catholicism that they practice is a syncretic one with considerable holdovers and infusions from traditional Mayan religious systems. Some still believe that the fruits of their labor – or, more accurately, the corns and vegetables of their labor – are at the mercy of not just the weather but the Mayan deities and Catholic saints who might intercede on their behalf. In keeping with that belief, the feria, which falls near the end of Guatemala’s wet season, is meant to please those spirits above. A couple days of hard drinking precede it; by the time the sun has risen on November 1st, many of the men are very drunk, stumbling through the dusty streets of the town. Tourists and foreigners pour in to watch them festoon themselves in colored ribbons, climb atop their horses, and ride as fast as they can back and forth down a short track of lose dirt. It isn’t a race, per say; sometimes a pack of horses will take off, and sometimes only one, and sometimes a horse without a rider. There are no officials with pop-guns or timed starts, and there’s not much concern for who finishes first or last. The main business is to showcase the men, stone drunk, riding and whooping without their hands on the reins. Falls are common and ugly – sometimes, injuries are serious. Deaths are not unheard of – they’re believed to bring rain in the rainy season to come. The mayor of Todos Santos banned the sale of alcohol in 2008 to try and curb the festivities. So far, no dice. In 2016, the festival was in full form, with many tiendas openly selling cervezas to the throngs who had come out to see the race. If you’re in Guatemala on All Saint’s Day in the future. you owe it to yourself to come out and see the madness yourself."
6,A Perfect Day In Prague,travel-leisure," With castles, cathedrals, palaces, gardens, and cobbled lanes aplenty, it’s difficult not to have a good day in Prague. However, many visitors never leave the well-trodden route running from Wenceslas Square, through Old Town Square, across the Charles Bridge, and up the hill to Prague Castle. To locals, Prague is so much more. Here’s one perfect day that helps keep you clear of crowds and selfie sticks. Rise and Shine Perched high on a bluff over the Vltava River, the seventeenth-century Vyšehrad Fortress is one of the Czech nation’s spiritual homes: Its cemetery is the final resting place for some of the country’s most beloved figures, including composers Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, and Alphonse Mucha. Seen from atop the fortress walls, the sunrise reflects beautifully off the river as it burns through the mist and is worth waking early for. Stretching along the river from Vyšehrad to Šítkov Water Tower, the one-mile pedestrian-only Náplavka riverbank thrives in early evening, when locals come down to unwind and sip cold suds. In the morning, it’s almost all yours, with the city’s famous skyline rising higher on the horizon with each step. Cross Legií Bridge to the west bank for coffee and breakfast on the outdoor patio of Café Bella Vida. Prague’s fairytale-like Wallenstein Gardens hide behind a tiny door off sidewalk on the way to Malostranská Metro station. Created in the 1620s along with the adjacent palace, this well-manicured baroque garden merits exploration with a frescoed pavilion, an artificial cave with stalactites, a koi pond, a pair of albino peacocks, and couples stealing kisses among the hedges. Midday The National Gallery of Prague has branches throughout the city, but its largest is north of the river bend in the Holešovice neighborhood, popular with expats and hipsters. The fairly unattractive building from 1928 was the first example of Functionalist architecture in Prague, but its art collection – including works by Picasso, Renoir, van Gogh, and Klimt – never fails to impress. West of Holešovice along the river, hilltop Letná Park not only provides panoramic views of Prague, but also historical significance: During 1989’s Velvet Revolution, nearly a million people came here to protest the communist regime. Today, Letná remains tranquil under the spread of leafy trees and is home to a popular beer garden. Happily, in Prague, it’s never too early to raise a mug. Continue on from the park to the Nový Svět neighborhood, where the old city walls still run along the backside of the castle district and cannonballs from the eighteenth-century Prussian siege protrude from buildings. Ring the doorbell of the U Raka Café and step into its gorgeous, tiered garden for perhaps the best apple strudel in town. Evening through Late Night The retro-furnished Pilsner Urquell bar and restaurant Kolkovna Olympia may open its doors to a major tourist artery, but its traditional meaty menu features some of the best versions of Czech classics in town, particularly its much-loved roast pork knee with horseradish, mustard, and sauerkraut. These former royal vineyards of Riegrovy Sady now make up the main playground of the trendy Vinohrady and Žižkov neighborhoods, east of the main train station. Come evening, half the neighborhood can be found strolling the paths, picnicking on the grass, tossing Frisbees to dogs and children, and relaxing at one of two great beer gardens. The western slope is the best spot in Prague to watch the sun go down behind the castle. Krymská Street in Vršovice has become Prague’s epicenter for all things cool, with cafés, clubs, bars, and boutiques spilling down the cobbled hill. By nightfall, particularly on weekends, many of the revelers take their drinks outside, creating an unofficial block party."
7,Six Easy Ways To Travel Sustainably,travel-leisure," As one of the largest travel networks in the world, Virtuoso is guided by a philosophy of enriching lives through human connection, and the power of travel and tourism as a force for good. We believe that travel is a powerful catalyst to educate and protect natural and cultural heritage for future generations. The United Nations has declared 2017 the Year of Sustainable Tourism, which inspired Virtuoso CEO Matthew Upchurch and his family to rethink their vacation strategy. ""We decided to focus our family vacations around destinations, hotels, and tour companies known for enlightened environmental practices and cultural preservation,"" says Upchurch. Read more about the Upchurch family’s first trip to The Brando resort. Costas Christ, an award-winning travel writer and pioneer of sustainable travel practices, serves as Virtuoso’s director of sustainability. Here, he shares six easy tips to travel sustainably – or to adopt at home. Say ""No"" to Plastic Water Bottles ""Better yet, bring a reusable water flask from home or ask your tour operator or hotel for local recyclable purified water. Your request will send a message that you care about stopping plastic waste that is clogging up landfills and polluting our seas, spurring more travel companies to also say no to plastic. Eat Sustainably Sourced Seafood At a time when worldwide fisheries are in decline, opt for sustainably-sourced seafood using the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch List phone app. I also say no to shrimp: most of it comes from aquaculture ponds bulldozed out of tropical mangrove forests and dosed with chemicals. And when it comes to other culinary delights of travel, always go local and, when possible, also organic. The less chemicals and food miles involved to get to your plate, the more nutritious and the less fossil fuels involved. Chose a Hotel Committed to Sustainability I always give priority to hotels that include their sustainability commitment on their website. Sure, some might be ""greenwashing"" –  talking without doing –  but most will provide a good idea of what a hotel or outfitter is doing to go green, and its puts them on record for you to also ask about those practices in person on your trip. Bring a Reusable Shopping Bag Carry an easy-to-fold reusable shopping bag on trips, and use it. It is one of the easiest and most helpful things for the environment that we can do when we travel to avoid contributing to plastic bag pollution, now a major cause of concern in many parts of the world. And locals will welcome it, too. I was buying fruit at a roadside stand in Belize last month, and the vendor thanked me for bringing my own bag. ""Betta no Litta,"" she said to me in Creole (""Better no Litter""). Eco-Friendly Travel Take the train, bike, and walk where you can. It is more environmentally-friendly and will also help you to embrace the Slow Travel movement – all about experiencing more than just seeing a place. When you do need to fly, use a reliable carbon offset provider like MyClimate, to offset your air travel, and opt for non-stop flights vs. connections – fewer flights, less emissions. Never Buy Wildlife Products Ever. Period. From pretty shells in Vietnam to fur hats in Kaszakhstan to sea turtle bracelets in Maldives – no matter where you are, the odds are overwhelming that it comes from killing wild animals. Just say no. Your response will send a powerful message that travelers do not support the wildlife trade."" Next week, we’ll post Costas’ tips on cultural preservation and helping local communities – both key pillars in sustainable tourism."
8,Favorite Ideas For Healthy Eating On The Road,travel-leisure," What products to take with you while traveling on the road so that your travel will be not only informative, but also tasty and healthy? Food on the road has to be convenient: when we say that we mean that it should be convenient to eat, convenient to transport and, of course, convenient to store. Therefore, first of all, we will define the main qualities of road products. Products shouldn’t be bulky and too heavy. Otherwise, while on a road you will be connected not with pleasant impressions of a travel, but with the cares that nothing from products has fallen anywhere and has soiled something of your stuff. Food shouldn’t be perishable Perfect meal on the road has to be of such quality that it would be possible to store it long time without refrigerator. Food shouldn’t thaw in the sun. Plus, it has to be simple in cooking, with no additional preparation required. Try to prepare everything in advance. Principle of two ""no"" ""No"" – to pungent smells, ""no"" – to garbage. You shouldn’t stock up to the road with food with strong smells even if you like them a lot. Approximately in two hours all smells will start irritating you. Besides, you shouldn’t also forget about fellow travelers. Food that leaves a lot of crumbs and additional packing, is not the most successful option while traveling on the road, especially if you travel by car. It seems that there is no food which would meet all these requirements. But this is not like this. Almost all products can be taken on the road, all you need to need to know is how they should be preparing to take on the road. Vegetables and fruits Vegetables is an ideal option not only for a main course to the road, but also for having a snack. The cut carrots, apples, sweet pepper straws are very useful and serve as a perfect alternative to all snacks in the form of chips, sunflower seeds and crackers. It is better not to take fruit entirely because they very heavy – it’s better to cut them up and take with you as an afternoon snack. It diversifies your road diet. It is better to cut various vegetable and salads and put them into tight containers. To make a road crude vegetables lunch tastier, prepare some simple sauces which will be very convenient for taking with you in small plastic sauce boats. Vegetables are good not only in the form of salads – vegetable fritters and zucchini, pumpkin, carrots and potatoes cutlets are perfect when even not warmed. Sandwiches Sandwiches are, perhaps, the most popular meals on the road. It is possible to prepare them using vegetables, or meat, fish and , of course, cheeses. Sauces, seasonings, any greens –you can add anything according to your imagination. It is better to use brown bread, with bran – it less high-calorie also not so strongly differs in taste from white, than, say, rye. For those who are who categorically against high-calorie bread, we recommend thin flat cakes (for example, a lavash) which you can use for wrapping stuffing. Beaters by the way very convenient – they are not less nourishing, than the same sandwiches, but they are much more commode in consumption."
9,Air Charter Service for Business,travel-leisure," When flying for business, one thing should always be on top of the priority list, the business. Thanks to the emerging technology, charter methods, and accessibility, flying in quality, luxury, and great performance has become possible. Many now offer air charter services exclusive for business. Private jet charter provides unique advantages that help businesses of all sizes achieve their goal. Below are just some of the biggest benefits of private jet travel. ●	Valuable time saved One of the biggest benefits of flying in private jet charter is the time saved both for the customer and the 3rd party involved. For many entrepreneurs and high-level executives, time is an important factor. So, instead of waiting for long hours in a queue or wasting your time on re-routing or on a missed or delayed flight, commit your time to things that brings you much benefit. This alone validates the use of private jet charter. ●	Increased productivity Aside from the time saved, chartering a private jet also opens a greater window of productivity for you and your team before and after the travel. The entire aircraft is all yours.

Multiple days of travel through commercial flights can be reduced to a single day. But of course, this will all depend on your flight preferences. ●	Flexible schedule Commercial flights require passengers to arrive early, basically few hours before their flight to deal with checking in and long security lines, while private air charter allows customers to arrive immediately before takeoff. ●	Global coverage Taking a private air charter allows you to fly wherever you want including exquisite locations.

10,How to enjoy your Backyard,travel-leisure," If you are one of the lucky people in life that is blessed with having a backyard outside your home, then enjoy it. Use your back yard, make it into a favorite place for you, your family and your friends to spend time. After all, not everyone has the privilege of having a great backyard to spend time in. If you have ever lived in an apartment or an inner city than you know how great it is to have even a little bit of property to call your own. You know how fun it can be to have space to play or relax or garden. You know that a backyard can be one of the greatest places on earth. I have grown to love my backyard so much because it holds so much potential for me and my family. It is a small plot of the earth just to be used by me and the ones I love. Because I know that not many people in the world have a space to call their own, I have really learned to make the most of the backyard I have. For the first few years our family had a backyard we did little with it other than mow the grass. That all changed, however, after a family meeting we held one Saturday afternoon. I guess it was my husband's idea, I cannot really remember, but I just know that we decided as a family to put our backyard into good use. We brainstormed ideas about the different ways that we could transform our backyard into a place that we all enjoyed spending time in. Our brainstorming session led to many changes in our backyard. My husband and I had always wanted to garden, so we set aside part of the backyard and began making preparations for having a vegetable garden. It was a thrill for us to actually see one of dreams come true right on our own property. We read up on gardening and asked for tips from our gardening friends. Within two seasons we had a small but successful vegetable garden that was one of the proudest spots in our backyard. Our children requested a fire pit so that we could enjoy bonfires and making smores on cool summer nights. We did a little research and installed a great fire pit on one side of our backyard. It became a gathering place for many of our friends and family members throughout the spring, summer and even fall months. Many special conversations were had around that fire pit and it too became one of the best parts of our backyard. Regardless of the state of your backyard now, take some time to brainstorm with your own family and make your backyard a great place for years to come."
11,The Nomad Lifestyle Picking your residency wisely,travel-leisure," For as many years as I can remember, I dreamed of living a Nomad lifestyle.  I cherished the 3-day holiday weekends and 2-week vacations so I could pack up the essentials and head out to the great unknown.  As time went by, money started getting tight, so my wife and I took on extra jobs—her working part-time from our home as a graphic designer, and me as a private marketing and sales consultant. Life was good, but I still wasn’t satisfied. Then one night my wife and I sat down on the couch and started to talk about our life.  That’s when it hit us both—we were existing but not really living.  It was and still is all about the escape.  So five years ago I quit my full-time job, sold our house, bought a slightly used RV and sold off most of our furniture and belongings.  We packed our precious items into a small temperature-controlled storage unit and headed off into the great unknown. To be safe, we decided to keep our part-time businesses just to keep a consistent money stream. The beauty of owning our own businesses is that we could operate from virtually anywhere we could get Wi-Fi connection or cell phone service, even outside the USA.  We also had to decide where we would establish our new residence as Nomads.  We wanted to go to a state that offered the best tax benefits as well as being RV friendly.  Since we planned to be on the road most of the time and not in the state, the choice became very obvious—South Dakota. Besides no State income tax, South Dakota has no personal property taxes, no state inheritance tax, no vehicle inspections. Unlike many other states, a person does NOT need a South Dakota driver’s license to obtain South Dakota license plates.  This can be done long distance. Now that we did our homework on the State to set up our Nomad residence, we needed to decide—with whom?  We talked with dozens of couples, and most of the response was positive and helpful.  It seemed that a majority kept saying the same thing: ""It’s very easy and affordable, and we should start off with the membership with Americas Mailbox."" Americas Mailbox provides its clients many benefits outside of what a normal mail forwarding company would offer, including mail scanning and forwarding client’s mail anywhere they travel, ensuring them a safe and reliable location to receive, store, and ship mail as requested.  In addition, Americas Mailbox saves its members literally tens of thousands of dollars in taxes and other fees from their current states. Don and Barb were determined to completely meet the needs of consumers at a fair price. When you set up an account with Americas Mailbox, it gives you the opportunity to establish residency in South Dakota. It doesn't matter if you own a house or a business there, unlike many other mail forwarding companies in other states.  It is also very easy to acquire a drivers license. For members that wish to register their vehicles in South Dakota, unlike many other states, a person does NOT need a South Dakota driver's license prior to obtaining license plates. Since South Dakota doesn't require any inspections or Proof of Insurance, the staff at Americas Mailbox can obtain license plates for its members remotely and then send them anywhere instructed. There are many more benefits to choosing Americas Mailbox, and you can learn more by visiting them online at www.americasmailbox.com or give them a call on (605) 718-1234.  They will be more than happy to assist you. One thing is certain, the Nomad craze is indeed growing, and there is no sign that it is slowing down. It will continue for years, as people realize that the Nomadic lifestyle is one that allows people with digital or telecommuting skills to live affordably, save money in taxes and fees, see the world at their leisure and, in short, enjoy their life to the fullest."
12,"Shore Excursions in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua",travel-leisure," Tourism in Nicaragua is on the up. Every year, more and more people are visiting this beautiful country. Nicaragua has stepped out of the Cold War shadow and is fast becoming the hottest destinations in Latin America. It’s not hard to see why; Nicaragua is blessed with amazing natural landscapes. There are pristine beaches, huge lakes, and stunning volcanoes (both active and dormant). There is also an abundance of flora & fauna, wildlife, and culture. Another selling point is its relative lack of development. Events in recent history have meant that Nicaragua has not been Westernised in the way that Costa Rica, it’s neighbour to the South, has. Instead, Nicaragua has held on to it’s unique charm (and low prices). However, things are changing fast. People are beginning to recognise the opportunities that Nicaragua offers, and investments are being made across the country. This is most notable in San Juan del Sur, where a new $3 million cruise port was opened last year. This new port makes Nicaragua more accessible than ever. In the 2017/18 cruise season, 50% more ships will visit San Juan than in the previous year, bringing tens of thousands more visitors. So what activities are available to these visitors when they arrive? Let’s take a look… Granada Located 90 minutes from San Juan del Sur, the charming, colonial city of Granada is the oldest European city in the Americas. Founded by the Spanish in 1524, it is known as La Gran Sultana due to is Moorish and Andalusian architecture. Visitors to Granada can enjoy a tour around its historical centre, either on foot or in a horse-drawn carriage. Highlights of the tour include the stunning cathedral and the convent of San Francisco. From Granada it is also possible to take a boat tour around the isletas of Lake Nicaragua, the largest lake in Central America. The isletas are 365 small islands which were created by an eruption of the Mombacho volcano thousands of years ago. Today they are home to many species, including Capuchin monkeys who are always keen to say hello to their visitors. Masaya The small town of Masaya has two big attractions — it’s awesome volcano, and the best artisanal market in Nicaragua. The Spanish conquistadors referred to the Masaya volcano as ""the Gates of Hell"", and it’s easy to see why. The bubbling lava must have been a terrifying sight back then. It’s no surprise that they erected a huge cross and had a priest bless the crater! The market isn’t quite as scary. Instead it offers tourists a place to admire Nicaraguan handicrafts and leather goods, and to pick up souvenirs of their trip. San Juan del Sur For those who are looking for a more relaxed day, there is absolutely nothing wrong with staying close to the ship and spending the day in San Juan del Sur. Often overlooked by the official ship tours, San Juan has a lot to offer. There are beach side restaurants where you can enjoy freshly caught fish, high-quality spas where you can get a relaxing massage, and a market where you can find Nicaraguan produce like coffee, cigars & rum. If you want to be a little more active, you can take a trip up to the impressive statue of El Cristo de la Misericordia. From there you can look down on your ship and enjoy stunning views up and down the Pacific coast Or you could visit Parque de Aventuras Las Nubes, where you will be taken up through the cloud-forest in an off-road vehicle, stopping to spot monkeys along the way. You could even go ziplining once you reach the top! You can even combine these activities in a half-day tour which also includes a brief history of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Conclusion Nicaragua is a hot, up-and-coming destination and the time to visit is now. With so much to see, you're going to want a tour company that specialises in catering to cruise ship passengers, that company is Nicaragua Tour Network."
13,Not Just for Germophobes | Hotel Survival Kit,travel-leisure," The Bittersweet Hotel Experience as Summer Comes to an End Labor Day weekend. Summer fades. Fall whispers hello. This is the last hurrah of summer magic as the sun, sand and camaraderie of friends and family rule the day. Gathering together to enjoy every single moment of all summery good things. Sandy toes, windswept hair, tingling sun kissed skin, smoky beach fires, burnt marshmallows and divine moments that become memories. But this article is about the ""other"" vacation moments. It's about tiny little free loaders like germs, parasites and bed bugs that love to hang out and share everything -  including your beautiful hotel room. These guys, they love to share. So, just how clean do you think your hotel room is when you plunk down your suitcases and champagne cooler? Before We Go There Think Survival, in a Modern, Enlightened Kind of Way Here's What We like to call it the ""Hotel Survival Kit"". Get a Shoebox - pack these things - Ok, Maybe an oversized Shoebox. Sanitizer Bed Bug Killer Spray Hand Sanitizer Antibacterial Hand Soap Disposable Sanitizer Hand Towels Socks or Slippers Flip Flops Drinking Glasses Here's Why Hotel Housekeeping - Keeping it Real The hotel room looks great. But, how clean is clean? Housekeeping does a bang up job, but they have their limitations. Due to quotas and pressure to get rooms cleaned quickly, not all hotel rooms are thoroughly cleaned. It's just a fact of life. There is only so much housekeeping can do, especially when some guests are unusually, unnecessarily, deliberately and flagrantly messy. Plus, not all housekeeping staff are exactly cleaning angels. Let's just say some unorthodox shortcuts have been studied and documented that would make your hair stand on end. Let's just leave it at that. The possibility of these two elements combined is a recipe for a germ infested hotel room disaster. Studies also show that the cost of a hotel room directly affects the cleanliness quotient of the room. Hmmm. Imagine that. There's Also the Sheer Number of People Traveling Here are the number of people who traveled to the United States in 2016 according to U.S. Travel Association: U.S. domestic travel increased 1.2 percent from 2015 to a total of more than 2.2 billion person-trips in 2016. International inbound travelers, including visitors from overseas, Canada and Mexico are estimated to have made 75.6 million visits to the United States in 2016. The sheer number of people who travel should be incentive enough to think about those who have stayed in ""your"" hotel room. Not to be an alarmist but it isn't just the room you are sharing. Microbes, germs, parasites and tiniest bugs that travelers leave behind can be there, in your hotel room, waiting in silence. It's also important to remember that infections that might be found in the U.S. population do not include some of the infections that are introduced by foreign, sometimes, third-world travelers. So, how is the issue of germs, microbes, and parasites dealt with in a hotel? On average, hotel housekeepers spend about 30 minutes cleaning each room, a range of 14 to 16 rooms in an eight eight-hour day. Thirty minutes is just not enough time to cover all bases. In essence, your vacation should not mean good health and hygiene is being compromised because of cleaning norms in a hotel. The Dirt on Germs in a Hotel Room Germs. Predictably you can expect high levels of bacteria in hotel bathroom sinks and floors. But the dirtiest areas are light switches and TV remotes, with light switches having the highest levels of fecal matter bacteria. That's a cringe worthy thought. Remember that inanimate objects like door knobs, table tops, light switches, TV remote controls are able to transmit infectious agents when they become contaminated. Study after study verifies that the TV remote control is one of the least-cleaned objects in a hotel room and germs accumulate on its surface. Many travelers bring along a plastic baggie to encase the germ laden piece of plastic and never touch the thing. But a good sanitizer used on other objects in the room will also do the trick. Remember that inanimate objects like door knobs, table tops, light switches, TV remote controls are able to transmit infectious agents when they become contaminated. Study after study verifies that the tv remote control is one of the least-cleaned objects in a hotel room and germs accumulate on its surface. Many travelers bring along a plastic baggie to encase the germ laden piece of plastic and never touch the thing. But a good sanitizer used on other objects in the room will also do the trick. Another thought to make your day - cleaning items that are used by housekeepers like sponges and mops have high levels of bacteria which increase the risk of infection as they go from room to room using the same sanitizing equipment. So, just bring your own sanitizer and avoid the possibility that you'll curate mysophobia (fear of germs) as a lifestyle. Hotel Practical Matters Germs in Your Hotel Room and Where They Live High Touch Areas. You don't have to be a germophobe to acknowledge the realities of germs and cross contamination issues in your hotel room, you just have to be practical. Not all viruses and bacteria can live for extended periods of time on contaminated surfaces but a limited list of common infections that can spread by incorrect hygiene practices in a hotel room include cold, influenza, rotavirus, norovirus, E.coli, Hepatitis A, staph infection and Streptococcus. Don't cancel your vacation. There's an easy fix for this. Again, it's called sanitizer. Spartan Hepacide Quat II RTU is a professional grade sanitizer that costs less than $3.00. Available to the public, this sanitizer is the first quart-based versatile disinfectant spray with EPA registered Hepatitis claims. So the question is, why wouldn't you bring along a professional grade sanitizer that means business? Hotel Beds & Bedding Bedspreads. Whatever you think might be living on the hotel bedspread, you are probably right. Logistically, washing and sanitizing the bedspread after each hotel guest is a pipe dream. Remove the bed spread. Don't use it. While it is true that many hotels now incorporate the use of duvet covers that are laundered along with other bedding and linens, the comforter itself is not cleaned. Keep that in mind. Again, sanitizing is not a bad idea. You may not want to spray the linen directly, but a mist in the air that settles within the room is a good option. Spartan SparSan Q Disinfectant is an ace product for this purpose. The Uncomfortable Subject of Bed Bugs in Your Hotel Room Bed bugs. Following World War II Bedbugs were virtually eradicated in the United States. They are back, with a vengeance. If you contract them in your hotel room, it is highly likely that you will carry them back to your home, not to mention the very unpleasant experience of being bitten by bed bugs. (Ask me how I know.) Please remember the cost of the hotel room is insignificant. Bed bugs can travel anywhere and they do not discriminate. If you really want to investigate their presence in your hotel room, you can initiate the tribal like ritual by pulling sheets, looking for residue, bringing a flashlight to find them and search for apple seed size buggers. Or, you can carry along Bed Bug Killer, spray it as directed, go have a cocktail and sleep easy. Bed Bug and Lice Killer by Spartan is a fairly new product that's portable, economical and effective. It's also used by many hotels and available to the public. For $6.50, why wouldn't you pack this miracle purple spray can of security? Got that? To summarize, in addition to sanitizer for the room, linens, and bed bug killer bring along these items to make your vacation memorable for all the right reasons. Hand sanitizer - Using hand sanitizer before and after interacting with high touch areas in a hotel room is a practical way to keep germs at bay for the duration of your stay. Antibacterial Hand Soap - Don't take a vacation from hand hygiene, 80% of all infectious diseases are transmitted by touch. This is an especially relevant fact while on vacation. Disposable Sanitizer Hand Towels - They're just nice to have around for everyday use without reusing hotel guest towels. Super for a quick clean up after indulging in room service for fingers and room surfaces. Socks or slippers - It's smart to always wear socks or slippers around in a hotel room. Carpet. Who knows? Flip flops - Wear flip flops in the shower to avoid any chance of contracting athlete's foot ... p.s. don't use the whirlpool tub. In a hotel, the pipes leading to the whirlpool tub are generally not flushed with bleach to kill germs. Drinking glasses - You don't want to know why. Just bring along your own if you can. All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware. ~ Martin Buber Enjoy finding your secret destination. We'll take care of the nitty gritty details. Sani-Chem Cleaning Supplies is run by people - not boards, stock holders or algorithms.

14,Why a Travel Agent is a Traveler’s Friend,travel-leisure," The travel industry is changing rapidly – especially with the Internet easily accessible from practically any point in the world. A lot of travelers have decided to book flights, hotels, and tours by themselves. Some were pleased by being able to do everything independent of travel agencies, and some were not satisfied with arranging travel on their own. Today we are going to cover the most important issues for any traveler to consider when deciding whether to use the services of a travel advisor or to plan their own trip When you are thinking about a future trip, you imagine it a certain way. You want to get particular emotions, experience specific activities, and have positive feelings and memories when you return home. Imagine that you had followed advice from the Internet or the suggestions of some friends, but your emotions at the end of a trip were not as bright and favorable as you had hoped they would be. Why did it happen? You seemed to gather enough information, prepare wisely and be 100% ready for your trip. The answer is simple: people are different and so are their tastes and preferences. You could never be sure that the hotels, resorts, and activities that your friends suggested would also be good for you. You may have different aims and goals for your travel; you may like different activities, be fond or not of sightseeing, shopping, museums, or sports. Or you can simply have different values: one person will put accommodations first on their ""list of travel issues,"" and another one doesn't care much about the conditions s/he lives in – but adores tours, diverse activities, and nightlife. How to choose smoothly and find the best variant for your future trip? The answer is simple: ask someone who has traveled to a particular destination dozens of times and knows PRECISELY about various activities, accommodations, transfers, and tours in the chosen destination. It is hard, however, to find such a person –especially one who has recently been to the preferred location and knows the latest trends and news from there. If you succeed in finding this person – how lucky you are! But if you don't – you can just ask for advice from a travel agent. They will understand the type of traveler you are and give you the most current, useful, and specific suggestions. He or she will plan your trip in the best possible way. Travel advisors do not just arrange a trip by booking flights, hotels, and tours; they know everything about your travel and almost go with you, constantly asking for feedback and sharing your emotions. If you want your trip to be ideal – ask a professional Travel Advisor for help. This person will become your friend and make your travel perfect."
15,Qualities to Look for In a Yacht Rental Company,travel-leisure," Sailing the deep blue seas on a yacht with your loved ones is probably the most exciting, fun-filled and rewarding holiday experience. Cruising, while enable you to take a healthy break from the real world, offers you a chance to connect with yourself as well as with Mother Nature in all her glory. Most people think of visiting famous, but overcrowded cities to spend their vacations. This is not a bad decision, but it is not clearly the wisest one. Cruising enables you to spend quality time and make most of your money. There are plenty of reasons why I recommend a cruising trip over any other way of spending holidays. While you get to enjoy the luxuries of a villa or a high-end resort, you also get to explore new beaches, islands, harbors and enjoy mesmerizing sunsets and whatnot. Apart from spending holidays, you can also charter a yacht or a cruise to host an event such as a wedding, meeting, parties, etc. Moreover, this would not be too much of a burden on your pocket. However, it is important that you conduct research while chartering a yacht; and in order to get the best one, you might have to go an extra mile. When it comes to chartering a yacht, selecting the best boat is not everything that counts. In fact, going for the most trusted and reliable yacht company is as important. But most people find it strenuous to get their hands on the best chartering companies. In order to find a good charter, you must have your requirements well defined first as you can simply not get the right answer in absence of the right questions. Know what exactly you want in your yachting trip. This includes the number of people travelling with you, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms required, the cuisine, destinations, extra activities that you might like, total duration, etc. Once you have it all figured out and agreed upon by each person of the group, it is time for you start with the difficult part. Here are the most important factors that you must consider in order to get your hands on the most suitable yacht chartering company: Types and Condition of Yachts Offered Depending on the type of yacht required, you must check multiple yachts and screen out a few. You must check out the rooms, bathrooms, lounge, kitchen and the overall condition of the yacht and see if it meets your demands. This will help you ensure none of your needs are being compromised and the boat can, in no way, cause any problems or malfunctions during your trip. If you want to go for a high-end boat with various features and amenities, you might want to go for one that is not more than two or three years old. On the other hand, if you are on a tight budget, you should choose a moderately older yacht. Payment Procedure It does not matter if you are going with a group of friends that are willing to equally chip in or if you are taking your family for a yachting trip, you must make sure the payment procedure offered by the company is smooth and hassle-free. Most chartering companies demand a 30%-50% advance payment. So it is better that you keep all the cash ready. Also make sure you go through the payment procedure thoroughly and ask if there are any hidden charges. If a company offers you very easy payment procedure, you might want to consider opting for its services. Extra Activities Offered There is no doubt that spending time on the yacht can be quite refreshing, but for how long can you do that? Not very long, I suppose. And what is the point of sailing if you do not go for a deep sea dive and explore coral reefs and swim along the marine life. You must look for a company that offers scuba diving or snorkeling or both. This will make your experience even better. However, you should also ensure if they provide the right equipment and gear and how much they charge for such activities. Captain and Crew To make your trip both interesting and safe, you must find a captain who is both friendly and extremely reliable. The captain must be highly experienced and must have the ability to wisely tackle the toughest of unexpected situations. Also, if the captain is friendly, you can talk with him and learn about various things about the sea and his experiences. When it comes to the crew, it is as important to find an efficient crew as it to find a great captain. The crew must be experienced too and must have all the necessary knowledge about entertaining the guests and taking care of problematic situations. They should know how to work together in all sorts of scenarios and must be pleasant to the clients on board. Rates This is the most important factor while deciding which company to go with. You must make sure you choose the one that offers you most affordable rates. Don’t be attracted to extremely cheap rates as you may very well be swindled into a sub-par experience and poor service. Compare the prices of the companies that you screen and opt for the one that suit all your specifications. Food and Snacks Most cruises offer free meals as a part of the package. However, the menu offered by each company can be different. Compromising on great food for a few hundred bucks is not recommended. Since delicious meals and deserts and refreshing drinks can bring a smile on people’s face and make times even better, you can select a customized menu for your trip. Safety The company you go for must provide proper safety precautions including fire extinguishers, first aid kits, life jackets, etc. This will ensure maximum safety and security is provided to the clients onboard. Now that you are aware of all the important factors while choosing a chartering company, you are all set to sail!"

We pass through the last village of Jorsale before reaching Namche Bazaar. The trail climbs through the forests and bridges until we reach the confluence of the Dudh Koshi and Bhote Koshi rivers. After a final steep ascent of about two hours we get first sight fist of at Mt. Everest, peering over the Lhotse-Nuptse ridge. We stop at Chauatra to admire the view. We still need to walk about 1.5 hours to reach Namche Bazaar, a gateway to Mt. Everest and main trading centre of this region. We stay overnight in Namche Bazaar. (B,L,D) DAY 05: Namche Bazaar: Acclimatize Day. This is the first of the two days set aside for ""acclimatization"". Health experts recommend staying active and moving even during the days meant for rest instead of being idle. We either spend the day taking a hike to Thame or visiting Khunde or relaxing and exploring Namche Bazaar itself. Namche Bazaar is the main centre of the Everest (Khumbu) region and has government offices, ATMs, Internet cafes, shops, restaurants, a bakery and temporary market bursting with colors and people each Friday evening and Saturday.

Overnight in Namche Bazaar. (B,L,D) DAY 06: Namche Bazzar to Tengboche (3,870m/12,694ft): 5 – 6 hrs After breakfast in Namche, we set out towards Tengboche, enjoying superb view of Mt. Everest, Mt.

Along the way, we can spot wildlife musk deer, a herd of Himalayan Thar and multicolored pheasants. The trail goes gradually down up to Kayangjuma. The path eventually reaches Sansa, which is the major trail junction to Gokyo valley and Everest Base Camp. The track then follows through the pine forests and after we cross the prayer flags festooned bridge over the Dudh Koshi River, we reach Phunki Thenga, a small settlement with a couple of teahouses and a small army post amidst the alpine woods. After having a relaxed lunch at Phunki Thenga, we gear up for a slightly tougher climb through the pine forests before we reach Tengboche. Tengboche is a great place for close up views of Mt Ama Dablam, Mt Nuptse, and Mt Everest, and it has the biggest Buddhist Monastery of the Khumbu region. We visit the monastery the same day at around 4 pm to witness the ceremony in the principal and popular monastery of Everest region. Overnight stay at a lodge in Tengboche.

You can take pictures of the monastery and the scenery around and as usual start the day journey. We choose the upper trail for better views on the way to Pangboche village. We pass through several Chortens and Mani walls and small villages. The place where we stop for lunch not only serves delicious food but also allows a fantastic close-up view of Mt Ama Dablam. In the afternoon, walk north to Pheriche or take the eastward trail beneath the towering north face of Mt Ama Dablam. From here onwards, the walk is fairly moderate as we enter the Imja Valley. The valley gradually unfolds as we approach the confluence of the Lobuche River. We descend into the river and begin the last and steepest climb of the day up to Dingboche. On arrival in Dingboche, you will see beautiful array of fields enclosed by stone walls to protect barley, buckwheat and potatoes from the cold winds and grazing animals. Overnight in Dingboche. (B,L,D) DAY 08: Dingboche (4,360 m/14,300ft): Acclimatize Day. We spend our second day of acclimatization in Dingboche. A refreshing breakfast while admiring a looming Ama Dablam (6856m/ 22493 ft) to the south is really fantastic. To better appreciate Mt Ama Dablam, Mt Lhotse and numerous other peaks visible from Dingboche, we climb the ridge on the north behind the village. This is an ideal acclimatizing excursion. From here you can see three of the world’s six highest peaks, Mt Lhotse, Mt Makalu and Mt Cho Yu. To the west, loom the towering peaks of Cholatse (6440 m/21,126 ft) and Taboche (6542 m/ 21,463 ft). As we look northwest, we see an array of peaks rising at the head of the Khumbu Khola valley. The Lobuche West and Lobuche East peaks are most dominant along with Lhotse which stands over 8500 meters (8501m/27, 890 ft). From a vantage point high on the ridge, you can scan the sweeping Imja Khola valley as well as the picturesque fields and pastures of Dingboche. Overnight in Dingboche. (B,L,D) DAY 09: Dingboche – Duglha (4,600 m/15,090 ft): 3-4 hrs We start the day with a climb to Duglha through the Khumbu Khola valley. The walk along the arid terrace is rewarding with awesome views of mountains on all sides. As we come to a yak herder’s place called Dusa, the valley begins to narrow and we continue through Phulung Karpo, the camp site of the first successful Everest Expedition in 1953. Above Phulung Karpo is Chola Lake. As we move on, the majestic view of Mt. Pumori (7138 m/ 23418 ft) comes into view. As the trail descends and curves, Mt. Pumori disappears from view and we come across a roaring stream. After crossing a small wooden bridge, we ascend to Duglha. We can see the tip of Mt Nuptse from here as well as Mt Cholatse, Mt Thamserku, and several other magnificent peaks. Spending a night in Duglha is ideal for acclimatization purposes. Overnight in Duglha. (B,L,D) DAY 10: Duglha – Lobuche (4940 m/16,207 ft): 2-4 hrs Beyond Duglha, we climb up the steep terminal moraine of the Khumbu Glacier. We pass through boulder-strewn slopes as we ascend Chupki Lhara, an eerie ridge top with dramatic mountain views. At the top of the ridge, we will find an array of stones with prayer flags used as memorials to Scott Fischer (American mountaineer) and 10 times Everest submitter Babu Chiri Sherpa (a Nepali mountain guide) who perished on a mission to climb Everest. As the trail drops to the Khumbu Glacier moraine, we find ourselves facing several great peaks — Khumbutse, Lingtren, Pumori and Mahalangur Himal. We are now in the vicinity of Everest but the great mountain still remains elusive. Mt Nuptse towers to the right as the trail crosses the Khumbu Glacier. As we pass along a murmuring stream leaving the Khumbu Glacier behind, we now begin to feel a little out of breath due to high altitude. Overnight in Lobuche. (B,L,D) DAY 11: Lobuche – Gorak Shep (5,170 m/16,961ft) – Everest Base Camp (5,364m/17,594ft) – Gorak Shep: 8-9 hrs The trail to Gorak Shep goes ahead through the lateral moraine of the Khumbu Glacier. We pass through the pyramid sign post. Ahead on the trail we see crest of north ridge of Everest along with Mt. Pumori, Mt. Mahalangur, Mt. Lingtern, Mt. Khumbutse, Mt. Nuptse, etc. A small ascent would take us to Thangma Riju from where we perceive 360 degree vista of snowy mountains. Climbing steeply up to the top through the torrent of Changri Glacier, we catch our first glimpse of Kala Patthar, a grey-green knoll beneath the Mt. Pumori. As we reach Gorak Shep, we will find snow-capped mountains looming all around us including the top of the world – Mount Everest. After a brief lunch and rest, we take the trail to Everest Base Camp through the once vast Gorak Shep Lake. Continuing straight ahead, we come through the Indian army mountaineers’ memorials. Only upon reaching the Everest Base Camp do we really appreciate the Everest climbers who brave the hazardous route through the Khumbu icefall. Mountaineer’s tents stand out in bright colors against the monotony of gray surroundings (especially in the Spring). Nuptse, Khumbuste and Pumori are the mountains we can view from the base camp. Everest actually is not visible from here. By now we have met the ultimate objective of our trip. However, the sunset view from Kala Patthar is more admirable than the sunrise view, so it is suggested to visit Kala Patthar today during sunset. As the setting sun’s rays strike the snow capped mountains the resulting scenery is indescribable. For those trekkers who wish to continue to Kala Patthar, our guides and Sherpas coordinate your hike to Kala Patthar for amazing sunset view today rather than waiting until the next day. Overnight in Gorak Shep at a local lodge. (B,L,D) DAY 12: Gorak Shep – Kala Patthar (5545m/18,192ft)- Pheriche (4280 m/14,070 ft): 8-9 hrs Today is the climax of our trip. We start early in the morning to catch the dramatic views from Kala Patthar and witness the first light of day caress the peaks of the mountains, particularly, Mount Everest. However, we need to be prepared for an early morning departure, amid predawn darkness and cold temperature (-10 to -14 C). Plus there is always the potential for chilly winds which are quite common. Familiar peaks such as Lingtren, Khumbutse, Changtse tower to the east even as Everest begins to reveal itself. During the ascent to Kala Patthar, we can pause to catch breath at several outstanding view points from where you can snap great pictures. After several hours of ascent, we reach Kala Patthar. From here we scramble up to the top of a rocky outcrop marked by cairns and prayer flags. Mind-blowing Himalayan panorama unfolds before your eyes as they wander from one mighty massif to another. You can take as many pictures as you want with your camera but don’t forget to imprint the vista in your mind’s eye so that it lasts a lifetime. On being back to Gorak Shep, we have breakfast and wait other participants to return.Those participants who wish to visit Everest Base Camp today will have early breakfast as the hike to base camp takes longer (4-5 hrs) than the Kala Patthar hike. Upon return to Gorak Shep, the group will have lunch together. We descend in the afternoon and arrive at Pheriche in time for a good night’s rest. (B,L,D) DAY 13: Pheriche to Kyangjuma (3,570m/11,710ft): 5-6 hrs Just after start of our trek, we cross Khumbu Khola (stream). Following the main Everest trail down the beautifully scenic valley, we pass through the villages of Tsuro Wog, Orsho, Shomare and reach Pangboche at the base of Ama Dablam. We cross the bridge over Imja Khola and pass through the Deboche village and reach Tengboche. We spend a brief time at Tengboche monastery, observe its many prayer wheels. We cannot explore prayer altars inside as the monastery opens only at 3 pm. From Tengboche, a steep descent of about 1500ft/500m leads through rhododendron bushes and fir trees to the Dudh Koshi River. We cross the first bridge over Dudh Koshi on our return trip at Phunki Tenga. Further we pass the village of Tashinga and Sansa before finally reaching beautiful village of Kyangjuma. Here, we appreciate the gorgeous Ama-dablam, Thamserku, Nuptse, Lhotse and Everest! Overnight at Kyangjuma. (B, L,D) DAY 14: Kyangjuma to Monjo [2,840m/9,315ft]: 4-5 hrs The trail to Namche Bazar clings to the steep wooded slope beyond Kyangjuma, winding through several bends. We lookout for wildlife such as mountain goats, snow leopards, colourful pheasants etc. while we pass through the forest by the trail. We have enough time in Namche to shop and relax in a bakery that serves coffee and cakes, and provides Internet access. A steep descent from Namche Hill leads to the suspension bridge crossing the Dudh Kosi river near the confluence of the Dhudh Koshi and the Bhote Koshi Rivers. We cross the Dudh Koshi River twice at separate locations before reaching Monjo. We are out of the Sagarmatha National Park after exiting from its official entrance near Monjo and finally reach Monjo Village. Not only is Monjo a quieter place to stay than Namche, it also means our porters have a less strenuous walk back to Lukla tomorrow. Overnight in Monjo.

6,Why the Cheapness of Independent Travel is a Myth,travel-leisure," The proportion of people who independently arrange their own tourist trips abroad is quite small. According to various estimates, it is 10-13% of the total volume. Despite the fact that the market for independent travel is growing (due to an increased number of hotel and ticket booking systems) there are still many more adherents of organized tourism in general. Independent tourism is not only fraught with troubles, it is also expensive. The independent tourist is a person who determines the route of the trip, books hotels himself, buys flight tickets, arranges cars and transfers, and also takes care of visas and medical insurance. That people decide to travel independently from a desire to save money is not entirely true. Most people who organize their own trips do so because of the dearth of tour packages offered – especially for countries that are not popular in the mass tourism market. Separate bookings of future segments on popular travel routes are 30% more expensive on average. At the same time, self-booking earns a commission or fee for the booking system that is no less than the one charged by travel agencies in the price of their package tours. Organizing trips independently does not seem so economical when these factors are taken into consideration. The growth of independent tourism is conditioned primarily by the desire of some tourists to conquer more and more new destinations. For most other ""organized tourists"" who go to popular countries like Turkey, Egypt, and Thailand – families with children and people who want to save time but get full service for their money – it is cheaper to buy packaged tours. Countries where it is less expensive to visit on your own include Cambodia, China, Singapore, Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Switzerland. The difference between purchasing a tour and paying for tickets and hotels yourself can range from 45% (Cambodia, Singapore) to 70% (China, Switzerland, Ireland). In Turkey, Croatia, Latvia, and UAE it is 15-25% cheaper to buy a tour than to book a trip independently. Traveling as part of a tour group to Malaysia can result in savings of 65%; Greece – 60%;  Sweden and Tunisia – 30%. There is also a question of visas. Depending on your citizenship, you might not be able to go to Japan, for example, without a travel agent – because to get a visa there you need an original invitation from a company that will act as your guarantor. Hotels and hostels, as a rule, do not make such invitations, so the only way for some to get into Japan is to use the service of a travel agency. Interest in ""indie"" travel has increased since many people think it is cheaper and more secure; however, this is not always the case. Most importantly, the tourist who travels on his own should understand that he alone is responsible for the entire trip. In 2010, when flights over Europe were interrupted for an extended period after eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, there was a reverse trend away from independent tourism. Self-tourists had been totally stranded by the force majeure situation that no one could have foreseen. Other tourists were protected through their travel agents – who provided them with hotel rooms at no additional expense, organized alternative modes of transportation, and offered other support services. The reverse trend intensified when the Italian company Wind Jet went bankrupt in August 2012. Tourists realized that there was a cost to independence, which, in fact, made tour tickets more economical. This basically caused many tourists who had gone on independent trips to return to their travel agents. The Global Business Travel Association, after interviewing nearly 4000 business travelers from around the world, found that 35% of respondents had gone back to traditional travel planning because they did not know who to contact to resolve unforeseen problems that had come up during their self-arranged trips. So, as you see, organizing travel by yourself is sometimes cheaper and easier. Nonetheless, in case of an emergency or force majeure situation, a travel agent will deal with most issues and assume overall responsibility for your comfort and safety on a trip."

10,Why is Business Travel Feedback so Important for Travelers and their Agents?,travel-leisure," Many  travel agencies ask for feedback from their clients once a year; some companies do this quarterly, fewer – monthly, and almost nobody does it immediately after each trip. YYZ Travel Group considers feedback to be mutually important (to both travelers and advisors) for creating successful collaborations in the future. Here are some reasons why: 1 – When you write a testimonial describing your travel experience, it is important for your memories to be fresh, so you can recall with certainty the particulars of what was excellent and what was not. After a season or year, you simply cannot remember those details, and it will be difficult to make your feedback as precise as it would have been right after the trip. Your opinion is very important for a travel agency to improve its services and for a professional travel advisor to take your views into account when making future arrangements. 2 – You should share your feelings not only as partners in travel planning, but also as friends and colleagues! That is what we call a sincere relationship with our customers. We do not consider the people who come to us for help as just clients; we think of them as our friends. So, we are interested not only in tour packages and hotel preferences; we try to know our customers better as people. A travel advisor knows a lot of things about numerous destinations, but to create your ideal trip, s/he needs to learn more about you and your personality. Then, s/he can use that knowledge to select the proper hotel room with fantastic views, or to recommend the best excursions and activities for you. 3 – Through your feedback, an agent will be able to understand your preferences, to see what was great and what could have been organized better. It is very important to know what type of traveler you are: if you prefer accommodations with cozy ambiance and high-level services, or you like to spend most of your time away from your resort/hotel area; whether you love animals and nature, or you get truly excited by various artistic performances and cultural exhibitions. Sometimes these factors become evident only after a trip, so be prepared to uncover unexpected personal features. 4 – While talking about a recent trip, you can discuss future travel plans and the agent can start to prepare something amazing taking your previous experience into consideration. There are so many important details in corporate evaluations that they should definitely be discussed soon after a trip."

Here you should visit beloved Disneyland, get a suntan on Malibu or Long Beach, and see a major attraction – Universal Studios."

Note: All but two of the following sites are free to use. Safari Travel Service scours hundreds of online sources for the cheapest fare available. The more flexible you are on time and destination, the better your chances of finding a great deal. Search for dates up to three days before and after your ideal travel dates or on any weekends in the next year.

It also lets you specify your preferred flight time, vacation activities (beach, gamble, golf or ski?) and weather (based on temperatures). Safari Travel Service can also help you bite the bullet and buy your ticket, or not, with its ""price predictor,"" which forecasts whether fares will go up or down. Enter your desired itinerary and the site will return a list of flight options, along with a recommendation to either buy now or wait for a fare drop. But the tool is not omniscient. Predictions appear with confidence rates and are limited to certain cities, round-trip, coach flights and specific time frames depending on your departure and arrival cities.

The site has actual people lurking on airline Web sites in anticipation of fare sales. They sign up for rewards programs to snag promotional codes and discount offers that can be passed on to Safari Travel Service  users. Plus, the site includes fares from Southwest, Allegiance and other small airlines that may not appear on bigger search sites such as Safari Travel Service . (Also check out Safari Travel Service , which fetches hotel listings that offer great values, meaning they have prices lower than similar nearby hotels, good locations and favorable Tripods reviews.

Search for your destination, and the site will return a detailed list of hotels, bed and breakfasts, vacation rentals and other lodging options. You can filter the results to find which hotels are best for value, families, business, romance or luxury. Watch out for possibly fake reviews from cronies trying to push up their own hotel's ratings or flame their competitors (the site flags some suspicious postings). Ignore reviews on either extreme and focus on those with mid range ratings — they're more likely to be the most helpful. Safari Travel Service doesn't sell rooms or offer any actual deals, but it links you to partner sites, such as Safari Travel Service . Click on the ""check rates"" button and select the site or sites you'd like to try — a new window with results will open for each partner.

13,4 Simple Fishing Tips for Beginners,travel-leisure," Summer is in the air and we all know what that means, fishing is in the air. Some people think you just need a pole, line and bait and you are good to go. But that's not the case all the time. Here are a few tips to help you catch that monster fish or your limit on pan fish. The first tip in simple fishing is making sure the rig is just right. There are two reasons making sure the rig is just right. First, a strong well tied fishing knot won't break when setting the hook and second, certain knots swim your fly or lure in  a way similar to the way fish swim making it more natural. There are many different ways of tying a knot and that all depends on what you are fishing for. Here are a few knots and what they are used for. The first one is a Turle Knot which is a great fixed knot for fly fishing and a Uni Knot is a loop left open that makes streamers and nymphs look realistic. Second tip is making sure your lure is swimming properly. You need to make sure that your bait is naturally moving through the water and mimicking fish movements and you do that with your rod tip and reel speed. When you pull on your rod tip and reel down to gather slack but making sure to keep in contact with your lure. Some people think they are going to catch something if they just cast and reel as fast as they can but if you do that your lure will not look like a natural fish in the water. Just make sure to swim your lure as the fishing spot dictates and you will have a better chance of catching that monster fish or just catching something period. Third tip is changing depths. Some people that fish the top of the water thinks it is fun but if there are no fish at the surface it won't be as fun as you won't be catching anything. If you are going to be fishing the top of the water, you want to make sure you are using a jig, spoon or a metal-lipped jerk bait to better your chances of catching something. You might have to go deeper to find where the fish are. There are going to be times where you will need to add or subtract weight when bait fishing or go to a sink tip or sinking line when you are fly fishing. Just remember if you are having any top water action you might need to go deeper to find where the fish are. Final tip is changing location. If you have been sitting in the same spot for a while and have changed different lures and baits and there is nothing baiting, you need to move around to where the fish are at. But before you decide to leave the location you are at make sure you have covered all the water around you. Make sure to throw a couple of cast to your left, to your right, in front of the boat and in the back of the boat. You never know the fish could be anywhere and it is easy to move the boat to where the fish are. With these few tips you will be able to catch that monster fish or a pile of pan fish this summer and possible into the winter, that's if you think you have the summer fishing down to give ice fishing a try. Good luck fishing this summer."
14,Reasons to Choose Luxury Travel,travel-leisure," When planning a vacation, budget is one of the most significant questions. People often try to economize on everything from booking cheap motels and hostels to spending less money on attractions and restaurants. However, there is a constant dilemma: should a traveler economize on a trip or not? In order to resolve this question, it is important to decide what advantages luxury has over budget travel and how to find a perfect solution for a great holiday. There are some reasons why people tend to choose comfort and luxury over budget travel: 1.Opportunity to Fully Relax You don’t have to stay in a noisy hotel with other neighbors, sleeping in uncomfortable conditions without a private bathroom in your room. Luxury hotels have it all to help you feel at home, and even better! You will not only enjoy another country’s sites and attractions, but also its cozy and wonderful hotel rooms. At first glance, living in luxury conditions might seem needless if you are going to be out most of the time. However, after a long day in a foreign city, a good hotel can be your refuge by providing all necessary conditions and amenities for you to have excellent rest and relaxation – private luxury bathroom with Jacuzzi, mini-bar and television, hotel breakfast and in-room services – and to be able to face the next day fully rejuvenated. 2.The Best National Food While average travelers try to economize on everything including food, it is not always a good choice to do this with local cuisine. To explain: when you buy food on the street or in second-rate restaurants, you should be prepared for the quality to not be at a high level. Moreover, street food doesn’t always mean a healthy meal. In first-rate restaurants you can try the BEST local cuisine and enjoy a foreign culture’s deliciously nutritious dishes. 3.Private Tours Although it may seem that arranging travel on your own will be cheaper, it is not always the case. A professional travel advisor knows for sure how to get tickets to the best sites at the lowest prices. Moreover, he or she may have a number of special agreements that allow you to pay discounted rates  for multiple attractions. In addition, when you book a PRIVATE tour, you can make changes wherever you want – if you made a preliminary note about that. You can also get answers to your questions right away and learn everything about a place through the words of a professional guide, who will reveal little-known secrets about the destination. 4.First Class Treatment and No Worries You have to worry about NOTHING. Remember, you have a travel agent who cares about you – that’s what LUXURY means. So, if you want to get a real rest with no worries about plans, schedules, delayed flights and uncovered messages – consult a travel advisor, and get ready to enjoy the best vacations ever in first-class style!"

16,Knowing about the Gullah Tradition,travel-leisure," Knowing about the Gullah Tradition In a bid to explore this unique culture, many people now visit these islands, especially the Hilton Head Island. The unique culture, tropical climate, activities and more attract a large number of tourists to this island every year. What’s more, the number of tourists is witnessing a significant up trend year after year. Curious for more… The History of the Gullah Here’s more about the historical journey of the Gullah Geechee culture from Africa to the Sea Islands. The birth of the Gullah Geechee traditions dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries, the time when transatlantic slavery trade was in vogue. One of the first settlements of the English was at these islands. They settled down near the coastal plains and swamp lands. This area is popularly known as the Low County. Due to the humid weather and tropical climate, growing crops in this area was challenging. However, the English soon realized that this climate was ideal for rice cultivation, which was then imported from Asia. The English, however, failed to grow rice here due to their ignorance and lack of knowledge on the intricacies and essentials of cultivating rice. This is when they decided to trade slaves from West Africa, as they were well-versed with the intricacies of growing rice. The Africans were brought here and rice was cultivated in these lands. As agriculture thrived, more and more African slaves were brought here to earn for the English through rice cultivation. However, the white population could not adjust with the weather conditions in these lands. The tropical climate made this land home to many diseases like malaria and yellow fever. The white people vacated these lands and continued cultivating rice with a few white supervisors and a large population of trusted African slaves. Retaining their culture As the island was not connected to the main land, these Africans had no exposure to visitors from any other land or an insight into other cultures. They were a close knit community and practiced their traditional culture, practices, customs etc, which they have maintained till date. They practiced their art and crafts and continued creating the age-old fanners, clay pots, wooden mortars and more so. In fact, they also enjoy a rich cuisine, made primarily from rice. These people came to be known as the Gullah Geechee people, who have preserved their traditions in the land, which was once inhabited by their ancestors. So, if you are tempted to gain an insight into this unique culture, visit the Hilton Head Island."
17,Gorilla Trekking in Uganda and Rwanda: Everything You Need to Know,travel-leisure," A complete guide to gorilla trekking, gorilla families, rules, what pack, cost of a gorilla permit and the right safari company. Seven years ago, I founded my first Safari Company Wild Africa Explorers. I founded Mushra Travel Agency  few years later. My success as a Tour Consultant has been driven by my passion for travel since childhood. Every traveler who goes to Africa never misses to see cute kids standing the road-side, smiling and waving bye bye mzungu (mzungu for white person).  I grew up very close to Lake Mburo National Park in Uganda, every time I see these kids waving at our Safari cars, I see images of myself about 35 years ago. I was a great admirer for travelers as child. I always wished I was one driving overland trucks full of tourists into the park.  My love for travel has inspired me to travel widely to Africa top tourist destinations; both as tourist and a tour consultant. I have so far visited five National Parks in Uganda, four Parks in Tanzania, two in Rwanda, one in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one in South Sudan and two parks in Kenya. I went for my first Gorilla Trekking Safari in Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park four years ago. Bwindi is home almost half of the world’s endangered mountain Gorillas. I have since then been involved on planning gorilla trekking tours for hundreds of tourists going to Uganda and Rwanda. Gorilla trekking is a life-changing Safari. It was not like any other ordinary safaris I had been to before. Meeting the endangered Gorillas, see them go on with their daily activities felt like part of me was endangered as well.  It’s unfortunate that we have only a few hundreds left in the world. I think this calls for greater conservation efforts across all sections of society, from government to communities. We need to support communities that live around Gorilla Trekking locations so that they can conserve these lovely creatures. Traveling to Africa requires a lot of preparations; physically and mentally. Being away from family, meeting strangers, what to pack, safety are some of the many concerns almost every traveler raises. Tour companies across Africa receive almost the same type of questions from travelers. I have compiled this article that I think will help address most of the issues raised by travels planning the Gorilla Trekking Safaris to Uganda and Rwanda. EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW There are only 700 - 880 Mountain gorillas remaining on earth. The majority live in the Virunga Mountains that straddle Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the gorillas live a wild existence, far from human reach. However, a handful of groups have been habituated and can be tracked and observed by small numbers of visitors under the watchful eyes of park rangers. Going on gorilla trekking safari takes more effort, both time and money. It’s more expense than a traditional safari but ranked highly by travelers around the world.   Every year, thousands of travelers go for Gorilla trekking safaris in Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo. The first thing to appreciate is that visiting mountain gorillas on a group tour can be quite expensive (going solo is often even more so). Gorillas exist in extremely remote mountainous locations, which means the logistics of a gorillas safari are a challenge. In fact the cost of a Gorilla Trekking permit can cover a wildlife-viewing safari in a top wilderness park in many parts of the world. The good news is, the gorilla trekking experience is completely worth it, it lasts a lifetime.  Are you planning to go trekking? Here’s everything you need to know about gorilla trekking in Rwanda and Uganda. WHERE TO SEE GORILLAS IN UGANDA Uganda is a larger country to explore than Rwanda, and it takes one day of driving to reach the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest from Entebbe. You can break this road trip with an overnight stay halfway at Lake Mburo National Park for a wildlife viewing tour. BWINDI, HOME OF THE MOUNTAIN GORILLAS Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park is best known for its Mountain Gorilla populations and gorilla trekking although, it also offers some of the finest montane forest birding in Africa and is a key destination for any birder doing a Safari to Uganda. Bwindi is one of the few in Africa to have flourished throughout the last Ice Age and it is home to roughly half of the world's mountain gorillas. The forest is also home to elephant, chimpanzee, monkeys and various small antelope and bird species. There are seven habituated gorilla groups located in different parts of Bwindi. The groups range in size from 10 to 20 individuals, each with one or two silverbacks. • Mubare Group:  this Mubare group (also called the M-Group) – was the very first group to actually be habituated for tracking by tourists. the habituation started in 1991 and this group received its very  first tracking visitors in 1993.  Mubare group is actually named after the stunning Mubare Hills in which this group was discovered. • Habinyanja Group: This Habinyanja Group was in 1997 habituated for tracking and received tourists in the year 1999. In the start it was a huge group, however a family was split from it named the Rushegura Group.  These two groups crisscross each other now and again and co-exist peacefully. •  Rushegura Group:  This Rushegura Group was in 2000 habituated for tracking and received tourists in the year 2002.  It is a huge group within the Buhoma area of Bwindi Forest. • Bitukura Group:   This Bitukura Group is among of the newest groups in Bwindi Forest- it is found and roams the verdant forest within the Ruhija area. There is restricted lodging in this area – although that available is offered in moderate plus high-class lodges. • Mishaya Group:  following a family dispute- the Mishaya Gorilla family Split from the then biggest Gorilla Group in Bwindi Forest – the Nshongi Gorilla Family – which two still live within the Rushaga  region in Southern Bwindi Forest. • Nshongi Group:  This currently is the biggest habituated gorilla family in Uganda with 25 members , at the opening of the group for visitors after Habituation it comprised of 25, and 10 left to form another family  called the Mishaya Group. • Nkuringo Region of Bwindi Forest – which is among the more physically challenging although rewarding regions in the of forest to enjoy Gorilla Tracking – habitat to the Nkuringo Gorilla Family. The Nkurungiro region of Bwindi is home to the  Nkuringo Group. The Group comprises of 19 members and is a favorite to people who have tracked over one group. GORILLA TREKKING IN RWANDA Gorilla trekking in Rwanda is often described as ""life changing"". It’s pretty costly though! Gorillas make their homes in and amongst the bamboo-covered slopes of the Virunga Mountains in the Volcanoes National Park in northern Rwanda. You’ll be introduced by expert trackers and guides to one of the fully-habituated families of mountain gorillas and you can stay with them for an hour as they go about their daily lives. Hikes in the mountains can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours + depending on the family allocated to your group and their location. The journey back can take just as long, but you are often carried along by the euphoria you feel at seeing the gorillas! There are ten Gorilla families living in the Volcanoes National Park that are fully habituated and available for visits by the public (whilst others are habituated for scientific research purposes only) . Each family consists of at least one Silverback (but sometimes as many and four), along with several females and a group of youngsters. •  Susa Family: This is the largest group with 38 gorillas. They’re hardest to trek as they tend to range high into the mountains. They have rare 5 year old twins named Byishimo and Impano. •  Sabinyo Family: A family of 17 members, Sabyinyo is an easily accessible group led by the powerful silverback Guhonda. •  Amahoro Family:  19 gorillas, led by the calm and easy going Ubumwe. To reach Amahoro it’s usually a fairly steep climb but it is well worth it! •  Agashya  Family (former Group 13): Because of conservation efforts by the Rwanda Government,  Agashwa today has 22 members •  Kwitonda Family: This is a family 23 members led by Akarevuro, originally habituated in DRC. These  tend to range quite far making it a moderately difficult trek. •  Umubano Family: Is a family of 13, who broke off from Amahoro with leader named Charles. •  Hirwa Family: This group has 18 members and only fairly recently formed from former Group 13 and Sabyinyo family members. They are led by Munyinya. WHAT TO EXPECT Gorilla trekking is an active expedition with moderate to strenuous hikes. Participants must be at least 15 years old, and should be physically fit. While tracking primates, guests will trek through thick jungle at elevations ranging up to 10,000 feet, for as many as four to eight hours, depending on the location of the primates. Treks can be arduous; and the terrain can be steep, uneven, wet, and muddy. This trip is not suitable for those who suffer from a cardiac, respiratory, or circulatory disorder or a disability that limits mobility. Most important to note is that you need a good Safari company to organize your Gorilla Trekking Safari. There are hundreds of Tour Operator Companies in Uganda, which include Mushra Travel Agency.  This leading Safari Company organizes Gorilla Trekking Safaris to Uganda and Rwanda.  Their 3 day gorilla safari tour includes a Gorilla Safari, Cultural tours, birding and guided village walks. WHAT TO PACK FOR GORILLA TREKKING Boots - Essential. A good quality pair of hiking boots will serve you well. A cheap pair of sneakers can’t work. Gloves - During the trek you might be grabbing trees, branches and vines, and your hands can get a bit scratched and generally beaten up if you’re not careful. Gloves a must-carry item. Light rain jacket - Bwindi and Virunga are both tropical rainforests, and there’s a good chance of rain almost the year-round. Pack a light-weight rain jacket that you can roll up in your bag and bring out if necessary. Energy snacks - The trek to the mountain gorillas isn’t impossible, but it is tough. Energy snacks like nuts, dried fruit, chocolate or power bars are a great idea. Just remember to take any rubbish with you as you go. Water –Bring a reusable canteen or a pack of filtration tablets. You’ll need to drink a lot during the trek. Long pants and shirts – It’s best not to expose too much skin during the jungle trek. Long pants, shirts and your rain jacket will cover you up. COST OF GORILLA TREKKING SAFARI IN UGANDA AND RWANDA A Gorilla trekking permit in Uganda is cheaper compared to Rwanda. You need $600 for a Gorilla trekking permit and $450 in the months of April, May and November (2016-2017). Uganda will not increase its gorilla trekking permits during the 2018/2019 period. Rwanda recently announced an increase from $750 to $1500 per person for all visitors. Rwanda also offers ‘Exclusive Visits’ which cost $15000, for personalized mountain gorilla visits for a targeted Gorilla family and $30000 for a minimum of 3 visitors for 3 consecutive days (Behind the scenes) GORILLA SAFARI FAQS Gorillas live in montane forest, so treks to see them are at altitude and pass through varied vegetation and terrain. You will need a reasonable level of fitness and a willingness to climb up muddy slopes and through thick growth. You can visit the gorillas year-round, and because of the rainforest climate, it can rain any day of the year, so there is not any time of year to particularly avoid travel here. April and May are the rainiest months. It's not possible to 100% guarantee sightings of the mountain gorillas. However, there have never been an instance where a tourist group did not get to see a gorilla group during their trek. To help ensure this, trackers set off at dawn to locate the gorilla groups and radio their GPS co-ordinates to the park headquarters, so when you set off on your trek with your guide, you know where you are headed. The trackers stay with the gorillas even if they are moving. Yes, you must be at least 16 years old and there's no flexibility to this rule. This is the same for both Rwanda and Uganda and it's enforced by the national parks. There is no upper age limit! Yes, permits must be obtained to visit the gorillas and, as only eight are granted per gorilla group each day, they are extremely limited. We will secure permits for you as far in advance as possible. Your permit entitles you to one hour with the mountain gorillas. This money goes toward conservation of the habitat, anti-poaching efforts and education of the local communities. It's definitely worth checking that your travel insurance does cover you for gorilla trekking as they may require an additional premium to be paid. But we only give a ‘Health Cover’ which only covers Malaria. Our Team and Doctor will take care of you if your get Malaria during your Safari period. Most tourists combine Wildlife Viewing Tours with Gorilla Trekking in Uganda and Rwanda. Some love to go rafting on River Nile before they go back home. You can go for wildlife viewing safari in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda or Akagera National Park in Rwanda. Queen Elizabeth National Park is understandably Uganda’s most popular tourist destination. It is the home of the famous tree climbing lion as well as the Uganda Kob, other antelope species, elephant, baboons, hippos, buffalo and chimpanzees. Over 600 species of birds have been recorded, making the park a magnet for bird watchers. A safari to Queen Elizabeth National Park includes Game drives to see wildlife, exclusive birding tours, launch cruises on the park’s lakes and cultural tours.

The foil liners come in different sizes so be sure to get the right size for your oven. Foil Cupcake Liners hold their shape better than paper ones but they still form odd shapes as they bake things like muffins, cupcakes and individual desserts. If you want your muffins to be uniform in shape, you need to use a Cast Iron Muffin Pan instead of cupcake liners. To keep rounded items, like avocados, upright during cooking, slice off a small portion of the bottom to create a steady surface. Then rotate the lid to evenly distribute heat during the cooking process.Slow cooking in a liquid produces tender meat.

19,Choose the Lake District for Your Perfect Cottage Holiday,travel-leisure," The Lake District. It means many different things to each of us. For some it is the stunning mountains and fells which are a beauty to behold. To others it is the ‘creative ‘connection to Wordsworth, Coleridge or Ruskin who were moved and inspired by their surroundings to create some timeless pieces which are still revered today. Many of us each year follow the daffodil trail alongside Ullswater to ‘walk in Wordworth’s footsteps’. The National Trust host the Ullswater Daff Festival (this year 28th March to 17 April), a set of events in the Ullswater Valley to celebrate its natural splendour.

1,Looking for a Permanent Partner Visa? You Need a Reliable Immigration Agent,travel-leisure," Making the decision to relocate to a different country to start a new life is an unforgettable experience. One would hope that it would be a happy time for everyone, but that is not necessarily the case. In many cases, the application process doesn’t go smoothly, and this is usually a result of ignorance. When applying for a 309 or a 100 visa, Australia bound partners can easily make a lot of mistakes. It is a common fallacy that all the information to successfully migrate is online. Actually, it is very easy to make a mistake that can delay an application or even cause it to fail entirely. For this reason, it’s vitally important to hire a reliable immigration agent to help. Negotiating the Maze: Most of us, are not very good at dealing with complex bureaucratic systems. Applying for a temporary or permanent partner visa without some kind of expert guidance is not for the faint of heart. The paperwork itself is hard enough, but it must be supported by relevant documentation, and it has to be made available within specified periods. It can be hard even to work out which kind of visa you actually need and should be applying for. An immigration agent should be hired by you before any of this process starts. This will ensure that you don’t waste time and effort in areas that will not be successful. Ensuring a Quality Service: Hopefully, now you understand that an immigration agent is a good person to have in your corner. That being said, there are a couple of things that you need to consider before you hire an immigration agent. Firstly, you must ensure that your chosen immigration agent is registered to operate in Australia. There are unscrupulous fake agents around that charge for services that they don’t deliver, so be wary and always check your chosen immigration agents credentials. Secondly, always choose an agent that has plenty of experience in your kind of immigration. Some agents may specialise in certain kinds of immigration and others are well versed in all aspects. Finally, ask plenty of questions to determine what your immigration agent can do for you. Some agents, really go the extra mile, with invaluable additional advice, such as driving laws, tax advice, employment assistance and relocation advice. If they are looking to apply for an 801 visa, Australia bound applicants for immigration should contact us. Here at 888 Migration, we are experts in all aspects of immigration into Australia. Our registered immigration agents are well versed in dealing with all kinds of visa applications. Get in touch with us; we look forward to discussing your needs in more detail and answering any other questions you may have."
2,The Role of Immigration Agents in 820 Visa Applications,travel-leisure," Many people that are interested in migrating to Australia for all kinds of reasons, soon discover that it can be a lengthy and difficult process. It’s entirely possible to garner all the information required online, but in reality, that is a bad choice for most people. The most common problem encountered is a lack of any real information mixed with opinion and plain bad advice. In reality, the immigration landscape is in constant flux, and it’s a full time job trying to stay relevant in that environment. This is the reason why many people opt to use an immigration agent to ensure that the process runs smoothly. Why Choose an Immigration Agent? As we’ve stated, the rules can be very complex for a layman to understand and they quite often change according to the needs of the country. If they are seeking an 820 visa, Australia bound people without the correct documentation will fail in their application. When you use an immigration agent, the process runs more smoothly for a number of reasons. Firstly, as experienced agents, you can virtually guarantee that they have encountered your particular situation before and know how to handle things effectively. Secondly, they are acting as your agent and have your best interests in mind, if a problem arises they will be available to offer valuable advice. Lastly, there is expediency to consider; an immigration agent will be on hand to check your forms for errors and tell you what you need to do. This will speed up the process a great deal and avoid costly mistakes that could set back your plans significantly. How Do You Choose an Immigration Agent? The first thing to realise is that there are unscrupulous people out there posing as immigration agents that will try and con you without offering any help at all. For this reason, all officially recognised immigration agents must be a registered agent in the country they are based in. They will have the correct qualifications and experience to handle your application, and they may even specialise in different kinds of immigration. Don’t be frightened to ask for qualifications and any other questions you can think of. It may be tempting to choose a cheap immigration agent, but cheaper agents are far more likely to be unregistered. If they are looking for an 820 visa, Perth residents should contact us here at 888 Migration. We are experts in Australia immigration issues and our clients benefit from the advice of our immigration agents. Some aspects of the 820 visa application process may seem simple, but incorrectly filed paperwork and a lack of knowledge can slow the process down significantly.

5,Squirrely News,travel-leisure," There are times when it feels like the squirrels in our yard are just as much a part of our family as our pets.   Seldom do we look out our window or walk around our property, without a couple of squirrels scampering nearby.  They race across our deck and railings.  They dig relentlessly in our flower pots when we are not looking.  Sometimes they even help themselves to the tasty heads of our favorite new blooms.  We are constantly filling in holes where they are burying new acorns or digging up last season’s crop.  The other day a squirrel was digging and digging in one of our young spring flower beds.  By the time he was done, until only a tail could be seen above ground.  Slowly, the squirrel started backing out of the hole while apparently filling it in as he retracted.  Within a few seconds, the squirrel was fully visible again.  Then I witnessed to my disbelief and amazement, the squirrel replacing all the mulch he had removed back over the hole.  His busy little paws quickly spread the mulch around the area.  After he finished, I peeked at his handiwork.  If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have known that a hole had even been in this spot in our garden.  Squirrels are certainly amazing little creatures. Around the world there are approximately 285 species of squirrels.  They can be broken down to three main lineages.  Two of the groups are relatively small.  These two groups primarily consist of the oriental giant squirrel and the neotropical pygmy squirrel.  The third and by far the largest group, can be split into three subgroups.  The threes subgroups are the flying squirrels, tree squirrels, and mainly ground living squirrels.  Squirrels in these categories vary greatly in size, with the smaller African pygmy squirrel weighing around a third of an ounce and the Alpine marmot weighing up to 18 pounds.  Yes, 18 pounds!  The Alpine marmot is also around three and a half feet long, while the pygmy squirrel is as short as 3 inches. An interesting fact about squirrels is that early spring is the hardest time of the year for them to find food.  Nuts buried during the fall can be dug up and eaten prior to the nut starting to sprout.  Once the nut sprouts, the it is no longer available for the squirrel to eat.  Once buried nuts are off the menu, squirrels then need to rely heavily on the buds of trees for food.  Therefore, there are so many chewed off twigs through the spring season.  Squirrels will quickly switch to seeds, fruits, fungi, nuts, pine cones and other green vegetation when available.  Some squirrels, when desperate for food, will switch to meat and eat insects, eggs, small birds, and even rodents.  It is during these times, that a squirrel will rob a nest of freshly laid eggs or dine on the young.   They are some species of squirrels that will regularly dine on snakes, shrews, lizards, and mice when they can find them. In North America, there are most likely squirrels in your neighborhood.  They live across the country and continue to populate in large numbers.  A squirrel’s normal life span is between 5 and 10 years in the wild.  They can have multiple litters in a year and have a new litter every three or four months.  Their gestation period is generally between 30 and 60 days, depending on the size of the species.  The kittens as they are called, then stay with their mother for seven to eight weeks.  Initially after birth, they are blind and stay in the nest.  Once on their own, the new litter normally stays within a two-mile radius of their birthing nest.  Nature does influence the juvenile squirrels with most of them not living beyond their first year of life.  Those that do, can typically be seen chasing each other from tree to tree, racing across the back yard, or dodging cars on our roadways."

7,History of yacht manufacturers,travel-leisure," The history of yacht manufacturer is closely linked to the areas they set out to fish and explore seas and oceans. In every ancient area populated by men, we found traces of a boat culture and manufacturing. Ships and boats were an important part of ancient Egyptian's life. The earliest boats in Egypt were made during the time of the Old Kingdom, where they were used along the Nile River. Because of the lack of wood, boats were made with bundled papyrus reeds. These boats were 25 meters long, two to three meters wide, and sixty centimeters deep, which allowed seating for 30 rowers with one to two rudder oars. The most daring explorers in our history seem to be the Vikings. Facilitated by advanced seafaring skills, and characterized by their longships, Viking activities at times extended into the Mediterranean littoral, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. They also ventured to North Atlantic islands and as far as the northeastern coast of North America. Another great explorer was Christopher Columbus who set out to find new trading routes to India and discovered the Americas instead. On the evening of the 3rd of August 1492, Columbus departed from Palos de la Frontera with three ships: a larger carrak, a three-masted ocean going sailing ship the Santa Maria and two smaller caravels, the Pinta and the Santa Clara. Caravels are small, highly maneuverable sailing ships developed in the 15th century by the Portuguese to explore the West African coast and venture into the Atlantic Ocean. Niña, Pinta, and the Santa María were modest-sized merchant vessels comparable in size to a modern cruising yacht. Comparing the manufacturing of Columbus’s ships to power yacht manufacturers or motor yacht manufacturer of today, one has to admire the courage of Columbus and his crew. The manufacturing of ships culminated with the production of the Titanic. The Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m). Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m). Comparing the material and tools used in those days to a luxury boat maker of today is not possible anymore."
8,India And Its Indianness!,travel-leisure," Watch out people if you are traveling to India for the first time because you will be blown with the cultural richness of this country. But stepping in and walking with your rules is not something you can do in this country. We know that India is all about a diverse unity and if you want to enjoy and savor in the complete unique heritage of this country, you have to mingle up with us. Come join us in India and become a part of us for a while by knowing little things about this place and knowing how it feels to live like this. So let’s get started with all those people from San Francisco who have all the feels for the beaches and heat. Here, Goa would be your kind of place but we think you should book your cheap flights from San Francisco to Hyderabad because this city is completely opposite to what you have seen. This city is a platter of royal etiquettes and habits. Ever been to the Nizami culture? No? Come visit Hyderabad. Let’s put a break on beaches for a while. Travel from San Francisco to Hyderabad to see what this city holds to show you and give you. Before coming here, make sure you know a few little things that are essential for your trip. Given below are my personal ten tips that will help you survive in India and I am sure you will not have any problem in following them. So here we go! Avoid burning out. Make sure that you are not a victim of fatigue and don’t try burning yourself out there. Take proper care if you are in India. Get away from the city. Cities might loo posh and all but they are definitely not what you must see in India. Get away to the outskirts, explore the wildlife and the earthen lifestyle of people out there. Know that the real India lies in its villages and forests. Not in the cities! Watch whatever you eat and drink. Make sure you don’t eat anything just by an experimental way. Know what the dish is all made of and then check if you can bear the spices. Because India is known to be the bearer of spicy etiquettes. So make sure you know how much of spices you can consume and eat accordingly. Don’t be too precious about your personal space. It is important to know that India is a country where emotions and bonds are very much valued and this leads to the fact that people will surely interfere in your lives and they will surely want to know if you are fine or not. So do not expect much of privacy because firstly it is not needed and secondly, the more you mingle, the more you will enjoy here. Dress conservatively. We know there is nothing absurd in the way we all dress up but when we are traveling to India, we need to dress according to their culture and they believe in wearing a little more than we do. Or may be you should try dressing up like them which will be even more fun to try. So make sure it is not just jeans and bikinis. Try a traditional skirt or drape a saree. Watch the way your hands and legs move. There are certain traditions and rituals that people in India follow. You can use your legs to touch or indicate something because it might be unholy for them. They have manners which are different from ours. So make a note of their values before going there. Take care of the timings. In India, make sure that you know that you got to check your timings and move because of the time difference that we already have. Stay safe and keep your things safe. It is important to not lose your important documents and passports safe. The pick pocketing is famous all over the world but in Hyderabad, the crowded places tend to betray our safety. Make sure you know that India is noisy. Do not expect to not hear noise because it is India. People will be chattering away and sharing their excitement all the time. Moreover the markets are always crowded and filled with clink-clanks. So yes, you got to get used to the noises. Avoid deals that are too good to be true. Don’t try to believe someone who is trying to sell you the best thing at a cheap price. It means that is definitely not something precious. Know what you are buying and make sure you talk about it to a lot of people so that they will help you out. After all, India is not a country full of bad people. Know these little differences and then your trip will be more awesome than you expect it to be. India is a place where you have so many surprises bombarding every day and it just becomes a daily routine for you to hear and see new things. Just get used to them."

11,Factors to Consider Before Your Partner Visa is Approved,travel-leisure," Australia has amazing landscapes, diverse wildlife and some of the best beaches in the world. However, before you move here to be with your fiance or partner, you need to be aware that it can be a little bit of a culture shock. So, here are some factors to consider before you go through the application process and have your visa approved. There is a Strong Coffee Culture: Australians tend to take their coffee very seriously. In fact, that the coffee industry is so large in Australia that Starbucks was forced to shut down. This American coffee giant closed 70 percent of their operations back in 2008 because of the fierce competition from the local businesses. Although this won’t affect your partner visa application, this strong coffee culture may take a little getting used to. We Also Love Our Booze: Just like our British cousins, Australians enjoy a drink, and it is also part of our culture. You are likely to find a liquor store on every commercial street, and you will be offered a drink in every restaurant. If you enjoy artisanal products, you will also find that we have an impressive selection of locally brewed craft beers and distilled alcohol. You’ll Still Find Snow: One of the things that many ex-pats worry about is that they will never see snow again after they move to Australia. However, this is not the case. While we do have a relatively hot climate with some fantastic beaches, there is also a lovely winter season. If you visit the Alpine region, you can still enjoy skiing and snowboarding with real snow. ​ You Won’t See Kangaroos Everywhere: Although some locals do consider kangaroos to be a pest, they aren’t everywhere. You won’t see a kangaroo hopping down the street in a big city. If you do want to see kangaroos, you will find them in wild areas or zoos. We Don’t Use American English: Something you will discover during the application for your partner visa is that we don’t use American English here. Australian English is closer to British spelling, but we do have our own slang. If you want to feel completely at home, you may need to spend some time getting the hang of the local jargon. Tipping is Not Mandatory: Unlike in the US or the UK, Australians don’t really tip service providers. The main reason is that Australia has the world’s highest minimum wage, which means that waiters and other service providers don’t rely on tips for a living wage. If you are considering applying for a partner visa, you should speak to us. The 888 Migration agents are ready to answer all your questions about applying for a partner visa, Australia visa requirements, and the overall application process."
12,Entitlements and Requirements of the 100 Visa,travel-leisure," If you are thinking of applying for a partner visa, you need to be aware that there are some specific requirements. During the application process, you will need to demonstrate that you are eligible for a visa and you may need to show documentation and proof in order to gain approval. Here is a basic guide for the entitlements and requirements of a partner visa, so you can check if it is the right option for you. The Basic Requirements: In order to apply for a 100 visa, you need to show that you are either in a de facto relationship or married to a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. Your partner needs to be at least eighteen and able to sponsor your application. If you are applying for a partner visa as a married person, your marriage must be legally recognised under Australian law. If you are in a de facto relationship, the 100 visa application form and process is a little more complex. De Facto Relationships: In order to have eligibility for a de facto partner visa, you will need to demonstrate that you have been cohabiting with your Australian partner for at least twelve months immediately before lodging your application. Both heterosexual and same sex couples can apply for a partner visa. Entitlements: Once you have met the criteria for the application and you have satisfied the character and health requirements, there are certain entitlements. The application process is two stage. Initially, you are likely to be granted a temporary visa which is valid for two years from the application date. After this period, the relationship between the applicant and their partner needs to be continual. If it is assessed to be a genuine relationship, a permanent visa will be granted. Holders of a permanent partner visa become a permanent Australian resident. Australian permanent residents have an entitlement to live, study and work in Australia. The additional benefits of being granted permanent resident status are that you gain access to Medicare, our government subsidised healthcare, the ability to apply for citizenship and certain social security benefits. If you would like to discuss your eligibility for a 100 visa, you should speak to us. We are specialist immigration agents, and the 888 Migration team is available to answer all your queries about the 100 visa, Australia visa requirements, and entitlements. We would be happy to assist you in preparing and lodging your 100 visa application form."
13,Starting to Pop,travel-leisure," When the soil temperature hits 50 to 58 degrees, some of our favorite Spring mushrooms will start to pop.  Throughout the United States, except for a handful of southern states that are just too warm and dry, the Morel mushroom is about ready to harvest.  As the soil temperature rises above 50 degrees the Morel quickly sprouts and reaches for daylight.  You must be quick because within hours various bugs and other wildlife start to consume the dandy delight.  As always with wild mushroom harvesting, be careful.  You must do some studying ahead of time and ideally bring along an experienced hunter that can identify the difference between edible and poisonous mushrooms.  The Morel does have a false counterpart that is poisonous. As spring turns to summer and then fall, several thousands of edible and poisonous mushrooms begin to sprout across the US.  Of these several thousands of mushrooms, only around 250 are considered significantly poisonous.  Although the odds are in your favor, the risk is not, so make sure you know what you are doing.  A significantly poisonous mushroom can cause sever liver damage requiring a transplant or even death. What do we mean by edible?  Edible typically is a mushroom that is absent of poisonous effects to humans and has desirable taste, aroma and minimal fiber.  A mushroom that is too fibrous is like eating cardboard and not an enjoyable experience.  Like the Morel, many edible mushrooms have look-alikes that are poisonous.  These look-alikes can even be found in our lawns.  Often that tasty looking mushroom in your yard, that closely resembles the common white button mushroom, is in fact a poisonous green spore parasol.  There are some mushrooms that are edible for most people but can cause allergic reactions in others.  If you are eating a mushroom for the first time, cook and eat a small portion to verify that you are not allergic.  So, the bottom line is, make sure you know what you are doing before harvesting wild mushrooms. Mushroom hunters typically harvest them for culinary reasons.  They are great sautéed and eaten as a side dish or added as a garnish to some other food item.  Reality is, mushrooms have many other benefits beyond the enjoyment of eating them.  Mushrooms are naturally low in cholesterol, calories, sodium, and fat.  They also can provide basic nutrition that can help prevent chronic disease due to beneficial dietary fibers and the presence of antioxidants.   They are rich in B vitamins that help the body draw energy from food and form red blood cells.  A rich supply of B vitamins appears to be an important ingredient for a healthy brain.  Mushrooms are also a non-fortified dietary source for vitamin D.  For those not consuming dairy products, mushrooms can offer an alternative source for this vitamin.  There are studies that show mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light before or after harvest, can provide up to four times the FDA's daily recommendation of vitamin D. There are many other benefits of increasing the number of mushrooms in your diet.  As mentioned earlier, mushrooms contain two types of dietary fibers in their cell walls, beta-glucans and chitin.  Consumption of these fibers makes you feel full longer and ultimately can reduce overall caloric intake.  These same fibers can also assist a diabetic in lowering blood glucose levels.  High fiber intake can also improve the digestive system function and reduce the risk of heart disease.  Another health benefit from consuming mushrooms, which are high in potassium and low in sodium, is the lowering of blood pressure and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  Top all of this off with the fact that the beta-glucans can lower blood cholesterol levels significantly.  There are many other side benefits of eating a cup or two of mushrooms.  With these benefits, on top of the exercise received while hunting for mushrooms, it is certainly time to start searching.  Remember to exercise caution, not all mushrooms are your friend."
14,Is an 820 Visa the Correct Option for Same Sex Partners,travel-leisure," Before 2009, if you wanted to live with your same sex partner in Australia, you would have needed to apply for an interdependency visa. However, the new Equal Treatment Commonwealth Laws, in particular, the Same Sex Relationships Act of 2008 eliminated the need for this subclass. The legislation changes were designed to ensure no discrimination between heterosexual de facto and same sex de facto relationships within migration law. This means that people in a same sex relationship now have the entitlement to apply for an 820 or another type of partner visa. The Criteria for an 820 Visa: In order to apply for an 820 visa, you must meet the Department of Immigration and Border Protection criteria. This includes; You must have been in a de facto relationship for at least twelve months with your relationship before applying. Applicants must be over the age of eighteen and meet the character and health requirements. Additionally, you need to show evidence of a ""social context"" of your relationship and joint finances. Finally, you need to demonstrate a commitment to each other even if there are periods of separation. Since civil unions and same sex marriages are not recognised by Australian law, regardless of your status back home, you need to meet the Government requirements here. Exceptions: There are some exceptions when applying for an 820 or temporary partner visa. Depending on where you are based, it may be a possibility that you could register your relationship formally. The rules for relationship registrations vary in different states and territories. It is not available in every Australian state, so you would need to check with your migration agent to see if this is a possible option. In cases where there is a demonstration of ""compelling and compassionate circumstances,"" the twelve month rule may be waived. An example is if you and your partner have shared guardianship of a child. Another example is if your home country laws prohibit same sex or other de facto relationships, making it impossible to live together before your application. Each situation is assessed on a case by case basis to determine if they are exempt, but the most straightforward applications are where you can meet the full requirement. Partner visas tend to be costly and complex. In recent years the fees have increased significantly, which highlights the need to submit an accurate and watertight application. To avoid excessive fees and charges, it is important that you get it right first time. So, if you are unsure about your visa options or eligibility, it is recommended that you seek the advice of a registered migration agent. If you are considering applying for an 820 visa, Australia applicants should speak to us. The team at 888 Migration would be happy to discuss your case and provide our expertise and advice."
15,4 Features of a Reliable Immigration Services Consultant,travel-leisure," With its wide range of natural wonders and lively cities, it is no wonder why Australia attracts thousands of tourists and visitors each year. A visit to Australia usually starts by obtaining a visa. This crucial step determines whether you will have permission to set foot on Australian soil. While it is possible to obtain a visa by yourself, many people want to avoid the delays and potential costs by employing an agent or consultant. Unfortunately, not all agents offer a high standard of service, so here are four features to look for in a reliable service provider. MARA Approval: Only agents registered with MARA or the Migration Agent Registration Authority are permitted to provide immigration services including managing your visa application. This government office has authority to regulate the Australian migration services industry and provides approved agents with a registration number. In order to retain their registration, the agents need to adhere to the MARA regulatory processes. So, before consulting with a service provider, be sure to ask for their MARA number to confirm they are registered. Genuine Contact Details and Offices: Your personal documents, which are a vital element of your visa application need to be handled in a secure location. Your chosen agent or company should have a registered address, even if their office is at their home. The contact details should also be clearly listed. Don’t Make Outrageous Claims: No migration agent or consultant can guarantee that you will obtain a visa or be able to issue one. There are some agents that make outlandish claims, but reliable service providers tend to only provide you with insight into the application process and offer to help you to prepare and lodge your application. If a service provider is making claims about inside connections with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection or that they can provide VIP treatment should be given a wide berth. Reasonable Fees: Most companies offer free eligibility assessments, and you should be wary of companies who insist on upfront payments before they conduct any initial evaluations. Additionally, your agent should not charge additional fees to speed up the process or take shortcuts. Remember that visas have specific requirements and are not likely to be approved overnight. If you are in need of immigration agents, Perth based 888 Migration is ready to help you. Our team of advisers is ready to assist you with any questions you may have about immigration services, Australia visa requirements or the application process. We would be delighted to provide you with immigration services you can rely on."

17,Snow Robins,travel-leisure," Look, there is a robin in the backyard tugging on a long and juicy looking earthworm.  Spring must be right around the corner.   Roaming around in the backyard is an American robin, easily spotted by its brown back and reddish-orange breast.  The bill, presently being used to hold onto that worm, is mainly yellow with a variably dark tip.  Some may argue that the dark tip is a result of digging for those juicy earthworms.  The next day, fourteen inches of snow and temperatures in the single digits.  Did the robins leave again?  No, listen, there are a couple of them singing over there in the trees.  Despite the drastic weather change, Spring must be almost here. Do robins really mean Spring is almost here?  The answer is, it depends.  There are ongoing studies being conducted on robin migration.  What we do know is that some robins migrate, others may not.  They seem to go where food is readily available.  They typically have a mixed diet of backyard bugs like earthworms, beetles, grubs, grasshoppers, and those cute caterpillars.  This makes up around forty percent of their food source.  The balance is mainly from wild and cultivated fruits and berries.  Due to their ability to switch over to fruits and berries, robins tend to stay much further north in the winter, than many birds.  If the area has a good supply of berries throughout the winter, the robin will stay around. A driving factor of seeing the robin in the backyard at the end of winter, is the thawing of the ground, the arrival of rain, and the earthworms moving around.  An interesting fact is that earthworms come to the surface during rain to avoid drowning in their burrow.  The temporarily wet conditions give worms a chance to move safely to new places. Since worms breathe through their skin, the skin must stay wet for the oxygen to pass through it.  After rain, or during high humidity, worms can move around without dehydrating.  As we all know, the earthworm is not a speed demon and thus is an easy target for waiting robins.  Reality is, robins do not need to wait.  They have both great vision and listening skills.  Often a robin can be seen hoping around, turning its head in multiple directions.  This is the robin detecting movement of its prey, either on the surface or underground.  The hunt is on and usually ends with a robin win. Once Spring has arrived and the robin can be seen daily now, it is not long before the breeding season begins.  The robin is one of the first birds to lay eggs as the warmer temperatures return.  Their normal breeding season occurs from April through July.  During this time span, most robins will have two to three broods.  Since deciduous trees do not leaf until sometime in May, most early nests are built in some type of evergreen tree or shrub.  The robin will rebuild their nest for the next couple of broods mainly in deciduous trees.   We have probably all seen robin eggs whether in a nest or a picture.  They lay three to five beautiful light blue eggs.  The eggs hatch in fourteen days.  Amazingly two weeks later the young can be seen flying and hopping around.  So, if we do the math, one North American robin could have up to fifteen chicks a year.  No sense in trying to lure a robin into your bird house either.  They are not cavity nesters.  A platform nailed to a tree or bush has a much greater chance of attracting a nesting robin. The most vulnerable time for the robin, like many birds, is during the nesting period.  The eggs and juvenile robins are preyed upon by snakes, squirrels, and other larger birds.  Having said this, the adult bird is also vulnerable, especially when distracted while feeding.  The robin has threats both on the ground and in the air.  Cats, dogs, and snakes will seek them out on the ground.  From the air, almost every variety of hawk, eagle, falcon, and owl dine on robins.  There are over twenty-eight varieties of raptorial birds, looking for a robin lunch.  Despite this, the robin is a strong species with a count of over 320 million members.  With these type of numbers, we will continue to enjoy seeing and hearing our first robin arrival of the Spring season."
18,4 Tips For Hunting in A Ground Blind,travel-leisure," Depending on the time of the year turkey hunting or deer hunting could be just around the corner. We all know what that means, it is time to get our ground blinds together and out. Here are some tips for hunting from you ground blind. First, making sure you choose the right location. Trying to find a natural structure to piggy back off is always a good idea as it might block one side but it can help blend your blind in better. Maybe finding some downed trees with limbs forming a perfect ""V"" is a perfect place to place your blind. You want to make sure you are finding the perfect location and placing your blind out there months before season opens so it gives the animals time to get familiar with the blind and won't spook off when season opens. Second, making sure you have concealed you blind in good. Using debris that is already on the ground is the perfect way of concealing from animals or humans. You always want to use the brush around you and getting it from other areas since it was already on the ground. Having the same brush or limbs around your blind as what you place it in will help conceal it even more and not make it stand out to animals or humans. Like if you are hunting in a bunch of pine trees, you want to make sure you are using pine tree limbs and not oak tree branches. You will stick out to every animal or human that is looking your way. Third, make sure you have cleared all the leaves and fallen branches out of the way. Last thing you want is having that monster buck or tom coming and you against to get a shot and your foot steps on a leave or branch and makes a noise and scares off that monster. Bringing a rake with you when you are setting up your blind will make it easier to get all the leaves and branches or sticks out of the way and you will have a nice quiet floor for your ground blind. Another idea to silence your ground blind floor is getting a piece of high traffic carpet. It has a rubber bottom and high traffic carpeting on top, plus it is very light. The two positives for this way is that it provides silence so you don't have to brush anything away and it provides a barrier between the cold ground and your boots to help you stay warmer. Fourth, choosing the right clothing to wear inside your blind. Most people would think to wear camouflage clothing but that can actually hindrance your looks than benefit from it. To make sure, you are not a silhouetted sitting in your blind, you want to make sure you have at least one side of your blind closed up. That way it will look black in your black to whoever looks in there and wearing black clothing will help you blend in better. Deer might be colored blind, but they can see patterns and in a big black background with a human shaped camo silhouette is a sure way to get busted. Now that you have some tips for getting your blind to the perfect location and making sure it blends in with the trees or brush, get on out there and shot that monster buck or tom. Remember to always wear black clothing when hunting in your ground blind so you are not making a silhouette. Good luck on your hunting adventure."
19,The Best World Markets,travel-leisure," Otavalo Market, Ecuador Known as the ""Otavalo Market"" to tourists, it is called Plaza de los Ponchos and also Centenario Market by locals. Otavalo is a town located in the northern Andes. The town center is located at 8345 feet (2543 meters) above sea level. This is a homeland for the indigenous Quechua people, who are still dressed in traditional clothing. Each village in the area specializes in its own craft, from woodworking to leather goods.

Here you can also visit the animal market, with chickens, alpacas, goats and sheep. La Boqueria, Barcelona Entering this market, you can find all the tasty, healthy and famous products of Barcelona in one place! This trading ground was first described in the 1200s, and at that time it was a travelling market for stallholders from Catalonia. Later, in 1470, pigs were sold here. Originally, the market was not fenced in, as it had no official status. It was not enclosed and had no official status, as it was regarded as a simple extension of the Placa Nova. It also had no definite structure. Nowadays, this market is the largest covered market in the region. It is located in the Ciutat Vella district and has a very diverse selection of food.

20,4 Money Mistakes To Avoid While Travelling,travel-leisure," Travelling the world should be an eye-opening and stress-releasing experience, not an anxiety-inducing one. Unfortunately, many of us often stumble into money problems in our trips abroad that can lead to a great deal of anguish – problems that often can be avoided with a little foresight and preparation. Financing a trip to far-away locales can be a struggle in and of itself. Some will save for months to have just enough to scrape by, others may look for supplementary funding like short-term vacation loans. Once your finances are in check and you’re ready to go on your adventure, there are some commonly-made money mistakes you should be aware of before setting out. Keep these in mind and plan accordingly before beginning your next journey. Leaving Your Bank in the Dark A simple phone call to your bank informing them of your travel destinations can save you plenty of trouble during your trip. When you neglect to do this, your bank may flag your overseas card usage as suspicious and block your account. Banks can detect unusual card activity fairly rapidly these days and it won’t take long for them to prevent your cards from being used if they feel the need to. While you could probably just call them if this scenario was to happen, the long-distance charges are definitely not worth it. Not Paying Attention to Fees Before travelling, it is wise to educate yourself on any fees you may incur – and how to avoid them – in your travels. This includes exorbitant banking fees for being outside your geographic area and fees for converting currency. Avoid making too many withdrawals from ATMs, especially with a credit card which will have significant cash advance fees. A few good solutions for avoiding fees are the use of a prepaid travel card or finding a credit card made for overseas use that won’t charge conversion fees. Using the airport for money exchange Continuing on the topic of conversion fees, avoid exchanging your money at an airport. Their exchange rates are generally dreadful and will cost you much more than if you plan to do your exchange elsewhere in advance. Not Carrying Smaller Bills Carrying backup cash is always important no matter where your travels may lead. Many places may not accept debit and credit payment and if you’re unlucky enough to lose your cards, you’ll want to have some extra cash to keep you afloat until you can replace them. When carrying cash in a foreign country, it’s better to have smaller bills than large ones. You will find that many vendors decline to make change for large bills and some shadier ones even use this common street scam to steal your money. Another important thing to keep in mind when handling cash during your travels is to never keep all of your money in one spot, lest it magically disappear. While you’re certainly there to relax and enjoy the experience, try not to let your guard down for too long if you don’t want to get a fast one pulled on you. Final Thoughts Travelling can be a wondrously valuable learning experience that takes you out of your comfort zone and provides memories for a lifetime. If you neglect to properly prepare and manage your money, however, the experience may end up being less than enjoyable. Take the time to phone your bank, look up any applicable fees and avoid airport exchange rates like the plague. Always carry some backup cash and be aware of your surroundings and most importantly: have fun!"

1,"Look Out, Mergansers Passing Through",travel-leisure," Daytime temperatures are starting to rise.  Spring is returning to New England.  Slowly but surely, the open water works its way back into the cove.  As the ice line recedes, more and more water fowl start to visit again.  This is certainly a great time on the lake, as hibernating species come back to life and many birds take flight starting their long migration north.  One morning, as the fog clears, there are several pairs of common mergansers actively playing in the cove.  Sure enough, two days later hooded mergansers join them.  This time of year, both the common and hooded mergansers drop in for a few days on their way further north. Both species are easily spotted.  The male common merganser with its blackish green head, black upper feathers, orange hooked bill, and snowy white breast is easy to spot.  They typically travel in small flocks showing up in our rivers and lakes.  The female colors are more muted; she has a bright rusty-brown head that is often fluffed up.  This may be her way of ensuring the males are noticing her too. Often traveling with the common merganser are the hooded mergansers.  These dapper birds, are the smallest of the merganser species while the common are the largest.  The two are quite a contrast in size when swimming and playing together.  Like their larger friends, the hooded mergansers are easy to spot.  Obvious features of the male include, a black back and black bill, a white breast with bold vertical bars, and a crested black and white head.  When the male raises his crest, the thin horizontal white strips turn into a gorgeous white fan that cannot be missed.  The female hooded merganser counterpart, like the common merganser, is much more muted with brownish gray flanks and a reddish crest.  Like her partner, she will also fan out her crest making her easy to spot. Unfortunately, both beautiful species do not stay around long in this area.  They head further north for breeding and cooler days.  When it is time for breeding, the mergansers prefer to nest in tree cavities or nest boxes where provided.  In other parts of the world, they can be spotted nesting in holes in cliffs or on steep banks considerable distance from the water.  The common female typically lays 6-17 eggs, while the hooded lay 9-11.  Both will only lay one brood a season.  Immediately after hatching, the mother takes her ducklings in her bill and heads to the nearest river or lake.  Here they feed on freshwater invertebrates and small fish.  They stay with their mother until they reach the ripe old age of 60 to 70 days.  Around this same time, they take their first flight.  The young females have the next two years to play and hang out before they start their own brood.  So, what are the males doing while the female is sitting on the nest and then raising the young? Well, they are generally a wary bird.  Especially during breeding season with one or more of them staying on sentry duty to warn the rest of the flock of any approaching danger.  The rest of them can be found floating around leisurely in a similar position to ducks.  They are interesting in that they also swim deep into the water like cormorants foraging and propelling themselves forward by stroking with both feet.   Again, like the cormorants, while resting, they can often be found sitting on a rock in the middle of the lake or stream, half-opening their wings to air themselves out and enjoy the rays of the sun.  When it is time for flight, they rise from the water flapping along the surface for many yards, until airborne.  Then they are off with a burst of speed and strong rapid flight.  For those of us on Webster Lake, neither species stay for the breeding season.  They are here for only a short stay.   We never know if we are seeing their last takeoff for the season until they are gone.  Then we are left with our memories of these gorgeous birds until they return the following Spring."

3,The New Trail,travel-leisure," We woke up early and prepared for our day.  We ate our breakfast and threw our snowshoes into the back seat of the truck.  We were going to try out a new trail for snowshoeing today.  You could feel the excitement in the air as we chatted about our upcoming hike.  We had done some research on the snowshoe trails in the area.  Google is an amazing thing when you need information. Our first thoughts were to take an easy trail like East Bluff Trail Loop which is 2.701 miles.  We also thought about Kettle View and Meadow Trails Loop which is an easy 3 mile walk.  However, we decided that we were going to look at the moderate skill trails.  Since we just started to snowshoe last year we felt very confident that a moderate trail would challenge us, but not leave us at total exhaustion. The three trails that peaked our interest were the Pike Lake Trail for 2 miles, the Nordic Trail for 3.7 miles and the Peninsula State Park Trail for 4.10 miles.  We have had good experience with the upkeep of the trails that we have been on and were leaning towards the Peninsula State Park Trail, but after much consideration decided that since this was our first trail of the moderate range we would go for the Nordic Trail.  Not really sure what the deciding factor was other than the name.  It made me feel like a brave warrior cutting my trail through the unknown territory.  I know that may sound silly, but creativity is a wonderful gift that I like to embellish to add to my snowshoeing adventure. We arrived at the trail by 9:00 a.m. and quickly snapped on our snowshoes and clothing.  We have learned that one of the most important parts of snowshoeing (aside from the snowshoes themselves) is proper dressing.  I have learned to focus on keeping my core warm, because it does not take long to warm up and I prefer not to carry all that extra clothes with me during the rest of my walk.  Now I dress for my daily adventure and found that since my blood starts to pump with my newfound love for this sport I no longer need to dress like I am heading to the artic pole. I never thought that I would enjoy winter like I do now.  I feel so alive as my family and I hit the open trail.  The sights are breathtaking and communing with nature adds to that good all day feeling that surrounds up during our morning walk. We were tired and content when we arrived home later that afternoon.  A day on the trails not only gave us a good workout, but also some much needed family time.  Life gets so busy with work and life that sometimes you just have to put that all on pause and go for a walk on the Nordic Trail."
4,Selecting a Rental Car or Your Own Car for a Long Road Trip,travel-leisure," For most people, the holidays mean spending time with family and friends. And with the holidays around the corner, it’s time plan something special with loved ones. Whether you intend to go on a long trip with them, or intend to travel a long distance by road just to be with them, you would want the trip to be a happy one. If you’re contemplating whether or not to take your own car and make that extra long journey, you need to consider a lot of things before taking a decision. No matter what type of trip you plan, selecting a rental car or sticking to your own car can make a lot of difference. Here are a few things that you should reflect on before deciding. If you’re going to take your own car on the trip, you’ll have to get it thoroughly checked a week or two in advance. You’ll also have to spend money on your car in case it isn’t fit for a long journey. If your car is quite old, it’s advisable to avoid subjecting it to the stress of a long trip. Most rental companies have a fleet of new cars that you can choose from. By booking a new car on rent for your trip, you can relax knowing that you’re getting a reliable car. Moreover, you won’t be adding extra miles to your car which will save you from future car-related expenses. If your car breaks down at any time during the trip, you’ll have to bear all the costs involved in getting your car running again. With a rental car, you won’t have to worry about these costs. If your rental car breaks down, all you have to do is inform the car rental company about the problem and they’ll promptly sort it out for you by repairing the car or giving you a replacement. Keep in mind that if you happen to damage the car in any way, you’ll have to bear the charges related to repair. Of course, you’ll have to pay for repairs even if you damage your own car during the trip. Things to Consider before Selecting a Rental Car or Your Own Car for a Long Road Trip If you’re going on a trip in a rented car with a group of friends, you can split the rental costs among yourselves. As per head cost will decrease substantially, the trip won’t be a burden to anybody. If you’re taking your own car, you can only split the cost of gasoline. But as mentioned previously, your car will experience significant amount of wear and tear. Not only will you have to pay for your car’s upkeep, but also repairs in case you happen to damage it during the trip. Your old car probably won’t give you a good mileage. This could raise fuel costs to a large extent. By hiring a relatively new car, you’re sure to get good mileage. Furthermore, you might have a car that doesn’t give good mileage on highways or on city roads. By opting for a rental car, you can choose a car that gives optimum mileage depending on the type of your trip. As mentioned in the previous point, by opting to hire a car, you get to select a car that will give you the best mileage. If you have a large-sized car, you may want to leave it at home in favor of a rented compact-sized car to get better mileage. On the other hand, if you have a small-sized car but want to take a trip with your whole family, you have the liberty of choosing a car that is the perfect size for you and your loved ones. Additionally, your car might not be able to work efficiently on difficult terrain or you might not want your car to get dirty. As such, renting a car is a favorable option if you want an SUV to go to hilly areas or drive on muddy tracks, or if you want a campervan to go on a special camping trip. By not having the right car, you could get into trouble. You may also have to let go of your dream of going on a trip with all your loved ones in one vehicle. And what fun would camping be if you couldn’t take all your camping gear with you because it wouldn’t fit into your small car? Conclusion By taking these things into consideration, you’re sure to make the right choice between your car and a rented one. Be open to opinions from others but remember that what works for others may or may not work for you. For some people, their own car can be the best choice for a long trip. For those who don’t have the right car, rental car companies can be a blessing. It’s important to hire a car from a reputable rental company though as you don’t want to be cheated in any way. Also be sure to read a rental company’s policies thoroughly. You don’t want to be over-charged for simple mistakes that you could have easily avoided. If you’re already in favor of rental cars, be sure to choose the right type of car as per your needs. By choosing to rent an appropriate car, you can be certain of having a gala time."
5,Sharpen Your Skills and Gain an 887 Visa in Australia,travel-leisure," This kind of visa exists to allow skilled workers that have lived here in Australia for two years the opportunity to stay here permanently. There are a number of jobs that will be in high demand over the next ten years and migrants would be wise to sharpen their skillsets. A recent report by the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency stated that the workforce needs to prepare for a ""competitive, technology driven future."" This all sounds very exciting, but what does it actually mean for migrants and which skills will be in demand? Some Interesting Figures to Consider: The study identified four growth scenarios; they are the Long Boom, the Smart Recovery, the Terms of Trade Shock and the Ring of Fire. Each of these were paired with an economic model to determine what Australia’s working future would look like. The result was a series of four key projections for the country in the years to come: The employed workforce is set to increase up to 3.5 million by 2025. The number of professionals is set to increase by 1 million, which will equate to 38% of the workforce. Australia will have to uplift the labour force participation to at least 69%. There is a need to expand tertiary enrolments by at least 3% annually. The Highest Demand Skills Now: Over the next two years, Australia will need to shift from the current engineering and construction focused workforce to more technical, professional and management positions. It has been identified that the three key growth industries in the next decade will be: Health Care and Social Assistance. Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. Education and Training. The sectors will provide an additional 1.8 million job openings until 2025 at least. For those seeking an 887 visa, Australia offers a prime opportunity to improve qualifications to meet this new demand. The key occupations will be carers, nurses, sales managers, advertising managers, software programmers, accountants, company directors, teachers, electricians, plumbers and real estate agents. The Highest Demand Sector in the Coming Decade: The most in demand group of workers in the next decade will be those with experience in the healthcare industry. There is set to be a growing demand for nurses and carers as the average age of the population rises. There will be a rush to secure places that will be prioritised for those workers that understand and can work with new technology in healthcare. If you need expert help in applying for a Subclass 887 working visa, we can help. At 888 Migration we have a wide range of experience in dealing with visa applications and immigration issues.

6,The Spouse Visa: Australia Bound Migrant Information,travel-leisure," Australia is enjoying an economic boom right now that is attracting people from around the world to come here and work. For many of these migrants, there are better living conditions, fairer laws and an exciting new culture to enjoy. In order to enter the country to work or study it is necessary to apply for and be granted a visa. There are a number of different visas available and one that has become more popular in recent years is the partner visa. What is the Partner or Spouse Visa? This kind of visa exists for Australian citizens and permanent residents here to allow their partners to live with them. Without this visa, it would be difficult for them to enter the country without some kind of marketable skill that is in demand. The Australian citizen or resident must be willing to sponsor their application for an Australian spouse visa. What are the Different Kinds of Spouse Visa? Essentially, there are two different types of relationships that qualify for this kind of visa application. As the name would suggest, this kind of spouse visa is intended for immigrants that are married to an Australian citizen or a permanent resident. The marriage usually occurs in the immigrant's country of origin; a visa is issued, and it is assessed again after a period of two years. If the relationship is still continuing, it is then possible for the immigrant to apply for a permanent residency visa. In order to qualify for this visa, the marriage must be legal and have valid character in the immigrants home nation. This second spouse visa is a permit that allows immigrants that share a stable relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident to live in Australia with their partners. If the relationship remains stable and continues for another two years, the visa can be converted to a permanent residence visa. This reassessment is carried out by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Another Option: There is a third kind of visa known as a Prospective Spouse Migration, and it differs from the previous two spouse visas in a few ways. Firstly, the visa is intended for those people in a relationship with an Australian citizen or permanent resident and that they intend to be married in Australia within nine months from the visa date. Secondly, once the couple has been married, they have the option of then applying for the same partner visa discussed earlier. All the spouse visas we have discussed allow the immigrant to live, study, work and enjoy the health care services in Australia. Limited social security benefits may be available for the visa holder, but there is no access to government subsidies for university studies.

7,Applying for a Partner Visa? Perth Residents Need to Avoid These 7 Common Misconceptions,travel-leisure," It has become increasingly popular for people to enter Australia by applying for a spouse visa. This visa is for people that are engaged to, married to or in a de facto relationship with either an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident or a New Zealand citizen that is eligible. However, there are many misconceptions and false beliefs that many people believe about this kind of visa. Many people believe that a partner visa cannot be obtained unless the couple has a joint bank account. This is not true, as there are more valuable documents that can be presented that will prove that the couple is in a genuine relationship. A solid history, proof of travels together and opinions of others that know about the relationship count for more. A common misconception that many Australian citizens have is that their partners or spouses are automatically entitled to a visa. Actually, for the visa to be granted, proof must be provided that the relationship is genuine and continuing to the exclusion of others. The relevant documents must be presented to provide sufficient evidence. This is the mistaken belief that a person that has failed in their first partner visa Australia application will automatically be subsequently granted a visa. Anyone that has been rejected will still have to provide sufficient evidence for their claims and meet all the necessary requirements. This is simply not true. For those seeking a permanent partner visa, Australia immigration services have no provision for automatic visa approval. Any visa that is approved has to be decided upon by the case officer involved. Many people hold the belief that there is no need to see a migration agent because they understand the immigration process. This may not be true; it could be the case that there are special circumstances that need to be taken into consideration. Remember, it is a complex process to secure migration, and you don’t want a silly mistake on a form to blow your chances. There is a perception that the immigration department understands that people don’t document their relationship until it becomes more serious. This is true to a certain extent, but many fraudulent relationships pop up trying to secure a partner visa. Always document your relationship as early as possible and try to be as honest as possible when presenting evidence. This is not true; it’s a very complicated process to apply for any kind of visa if you have no experience. In order to maximise your chances, use a professional migration agent to guide you through the process. They can ensure that you have all the correct documentation and that your forms are filled out correctly."
8,Information on Fraudulent Migration Agents Perth Bound Applicants Need to Know,travel-leisure," Applying for a visa in Australia can be a complex process for many people to navigate. However, the rules exist to protect Australian society from fraud and prevent unauthorised people gaining entry to our country. In order to make the visa application easier to understand many people use the services of a migration service. Most of these companies are law abiding, and they provide a valuable service, but there are fraudulent firms operating in Australia that should be avoided. The DIAC Warning: The DIAC has issued a warning recently regarding the conduct of migration specialist and future visa applicants. Fraud is treated very seriously in Australia and applicants found guilty of fraud are subject to penalties. These penalties can be a prevention from lodging an application for a period of three years or even a complete exclusion from entering Australia. There is also a code of conduct for migration agents that must be adhered to. At its worst, fraud can include providing fraudulent documents or other misleading information. However, an agent can face severe penalties even if there is no clear intention to commit fraud. The penalties for an agent could result in them being formally de-registered and losing their ability to conduct a migration business. What Constitutes Visa Fraud? People that are intending to migrate to Australia must protect themselves from the potential for fraud. Unscrupulous criminals can disguise themselves as DIAC officials, but there are signs to look out for that a potential fraud may be taking place. An offer of a guaranteed visa that arrives unexpectedly is a sure sign of fraud. A specialist migration company or DIAC will never offer a guaranteed visa. A migrant has to lodge the application and only then will a decision be made depending upon the applicant's ability to comply with the necessary requirements. When paying for a visa application fee, the money should be paid directly to the designated account. A legal migration specialist will never ask for a pre-processing payment. Any subsequent fees will be paid directly to an agency that is authorised by the Australian government or to the migration specialist dealing with the application. There is no need to provide original documents; a legal visa processor only needs certified photocopies. Original documents are only necessary if they are specifically requested by DIAC. A migration specialist will have all the relevant details available and have no need to conceal or provide fake information. Always ensure that your chosen agent has a Migration Agents Registration Number (MARN), an office address, a statement of service, a website and that they offer you a contract."
9,"PCT Training Hike on the Big Piney Trail, Paddy Creek Wilderness, Missouri",travel-leisure," I set out for my first overnight training hike that I have been on since I was on the PCT in May, 2016. Starting at the Roby Lake, Missouri area, I made my way down an unfamiliar trail, with an intentionally overloaded pack. Two tents, two sleeping bags, and just about every piece of gear and trail clothing I own. I didn’t bother to weigh the pack, but it was the heaviest I have ever carried. Some distance into the trail I found a trail register – I stopped to register and was curious to see if I might come across any kindred souls. Nope, not a soul on the trail register for the past 12 days, I would very likely be totally alone. The trail meandered uphill and down, by ponds, and eventually to a nice creek with a small waterfall. Along the way I came to a pine grove atop a ridge and what a mess that was – we recently had freezing rain here in Missouri and it looks like it took out several dozen along the trail – they literally look like they just exploded – with the trail being impassable for about ¼ mile – resulting in some bushwhacking and hopefully me not getting lost. Unlike the PCT where I have Halfmile, Guthooks, and other apps that can tell you that you are 400’ west of the trail, and which direction you need to go to get back on trail, here you just need to pay more attention. When finally done tramping around the blow downs I continued down the trail, and back up on top of another ridge and into some pines. I set up camp about 4:30 PM which would usually be early, but it was dark, cloudy and wet – I wanted to find a decent campsite and took the 2nd one that I thought looked nice. As I set up camp I found I was just above a nice running creek, which made for a nice setting. There was no rain in the forecast but heavy fog came in, which collected on the trees and might as well have been rain. Of course I packed everything, except my rain fly it turned out. Yes I had another tent, but that is my PCT tent and I am not going to chance damaging it before I even get there. I decide it’s not too bad, occasional drips would splatter through the netting but all would be well – and I did have my bivy sack so I put my sleeping bag in there, inside the tent, and made sure most things were covered. There were signs of bear throughout, and I could not locate my paracord rope for hanging my food, so I put the food in my pack, put the pack a ways up a tree, and strapped it on to hope for the best. I had a time getting a campfire going, with everything being wet, but eventually enjoyed a nice campfire until bed time. Unlike being on the PCT where you never really feel alone because there are so many other hikers out there, I knew I was truly alone out here, there were no other footprints in the mud – see the pictures of the trail/river – and this was a bit unusual, really feeling alone and way out there. I enjoyed that. It was one of those nights when every noise piques your curiosity, and every drop falling from the trees landing in leaves sounds like a footstep of some kind – I did hear some animal grunt, possibly a ferel hog, bear, or deer even – couldn’t really tell. Nothing bothered my pack, and all was well in the morning – but much of my gear was wet. I set off back down to the trail head, surprised at how little muscle or back pain I was in considering the workout provided by the trail and the heavy weight I was carrying. I would feel it a bit later however, but that’s a good thing, that’s why I am training – trying to get some sense of trail legs before I hit the PCT exactly 60 days from now! I received my permission to enter Canada, I have my plane tickets, and in 3 more days I will apply for and get my PCT permit for March 21, 2017 – time is flying by… Morgan"

12,Useful Hebrew for Travelers,travel-leisure," Whether you are a first-time visitor or have already been in Israel, learning the local language can be useful. Communicating in a new country requires some knowledge of language and oral expressions, as well as cultural rules. Remember to consider these factors before visiting a foreign country. Some people might tell you that Hebrew is useless, and that most residents of Israel speak English fluently. This may be true if talking about big cities with a huge flow of visitors and foreign residents. In fact, in Israel, and especially in Jerusalem, you can often find someone who speaks English. However, you should upload a translation app to your electronic device, as it could be helpful if you don't find anyone. Even if you have already downloaded some useful translation apps, there can be problems with limited Internet access or a dropped Wi-Fi connection. Anticipating such circumstances, many travelers decide to learn some of the most useful Hebrew phrases. If you still doubt that this is necessary, remember there are many people who don't speak any English at all. These people are often religious, Sephardic Jews, from small towns, working class, older people, part of the Arabic minority, or Jewish immigrants from places like the former Soviet Union. You can often encounter them in Israel, especially if you plan to visit smaller towns and villages. Moreover, knowing some Hebrew can be an icebreaker with Jewish people all around the world. Keep in mind that most foreigners are agreeably surprised when you speak their language. Since Hebrew is closely connected with their religious traditions and cultural history, local Israelis will usually be impressed by your knowledge of the language and will respect your effort to learn it. Here are some useful words and phrases you can use: ""Sababa"" - Sure or no problem ""Aifo HaSherutim"" - Where is the bathroom? ""Efshar Et HaHeshbon"" - Can I have the bill? ""Bevakasha"" - Please ""Shalom"" - Hello , goodbye, peace ""Mayim"" - Water ""Ani lo medaber ivrit"" - I don't speak Hebrew ""Ani lo fryer"" - You can't take advantage of me or I am not gullible ""Mone Bevakasha"" - Please put on the taxi meter ""Kef Chaim"" - Tons of fun That should get you started, and you will be surprised how many phrases you'll pick up during your stay."
13,Business Travelers' Desires and Prospects in 2017,travel-leisure," According to recent research conducted by Booking.com, the expectations of business travelers from their corporate trips are increasing. Nowadays many employees tend to agree to lower salaries and accept a job with business trips instead of high pay. Research has shown that there is growing interest among modern workers in travel and associated new impressions. Forty-nine percent of business travelers confirmed a tendency to extend their business abroad during the past year, with 27 percent admitting a plan to repeat this action in 2017. In fact, a trend among business travelers indicates that 46 percent desire more trips in the upcoming year. ""No longer seen as lost time or a career inconvenience, business travel is increasingly seen as an opportunity to expand horizons, find inspiration, and progress in a career,"" proclaimed director of product development of Booking.com, Ripsy Bandourian. ""Today's laptop and latte breed of employee is increasingly mobile and fluid with their travel plans, looking to strike a balance between business and leisure travel."" When it comes to corporate travel, it is essential to be reminded of the most popular modern business destinations, which are generally located in Asia. Business travel bookings in the region saw a sharp increase over the past 12 months with Shanghai as the unquestioned leader, Tokyo taking second place, followed by Bangkok and Guangzhou. New York was in fifth place (the only U.S. destination on the list) followed by Budapest, Singapore, Hong Kong, Prague, and Amsterdam. In fact, only two of these business destinations boast highly convenient transit times between airport and hotel. Booking.com reports that Singapore Changi Airport has the fastest transit time from airplane to city center accommodations, approximately 45 minutes, which is not a lot. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport also showed nice efficiency, ranking third with about 54 minutes. Munich Franz Josef Strauss Airport, Madrid Barajas Airport, and Berlin Tegel Airport completed the top five airports on the list. Their times range from 49 minutes to 60 minutes. Prompter transit times give travelers more free time for rest and exploration of a destination - something a majority of road warriors strive to do, with 62 percent indicating that they want to do as many activities as possible when visiting a new location. When booking business trips, roughly one-quarter of travelers wait until the last moment, with 23 percent booking a domestic trip within a week of departure, and 24 percent booking international trips within four weeks of departure."
14,Where Do Turtles Go?,travel-leisure," Where do turtles go once the cold weather returns and ice forms over the surface of the water?  Do you know?   There is something about turtles most of us adore.  Kids love them and often have them for pets.  There are at least 263 species of freshwater and terrestrial turtles.  Most of these turtles spend a large amount of their time in water.  Often, we can spot them surfacing at regular intervals to refill their lungs.  All turtles and tortoises breathe air so they can stay under water, but for only a limited period. Turtles have a very long history.  Some fossil findings over the last decade indicate that turtles existed over 220 million years ago.  Over the decades, turtles have adapted quite well to their environment.  Having said this, the turtle population is decreasing at an alarming rate.  Of the 263 species, 117 are considered threatened, with 73 on the endangered or critically endangered list.  As with much of our wildlife, turtles are faced with many threats, including habitat destruction, harvesting actions for food consumption, and capture for the pet industry.  They too need our help. One late spring day I was down by our lake cleaning up some early weed growth.  I found a couple egg shells.  The next thing I saw was a dug-out hole in the sand with many egg shells.  No one was home but it was obviously a recently deserted turtle nest.  I was surprised at how many shells were scattered in and around the hole. All species of turtles are egg layers.  Large numbers of eggs are deposited in sand or mud holes.  The eggs are covered and then deserted, being left to incubate and hatch by themselves.  The gender of the new hatching in many cases, is determined by how cold or warm it is during the incubation stage.  The incubation stage usually last from 70-120 days.  The mother does not return to the nest at any time before or after the little ones are hatched.  There is no parenting within the turtle species.  The little hatchlings are left to make their way to water and then fend on their own. Later that same spring day while washing our car, I noticed a little hatching in the middle of the driveway.  He must have gone the wrong way and was now over 500 yards from the lake and cooking on the hot pavement.  A quick rescue was in order.  Back to the lake he went and within a moment of being placed in the cool water, he swam away.  Happy ending! So back to the ice.  So, what happens when it turns cold?  Have you ever seen a turtle cruising along on the ice of a pond or on land during the harsh winter months?  Turtles hibernate, usually digging into the mud at the bottom of a body of water.  As the water temperature drops below 50 degrees and as low as 39 degrees, turtles seek the muddy bottom.  They bury themselves and in some cases just sit on the mud.  Hibernating turtles take advantage of the fact that water reaches its greatest density at 39 degrees.  This means as temperatures rise and fall, the water at the very bottom of the pond or lake remains around 39 degrees because the densest water falls to the bottom.  The constant temperature ensures the turtle does not freeze and that the temperature of the water does not rise to the point of the turtle requiring extra oxygen.  At this temperature, the turtle’s heart only beat a couple times an hour.  The turtle’s cloaca, back-end plumbing, has finger-like extensions that are abundantly supplied with blood vessels.  The cloaca functions as a substitute lung, allowing the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the surrounding water and the turtle.  It is possible for our little shelled friend to stay in this mode for four or five months.  As soon as the water starts to warm in the spring, turtles return to their active life on land and in the water.  I am looking forward to seeing their little heads popping up above the water surface again in the next few weeks."
15,I am so glad that I took that first walk with my new Snowshoes,travel-leisure," Winter was never my favorite time of year. All I could ever think about was how cold I was, until my husband bought me a pair of snowshoes.  I must admit I was not sure this was the sport for me.  I have never been an outside person in any weather that was colder than short and t-shirt weather.  My sweetie said let’s just give it a try and see how you like it.  We started out slow going to the Hiawatha Trail.  We strapped on our shoes and off we went.  I was amazed at much fun it was.  Not only did I get to spend some time with my husband, but we were getting healthier at the same time. I must admit that I am actually starting to enjoy winter.  I know it sounds odd to hear that from someone like me, but it is true.  I cannot tell you what it has done for toning my arms and legs.  My whole persona is starting to change.  I guess what they say is true that muscle keeps you warmer, because I no longer shiver like dog pooping razor blades. It took me a bit to hit those trails the first time, but since then I have been hooked.  At first we would go on the weekends.  We started out walking for 20 minutes or so.  The times got longer and the laughs got louder.  We spend the time rekindling our love for life on the open trails.   Now we take hikes during the evenings.  I look forward to coming home and grabbing my shoes and communing with nature. Now it does not matter what life has to throw at me.  I take so many more things in stride.  I feel so much more relaxed.  My energy level has increased and I feel great.  We even got our two girls involved.  Can you believe they actually enjoy spending time with the old folks!  It is so nice to tell our friends that we are going snowshoeing with our kids.  They think we are the hip parents now.  I tell them to get some snowshoes for themselves and they can see what a difference it will make in your life. We started to get together and have snowshoeing groups.  We all meet at the trail on Saturday mornings.  We spend the day laughing, sharing and building bonds that create memories that will last a lifetime.  I actually think this is not only one of the best things we could have done for our family, but also one of the best things we could have done for our circle of friends.  We kid each other on ""how far we have come"".  There is a lot of truth to that.  We have made leaps and bounds not only in our friendships but also in our physical and emotional health. I always thought of snowshoeing as something the super athletic do.  I have noticed that all types of people love this sport from the young to the spunky adults.  I am so glad that I took that first walk with my new Snowshoes."
16,5 Confounding Aspects of Vietnam & Cambodia,travel-leisure," 5 Confounding Aspects of Vietnam & Cambodia A trip to South East Asia can be daunting for those who are worried about the language barriers, but it turns out that there are lots of tourists from other countries and continents that will make a visit. In 2015, research data showed that the top 10 source of visitors to Asia are China, EU, Japan, Australia, Korea, USA, India, Taiwan, and Russian. But what is there to do in South East Asia? I’d like to tell you a little about Vietnam and Cambodia specifically, and I’m sure you’ll be amazed at what these amazing countries have to offer! Beaches and Bays Cambodia rocks their Otres beach while Vietnam boasts the amazing Halong Bay in its northern parts. Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World heritage Site and consists of natural limestone formations that have been estimated to have been through 500 million years of formation. It serves as a tropical evergreen, oceanic and sea shore system, homing 14 floral and 60 faunal species which are only found in that area. The community of people in Ha Long Bay are distributed across 4 fishing villages, made up of floating houses. There are 989 islands in Ha Long Bay! Culture In Vietnam you’ll get to learn more about the culture just by immersing yourself in the streets. Visit Hoi An Ancient Town, a well-preserved trading port dating back to the 15th century, or the Old Quarter in Hanoi where you’ll be taken back in time to how Vietnamese culture was like. Cambodia has lots of old architectural structures that are symbolic to Khmer culture. The Angkor Wat in Phnom Penh, the many other temples, plantations, and farms are great options for getting to know about the different lifestyles in the area. Cuisine It is a must to try amok, which is a popular Khmer dish. There’s also lots of tropical fruits, noodles, and for the adventurous foodies, there’s fried spiders. Street foods in Vietnam will also beat your expectations with nem cuon, pho, bun bo hue and many more being popular dishes. History Cambodia has lots of rural style houses and Angkorian style temples that were built from stone. Angkor Archaeological Park, Choeung Ek Genocidal Center and the Cambodia Landmine Museum are among some of the best museums to visit in Cambodia to learn about the history of the country. In Vietnam, there’s the War Remnants Museum and Vietnam Museum of Ethnology which will get you learning about the past and its people. Nature The Cu Chi Tunnels, Paradise Cave, Phong Nha Caves and Mua Caves… There’s no shortage of caves in Vietnam in addition to its bays and beaches such as Non Nuoc Beach and the Marble Mountains. In Cambodia, you’ll see trees growing into old structures such as the Ta Prohm Temple, and there’s also Battambang Bat Caves located at the top of a mountain, with millions of bats. The Elephant Valley Project is also a great sanctuary to visit if you’d like to observe elephants in their natural habitat without disturbing them. The interesting cultures, amazing scenery, great food and the possibility of doing all of this on a low budget, Vietnam and Cambodia are perfect destinations for the solo traveler. IIf backpacking is not your thing though, there are plenty of Southeast Asian tours available that will keep you busy while not having to do all the planning!"
17,"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly: Living Abroad in Thailand",travel-leisure," This is my post about the best countries to check out for those looking to live abroad. I try to cover more than just statistics in these posts to give you an idea of what it really would be like to live there. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly… Thailand is renowned for being one of the most beautiful places in the world. Its beaches are unparalleled and the wildlife is some of the most diverse on Earth. It has long been an ideal place for westerners to vacation, but more and more it’s becoming a place where college students, retirees, and expats are choosing to take up residence. And it’s not just for the clear waters and ridiculously green scenery. Of course, there are some less-than-pleasant things about living in Thailand which anyone considering moving there should take into consideration. So let’s look at The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of living in Thailand. The Good Adjusting to the Culture and People Thai people are normally very friendly and open. Many of them also speak English so language barriers won’t be quite as hard to overcome as in some other countries. Westerners moving to Thailand may be surprised by how easy it is to make new friends in such a dramatically different cultural environment. Oftentimes foreigners moving to Thailand even express the feeling that their quality of life has improved. One author describes her experiences (here) with the cultural differences when it comes to the roles of women, saying that she often received blank stares and confusion when she attempted to explain that she was happily single. Some conversations even ending (in the nicest possible way) with the Thai people coming to only logical conclusion for her unfortunate single status: she must like women. Cost of Living Thailand is also very cheap compared to western living – in most respects anyway. Unfortunately wine, imported goods, and electricity are among the amenities that can be very expensive. But when you balance that with the fact that it’s usually far cheaper to eat out than to cook at home, and that you can now afford to rent a larger property with hired help, the higher price of a hangover and lighting might not be as much of an issue. Hell, who really needs lighting anyways? Get some wine and candles and call it good! Just kidding, the pricing isn’t really that bad – although you can definitely end up paying 3 times the price for imported goods, so bring as much stuff from home as you can. You can purchase everything you need in Thailand, but the quality isn’t always reliable, and depending on whether you’re in a city or small town, not everything will be readily available. Safety and Health Safety isn’t a big issue in Thailand. There is petty theft, and like anywhere there is more crime in bigger cities. If you are particularly concerned about break-ins you may be able to arrange for a police patrol to make regular stops at your residence – for a small compensation of course. The healthcare standards in Thailand are similar to what’s available in most modern societies, health insurance is available for those who want it. Good-to-Know When you do feel inclined to grab some food for your house check out the street markets (the earlier in the day the better) and get some fresh fruits, veggies, and meats. The Bad Foreigners generally cannot own property in Thailand. Only rent. Safety and Health Petty theft If you drive in Thailand you will be stopped by the police. Driving in Thailand is scary (and possibly the most dangerous part of living there) and traffic laws are not a concern. The police aren’t stopping you because you actually violated a law – they are looking for ""tea money."" Pay it. Get used to it. About 300 Baht (roughly $10) should work. The health codes in Thailand can be another source of concern. They are not going to be what most westerners are used to, but that doesn’t mean that you’re going to get sick from eating local food. For the most part, you should be fine, although you might have some stomach trouble while getting used to the new cuisine. If you are really concerned about health, get health insurance as soon as you arrive. Otherwise, you can pay as need be, but you will normally receive better service if you’ve purchased health insurance. Finding Work For foreigners, finding work in Thailand can be very difficult. The system is structured to support local workers, not foreigners. Even if you want to build a business that could help the local economy, you’re probably setting yourself up for failure. So, unless you really know what you’re doing, plan on either having work set up before you make the move, or having an alternative source of income – retirement savings, business that can be conducted over long distance… or your very own travel website… as a for-instance. Good-to-Know The Thai street dogs are NOT your friends. Do NOT try to make friends. You will NOT have anymore fingers. Just kidding! No. But really – no touching. Thailand is hot and humid. It’s tropical. Get used to it. The whiter you are, the better. No I’m not going all Aryan Brotherhood on you; pale skin is considered beautiful in Thailand, and unfortunately that means a lot of beauty products have bleach in them. Many Asian women completely destroy their skin from this. One of these days maybe we’ll all see natural as beautiful, but for now all I can say is – wtf? Sometimes Thai people park 3 cars deep and leave their car in neutral so the person who needs to get a car out can push their car out of the way. True story. You get in a car accident, it’s your fault. Why? Because you’re foreign and if you weren’t there, there wouldn’t have been an accident. The Ugly It’s illegal to step on any kind of Thai currency because it’s considered extremely disrespectful to their King. Although prostitution is technically illegal in Thailand, the laws aren’t really enforced. As a result there is an extremely high rate of sex-trafficking – including that of children"
18,Historic Colonial Williamsburg,travel-leisure," Historic Colonial Williamsburg Historic Colonial Williamsburg  has more than you think. When visitors come to Williamsburg on vacation for the first time they think, they can see everything in a few hours. And they also think this popular destination is nothing more than an attraction town. I have seen disoriented guests arrive at the museum’s visitor center without any idea of what is really going on.  I guess the joke is on them because it is a 2 day event  to see everything. Wait until you come to here to get you discounted attraction tickets in Williamsburg as you can find some for free. There’s a reason why 68% of visitors who travel here have to repeat their visit because of a lack planning. There are days , not hours’ worth of things to do here in Colonial Williamsburg. Guests drive in anticipating to see a good honest-to-god forged ""frontier settlement"". And where they can spend 10 moments watching the small town smithy make a horseshoe and get on their way. However they are in for something of an awakening. A reconstructed city The reconstructed city of Williamsburg seats on approximately 75 acres. It stretches out a mile long and about half a mile wide. Upon this patch of property are 100s of buildings. Eighty-eight of these are originals geological dating to assorted periods in colonial history. The other buildings are reconstructed. They are built on records and archaeological evidence as nearly as realistic as possible. From the 18th century back to life. Walking down Duke of Gloucester Street in the middle of the day, you are not in a museum any longer, you’re in a real town from 1775. When you stop to ask why Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia is such a favorite resort destination, remember that along with Busch Gardens, Jamestown, all the outstanding golf courses.. The tradesmen are experts in their selected fields in all the world. They are there to aid and bring the ghosts of Williamsburg to life. These ""translators"" stand between visitors and a world that would differently be foreign to them. Their occupation is, to interpret the world of 18th century Williamsburg so that every visitor is able to experience what the museum has to offer So if you are one of those who think ""We’ll just take an hour and see Williamsburg,""you are mistaken. You better plan on another visit if that is what you are thinking. There is really a lot going on in Williamsburg, and you really want to see it all. We are not only about history but have different attractions like Water Country USA and Busch Gardens just to name a few."

1,Key things to consider when choosing a venue for hire,travel-leisure," Every day, there are multiple events that happen in various places of the world. Most of these events are very official and therefore, the organizers must look for appropriate venues. It is always not easy to select the best venue. You will come across hundreds of them and from these multiple options, you will be required to select only one. To avoid stress therefore, there are a few things you can consider. The cost of hire: Before you do anything else, you have to look at the cost of hiring the venue. The decision on whether you pay for it or not depends on the amount of money you have put aside on the budget for hiring the venue. Moreover, you may want to allow more room for other things such as foods and drinks and this therefore means that, you avert from the venues that are more expensive. However, negotiating with the venue owner is allowed if you want to pay less amount for the same. Since there are venues for hire in Auckland at different costs, you must be certain about the one you need. The location: Unless you want a long distance travel, it is always appropriate to choose a venue that is closer to you. This is important because people can save on the transport costs and spend the rest of the money on important things. However, there may be cases where those attending the event may want to travel over long distances. In this case, you can opt for a venue far from you in order to impress them. If the attendees are fewer in number, you will then be required to choose a room in a hotel but with an ample space. The ambiance: You do not just choose a venue blindly or simply because someone else chose it a few days ago. You must be sure of want you really need if you want to be happy with your event. For instance, you can look at the way the room has been designed, the color of the walls and the general décor to see whether it satisfies your tastes and preferences or not. Different events always require different venues. If you choose a wrong venue therefore, the attendees may not be satisfied with you. Function venues in Auckland are multiple and therefore, you need to plan first with the experts before you can make any decision. Services and amenities: People are highly predisposed to things such as diseases and therefore, you have to provide means through which they can get aid should any uncertainty occur. In this case therefore, a presence of a hospital in the vicinity may be among your top choices. Other important things that are required include the kitchen for cooking the meals for attendees, presence of cleans chairs and tables to provide ample space and comfort while in the room among other things. If all these are available, nothing should hinder you back from choosing the room."
2,Limpy the Mallard,travel-leisure," Last spring a female mallard decided to turn our deck flower pot, tucked under an overhang, into her nursery.  Nesting is a stressful and tiresome period for the female mallard, as she lays more than half her body weight in eggs.  We counted 11 eggs in her clutch that were incubated for 28 days and then began hatching at 50-55 days.  All but two successfully became little fuzzy yellow hatch-lings. Our mother mallard was remarkably patient during the nesting period, leaving only at dusk to meet her awaiting mate in our cove.  Each evening they would swim off together and likely feed until just dark.  Then she would carefully fly back to her protected nest.  We enjoyed watching her up close each day through our glass door about eight feet away.  She would see us yet seemed to know there was no threat. Early one spring morning around day 50 before leaving for work, I decided to check on mother mallard.  As usual there she was, sitting perched atop her feathery nest.  We made eye contact and then it was time to go.  When I returned at noon for lunch I checked in on her again and she was gone.  She was nowhere to be found or so I thought.  I quietly walked over to the nest.  To my surprise, I discovered only two eggs and a scattering of broken shells.  The others had hatched and somehow made it off my second story deck.  For weeks, I had been fretting about the hatch-lings falling off into the gardens below.  Thankfully there were no signs of trouble. After making lunch, I decided to enjoy the warm spring sunshine and eat by the water in a chair on the beach.  As I walked down the stone steps to the beach I noticed a little splashing activity next to our lake rock wall.  To my amazement, there were mother and father mallard with their new family having a first swimming lesson!  Perfect timing.  They were so proud of their beautiful little ones paddling around.  I was sure they were showing them off for a few minutes, before swimming around our dock and heading out to the open cove water. Ducklings instinctively stay near their mother due to something called filial imprinting.  Not only does she provide warmth and protection, but teaches them about their habitat, and how and where to forage for food.  Once matured into flight-capable juveniles around three or four months of age, they will learn and remember their traditional migratory routes.  After this important lesson, the juveniles and mother may or may not stay together until the next breeding season. Our ducklings and parents happily made our cove their new home.  With our hanging deck bird-feeders providing daily seed spills in the grass below, they enjoyed snacks and napping afterwards in the sun until mother mallard announced it was time to head to the lake again.  One little duckling always seemed to trail behind.  A leg stuck out to the side and caused a limp when she walked.  I wondered if it was a result of falling out of the nesting pot or off the high deck. Limpy, as I affectionately called her, and I soon became friends.  She was frequently alone.  After becoming used to me by the house and on the beach, she let me get close on the dock, while swimming nearby.  She liked to quack and chat as she paddled about.  I would chat back.  The other ducklings didn’t include Limpy in their swimming or seed feeding activities.  Limpy had to wait patiently to the side until they were finished.  She would quack and quack, calling to her siblings, only to be ignored.  It was hard to see her shunned by the others.  Mother mallard was busy keeping track of everyone too, and had little time for waiting around for Limpy. Developmentally Limpy never quite grew to typical mallard size of 20 – 26"" long and 1.5-3.5 pounds.  Mallards reach maturity at 14 months with an average life expectancy of three years.  Some have been known to live to a ripe old age of 20!  During her first year Limpy did grow beautiful chocolate brown feathers and an orange and black bill. Limpy and her family happily remained in and around our cove throughout the summer until the chilly winds of autumn returned.  Mallards winter on our lake, as the various springs usually provide open water.  Most winters Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg, also known as Webster Lake, freezes.  This year most the lake was frozen, but around our little cove island there was an open patch of fresh water.  Ducks congregated each day to swim, eat and socialize in and out of the water on the ice. One morning a bald eagle was on the ice, in the area, of the open water.  There are a pair of bald eagles who make a larger island their home and they had two eaglets, so it wasn’t surprising.  However, when I heard the news from the Webster Lake Association that an eagle had been spotted eating an injured duck, I immediately thought of little Limpy. The following summer came and went without a visit from my young mallard friend.  Mallards of all ages must contend with a wide variety of predators.  The most prolific are red foxes and the faster birds of prey, from hen harriers and short-eared owls to huge bald and golden eagles.  The circle of life…  Fortunately, each year the cycle begins again.  Perhaps our wooden barrel planters will be the next nursery.  We shall see."
3,Musky Rodent Happenings,travel-leisure," Early one December morning while sipping my first coffee, I spotted a small dark shape struggling on our newly nearly frozen lake.  After further observations, I discovered it was a muskrat attempting to make his way from the little island in front of my cove to the nearby shore.  Every few steps the poor little fellow would sink through the ice and cling to the edge, struggling to make his way back up and out.  Once back on his feet, off he would quickly scamper with long tail pointing to the heavens, until again back into the water he would go.  This hurry up and sink dance repeated itself countless times until the determined little guy safely made it to shore.  Most impressive!  So much so, that it inspired me to learn more about our local muskrats, here on Lake Chaubunagungamaug in Webster, Massachusetts. The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) gets its common name from a resemblance to stocky, medium sized rodents, along with their musky odor from scent glands used to mark their territory.  Muskrats weigh between 2 to 4 pounds and are typically 18 to 25 inches long with a flat, sparsely haired (scaled) tail that measures between 8 to 11 inches. They are covered with a short, thick brown fur that is doubled layered to help protect them from cold water. Most of the time the muskrat can be found in the water, swimming underneath up to 17 minutes at a time.  They can close off their ears keeping water out, have semi webbed hind feet and a strong tail that propels.  When walking on land their tail drags behind them, making it easy to spot their distinctive tracks, especially in the snow. Muskrats are semi-aquatic, most active at night or near dawn and dusk, with an adaptable lifestyle native to North America.  They are most commonly found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. Specifically, they make their homes throughout still or slow moving waters that include freshwater marshes, beaver ponds, reservoirs, canals and borders of lakes and rivers.  The muskrat's den includes a short tunnel that leads upward from below the water to dry soil.  Sometimes there are complex chambers with multiple entrances and even air ducts.  They also build lodges in open water around 2 to 4 feet deep, up high enough to keep the den dry. Food sources for the muskrat include a variety of plants, cattails, bulrush, arrowhead, water lilies, pond weed, clover, ferns and other crops if they are within their territory.  When plant varieties are scarce they will also dine on shellfish, snails, fish, salamanders, and frogs.  Normally they feed within 150 feet of their primary dwelling when food is abundant, although they will travel much further if necessary.  My lake (and yard) offer most of these, making it a perfect location for the muskrat to live and thrive. Most muskrats make a valuable contribution to aquatic communities.  By harvesting plants for not only food, but their dens, they create open water space for ducks, geese, birds and other native wildlife.  Other animals and reptiles will periodically share the muskrat's den or lodge to rest and even nest.  Having said that, many of our lake neighbors consider the muskrat a pest, as they have been caught chewing through plastic floating docks, rafts, moorings and even boat ties.  They can also damage dams and dikes when over burrowing or eating early sprouting crops, such as my tender young sunflowers near our beach.  Muskrats are not climbers, so if we want to protect our beautiful waterfront garden we will need a fence staked at least a foot below ground, as they are determined diggers.  One more project for spring!"
4,Eagle Islands,travel-leisure," It was a clear, warm summer afternoon on Lake Chaubunagungamaug in Webster, Massachusetts.  We were anchored in a quiet cove, playing a lively game of cribbage when I spotted a pair of eagles soaring high above us.  It was as if they were playing a game of tag.  Then suddenly one of the eagles headed straight down into the water and came back up with a big fish in its beak.  He flew to a tall bushy pine tree nearby to enjoy his fresh catch. These are the special lake moments that many of us have come to look forward to in summer.  Each spring at least one pair of bald eagles return to nest here, on one of the lake’s many small islands.  Webster Lake, the other more ""speaker friendly"" name, is located near the corners of Connecticut and Rhode Island and has a surface area of 1,442 acres.  The lake’s original name comes from Nipmuc, an Algonquian language and is frequently said to mean ""You fish on your side, I fish on my side and no one fish in the middle."".  Another translation according to anthropologist Ives Goddard, is ""lake divided by islands"".  Given the size of Webster Lake, locals refer to its’ three connected bodies of water as North, Middle and South ponds. Webster Lake also goes by an even longer, 45-letter alternative name, ""Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg"" that was thought to be coined around 1921.  It is frequently cited as the longest place name in the United States and one of the longest in the world!  Many of our long-time resident neighbors are proud to roll the exaggerated name off of their tongues with ease and finesse.  I am still working on it. Today there are an estimated 7,066 nesting pairs of bald eagles, according to US wildlife experts. An eagle can live up to 30 years in the wild, with many decades to produce offspring.  Their nests or aerie, are found high in large, strong trees near rivers, coasts or on lakes.  The nest shape can be cylindrical, disk, bowl or inverted cone depending on which branch point it’s built.  Typically, the nest is about five feet in diameter.  A nesting pair often return to use the same nest year after year.  When doing so, they tend to reinforce the nest structure, as strong winds or storms often take a toll.  As you can imagine, over time the nest can get as large as nine feet in diameter, weighing nearly two tons!  Eagles have also been known to build a second nest nearby if they feel threatened.  On Webster Lake our pair have a massive nest on a single residence island in South Pond and another smaller (newer) nest on an island in Middle Pond. Eagles lay one to three speckled, off-white colored eggs about goose egg size, one day at a time.  In our New England area egg laying starts in late March.  Then it takes 35 days of incubation duties shared by both parents.  The female spends the most time on the nest, not only keeping the eggs warm, but to protect from intruders such as squirrels, ravens and gulls who will eat the eggs.  Interestingly, the male habitually brings green sprigs of fresh conifer branches to the nest during the incubation period.  To date experts have not determined why, other than to possibly deodorize the nest or provide shade for the eaglets.  The cycle from the time parents build the nest to when the young are on their own is about 20 weeks.  The parents remain within one to two miles of their nest during this cycle. Human disturbance can have a negative impact on the bald eagle, as most require privacy and quiet to breed and raise their young.  The Webster Lake Association (WLA) has a home webcam on the nest of our local pair.  From the comfort of his home, a WLA member watches and regularly reports the eagles’ many activities in a newsletter.  Those of us out on the water in our boats and kayaks enjoy spotting the eagles and letting the WLA know of their whereabouts.  We even have a fun contest each spring to name the new eaglet(s), with Independence, George and Martha and Liberty being a few of the most recent winners.  Last spring one of our eaglets was injured during the banding process.  The year before one of the young fell out of the nest and had to be rescued.  Both eaglets survived, however last summer our nesting adult pair left their large, original nest and were repeatedly spotted in Middle Pond by their smaller nest, likely a result of these traumatic experiences.  It is predicted they will relocate there to safely raise their young next spring.  We shall see."
5,Fall to Winter - Water to Ice,travel-leisure," There is no doubt fall has left and winter has arrived.  Our deciduous trees have shed their leaves.  Early morning frost and warm days have turned to frozen ground and bone chilling winds.  Activity on our lake is represented by a few ducks splashing in the slightly warmer creek fed waters.  As the days pass, a thin coating of ice will begin to form around the shoreline and eventually across the various coves.  Soon the lake will be covered with winter ice increasing in thickness by each passing day.   As the ice thickens, so does the excitement level of our ice fisherman!  Yes, it is time to put those augers, tip-ups, spears and light fishing gear back to work. We are anxious to get out on the ice.  Is it thick enough?  Ice fishing is one of the most dangerous methods of fishing.  Caution must be taken, especially when we are so eager to get started.  There have been many accidents on our lake.  Unfortunate stories have been told of hummers, trucks, cars, snowmobiles, animals and of course people breaking through the ice.   A sure way to start the season off on the wrong foot.  Some fisherman risk walking on ice at two and a half inches, when experts recommend a minimum of four inches.  Ice thickness varies, especially in lakes with greatly varying depths.  Our lake can drop twenty feet in a lateral distance of eight feet.  This means the ice thickness will vary greatly early in the season.  Six inches is recommended for sleds and snow mobiles.  Ten inches for smaller vehicles and at least 16 solid inches for full sized trucks.   In our seven years on the lake, the ice thickness was over 10 inches only once. There are other risks to be aware of when out on the ice.  Frostbite can occur from prolonged exposure to wind and the low temperatures.  Proper winter clothing is essential.  These days there are great huts, tents and shelters that can be quickly erected for escape from the harsh temperatures and biting winds.  Some ice fishermen have more permanent shelters, usually on wheels, that can be towed onto the ice.  These shelters often have bathrooms, stoves, beds and even satellite television.  If you have a shelter with heat, proper ventilation is critical.  Some fishermen lost their lives on the ice due to carbon monoxide poisoning.  The greatest risk and most deaths have occurred from hypothermia.  This is when the body temperature falls too low.  It is important to educate yourself on hypothermia and all the other potential risks prior to heading out onto the ice.  The goal is to have fun and be safe! Time to fish.  There are many different approaches to ice fishing.  All approaches have some factors in common.  Fish do not expend much energy under the ice.   No need to have your bait do so either.  In fact, too much motion will actually deter the fish.  Depth is critical.  Do a little research prior to heading out on the ice.  The species of fish determines the depth of the fish.  For example, crappie and bass will be found at different depths.  This is one time a bobber is important.  Use a slip bobber to set the proper depth.  The bobber will also serve as a good visual for when there is action below.  Fishing for bluegills and perch?  Send the bait to the bottom.  Some bouncing action will entice them to your bait.  Chum is a good way to attract some attention too.  This activity created by other fish feeding can draw lower energy fish to the site.  In shallow waters, it is a good idea to cover your hole.  Light penetrating thru the hole can scare fish away from your bait.  There you have it - the rest is up to you.  Have fun and catch some fish!"
6,The Most Festive Cities To Travel Over Christmas,travel-leisure," With Christmas coming up, festivities around the world are well and truly beginning to take over. Christmas is a time for tradition, with different cities and cultures celebrating it in all manner of ways. Even though everyone has their own traditions, why not try something new? Experience a new taste of Christmas, or try out some of the more unique traditions across the globe. So if you fancy some sun, or maybe even just some fantastic lights, there are some wonderful places for you to visit at Christmas. London, England One of the most vibrant and exhilarating cities to visit during Christmas. The city comes to life during the festive period. You can forget the hustle and bustle, simply becoming engulfed with the feel-good factor. The whole city gets decorated, packed full of lights and trees. With markets galore, there’s a great opportunity to get stuck into some street food, and try out some authentic English cuisine. If there’s one place in particular to be in London, check out Hyde Park. The whole place transforms into a complete ‘Winter Wonderland. ’ Barcelona, Catalonia Sick of the freezing cold? Barcelona is the place to go. It’s a break from the bad weather but isn’t too hot. During the festive period, the place is completely transformed. If you fancy a break from the old roast dinner, then the Spanish certainly know how to feed you. Christmas food, usually consists of seafood, tortilla de patatas, croquettes and caldo con delotas. It’s a world away from turkey! If you can stay until the 5th of January, then you’re in for a treat. The city puts on an enormous parade, celebrating the three Kings, Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspar. The three go through the city, with cannons, fireworks and even camel’s joining them. New York, America Already a fantastic place to visit, but during Christmas there is simply no place like it. The whole city is lit up, with free ice skating rinks set up in Central Park along with an enormous tree, which has been going up for 84 years. There’s street stores galore and simply no better place to do your Christmas shopping. If you really want to feel the Christmas vibe of New York, grab yourself a pretzel and head to Central Park, the spectacles there will simply blow your mind. Reykjavik, Iceland If you need a break from the usual Christmas celebrations, then this is the place to go. Iceland has a few peculiarities to say the least. The décor is slightly different to what you might usually expect! 13 ‘Yuletide Lad’s’ which are effectively scruffy Santas supposedly bring gits to 13 well behaved children, during the 13 nights which lead up to Christmas. The main pull for this fantastic city in Iceland, however, is surely set to be the magnificent Northern lights. On top of the brilliant decorations, they truly do make it an extraordinary place. Salzburg, Austria Salzburg in Austria has recently become a very famous city. But not for the most conventional event! A recent Christmas/horror film called Krampus is based on a famous tradition from Salzburg. Across Austria and parts of Bavaria, people dress up as the terrifying alpine bests, which search the streets for naughty children. Apart from the rampaging monsters, Salzburg is a wonderful place to visit come the festive period. Filled with stalls and home to the perfect box of chocolates. The city is also home to the memorable hymn ‘silent night.’ There are plenty more which could have been included on the list, with so many famous cities having their own unique set of traditions. But for Christmas beauty and pure theatre, these are the places to go!"

10,Timeshare Advice,travel-leisure," Timeshare Advice Timeshare advice is more than just resort information. I am not sure if you know this or not but the hotels you stay in are really timeshares. Let me explain about timeshare advice, you call up and rent a room at a hotel. Then you stay there for a week and when your time is up, you check out of your little room. Also you pay for the time you spent staying there. Then as soon as you go out the door someone else rents that same room 51 more times. . So you helped pay for that hotel by spending your time and hard earned money there while on vacation. Bottom line is you share time in that hotel for one week and then others shared the same room . Would the hotel make money if they only had one room? No but if they had 400 rooms’ times 52 weeks times 700.00 do you think they would do alright? If you go to a hotel or even if you rent a resort it may cost you at least 700.00 a week, i am not sure how old you are but i am 70 and over those 70 years i went on at least 2 vacations a year for 48 years and with inflation over the years i would have spent at least 98,000.00 in accommodation fees and if I rented a room at a Hotel all i would have gotten is a bill for the time i rented so pay attention to this good timeshare advice. Time Share With timeshare ownership like Westgate Colonial Williamsburg you put pay much less into ownership just like a home, not a renter. So what can you do as an owner that a renter cannot do? Well you can rent it, exchange it every year to go to other vacation destinations, use it, sell it or will it. So that is how I can sell it so cheap because someone else helped pay it off. Hope that helps you understands, and why you need a lot of resorts to make any money at all. I learned this the hard way and at the closing years of my lifetime I plan on using a few of these with family and friends. In closing let me say this, I would rather take my family to a Luxury timeshare Resort any day of the week than to stay in a small 1 bedroom bug ridden hotel where they keep their coffee pot in the bathroom. After busting your butt all year the one week you are off, you deserve to enjoy your week in comfort and luxury so you can dream about your next vacation. Rattling Along Sorry I rattled on so much but maybe this helps you understand why I had so many and whiter you are in I am not sure if you know this or not but the hotels are really timeshares but not resorts. If you go to a hotel or even if you rent a timeshare resort it may cost you at least 700.00 a week, i am not sure how old you are but i am 68. Over those 68 years i went on at least 2 vacations a year for 48 years and with inflation over the years i would have spent at least $98,000.00 in accommodation fees that i left the Hotels all got is a bill for the time i rented. I could have put that money in being and owner not a renter. So what can you do as an owner of a timeshare that a renter can’t? Well you can rent it, exchange it every year, use it, sell it and will it to one your children. So that is how I can sell it so cheap because someone else paid it off. Hope that helps you understands where i am at and why you need a lot rentals to make any money at all. Interested or not I have always treated people with courtesy and respect and hope you have a great time on your next vacation."
11,A Great Stay At Westgate Resorts,travel-leisure," A Great Stay At Westgate Resorts a short testimonial ! We visited Westgate resorts and spa  during the week of March 10-17, 2013. It was a beautiful week with cool nights and warm, sunny days, so I cannot comment on the A/C. We left the windows open and enjoyed the fresh air. The 2 BR condo was spacious, easily accommodations a family of 4-6, but rated for 8-10!. We were only 2! The 2nd BR had 2 true double beds (not twins). The sleeper sofa in the LR could sleep another 2 but this arrangement would ruin the spacious, open feel of the condo, which I loved. Our Westgate resorts unit was located in Building 6 which was easily accessed from either entrance to the property. Parking (free) was never a problem during our week. I liked that Building 6 had easy access to the biggest of the many pools and we overlooked this pool from our balcony on the top floor. We faced west and enjoyed sunset views from our screened and furnished balcony. A great treat. We could not see the Big Sand Lake from Building 6 but the pool view after dark was very pleasant with lots of landscape lighting. The master bath was great, and special, with a shower and separate Jacuzzi that had a 2 step surround and was at least 6 ft x 6 ft. More on the room There was a private room for the toilet. The king bed was comfortable. The upholstered easy chair was also comfortable. There was plenty of natural light from the balcony which you could enter privately. There was also access to the balcony from the LR. The balcony was spacious. Easily enough room for the padded recliner that you could extend in either direction. The room was equipped with a dining table and 4 chairs that were standard issue. The 5 paddle ceiling fan was never needed. We ate late dinners and early breakfasts out on the balcony every day. Loved it (and the wonderful weather that we were blessed with). March weather in Orlando can be nasty. I liked the design of the Westgate resorts condo that allowed the 2nd bath to be accessed from either the 2nd BR or from the hall (yes, 2 entrance doors). It was a full bath too, with a shower/bathtub combination. Nice size sink/vanity area too, with good lighting and ventilation. The Kitchen The kitchen was fully equipped and we put it to the test, cooking every night. The laundry was located in a convenient closet behind the kitchen with shelving and full size washer and dryer. The condition of all appliances in our condo was near new. The full size refrigerator included an efficient ice making freezer. The oven, microwave, and garbage disposal all worked properly. The base cabinets were cheap plywood and the doors didn’t align. No big deal to me. Our only maintenance call while on vacation at Westgate Resorts involved the electric stove top element which was quickly replaced. I asked for a roasting tray and received a brand new one still in the shrink wrap within 20 minutes of my phone call. The 50 inch TV in the LR was a great treat. There were smaller TVs in each bedroom. I cannot recall if any of them were flat screen. Summary- Westgate Resorts have a winner in this property. The location is convenient to everything and especially to the I-4 in both directions. There is a Super Walmart only a few minutes away. Many restaurants are in the area too and lots of shopping. We had rented a car so I have no comment about the free shuttle services that are provided. You cannot easily walk to anything that is off the Westgate Property so keep this in mind in case you intend to not rent a car. I found the Westgate Resorts Staff at this location to be very friendly, even cheerful. The many high rise buildings looked to be in good shape. The lobby area was tastefully set up. I visited many of the pools and each was clean and there were plenty of recliners and chairs and umbrellas. The Grounds Landscaping was mature and tasteful. The hardscape was very well maintained, showing lots of update activity. The walkways along the lake was a great treat for early morning walks, and the grill areas looked to be in good shape too, although I did not use any, as they were located far away from our building. The location of a grill located at lakeside in a beautiful wooded setting was a destination that I added to my ""next time"" to do list! At our Westgate resorts there was a weekly calendar of activities provided that included many pool games, exercise classes, kids stuff, etc. We did not use the spa so we cannot comment on that. Also did not use the tennis courts, miniature golf course, fishing rods, paddle boats, jet skies, wave runners, and canoes that are free if you are an owner but a good value otherwise. We did take advantage of the early AM breakfast buffet deal held at the Smokehouse Grill on campus. An excellent value. I enjoyed our week at Westgate Resorts Lakes and hope to return. I traded using DRI points and now we are heading for Virginia Beach. Thanks for reading my review. Hope it helps you plan your next vacation."
12,Air Travel and Pets,travel-leisure," Air Travel and Pets Do you have to travel by air in the near future?  If you do, are you a pet owner who needs to bring your pet along with you?  Although most of us leave our pets at home, you may not want to do so or your purpose for travel may be to move, as opposed to taking a fun filled vacation.  Regardless of your reasons for wanting or needing to travel with your pet or pets, there are a number of important points that you will need to keep in mind. The first step in traveling with a pet is to make sure that you can do so.  Although a good number of airlines will allow pets on their planes, not all will. You may be in a predicament if you plan to depart from a small airport with only one or two airlines.  If they do not accept pets or if their rules and restrictions are too much for you to handle, you will want to examine other nearby airports, especially those that are larger in size. When traveling by air with your pet or pets, it is important to remember that you will be charged an additional fee.  Unfortunately, many first time pet travelers believe that they can use their pets and their pet carriers to count towards as a carry-on bag or a checked bag.  This isn’t how it works though.  You will, almost always, be charged an extra fee for traveling with a pet.  This extra fee will likely depend on the airline in question and well as your pet’s location, such as in the cabin or in the baggage compartment. That leads to another important point.  Even with some of the airlines that allow pets, like cats and dogs, aboard their flights, not all allow pets to be in the cabin with other passengers.  This is particularly common on small planes where allergies may be a big concern.  If you cannot part with your pet, be sure to search for an airline that will allow you to keep him or her in the cabin with you.  With that said, remember that the size of your pet will also play a huge factor in your options. Regardless of where your pet is stored for the plane ride, you will need to have a pet carrier or crate for them.  Many airlines have specific rules and restrictions on what type can be used.  Resections often include materials used, as well as size.  Most will provide you with that information when asked.  Speaking of pet crates and carriers, it is important to make sure that you give your pet enough room to stand and move around a little bit.  In fact, most airlines will refuse to transport pets that they feel are unsafe from small pet crates and carriers. It is also important to make sure that you get your pet checked by their vet.  You will want to make sure that your pet has all required vaccinations and that they are fit for travel.  Also, all airlines require that you receive a health certificate, which will state that your pet is healthy and safe for travel. The above mentioned points are just a few of the many that you will want to take into consideration when traveling with a pet.  Added tips include booking direct flights, making sure your pet’s collar is marked with the proper identification, as well as their pet carrier."
13,Titanium Time Travels,travel-leisure," Ready to escape to nature?  Outdoor activities are a favorite outlet for many of us to decompress from the day to day routine.  A popular outdoor activity is to hit the trial on a great hike and overnight camping adventure.  Of course, if we are camping, we are usually cooking.  There's nothing like some fresh air with a healthy dose of nature to build up a good appetite!  In this article, I will highlight a brief history of titanium, an important element now found in some light-weight camping cookware. First, let's start by understanding titanium is a chemical element you may have learned about in chemistry class, with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22.  It is the ninth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the seventh-most abundant metal. It is a lustrous transition metal with a lovely silver color, low density and highest strength-to-weight ratio of any metallic element.  In its unalloyed condition, titanium is as strong as some steels, but less dense.  Impressive!  It is highly resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua Regia and chlorine.  So, what does this have to do with camping cookware?   We love titanium because it is light weight in our packs, exceptionally strong and a good investment, as it holds up well over time. Speaking of time, did you know titanium was first discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain by William Gregor, the vicar of the Creed parish and amateur geologist in 1791?  Gregor recognized the presence of a new element in ilmenite when he found black sand by a stream in the nearby parish of Manaccan.  It seemed the sand was attracted by a magnet, so Gregor analyzed the sand and determined the presence of two metal oxides: iron oxide and a whitish metallic oxide he could not identify.  Realizing the unidentified oxide contained a metal that did not match any known elements, Gregor reported his findings to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall and in the German science journal Crell's Annalen.  Interestingly a few years later the oxide was independently discovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, in what we now call Slovakia.  Klaproth named the new element for the strong Titans in Greek mythology. Fast forward to the 1950’s and 1960’s, the Soviet Union pioneered the use of titanium in military and submarine applications as part of their Cold War programs.  Beginning in the early 1950’s, titanium was frequently used in military aviation, particularly in high-performance jets, such as the F-100 Super Sabre, Lockheed A-12 and SR-71. Recognizing the strategic value of titanium, the U.S. Department of Defense supported early commercialization throughout the Cold War.  So much so, that a large stockpile of titanium was maintained by the Defense National Stockpile Center, until it was finally depleted in the 2000’s.  As of 2015, titanium sponge metal was produced in six countries: China, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, United States, Ukraine and India (in order of output).   So, there you have it - who knew titanium is found and valued worldwide?  Today we know that it is a wonderful cooking companion on our many travels across the great outdoors."
14,Student Travel Ideas:  Celebrated American Writers from Philadelphia,travel-leisure," For student travel groups headed to Philadelphia, an historic tour is not complete without visiting the historic homes of famous American writers who lived there and penned their work there.  A trip to a writer’s home provides a window into his domestic life, and the homes are well-preserved or restored.  Teachers interested in creating a blended learning experience can have their students can read the works of these Celebrated authors as preparation for the trip. Edgar Allen Poe, Ben Franklin and James Michener all lived in Philadelphia at some point in their writing careers.  Poe was originally from Richmond, Virginia. He relocated his wife and mother to Philadelphia to assume editorial positions at literary magazines.  Ben Franklin grew up in Boston. He took ship to Philadelphia to escape the tutelage of his father.  Franklin would found his own printing press and purchase a newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette. He wrote many articles for this publication under various pseudonyms. He is well known for The Autobiography of Ben Franklin, which is his mythologized version of his trip to Philadelphia as a young man.  Franklin is also known for Poor Richard’s Almanack, where his memorable phrases about life were recorded.  James Michener is a celebrated American writer who penned non-fiction, historical novels about the U.S.  He is best known for Centennial, Chesapeake and Alaska. The Poe House, Philadelphia PA Student tours of Philadelphia should include a look at the Poe House, at 7th and Spring Garden Streets.  The only weekday this National Historic Site is open is Friday, so plan itineraries accordingly.   Take advantage of a Ranger led tour of Poe’s home. Choose from ""Poe’s Life, Literature and Legacy"" or ""Poe in Philadelphia.""  The six years Poe spent living in Philadelphia were some of his most productive.   He wrote the short story, ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" in Philadelphia and was employed as an editor and a critic.  Poe’s influence reached European writers. His literary achievements include writing the first detective story and pioneering science fiction, by looking towards the future based on new technologies. Student trips can explore Poe’s reading room and the parlor, where his desk was located, as well as his bedroom and the basement. There is a replica of an air balloon students can launch - and more interactive exhibits. Ben Franklin: The quintessential Philadelphian Not only was Benjamin Franklin an inquisitive writer, a printer, a legislator and diplomat - but he was also a scientific genius. Franklin experimented with electricity and other new phenomenon that characterized the Early American era in which he lived.  In high school history class, students are taught Ben Franklin was one of the founding signors of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. Yet there is so much more beneath the surface of this fascinating figure.  Franklin ran away from an overbearing father in Boston, and elevated himself to a prominent life in Philadelphia.  He escalated his visibility using a printing press and a pen that rivals Mark Twain’s sarcasm.   Franklin wrote under numerous pseudonyms in his day.  The Benjamin Franklin Museum located in Franklin Court, with entrances on 3rd and 4th Street.  A visit here is the best way a student travel group can become acquainted with his life and work as a statesman, printer and scientist. Though Franklin’s old residence is no longer standing, an outline of the old building remains. This is also known as the ‘ghost house’ in Franklin court. James Michener: The Cultured Philadelphian Born in New York City, Michener’s family moved to Doylestown, Pennsylvania when he was a child. He left at the age of 20 and hitchhiked cross country. Michener returned to study at Swarthmore College, where he graduated with highest honors. Michener is known for his historical fiction about the United States, tracing the land’s beginnings as far back as scientific evidence and the imagination can conceive.  Some of his best known works include: Chesapeake, Alaska and Centennial.  Michener’s writing career was etched in stone when he won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel, Tales of the South Pacific (1947). This was later turned into a wildly popular Broadway Musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein and abbreviated to South Pacific.  Student tours will want to see the James A. Michener Art Museum in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.  Michener funded the museum for his beloved Doylestown, where he maintained a foothold and a residence. Student trips to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania offer many opportunities for English, History and Social Studies students. Places such as the Edgar Allen Poe house (and basement), the ghost of Benjamin Franklin’s home (and Museum) and the James A. Michener Art Museum are only a sampling of many famous writers and thinkers who lived and worked in the Philadelphia area.   Students may continue to engage in studies of these notable figures that changed the American Cultural landscape forever.

15,Let’s talk a bit about Thessaloniki,travel-leisure," Even though Thessaloniki is one of the most beautiful cities in Greece, it is not as big as you may think. Therefore, a single transfer in Thessaloniki will probably not exceed the rate of 30 euros, with that being an example of the highest rate for a transfer from the west side of the city to Macedonia airport, which is at the east side of the city. For your transfers, within the city center, it is highly recommended to book a taxi, instead of using the bus, which is the only alternative way of transfer in Thessaloniki, as there is no tram or metro. Thessaloniki offers you a variety of interesting things to do and places to visit. There are a number of museums, archaeological sites and monuments, such as the Archaeological area of Thessaloniki Roman Forum, the museum of Byzantine Culture, the Archaeological museum of Thessaloniki, the state museum of Contemporary art and many more. Fortunately, for those of you who are not very keen to travel long distances, most of these places are within a walking distance form each other, or you may need to travel by taxi or bus, but it will not take you more than 20 minutes. It is worth it though, as you get the chance to discover some of the most ancient pieces of history of the world. Now, let us fill you in in some of the basic information about Thessaloniki. The city was founded by the King of Macedonia Kassandros in 315B.C; the city is named after Kassandrosʼ wife, who was also Alexanderʼs the Great sister. Moreover, in 1997 Thessaloniki was announced the European Cultural Capital of Europe and in 2014 it was announced European Youth Capital City; both titles are of high significance and importance for the city. In more recent news, Thessaloniki serves for all tastes and ages; it offers from historical and educational options to restaurants and bars. There are a couple of spots within the city where you can find shops, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, nightclubs and anything else you wish to find during your holidays. The best example is the city centre, which lies around Aristotelous square, that is the cityʼs most central spot. We promise you that the city of Thessaloniki and its hidden treasures will not let you down and you will definitely enjoy your stay. However, you should be open to meeting local people, who know the city best and will offer you the best guidance and suggestions, in order to experience the real Thessaloniki. When being on holidays, we all enjoy our privacy and relaxation moments! Therefore, we would suggest that you plan your trip ahead, donʼt stress and rush to catch your flight or make it on time for your meeting. You just need to handle things the right way and choose a Thessaloniki taxi wisely in order to stay calm and on time. Thessaloniki taxis are available in all areas of the city, 24 hours a day. In most streets, taxis will stop when hailed everywhere. It is not uncommon for passengers to share a ride, if it is suitable for all of them. If you don't wish to call out a taxi, there are taxi ranks in the following central areas: Mitropoleos Street near Aristotelous, Mitropoleos Street opposite the cathedral and Pavlou Mela Street just before the White Tower. A licensed Thessaloniki taxi is always blue and bear yellow or white number plates."
16,National Museum of African American History and Culture Opens in D.C.,travel-leisure," A brand new Smithsonian Museum will be a desirable attraction for student travel groups.  It is situated prominently on the Mall in Washington D.C.  The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) will open on September 24, 2016 to much fanfare, and includes a welcoming speech by President Barack Obama.  An outdoor music festival will accompany the opening on September 23, 24 & 25. The new museum has a contemporary and memorable architecture, created by David Adjaye, an internationally known architect from Ghana, Africa. Student travel companies will want to schedule student trips headed for Washington D.C. a timed group entry to the museum well ahead of time.  After the official opening, it is sure to become a popular item on the itinerary for student group travel.  The NMAAHC provides special tours and education programs for school groups of various ages. There are plenty of reasons to add the National Museum of African American History and Culture to a student travel itinerary. First, the museum’s collection crosses curriculums, appealing to the art, history and social studies student.  Second, the Museum draws an accurate picture of the long and tormented history of the African-American, highlighting the most famous figures. From enslavement to freedom to the civil rights movement and the reclamation movement, the unique challenges of the African-American are covered.   Many famous leading African Americans are celebrated, giving students an opportunity to learn more about the specifics of the fight for freedom. The architect, David Adjaye, conceived of the bronze webbed design.  The outer form that he evokes is a common motif seen on top of ceremonial and sacred places in West and Central Africa.  When light strikes the building, it filters through the webbed design to the interior spaces, giving the visitor a unique display.  Adjaye made sure that the windows inside the Museum would offer a view of the major monuments on the Mall, including the Washington Monument. While researching the history of the building, Adjaye found the very center of the NMAAHC gallery used to be a slave market.  So he designed a large circular window overlooking the floor where slave owners viewed the men and women below.  Several galleries are housed in the basement levels, giving student travelers a glimpse deep into African Americans beginnings - in a cryptic and darkened environment. As the student groups ascend to different floors, history marches onward to the present. This Museum has been in the works since 2003. Lonnie G. Bunch, III was the original founding director. Bunch had amassed a significant collection of African-American artifacts and wanted a place to display them and educate Americans about a painful part of U.S. history.  Some of his signature artifacts are photographed and available online.  Teachers may want to introduce students to the NMAAHC by viewing some of these. The galleries are separated according to themes and topics of interest to all Americans.  A Changing America:  1968 and Beyond offers a window into the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.  Cultural Expressions, Musical Crossroads, Taking the Stage and Visual Arts and the American Experience highlight famous African American artists and performers and will be of interest to the art, music and theater arts student.  Sports:  Leveling the Playing Field showcases the best African-American athletes and the history of a long struggle to compete with white Americans.  Slavery and Freedom, Power of Place and Making a Way Out of No Way are collections that speak to the struggle to unite African heritage and American identity while experiencing the harshness of survival. For many student travelers an actual visit to the NMAAHC will be an eye opening experience that offers the African-American perspective on many important topics.  Clearly a great deal of intelligence, thoughtfulness and expert planning went into the execution of the newest, and 19th of the Smithsonian Museums.   Trip leaders and teachers interested in taking a class trip to Washington D.C. and want to include a timed entry pass for their group may contact info@educationaltravelconsultants.com or visit: http://www.educationaltravelconsultants.com."

As indicated by mythology, the town was established by Náfplios, the child of god Poseidon and the little girl of Danaus (Danaida) Anymone. The town's history follows back to the ancient period when troopers from here took an interest in the Argonautic undertaking and the Trojan War alike.

Possessed subsequent to ancient times, the landmass comprises of three levels, among which stand three free châteaux, the most seasoned being the western one. It was there that the antiquated acropolis was arranged, braced with polygonic Cyclopean dividers. The most captured spot of Náfplio –and its perspective as well– is Bourtzi, the Venetian little fortification remaining on the rough islet of Agioi Theodoroi. Amid the Venetian standard it was associated with Akronafplia through a colossal metal chain that secured the port against foe ship assaults.

1,Diving With Sharks In The Bahamas,travel-leisure," Have you ever swam with sharks in the Bahamas? Imagine your first ever shark encounter is set in Bimini, only having known the terrifying creatures of the sea through movies and TV shows. You cruise on a speedboat through the soft waves of the Caribbean Sea, leaving behind the comforts of the land. When you arrive to your destination in the middle of the ocean, you watch as your peers jump into the water one by one, leaving you behind, last man standing. You stand on the edge of the boat, look down below the crystal clear waters, and see a frenzy of sharks swarming the waters. With eyes closed, you take one deep breath and jump in… only to notice last second that you’re falling directly on top of a shark. But unlike the movies and TV shows that portray the creatures as unforgivingly ferocious, the shark is just as scared as you and swims away as fast as it can. Now imagine that after an experience like that, you fall in love with the creatures so much that you leave your office job behind and decide to work with the exact excursion agency that gave you your first shark encounter. That’s exactly the story of Pablo Aviles, Sales Manager of Bimini Undersea. We had the pleasure of speaking with him and learning about the sharks that inhabit the waters of Bimini, and the various ways that they can be explored with Bimini Undersea, the excursion agency of Resorts World Bimini. ""Sharks are commonly known as monsters of the sea"", Pablo exclaims, ""I once thought the same."" People are simultaneously fascinated and fearful, craving knowledge on the creatures yet hoping to never cross paths with one in the wild. Movies like Jaws, Sharknado, Deep Blue Sea, Open Water and countless more portray the fish as horrific, life threatening creatures. Shark Week, airing this entire week, is an annual shark-based program with a strong cult following. Every year’s program brings in record-breaking millions of viewers, giving people a mesmerizing glimpse into the lives of these mysterious creatures. And while sharks definitely do portray a potential threat to swimmers, Pablo is confident that ""Bimini Undersea aims to show a different side to the creatures, you’ll have a better understanding of them once completing one of our excursions."" No matter whether you’re an experienced scuba diver or a beginning swimmer, Pablo ensures you’ll be able to participate in the various excursions offered by Bimini Undersea. The agency offers three different Shark Encounters, based on your level of experience. These Shark Encounter excursions are set within the beautiful blue waters of Bimini, no cages and no barriers. Swim with sharks in their natural habitat and get an up close view that rivals any Shark Week program or thriller movie. Not so confident in your swimming skills? Start off with level 1, ""you’ll receive a life vest and be able to float without thinking"" as you snorkel with black tipped reef sharks in 25 feet deep water. Feeling a little more risky? If you’re scuba certified, venture with level 2, where you’ll be able to swim with sharks and even experience a photographed feeding session. For those who want the ultimate rush, level 3 is a unique experience only offered during the winter months. You’ll be transported to the famous shark-filled area of Bimini, Triangle Rocks, where you’ll dive deep below the surface and freely swim with Great Hammerhead Sharks. This once in a lifetime opportunity also features a photographed feeding session with the magnificent creatures. 365 days a year, those diving in Bimini can come across Black Tip Reef Sharks, Lemon Sharks, Nurse Sharks, Bull Sharks, Great Hammerhead Sharks, and the occasional Tiger Sharks. Bimini is a true haven for sharks, not just because of its perfect climate, but also because of its preservation measures. ""For years, shark fishing has been outlawed in the Bahamas, so this area is a sanctuary for sharks to reproduce and thrive."" When asked if the sharks in these excursions pose any true threat to visitors, Pablo confidently replies, ""Sharks are biologically afraid of people. It would rather eat something smaller before it would ever bite you."" Pablo goes on debunk the common misconception about sharks being the most dangerous, terrifying creatures. He ensures that Bimini Undersea educates visitors before all excursions. As long as you don’t harass the sharks in any way and let them be in their natural habitat, you should be free from worry. When you look at the facts versus the fabricated tales, sharks deserve more respect as magnificent creatures of the sea. Sure, they can be dangerous. But they don’t always have to be. Oftentimes humans are labeled as victims against sharks, but the reality of the matter shows the opposite. 100 million sharks are killed per year by humans, while no more than 10 people worldwide are killed by sharks annually. Bimini Undersea gives visitors a chance to see sharks in a light they’ve never seen before. Pablo is one of many members of the excursion agency who are passionate about the creatures and who wish to shed some of the fear that people have and replace it with pure fascination. Make your own Shark Encounter story by diving with sharks in the Bahamas with Bimini Undersea."
2,Students Trips to D.C. Include a Visit to Holocaust Museum: Conversations with Holocaust Survivors,travel-leisure," Student tours of Washington D.C. often include a visit to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  A visit to the Museum can be an eye opening experience for students of this generation, who did not live through the war, and were not raised by parents that fought or participated in World War II. Many of the popular Hollywood films about the holocaust focus on the experience of the Jewish population in Germany.  However, the Jewish population throughout Europe was deeply affected by anti-Semitism and genocide. As the war progressed, the Nazis came to invade many different European countries and round up Jewish people for extermination at the camps in Germany. The First Person Podcast Series by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a wonderful resource for teachers who want to introduce students to the individual stories of holocaust survivors.  It is also a great way to prepare them for a class trip to Washington D.C. that includes a stop to at the Museum on the itinerary. Visit the U.S.Holocaust Memorial Museum and select the menu ‘Survivors and Victims.’ Page down and peruse the selections of audio podcasts available for online listening. Genocide of the Jewish Population in Europe in the 1940s These first person accounts of war and its consequences to families and whole populations will be an awakening for many students. Students may be familiar with the major battles of World War II and the politics of the war.   However these personal accounts of intimidation, fear and hiding. Jewish people had to disguise their true identities and survive in a small amount of space – or go from house to house. Separation of husbands and wives and mothers and children was all too common. These stories will leave students spellbound - and should be digested slowly.  Post -listening exercises are recommended so students can fully integrate.   A visit to the Museum will also assist in learning more. The Nazi Resistance in Europe There are also important details about those who courageously resisted Nazi control and aided those who were fleeing. Many of these allies were non-Jewish and taking a huge chance by hiding those who were.  Listening to these Survivor Stories adds a whole new dimension to students’ knowledge and learning about the holocaust of World War II. Each story has its own unique description of the challenge of a Jewish adult or child leaving war torn Europe.  With the German army crossing through many war torn territories, this is quite a challenge and took a great deal of courage for the many who aided those who sought refuge elsewhere. Warsaw Ghetto Uprising: Nazi’s Stalled One highlight of the First Person Podcast Series includes the story of Estelle Laughlin: The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.  In Poland, some of the fiercest resistance to a Nazi takeover came from an ill supplied but prepared group of urban fighters.  The resistance movement in the Warsaw Ghettos helped families to build secret bunkers before the Germans arrived.  While war raged in the streets of Warsaw families hid in bunkers to survive.  This actually saved quite a few families, who were spirited away during lulls in this urban war. Laughlin’s story of resistance and escape is compelling, mostly because she was only a child. Romania: Hiding from a Pogrom in Iasi Heim Solomon’s story explains what the word ‘Pogrom’ means. After the Germans invaded the Soviet Union on June 21, 1941, The Romanian Jewish population came under the authority of the Germans. The Nazis pressed upon the authorities of Romania to eliminate the Jewish population.  The Jewish men of the town were summoned to the City Hall to be reissued new identification.  From this room they were escorted into a stone outdoor enclosure.  Here German soldiers would either split their heads or shoot them in the temple of he head. Later a garbage truck would clean up the trash.  In the July 29th massacre, 4,000 would perish within the perimeter of the stonewall. This particularly vicious form of genocide was terrifying to the Jewish population. Two of Heim’s brothers scaled the stone wall that night, and hid for 6 days without food or water. They hid themselves in a space above wood piled to the ceiling. Many more were lined up and sent by train and because it was so hot, one half of those who traveled died from lack of water.  Solomon’s family was scattered during the roundup and after the Pogrom calmed down, in 4-5 days, they reorganized from their hiding. His scathing account of the inhumane treatment of the Nazi’s is not easy to listen to, however it gives a perspective not often recorded in history books. Teachers may have to face hard subjects with students and will find creative ways to help them understand materials. Resistance to fascism, survival in a hostile environment, and the ability to live in secrecy are just a few of the characteristics many survivors share.  Students will learn about the struggles and turmoil of separating from family –immediate and extended.  Most of all students will learn about the bravery of survivors and those who helped them.

3,"Student Trips to NYC: Try a Behind-the-Scenes Workshop About Broadway Acting, Singing and Staging",travel-leisure," Theater arts, dance and music students are fascinated with Broadway Theater in New York City.  Many take class trips to New York City to experience the theater district, take in a Broadway Musical or two, and eat in New York City restaurants and delicatessens.  How many student groups on a NYC tour have also considered a Broadway Workshop? These workshops are designed to enhance acting skills and help students develop a greater understanding of one of the highest and most demanding levels achieved in the acting profession – Broadway acting. Not too long ago, High School Musical was all the rage for students with acting aspirations.  Once it was Wicked and The Lion King, drawing large audiences. Now it is Hamilton that is hot - and tickets hard to obtain. Behind the scenes Broadway Workshops keep up with what is trending on Broadway in some fun and extraordinary ways.  The workshops are applicable to theater arts and inspire students to probe deeper into Broadway Musicals. At the same time these learning experiences show the hard and constant daily effort that goes into making sure all parts of the Broadway show work in concert. Many trip leaders opt for the Broadway Rehearsal or Choir Workshop.  The score from the musical the student group will attend is used, making the experience of seeing a Broadway musical more familiar.  Students learn about choreography, staging and music from a cast member and a musical director.  Choir Workshops focus on learning the vocal score of the musical. There are other workshops to engage the young actor or actress, including a useful one for every aspiring actor – The Audition Workshop. Then there’s the Improv Workshop, Stage Combat and the Make Up Workshop for students who want to jump right into the action. For teachers who want student groups to meet real Broadway Actors, Meet the Artist Q & A will be an excellent workshop to do so. Students meet the Broadway actor or actress in a rehearsal studio.  Here the group can ask questions about life on Broadway in a private session with the artist, at a show which they may attend later.  This is a great way for students to gain insights about life in New York City and the day-to-day demands and scheduling of a Broadway actor or actress. For the student who already knows how hectic it can be backstage, the Broadway Quick Change workshop may be a great way to learn some tips from the experts.  Student tour groups will see how the professionals change costumes quickly and effortlessly. A real Broadway actor will demonstrate a quick change and students will be invited to try it.  Students will learn the importance of this skill for the acting profession - where space is often tight and several actors must change in a short period. As mentioned earlier, Hamilton is now the hit Broadway Musical most theater art students will be familiar with already. The star of the show is loosely based on the historical Alexander Hamilton, a Cuban orphan who came to New York City penniless and emerged as a top writer and revolutionary of his day.  The story is told in hip-hop style so students can relate if this is their preference in music.  Trip leaders can either select a Hamilton Meet the Artist workshop, where students meet a real actor in his or her rehearsal studio, or the Hamilton Dance workshop, where students are introduced to the choreography behind Hamilton. As a whole, participating in one or several Broadway Workshops is an active learning experience students will remember for some time.  For more information on booking class trip to New York City that includes a Broadway Musical and participating in a workshop, visit http://www.educationaltravelconsultants.com."

5,Chernobyl Zone: Can It Become an Official Tourist Object?,travel-leisure," Are you a fan of extreme tours and adventures? Do you wish to get unforgettable memories and emotions that will last for a lifetime? Or, maybe, you have already visited lots of places around the world and wish to see something extraordinary – something that it is impossible to see in everyday life? If you have answered at least one of these questions positively, then a tour to chernobyl zone may be a great solution for you! Why Are Chernobyl Tours Exciting? The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power station that shocked the whole world in 1986 remains the topic of hot discussions by this time. The fact is that even the experts cannot tell for sure what ecological aftereffects triggered by the catastrophe may still be observed in future. This puts several generations of people at risk, even though, it is reported that the most tragic consequences are already in the past. With that said, it is not easy to explain the desire of thousands of people from different countries of the world to book a chernobyl tour. What’s more, the number of such extreme tourists keeps increasing with every passing year. So, why are the tours to Chernobyl so popular and why do they attract so many people today? The major reason for the popularity of the exclusion zone is… human curiosity. With so many things that have been said about the disaster and so many movies and books that have become available these days, people have the desire to see the location with their own eyes. They realize that the world around us has changed a lot since 1986, but the Chernobyl zone remains the same. The time seems to have stopped there and this is, probably, the only place in the world, which has preserved the atmosphere of the former USSR. In other words, this place can be compared to the museum under the open air, where each object has historic meaning.  No wonder, the tourists traveling to Pripyat and Chernobyl with to ""touch"" the history and feel that special atmosphere of mystery created by silence, things that have been left in haste, ruined buildings and other suchlike elements. Can Chernobyl Become an Official Tourist Object? Chernobyl tours are really in demand nowadays. They are especially popular with young people, who are not afraid to visit the exclusion zone and consider such tours a kind of an exciting adventure. Many of them decide to travel to the location on their own, without any official permission and safety measures. This is a huge mistake, which can trigger unpredictable consequences. The fact is that not all the places in Pripyat and Chernobyl are safe for people because of the increased radiation level. Furthermore, not all the objects in the zone are officially allowed to be visited, which can also pose danger to people, who don’t know that. That is exactly why, tours to chernobyl zone should be organized by professional agencies, like Go2chernobyl.com, which are aware of all the nuances, dangers and special features of the place and can make the trip safe and exciting for everyone. According to recent statistic data, about 10 thousands of people visit Chernobyl each year and this number keeps growing rapidly. That is why, the government of the country considers it possible to make Chernobyl an official tourist object, thus making it an additional income source. Meanwhile, trips to the exclusion zone organized by professional tourist agencies keep gaining popularity."
6,Fishing in Bimini,travel-leisure," The Bahamas fishing scene is world-renowned for the rich history it carries and the incredibly diverse marine life that populates its waters to this day. Of all the 700 islands that encompass the archipelago of the Bahamas, Bimini is the one destination that attracts sports fishermen from around the world, firmly holding its title as the Big Game Fishing Capital of the World. Sitting on the edge of the Gulfstream and the westernmost edge of the Bahamas, Bimini is the perfect location for access to the tropical north-flowing current of warm waters, replete with fish of all varieties. Conditions for fishing in Bimini are perfect year-round, making it a highly popular destination for fishing tournaments and events. More than 50 record-setting catches have been made in the waters that surround Bimini, not to mention the 1993 record tuna weighing a staggering 971 pounds. Bimini’s vibrant marine life has always been a major attraction for visitors, including the revered American novelist, Ernest Hemingway. He spent many seasons of the 1930s exploring Bimini and finding inspiration for his novels within the deep blue waters that surround the island. Hemingway spent his days sailing the waters on his boat, the Pilar, searching for the perfect catch of marlin, tuna, and swordfish. Many of his most famous works were taken from his experiences out on Bimini’s waters, including To Have and Have Not, The Old Man and the Sea, and Islands in the Stream. Both amateur and avid fishermen will find their slice of heaven within the enchantingly colorful marine life that rushes through Bimini’s warm currents. The list of fish that can be sought is truly endless: blue and white marlin, sailfish, swordfish, wahoo, kingfish, mackerel, tuna of all kind, Oceanic Bonito, bonefish, permit, tarpon, amberjack, grouper, snapper, barracuda, and more. There’s no better source of fishing wisdom than from locals who are immersed in the waters of Bimini daily; that’s why we’ve reached out to Jonah Hepburn III, a local fisherman, to find what makes the island of Bimini his most prized fishing paradise. Resorts World Bimini: How many years have you been a fisherman, and would you say that Bimini is a top-rank destination for fishing? Jonah Hepburn: I’ve been fishing for the past ten years; 3 years ago I put down my rod and reel, picked up a spear and never looked back! Yes, Bimini definitely is a top-ranked destination for fishermen of all experience levels. RWB: What has been your greatest catch in Bimini, and do you have a particular fish that you are still chasing? JH: My biggest catch would have to be a 23.6 lb mutton snapper that I shot in 20 ft of water less than two miles west of the island. As far as hunting a particular type of fish goes, I am after the species that offers me the greatest challenge. Whether it be big groupers hiding in deep ledges and caves or the elusive mutton snappers that push your breath holds to the very limit. RWB: What sets Bimini apart from any other place for fishing? JH: The one thing Bimini has over all other fishing destinations is its location. Having the Great Bahama Banks to the east and the Gulfstream to the west, the waters of Bimini are nutrient rich. The waters provide not only numerous reef structures for fish to live, but also excellent feeding grounds. Having the deep waters of the Gulf Stream so close to its shores means that large schools of pelagic fish are not very far away. These factors and a few others help to create an angler’s utopia. RWB: In your opinion, what is the tastiest fish you have ever tried and how do you prefer your fish cooked? JH: Hands down the tastiest fish I have ever tried would be the Hog Snapper. Ceviche would be my favorite way to prepare freshly caught fish. RWB: What is the most interesting story that you can share of your time out there in the Atlantic Ocean, and what advice can you give to anyone that is interested in a fishing excursion in Bimini? JH: Two years ago I shot my very first Nassau Grouper in a small cave two atmospheres deep. On the surface as I began preparations to go back and retrieve my catch, I had the misfortune of watching an 8ft green moray eel devour my grouper in the most vicious of ways, leaving me with a broken heart and a bent shaft. The best advice I can offer to anyone looking for a fishing excursion or any nautical experience in Bimini is to get out and make it happen! Find a guide that’s knowledgeable and experienced who can offer a safe and fulfilling trip. Moreover [and] most importantly, enjoy every moment of paradise."
7,Bimini Popular Attractions,travel-leisure," What’s the secret to a perfect Bahamas vacation? Adventure. Bimini is filled with opportunities for sightseeing, exploration, and stories of the island’s history. Bimini is made up of a chain of islands only 53 miles east of Miami. Nicknamed the ""Big Game Fishing Capital of the World,"" Bimini offers world-class fishing, incredible scuba diving, and beautiful displays of nature. Bimini’s mangroves are one of the island’s most beautiful natural preserves. As the only mangroves in the western Great Bahama Bank, they are widely known as one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. The area is filled with a large variety of marine animals, including many endangered species. On any given day, you could see the Nassau grouper, smalltooth sawfish, hawksbill turtles, kirtland’s warblers, loggerhead turtles, great hammerhead sharks, and the Bimini boa. Through the Bimini mangroves lies one of the island’s most popular natural wonders, The Healing Hole. Guests are invited to swim in the mineral rich water. In order to reach the spring, visitors will have to walk through acres of trees and creeks. The walk is well worth it, as the waters are believed to have healing qualities. The waters of Bimini hold more than just amazing displays of nature, they also hold artifacts and tales of Bimini’s past. Bimini Road is a rock formation that is completely underwater near North Bimini Island. The rock formation is half a mile long and is made from limestone blocks. Some say it has mystical origins. J. Manson Valentine, Jacques Mayol, and Robert Angove discovered this formation in 1968. Legend has it that Bimini Road was once a road system of the Lost City of Atlantis, which according to popular belief, sunk into the sea thousands of years ago. Another popular attraction in the long list of Bahamas activities is The Dolphin House. Established in 1993 by local author Ashley Saunders, the house is made from reclaimed items from local beaches. The house shows how the island of Bimini truly treasures its natural materials. Visitors can join daily walking tours led by the Saunders family. One of the most popular attractions on the island is The Bimini Museum. Founded in 1995 and opened in 2000, the museum went through a five-year period of restoration and funding before opening to the public. Visitors will find pictures, artifacts, relics, and memorabilia of the island’s history. Together it all tells the story of Bimini’s rise to a top vacation destination. Two popular items currently on display are a 1964 immigration card of Martin Luther King Jr. and Ernest Hemingway’s fishing logs. One of the island’s most prized artifacts is The Fountain of Youth. According to legend, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon searched for the fountain on the island of Bimini. Unfortunately, he failed to discover the site. The fountain was later discovered by locals and is believed to carry the power to restore youth to those who bathe or drink its waters. Visitors are invited to tour the site to see if the legend is true. Looking to explore the stunning nature of the island? The Bimini Nature Trail is a great way for visitors to hike through the area and discover a large variety of native plants and animals. Visitors can take a guided tour of the natural trail and learn about the animals that live throughout the area. Many travelers enjoy shopping when they are on vacation and the Bimini Straw Market is the place to go. It is located next to the Bahamas Custom Building and there are many vendors selling their handmade crafts and goods. Any visitor that enjoys the water will love visiting the Sapona wreck. The ship was blown to the area by a hurricane during the 1920s, and now lives deep below Bimini’s waters. Both divers and snorkelers can swim and explore the wreck. If visitors are interested in spending time with Bimini’s larger sea creatures, swimming with the island’s dolphins is an absolute must. The dolphins crowd the area between March and September, providing a once in a lifetime opportunity to swim with these beautiful creatures in their natural habitat. The history and the legends of the island of Bimini are available for all to explore. No matter which excursions fill your itinerary, from scuba diving shipwrecks, to tasting Bimini’s delicious dishes, to exploring the artifacts within the Bimini Museum, there’s no doubt that Bimini is the perfect destination for an unforgettable Bahamas vacation."

9,Take a Student Tour Group to Philadelphia to Study Black History,travel-leisure," A student trip to Philadelphia is an excellent opportunity to study African American History.  The African American Museum in Philadelphia (AAMP) is the best starting point for the tour.  The AAMP is the most definitive collection of African American art, culture and history and best describes the ever changing social fabric of African Americans that define the region.  The native cultures of Africa are also honored here. When founded, Philadelphia was a mixture of free slaves and indentured servants and the rules between each group were not clearly defined.  At one time it was possible for a slave to be freed by his or her master, or to purchase their freedom.  Thus Philadelphia evolved as an abolitionist city and a place where some African Americans moved freely The African American Museum in Philadelphia is located at 7th and Arch Streets, in the heart of Downtown Philadelphia. After a morning trip to the Museum, student travel groups can have lunch in nearby Chinatown or at the Reading Terminal Market. The African American Museum in Philadelphia The African American Museum in Philadelphia houses far more than art.  In fact it traces the lives and work of a wide diaspora of African Americans across the United States and their heritage in the Philadelphia region and in native Africa.  There is usually a rotating exhibit in one gallery.  A significant show from the Permanent collection is always on display in another gallery:  Audacious Freedom:  African Americans in Philadelphia 1776-1876.  The exhibition is interactive, with a narrated timeline that spans 100 years.  Trailblazers from the African American Community are highlighted with video projections telling the story of their lives.  These video narratives make history larger than life for students.  There are other educational programs at the Museum as well. For teachers preparing students for the trip, expect exercises will be eye opening and told from a unique historical perspective.  Visit:  http://www.aampmuseum.org/education.html to learn more about Traveling Trunks, Iconic Images Mural Tour and the Passport to Culture Summer Youth Enrichment Program. Barnes Foundation The Barnes Foundation relocated from an estate in Merion, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia several years ago. In order to satisfy Barnes’ will, which stated the art must be kept in the original mansion, those who designed the building’s interiors recreated them exactly as they were in the 1920s. The collection was displayed precisely in the same places inside the new building. The Barnes Foundation is next to the Rodin Museum on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.  Albert C. Barnes is known for his collection of post-impressionist and early modern paintings.  He also has an extensive African American collection of arts and practical items used in African cultures.  Barnes felt the African Art to be a highly developed form. So, he collected figural sculptures, ceremonial masks, and domestic objects as well as those used in rituals and celebrations.  The collection is worthwhile seeing on this tour. Many of these pieces of the African diaspora are now well documented by African American Art Scholar Christa Clarke, PhD. President’s House Commemorative Site A perhaps unknown facet about the President’s House in Philadelphia, which honors George and Martha Washington, is about the enslaved members of the household. Altogether Washington brought 9 enslaved Africans to his three story mansion in Philadelphia, where he and Martha lived from 1790-97.  President Washington was known to treat his slaves in his household well. Eventually he freed them in his will and donated money to the creation of the African Episcopal Church of Saint Thomas.  Students of Black History will find this remarkable and important historical site to visit. Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church One of the first historically black and abolitionist churches in the new country was the Mother Bethel. A.M.E. Church in Philadelphia located at 6th and Lombard Streets.  The first church was convened in 1794.  In 1805, the building was expanded and the church leaders and congregation would become a leading force in fighting against slavery by helping those who escaped and were on the run.  Beginning at its infancy, and as the decades wore on, the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church would be a leading force in abolishing slavery all together. Bishop Richard Allen constructed the first church and expanded the second while leading a congregation of black Christians and allies in a fierce anti-slavery movement.  All students of black history will want to visit the Richard Allen Museum, which is part of the Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church. As any teacher can easily see, Philadelphia is a city rich in African American history, culture, politics and the arts. There are many more places to visit in Philadelphia, which celebrate black history, besides those noted here.  Trip leaders and teachers may feel free to explore and suggest other places in Philadelphia that would enrich a black history tour.

10,5 Tips for Driving a Rental Car in Puerto Morelos,travel-leisure," Puerto Morelos, Mexico is a tranquil, laid back beach town on the Yucatan Peninsula, and makes the perfect home base for a vacation in the Riviera Maya. Having a rental car in Puerto Morelos is a great decision for most people, since it gives you the freedom to jet off to Cancun or Playa del Carmen for a day whenever you feel like it, or explore the many amazing ruins and natural wonders at your own pace. Driving a rental car in Puerto Morelos and the surrounding areas isn’t much different from driving in the US – the Yucatan is one of the safest places to drive in the country and the main roads are generally well-maintained. However, there are some tips that travelers should follow when driving a rental car in Puerto Morelos in order to have the best vacation possible. Tips for rental cars in Puerto Morelos Collision Damage Waiver/Loss Damage Waiver is a pseudo-insurance policy that covers damage to the rental car itself (which is not covered in the mandatory Liability Insurance). Most major credit cards offer a certain amount of CDW/LDW coverage for free as long as you use it to make the reservation and pay for it. To get it from your credit card, you must decline that coverage from the rental car agency in Puerto Morelos. Car rental companies will offer this protection for an extra fee, but it usually includes a deductible of 10-20% of the vehicle’s replacement cost. Always, always, always have a copy of your Mexican Liability Insurance, CDW coverage and your car and health insurance policies from back home, just in case. The most important is the Liability Insurance – if you’re in an accident and can’t prove that you have enough insurance to cover the damages, you could find yourself waiting in a Mexican jail while the police figure out who was at fault and how much coverage you have. There is only one chain of gas stations in Mexico, Pemex, and the prices are the same everywhere in the country. Be aware that most gas stations will only accept cash, and there may be very few gas stations on some long stretches of highway. For example, the toll road to Chichen Itza has few exits and few gas stations, so plan accordingly. The major and secondary highways in Riviera Maya and the roads in the city of Puerto Morelos are in pretty good shape. But be careful with rural highways, side roads, and pulling off onto shoulders – you might get an unpleasant surprise from a pothole. Potholes are actually the main reason people in Puerto Morelos don’t recommend driving at night. The Mexican government has an app called Mappir that not only helps you plan a route from Point A to Point B, it will also estimate how much fuel it will take and what the costs of the route are (fuel, tolls, etc.). For example, it Mappir suggests 2 possible routes from Puerto Morelos to Chichen Itza: one has tolls, with a total cost of 697 pesos but only takes 3 hr 45 min; the second has no tolls with a total cost of 424 pesos but takes 4 hr 25 min."
11,"Smithsonian American Art Museum: Presenting a Fun, Online Classroom for Prepping Student Travelers",travel-leisure," There are many art museums across the United States with notable collections.  Yet only a portion of these museums specialize in American Art. It is true that many museums collect American art, but few focus solely on it.  A student tour of Washington D.C. is greatly enriched with a visit to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  A visit to this comprehensive museum will expose students to American Art and artists. Class preparation for a trip like this is important.  Many teachers will want to incorporate blended learning exercises to pique student interest in the class trip to D.C. Prior to a visit, teachers will want to explore the rich, in-depth classroom activities available online.  Visit http://americanart.si.edu/education/activities/online/index.cfm to review them all. Teachers will love the prepared exercises. Students will learn about American art from different perspectives. There are classroom exercises that focus on different eras in American Art, evolving identities for various ethnic groups, and fun, mystery solving exercises that help students retain what they learn. An example of an inspiring and interesting exercise is Meet me at Midnight.  This imaginary adventure involves a folk art sculpture coming to life at night and mixing up the art in the museum.  Students are tasked with setting things aright. There are a plethora of ways to learn about art. One of the ways to do this is to immerse students in the stories of artists.  Many of the artists featured in American Kaleidoscope emerge from working class backgrounds or specific ethnic groups and achieve greater recognition for their works through social movements, such as Chicano Rights, Black Rights or even Women’s Rights. Selecting Del Corazón! is a way to immerse students in the experience of the Latino artist. This classroom exercise features bi-lingual interviews of artists.   Plus, the interactive zoomify feature allows students to take a closer look at work by this important group of Americans. In Cleopatra: Lost and Found, students will learn more about the intersection of art and history.  The focus in this exercise is gaining a unique understanding of historical, literary and biblical figures celebrated in the art of sculpture. For many art students, participating in classroom activities online will be stimulating and fun –but these exercises still do not compare to a real time visit to the Smithsonian American Art Museum and Downtown Washington D.C.    Teachers will want to combine the online learning with a real visit to see the exhibitions. The Smithsonian American Art Museum was renovated from 2000-2005.  The Renwick Gallery is a centerpiece of the work completed and it is a stunning example of architecture. This was actually the first building in the U.S. specifically built to be an art museum. An important part of the gallery that is not to be missed is the Renwick Gallery. Located right across the street from the White House - this building houses American craft arts.  The current exhibition is called Wonder. This exhibition of large-scale installations includes well-known contemporary American artists. Smithsonian American Art Museum continues to be a leader in art education across the United States. Since 2006, the Museum curatorial staff has launched 14 major traveling exhibitions of more than 1,000 pieces of art from its permanent collection.   The Museum’s renovations left more time for curatorial staff to take a deeper look at the collection and send parts of it on tour. There are plenty of reasons to take student groups on a trip to Washington D.C.

12,Resorts versus Hotels,travel-leisure," Resorts over Hotels Why should I invest in or stay at a resort over hotels is the big question families are asking me all the time. The most important difference that every family should take into consideration is security. If you stay at a resort you will find out that most people are just like you. They are there with their family members on vacation having a wonderful time and bonding. Another benefit of resorts over hotels is that the resort has several rooms including a kitchen. According to triple AAA a family of four vacationing will spend approximately $150.00 a day eating every meal out which comes to a $1,050.00 a week. Using the kitchen you could possible save $ 525.00 which could pay for your getaway saving you money you would normally pay for your accommodations. Guests staying at a resort over hotels have many things to do besides the pool area. Things like horseback riding, miniature golf, game rooms, movies, bingo and many other things too numerous to mention in this article. One of the main things family’s are likely to find at a resort is the people they meet there are really friendly, especially the staff who love to help the guests when they arrive. They welcome you to the resort and quickly get you booked in. A concierge will escort you to your condo, make sure that your room is ready and they give you a welcome package with discounts. They will then tell you the best locations for attractions and restaurants in the area. Another great thing about 5 star resorts is peace of mind on what the accommodations are going to look like and are they clean, your money is well spent for just that one thing. Vacations are meant for making lasting memories not nightmares. I will stop here as there are too many benefits of staying at a resort over hotels to mention and do not want to take any more surprises away from your vacation. In all fairness I must say there are a few nice hotels out there and if you are alone or with one family member they might do given the fact that there are not resorts in every state of the union. At hotels there are also families on vacations trying to have a good time that are all crammed into one little room. If they get hungry in the middle of the night they can walk down a lonely hallway to the candy machine as most have no refrigerator or stove. There are other guests there that are not vacationing, and you always need to keep a watchful  eye on everyone going up and down those hallways. Because you only have one room you mainly keep your curtains closed over the one window you have in your room because that is your bedroom, and no one likes strangers looking into that room. Out of 24 hours you only use the room for eight of them but have to pay for the entire twenty four. I am not going to go into this anymore but hotels had their day, and just like technology is constantly changing so are the way people vacation."

14,A Popular Broadway Musical Choice for Student Travel Groups is Hamilton and Other Shows,travel-leisure," The 2016-2017 Broadway season is promising and filled with some popular choices in musicals for student travel groups.  The Lion King and Wicked continue to make long-term runs on Broadway.  These Broadway Shows are an excellent choice for student travel groups - because they accommodate groups in larger numbers.  Each musical is presented in high Broadway style with video and audio sound effects and exceptional costuming, music and dance. A student trip to NYC is not complete without a trip to Broadway to take in a show. For some students, perhaps the musical Frozen, due out in 2018, will be their first choice for a Broadway show in the near future.  For now, audiences will have to wait for the production to come together. The newest, hottest ticket on Broadway is Hamilton.  This Broadway show won the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Broadway Theater Album.  As Hamilton’s popularity surges, so will ticket sales in the future.   Be sure to arrange tickets far in advance with the help of a student travel company. Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant and now he is an important part of Early American Revolutionary War studies. For history and social studies teachers, Hamilton promises to be a great boon to classroom studies and fun to attend as well.  Taken from the 2004 biography by the same name as the musical, the book by Ron Chernow is a close look at Alexander Hamilton’s life. The musical traces this immigrant’s rise to fame as the youngest signer of The Declaration of Independence.  Hamilton’s writings and ambition are what brought him to the inner circle of founding fathers.  At the age of 22 Hamilton was the Aide de Camp of General George Washington, and by 34, he was the country’s first Secretary of the Treasury. The composer, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has taken an unusual approach to this Off-Broadway musical, now the hottest ticket on Broadway. Lin-Manuel Miranda also plays Hamilton and has based his life on the biography of Hamilton, but has given him the songs and dreams of a hip-hop star.  Because Hamilton came from the Caribbean and was abandoned by his father, he had much insecurity about his birthright and his lower station in life. Hamilton is portrayed as a man who tended to overcompensate in dress and speech yet was eloquent enough to be successful. One thing is for certain, the comparison to hip hop culture and speech will not be lost on high school students visiting Broadway for the first time. Hamilton’s costume is designed for the era in which he lived, with a flamboyant nod to Early American attire and styles.   The musical is composed of songs that are a bold mixture of hip-hop, R & B and even 1970s pop.  It’s a great example of a montage of American styles mixed into musical composition.  Hamilton is truly a Broadway show student travel groups can get excited about. Hamilton’s untimely death in a duel with his lifelong nemesis, Aaron Burr, came about in 1804. Perhaps this is another comparison to hip-hop culture - dying young yet courageously of a fatal gunshot wound from an enemy. There are other great musicals for student travel groups to select from on Broadway, such as Beautiful, the Carole King Musical about the 1970s singer/songwriter star. Or groups may want to check out Holiday Inn, an Irving Berlin musical production that closes in the fall of 2016. Student travel groups are sure to be amazed and dazzled by any of these professional theater productions. Whatever the choice for Broadway musical, teachers and trip leaders will need assistance from a qualified student travel company in reserving and purchasing the correct number of seats for the desired production.

15,"A Class Trip to Harpers Ferry, Historic Armory and Civil War Battlefield Near Washington D.C.",travel-leisure," For those interested in studying the Civil War, a visit to Harpers Ferry will easily explain its critical geographical position.  The natural boundary between north and south is the Potomac River. The Potomac River joins the Shenandoah River here, at the headwaters of the Shenandoah River Valley.  During the Civil War, rail and ship transportation were key to supply chains for both armies.  Harpers Ferry had both forms of transportation and was a strategic location between north and south. The Confederates were wooing Maryland residents to take up the Confederate side during the war and Harpers Ferry was a good position for this sort of public relations campaign. A Short History of Harpers Ferry Before Civil War The U.S. Armory and Arsenal was opened at Harpers Ferry in 1797. This facility produced over 600,000 muskets, rifles and pistols from 1707-1861.  Harpers Ferry was also the first place in the U.S.  to mechanize the production of weapons. John Brown’s Raid John Brown was an abolitionist with radical ideas about freeing slaves.  He set out on the evening of October 16, 1859 to raid the U.S. Armory and Arsenal with the objective of seizing 100,000 weapons.   These he planned to distribute to slaves to fight a guerilla war against slavery in the Shenandoah Valley.  About a day and  a half later, with Brown’s men killed or wounded, he was captured by the U.S. Marines. For his crimes of sedition against the country, he was hanged on December 2, 1859.  John Brown’s Fort stands today as a memory of the raid, and the place where he was captured. It would take less than two years from the time of John Brown’s raid, and the country would be in a state of civil warfare. Harpers Ferry During the Civil War Confederate and Union soldiers passed through Harpers Ferry, making it a vulnerable location.  Less than one day from the time Virginia seceded, Federal soldiers burned the armory n April 18, 1861. Yet only 15,000 weapons were burned, and Confederates were able to take the weapon making machinery into the South.  The Confederates held Harpers Ferry until the Battle of Antietam concluded in 1862 then the Union reoccupied it . All together the town changed hands eight times between 1861 & 1865 - which illustrates its significance. Harpers Ferry Jeopardy – Easy to Download and Play To make it fun for students to prepare for a trip to Washington D.C. and Harpers Ferry, the National Park Service has a game (designed in Powerpoint) called Harpers Ferry Jeopardy.  Another useful classroom teaching tool, The War for Freedom is designed for the student to gain a better understanding of slavery and emancipation. The War for Freedom includes intro text, teacher pages, learning activities and additional resources.  Students can learn about slavery from the viewpoint of a slave and trace his or her journey to emancipation.  Also documented in this section are actual stories of African American soldiers who fought hard for their freedom on different battlefields of the Civil War. Middle School Lessons Plans for Social Studies Students The National Park Service has designed a lesson geared towards 5th-8th graders that focuses specifically on Harpers Ferry. The Battle for Harpers Ferry, 1862:  Harpers Ferry is the Key! includes four lesson plans that take 30-40 minutes to cover in the classroom.  Students gain a better understanding of the strategic importance of Harpers Ferry for the Union and learn more about the life of a Civil War soldier. With so many great classroom tools to work with, teachers will find it easier to help students understand the importance of Harpers Ferry during the Civil War era.  They will also be able to tie this lesson into another about the Battle for Antietam. A real visit to Harpers Ferry will enable students to understand the geographic position of Harpers Ferry today and to view some of the historic sites where armies were situated.

16,"Students Travel to Charleston, South Carolina to Learn About Revolutionary War Battle of 1776 and the Siege of 1780",travel-leisure," Charleston, South Carolina has a rich history, beginning in the Revolutionary War era and pre-dating it. The Ashley and Cooper Rivers converge to create an inland harbor, making it one of the most prosperous and perfectly formed and located port cities in Early America.  Seen as a ‘crown jewel’ city by the British Navy, Charleston was attacked twice in the Revolutionary War:  once in 1776, when it was defended by General Moultrie successfully, and again in 1780, when the main peninsula and harbor were commandeered by the British and no ships besides theirs were allowed into port. Students of history and social studies and even military history can learn much through the active study of Charleston. Since its inception in 1670, Charleston has always been a strategic coastal settlement and bustling port city - and remains so to this day. While the army of Patriots in the North fought off the British and dealt with traitors (Tories) and espionage, the South was also faced with inconstancy in allegiances. In Georgia, prosperous landowners and businessman aligned with the British, so the state was easily taken over by the British. Some of these sentiments spread to the landowning class in South Carolina. In South Carolina the entire population was not so easily converted to ‘Tories,’ especially in the upstate, the rural areas and the backcountry, where resistance to British rule was strong. So the Revolutionary War resembled a civil war in the South because these open alliances with the British divided families, neighborhoods and towns. 1776:  Charleston is Bombarded & Defended During Revolutionary War The first shots of the American Revolution may have been heard in Massachusetts - but they also resounded in the south in Charleston’s harbor on June 28, 1776. With some foresight, Americans built fortifications at Sullivan’s Island, which sits at the mouth of the harbor.  An assault force of nearly 3,000 British soldiers and seaman were repelled by Patriot General Charles Lee in 1776, protecting the city from harm. By engaging the British forces here, the Patriots were able to save Charleston from falling. This important first battle for Charleston encouraged many to join the Patriots and fight for a new united country. 1780: Charleston Under Siege and Occupation Recalling the battle of 1780, when the British once again attempted to lay siege to Charleston, is a far darker episode in the Revolutionary War. Overwhelmed by the nearly 10,000 British troops in the harbor - the Patriots fought valiantly. The second time the British Naval forces entered the Charleston harbor, they passed Sullivan Island and laid siege upon the City. The British successfully captured the Peninsula and the entire city of Charleston fell into British hands on May 12, 1780. Over 5,000 Patriot soldiers were imprisoned and British troops occupied Charleston until the Revolutionary War concluded. Over a year later, the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia on October 19, 1781 would free Charleston’s occupants from British rule and captivity. Knowing the history of Charleston’s struggle with Patriotism, it’s no wonder the movie, The Patriot, was filmed in Charleston and in some of its historic homes and estates.  Some sites student groups will want to tour include Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, the Heyward-Washington House and Middleton Place House Museum.  All of these sites date to the Revolutionary War era. Trip leaders may want to take shorter trips west, into South Carolina, where the Revolutionary War continued. In Camden, South Carolina British troops were met with strong resistance that spread into other battles across Clarendon County.  A tour bus can easily take student groups out to selected battlefield destinations.  Work with a student travel company to determine which sites work best for Revolutionary War studies and are accessible at the time of year Charleston is visited.

17,Antietam: A Civil War Battle to Defend the Capital and Gateway to the North,travel-leisure," Student groups studying the Civil War Battle of Antietam will find a visit to this historic place to be a beneficial learning experience. Named after a creek in Maryland near Sharpsburg, Antietam Creek once ran through farmland and forests.  It was in this remote section of Maryland that General Robert E. Lee made his first incursion into the North and took a firm stand against the Union Army. The fated day of the battle of Antietam was on  September 17, 1862.  This first battle in Maryland was traumatic, with 100,000 soldiers clashing. Over 23,000 soldiers were lost during the 12-hour battle of Antietam with casualties the heaviest on the Confederate side, around 15,000 soldiers. Although most people believe Gettysburg was the bloodiest battle of the Civil War, in fact it was the Battle of Antietam. Antietam was part of Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s overall strategy of advancing his Army of Northern Virginia into the North. This would bring the Civil War to the Union territories. He hoped to inspire some to rethink their position on the Civil War altogether. In Maryland, the populace was divided as to allegiance to North or South.   Lee sought to convince the slaveholders and propertied landowners of Maryland to join the Confederate cause. Not far away, Washington D.C., the Union Capital city, needed to be defended. Lee’s first attempt to bring the battleground North was also seen as a mighty force being brought upon the nation’s capital.  His invasion was answered with the full force of the Union Army. General Robert E. Lee gathered his army on the western banks of Antietam Creek. Meanwhile, Stonewall Jackson’s troops held the left flank and General James Longstreet’s army held the center position for the Confederates.  Human losses at Antietam were devastatingly large because the battle lasted over 12 hours. There were huge casualties on both sides.  On September 18th, both armies carried the wounded away and buried their dead. Lee and the Confederate Army took leave of Sharpsburg and Maryland altogether. They crossed the Potomac River back into Virginia, much to the relief of the Union soldiers and citizens of the North.  This first decisive battle would leave its mark on Confederate and Union troops.  It surely was a bold move by a General whose strategy was unique and took chances. For the small town of Sharpsburg, Maryland this battle of the Civil War was a devastating blow. Properties were destroyed and crops were burned. Much was lost, including livestock and other food sources.  Now the people of the North knew what it was like to live amongst battle torn countryside and ruins. Students Travel to Battle Site to Learn More About Antietam Prior to a planned class trip to Antietam National Battlefield, students will want to study this year in the Civil War that included other decisive battles. One such battle was for Harpers Ferry, which took place in tandem with Antietam. While Lee positioned troops on the northern front, Stonewall Jackson’s army took Harpers Ferry, a town that possessed a strategic railway station and a large munitions cache. Another focus area of study may include an investigation into Lee’s strategy to bring the Confederate Army – and Civil War – North.  By visiting Antietam, students can participate in the Parks as Classroom program and learn more about the background of the land, its people and the soldiers who fought there. At the Antietam National Battlefield Visitor Center students can review historical photographs, sketches and paintings of the battlefields during Revolutionary times and tour the battlefields today to learn more about pivotal skirmishes during the battle. When considering a class trip Antietam, teachers and trip leaders may want to schedule a trip to Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia to to visit other key Revolutionary War Sites.

18,Icy Iceland Part 1,travel-leisure," Icy Iceland (Part 1) - By Jurg and Astrid Bluemel There are no direct flights to Reykjavik for us in winter, because all the ""normal"" people go there in summer. We leave on January 29th, the sun will rise at around 10:00 and set at 17:00 and won't get higher than 10 degrees above the horizon. The bad thing is we can't pronounce any of the names of the places we are going to see, and we'll barely have 9 hrs of light per day. The good thing is you can do sunrise shots and sleep late. The flybus gets us to town in about 45 min and is rather cheap too for Iceland, at around 20€ per person. Reykjavik, especially the old part is a a cute little town, and our hotel is right in the middle of things. We can easily walk to all the sights. Our favourites are the Harpa Concert Hall with the blue and green waves of its ever changing light show at night, looks almost like a small local northern light, and the Sun Craft sculpture which is like a viking ship. The food here is good and there are many cool places to choose from. DAY 1 Our photo tour starts with a shopping trip. We are all going to buy Viking Ice Fighter boots and a set of spikes to match it. They are huge rubber boots with a furry inside, guaranteed to keep our feet warm and dry, and soon we all grow to love our boots, they are the best buy on this trip. We walk through town like good tourists do, and photograph all the sights. In the evening we have a nice dinner with the whole group to end off the day. Tomorrow the photo part really starts. We will drive 190 km to the tiny town called Vik which is famous for its black sand beaches. DAY 2 We leave Reykjavik at 8:00 to get to the Skogafoss falls at sunrise which is at around 10:00. Now we know why we need the waterproof boots.... Hougaard makes us stand in the river which is flowing from the falls, to get a nice piece of ice in the foreground. The boots are amazing, you don't even feel the cold, I could stand in the river forever. Only an hours drive more and we get to our gorgeous Icelandair Vik Hotel. As beautiful as it is, we prefer to go outside and check out the beach. We photograph the troll rocks they have here, called Reynisdrangar (see what I mean with the names, we will call them troll rocks from now on) and the waves crashing in on the black beach. In the afternoon we go to Dyrholaey, the icelandic "" Hole in the Rock"", and photograph it from the eastern side with a milky sun setting in a very cloudy sky. Not finshed yet, we move back to our black beach and do the trolls again, this time standing in the water and with very slow shutter speeds to make it look nice and ""flowy"". DAY 3 The plan was to go to the waterfall again but this time an hour earlier to beat the crowds. The extreme wind won't allow travel to the west, a mountain road is closed. Plan B gets us back at our troll beach, standing in the waves again. So we do rocks and frozen puddles and snow. Looks great too and we get some great composition tips from Hougaard. Hafi our driver turns out to be quite good fun as well, and is probably the most talkative Icelander for miles around. The light is getting better so we put on the Graduate Filter and get into the waves again. Wait till the water flows back for the really good shots with nice lines in it. As the water is retreating we move forward a bit more, and a bit more.....and then the big wave came and now the water is sloshing in my shoes with every step I take. The boots are fine but my waterproof pants are not quite as good, so I spend most of our lunchbreak in the bathroom with my boots and a hairdryer. The afternoon we move on to the DYRHOLAEY where we were yesterday. Only this time we hike to the top of the cliff to the little lighthouse, which is not so little when you stand beside it. We climb over the fence as good photographers are supposed to do to get THE shot of the Hole in the Rock, it is really big from up here ! The sky is not the best of colours but with help from Hougaard and Isak it turns our rather nice after all. After dinner I spend another hour with my hairdryer, the boots should be okay for tomorrows outing. DAY 4 Up at 07:00 to beat the crowds, and this time we can go see the waterfall, the wind is gone. Too much spray there now that it is not being blown away, so we shoot from further away which is real pretty too. As we leave at 10:00 there is still nobody in sight, good for us ! We now get in the bus for the 210 km journey to Hali near the Jokulsarlon glacial lagoon. After we check in to the guesthouse we drive to the ice beach. This is one of my favourites, it is so scenic ! Imagine a long black beach with blocks of ice strewn all over it and big white waves crashing in on the beach creating lines and patterns in the black sand. Some blocks are like tennis balls, the big ones are easily 1x2m. We do our shots which are not the very best,  but we will be back here a few times and we are learning. DAY5 Another morning at the beach. We could sleep late and only leave for the beach at 08:30 to get there in time for sunrise. It is even better now than in the evening, the sky glows red and pink and this reflects on the wet parts of the beach creating a lovely pink glow. By 10:00 we move to the other side of the road where the lagoon is. First a coffee, then we go to photograph the ice. It is quite hard to find a good composition, the light is awful and there are no scenic ice blocks close to the shore. But we do manage to find a few cool spots. The afternoon shoot is again at the beach which  looks different once again. A fine cover of snow has made the beach and the ice blocks white, the part where the waves wash ashore is still black, the sky is a drabby grey. The whole thing looks like a black and white photo, without having to set B&W ! After dinner just as we are about to go to bed there is a knock on the door. Northern lights ! We walk a bit away from the lights of the guesthouses and set up. In the beginning it is just a faint light, luckily the camera sees it much more clearly than the human eye does. The lights come in waves which flow over us, at times they are a bright green, mostly a soft glow, but once you know where to look they are all around and above us. I have been telling Jürg I would get him an aurora for his birthday, boy is this great timing.... At midnight he turnes 50 under a sky full of green lights ! Happy birthday my love ! DAY 6 A storm is blowing and getting worse and worse, snow is piling up against the buildings and the snowflakes rush by from right to left at incredulous speed. We are not going anywhere today ! Well, except for a short walk to the museum restaurant which turns out to be a rather adventurous outing. The snow has formed big heaps on the road which we have to cross, the wind is blowing so hard we hold on to each other not to get blown away, the snowflakes come at us at such a speed that it really hurts when they hit your face. We can't stay too long, says Hafi our driver, or we will not be able to get back ! In late afternoon we get a presentation by Hougaard and Isak and reviews of our shots which we continue after dinner. We all go to bed at 21:00 as the power is off once again and there is nothing better to do in the dark with a storm at 9-10 bft howling around the building, it sounds like an endless freight train driving past. DAY7 The ice cave day ! As we wake up it is dead silent, the storm has died down ! We leave at 08:15 in  a big red monster truck on extra high wheels. Our guide Einar says he has never had so much snow to drive through, and he's been in the business a long time. After 45 very bumpy minutes and almost getting stuk twice, we finally get there. The cave is much smaller than we had expected, a very narrow path leads way to the back. There is a hole in the roof but to see it you will have to overcome any claustrofobic fears, the tunnel you wiggle yourself in, is as narrow as if you are in an MRI, tons of ice overhead....just don't think about it. As the next group approaches we leave the cave and head back to Hali for lunch, the sky looks promising. Unfortunately the weather changes for the worse, we have to leave the car at the road and walk to beach. There are loads of new ice blocks, to tell the truth, too many and too close together to get a good shot. It snows heavily. We walk further along the beach to where the ice is a little less dense and get in a few good shots before the snowstorm gets so bad that we give up. So another afternoon spent in the room, followed by a session of lightroom editing and photo reviews. Will give the ice beach another go tomorrow and hope for a sensational sunrise. If we succeed will be in part 2 of the ICY ICELAND story. Text and Photo's By: Astrid and Jurg Bluemel"
19,Blended Learning About Wildlife: Saint John’s River and the Hontoon Dead River in Florida,travel-leisure," September through May is an excellent time to take student travel groups on an eco tour of the Saint John’s River.  Student travelers will be fascinated by the famous manatee, the gigantic sea creature with a Buddha-like personality.  At the intersection of Blue Spring State Park and Saint John’s River, students are likely to see this joyous creature that visits the back-waterways of Florida seasonally, where there are warm waters and plenty to eat. The world of reptiles, wading birds and more awaits the eager student of the environment who will learn more about Central Florida through active immersion in the natural world. Classroom Preparation for the Adventure of Saint John’s River Have students engage in online studies about wading birds such as the blue heron, wood duck or water thrushes. In reptile species, students can investigate alligators, turtles, frogs, lizards or snakes – all plentiful in the Central Florida region. Or, perhaps they are interested in studies about bottlenose dolphins and river otters or even muskrats- all native to this eco-system. Why Are People So Fascinated with the Manatee? Also known as the ‘sea cow’ the manatee has a bizarre yet fascinating appearance.  Its overly large body is buoyant while its head is small in comparison.  A set of docile eyes gives the manatee the natural look of compassion and empathy not seen in many species.  The manatee lives in the Saint John’s River from November-March. During this time no swimming or boating activity may occur at manatee protected areas – including Blue Spring State Park. Student travel groups may still observe them in their winter habitat.  This part of Saint John’s River provides the warmth and food the manatee need and all who visit love to gaze on the many manatee that gather in the River. Riverboat tours of the Saint John’s River The upper Saint John’s River provides diverse swampy habitats and boating activities are not restricted during manatee season.  Upriver, there are an assortment of riverboat tours to choose from. Schedule a boat tour in advance in conjunction with a student travel company. Touring the river like this will give students a chance for close observation of many species of mammals, reptiles or birds they have studied beforehand.  A science or environment teacher’s presence enhances the experience.  On board, students will listen as a tour guide points out and describes different habitats and parts of the river, while students look closely for the animals that live in Central Florida’s inland rivers. Facts About the Saint John’s River & the Hontoon Dead River in Florida The Saint Johns River is unusual because it flows south to north, is relatively young (5,000 years old), and runs a length of 310 miles. Yet, it flows very slowly, making it the perfect environment for a student group study of an eco system.  The Saint Johns River basin is inhabited by 3.5 million people and spans 8,840 square miles. The northern end is in a warm temperate climate while the southern end of Saint John’s River is in a subtropical climate. This student tour focuses on the area close to Orlando, or Central Florida. A canal links the Saint John’s River to the Hontoon Dead River.  A dead river is very much alive. What distinguishes it from other rivers is there is little current. Snake Creek is another tributary that surrounds Hontoon Island State Park.  This is another warm water refuge for manatees and is protected by the State of Florida.  Manatees are reportedly friendly to paddlers on the Hontoon Dead River. The marshy landscape beyond the island is lined by Cypress Swamps and hardwood hammocks. Here, waterfowl, reptiles and various swamp vegetation can be studied by student groups. The slow movement of the river is an advantage. Central Florida Eco Tour for Student Travelers With a span of 310 miles there is so much to see on the Saint Johns River.  Each of the tributaries has something different to offer, too. The most exciting thing for students will most likely be sighting manatees or even getting close.  However, boat tours can only get so close to see them in season without disrupting their protected natural environments. The boat tour has a great deal to offer student groups by passing through different environments on the river, illustrating diversity of habitat and species. Post Trip Sharing Many students will want to post photos to their individual Facebook accounts. Why not make a community Facebook page just for the adventure?  If set-up of a special page is too complicated, consider asking the educational tour company to use their Facebook page to share these outdoor adventures.  What is important is sharing in one place on the Web, to gain differing perspectives. Pictures and captions of the class trip to Central Florida are sure to be colorful.  Sharing is a great way to engender learning. Have students collect information about the mammals, reptiles, or waterfowl they choose to study.  Share the experience of seeing actual manatee in one whole class session – using photos, film and writings captured along the way. Choose a seasoned student travel company to help make a visit to Saint John’s River spectacular and fun.

4,"Las Vegas Adventures: Finding the Best Grand Canyon Chopper, Airplane Tours",travel-leisure," Have you been thinking about touring the Grand Canyon? If you have, then it would help to know that Las Vegas flights are some of the best air tours available. You can choose from an airplane or helicopter tour, and then you get to add on fun extras. All you need to do is find the one that fits you. Helicopter Tours From Vegas One of the reasons starting your air tour in Vegas is the best bet is because those are the only tours that can land inside of the Grand Canyon. One of the tours that many people love is the chopper tour that descends into the canyon and lands on the canyon floor where a champagne picnic awaits. Your picnic is near the Colorado River, and since you'll be so close, you can even add on a float tour, and if that's not exciting enough, you could land on top of the rim instead and walk out on the famous Skywalk. The West Rim of the Grand Canyon is only 100 miles from Las Vegas, so all of the tour choppers that depart from Vegas go to the West Rim. The flight to the West Rim takes about an hour and you'll get to see a lot of beautiful scenery from the air, but it still doesn't beat the thrill you'll get when you stand over the canyon on the glass Skywalk bridge. The steel and glass platform is 4000 feet above the bottom of the canyon, and you will get the sensation that you're floating out above it. Even if you can't take a landing air tour, the flyover tours are still something to remember. They are also less expensive than landing tours. Plus, you'll even get to see Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam from the air since they are along the flight path between the canyon and Vegas. Choosing A Basic Tour Or A Deluxe Tour You have to decide if you want to book a basic or deluxe tour. Basic trips leave from Boulder City, which is 35 minutes out from the Las Vegas strip. There's a shuttle bus ride included with basic tickets. In addition, the basic tours utilize Bell Rangers and AStar helicopters. You'll still have a great flight, but there aren't the best aircraft for sightseeing. If you want something better, then be sure to book a deluxe tour. The deluxe tours depart conveniently from the Vegas Strip and they come with complimentary limousine transportation to and from your hotel. These tours are flow on modern EcoStar 130 choppers. There's a huge windshield which wraps around the whole front of the cockpit. This allows for an unrivaled sightseeing experience. The seats are bigger than in other tour helicopters, and they're laid out in a way that everyone has an unobstructed view. You'll love taking a deluxe tour, so you should upgrade if you can. Grand Canyon Airplane Tours Airplane tours are more affordable than helicopter tours and they fly along the same route. The trade off is that the planes fly higher than choppers, so that can affect your view, plus the airplanes can't descend into the canyon. However, saving a significant amount of money makes the airplane tours appealing. The airplanes can take 19 passengers on each trip, so a plane tour is a better choice if you are traveling with a group you don't want to split apart. The tours utilize planes designed for sightseeing, so they are made with big windows and the wings don't get in way of the view. So, it isn't the same as a helicopter tour, but it's the next best thing. Airplanes that depart from Las Vegas provide West Rim and South Rim tours, so that is beneficial if you want to tour the South Rim, North Rim, and eastern edge of the National Park. You'll Never Forget Your Tour Of American's Wonder With all these options, you can now see that an air tour of the Grand Canyon has a lot of potential for fun and adventure. Taking a tour out of Vegas is your best bet since you can take a bottom landing tour complete with a picnic, walk on the Skywalk, or even take an economy flight to either rim. Once you've decided on the tour you want to take, go ahead and book it in advance because Grand Canyon tours are so popular they fill up fast."
5,"Top Cities in the U.S. for Performance Tours:  NYC, Washington D.C. & Orlando",travel-leisure," High school bands, orchestras, ensembles, choirs and other student performance groups generally tour cities where they may perform in a public venue.   When arranging a band trip, I often recommend specific cities where musicians are encouraged to perform in some of the most visible public venues.  Performance groups often travel to:  New York City, Washington D.C., Orlando when traveling on the East Coast of the United States. Philadelphia and Atlanta are also popular choices for performing groups, however this piece will not offer an overview of these two cities. I have selected the most current and popular performance venues in these cities. Adjudicated performance dates and parades for marching bands in these selected locations are also noted. Working with a student travel company with experience in performance is a must for a successful trip. Whatever need a performance group may have may be planned and adjusted by a professional.  Band, orchestra and choir leaders can focus on preparing the group for performance through rehearsals, while the educational travel expert takes care of all of the necessary details for the trip. New York City Since many performing artists aspire to work on Broadway or in television or film, New York City is a premiere destination for student groups. Some of the most highly respected performance venues are located in New York City and available for booking public performances:  the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations building and Lincoln Center are all popular choices for bands, orchestras and ensembles.  Choir directors may also select The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine.  For performance groups that require adjudication (formal judging) the season for this type of festival runs from March 12-June 4. Washington D.C. Band trips headed to Washington D.C. will find a plethora of choices for performance venues. These include:  The White House Ellipse, the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Union Station, the U.S. Navy Memorial, the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall.  For more information about adjudicated festivals in Washington D.C. contact a student travel company experienced in performance booking. For bandleaders interested in participating in parades in Washington D.C., consider the National Cherry Blossom Festival or the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade.  Both occur in early spring – a great time to travel to Washington D.C. Orlando Orlando, Florida is an excellent destination for a student performance group. Universal Studios Florida provides the Star Performance Program for concert bands, marching bands, show choirs, dance teams and other performance groups.  Student groups may perform at one of the five themed islands at Universal Islands of Adventure. In Disney World, student bands, choirs, orchestras and ensembles as well as dance troupes have a variety of choices, too.  Here they may play publicly at: Magic Kingdom Park, EPCOT Center, the Disney-Hollywood Studios Theme Park and the Disney Village Marketplace. For marching bands, Disney provides several different parades in their parks.  Band trips can join the parade at Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot Center and Disney-Hollywood Studios Theme Park. Marching bands may also end up on stage after a parade for a ‘stand-up’ concert. For band leaders, choir leaders and music teachers, having the band perform to a new public audience is a large part of the reason for traveling. Students are introduced to new cities and travel experiences with fellow musicians. They rehearse more vigorously for these performances, and learn to set-up and break down a performance in an environment outside of school.  In some cases, where time and budget allow for it, an educational travel company may even be able to schedule master classes with professional musicians in conjunction with the tour. To schedule a band trip or performance tour, email info@eudcationaltravelconsultants.com or visit www.educationaltravelconsultants.com for more information."
6,"Blended Learning About September 11th, 2001",travel-leisure," Visiting New York City for the first time is an exciting experience for student tour groups.  Many students of junior high and high school age were quite young when 911 occurred. Pennsylvania and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. also suffered casualties that day in separate strikes.  Now it’s time for them to study the historical date and events that unfolded that day in the place that was the center of the world’s attention:  New York City. On this hallowed ground in Manhattan, also known as Ground Zero, a rebirth of hope and prosperity has taken place during the intermittent years. Before journeying to New York City, history and social studies teachers can prepare students with online lessons about 911.  The websites for the National September 11th Memorial and Museum and the new One World Trade Center are a great place to start.  Teachers may also ask students to research magazine and newspaper articles and television news clips of that time period- and present their findings to the class to share. Ground Zero has changed immensely since 911. It took a long span of time to remove the rubble from the site of the former Twin Towers. The rescue workers and those who carried the rubble away were sensitive enough to keep some mementos of the building and the towers to memorialize the day and better explain the events to those who were not there. New World Trade Center One World Trade Center opened to the public in 2015.  The project spanned many years in fundraising, planning and construction. One World Trade Center incorporates the materials and concepts of contemporary architecture and design.  Best of all, the newly opened One World Trade Center’s 100th floor is designed as the main observatory.  Students will love the glass elevator and the commanding view of New York City and New Jersey from the 100th floor.  Groups who visit may step into the interactive Sky Portal, which offers remote real time street viewing of the neighborhood below. After finishing the tour, students may visit the gallery to purchase one-of-a-kind souvenirs. National September 11th Memorial and Museum Also known as the 911 Memorial and Museum, this site was developed prior to the opening of One World Trade Center, and has been on most student travel itineraries since its opening in May 2014.  At the Museum, students will see the actual bedrock of the original World Trade Center and relics of the towers - such as the twisted piece of ""impact steel."" Student tour groups will learn more about first responders and victims of the catastrophe on September 11th and examine some of the personal items left behind such as:  shoes, glasses or a United Airlines lapel.  Fragments of lives lost and stories about first responders heroism make the 911 Museum a must see for students. The Memorial is arranged to celebrate each victim lost on 911 and on February 26, 1993, when the World Trade Center was bombed for the first time.  The name of each person who died in these terrorist attacks is inscribed in bronze around the twin memorial pools. There is also a survivor tree, and a memorial exhibition made up of contributions from families and loved ones. Post NYC Student Trip Chat Room Teachers who want to create a true blended learning experience of the trip will want to start either a page on Twitter.com for sharing thoughts and photos during and after the school trip to New York City or a private room where the class may post such materials and thoughts.  This activity will allow students to engage their thoughts and share videos and photos post trip – a vital part of any active learning experience. New York City is a premiere destination for student travel. To learn more about a trip to NYC that incorporates a visit to the national 911 Museum, email:  info@educationaltravelconsultants.com or visit www.educationaltravelconsultants.com."
7,Student Travel Groups Visiting New York City: Include a Tour Some of the Most Magnificent Cathedrals in the World,travel-leisure," When most people hear the word 'cathedral,' they generally think, initially of cities like London, Paris, and Rome. But it's also true that many wonders of religious architecture are located in North America. And New York City, in particular, is home to some of the most breathtaking cathedrals in the world. Which means that student travel groups headed to NYC looking to experience the full impact of architectural excess and Catholic iconography are in for a truly immersive treat. Exploring all of the Big Apple's cathedrals is a no small task. For Catholic school trip leaders, a full Cathedral Tour of NYC may be desirable. Other class trips may choose to incorporate a tour of one of New York’s cathedrals in a neighborhood they are visiting, or to expand upon the study of a historical period. Consult with an educational travel company prior to building an itinerary that showcases some of the city's most impressive cathedrals. So where is a trip leader of a student travel group to begin? This short list of cathedrals in NYC is a great place to start. Saint Patrick’s Cathedral: A NYC Landmark With its spectacular Neo-Gothic architecture and interiors modeled on the ancient churches of Italy, the world famous St. Patrick's Cathedral is a magnificent starting point for any student tour of NYC. The cathedral has over 65 stained glass windows, the most famous being its 26-foot rose window, a towering masterpiece made up of more than 10,000 pieces of glass in a dazzling variety of colors. Students can also see a statue of the Lady of Guadalupe at the Altar of the Sacred Heart, an awe-inspiring devotional site that's lit by hundreds of candles. For student groups visiting other sites in Manhattan, St. Patrick's location is perfect. It’s right in the middle of bustling midtown Manhattan, across the street from the Rockefeller Center and its ice-skating rink. A visit to Saint Patrick’s is worthwhile.  After visiting the cathedral, student tour groups may want to cap off the day with a fun-filled whirl across the ice. Saint John the Divine: The Fourth Largest Christian Church in the World The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, located in the Manhattan ""college neighborhood"" of Morningside Heights, has the notable distinction of being the fourth largest Christian church in the world. The church is known for its exquisite works of art, which include the Barberini tapestries, woven in the 17th century and inspired by the life of Christ. Saint John the Divine’s entrance is magnificent with its bronze doors, which were cast by Ferdinand Barbedienne of France, the same artist who cast the Statue of Liberty. The cathedral also has its very own cultivated Biblical gardens, which feature a wide variety of the plants and flowers that are mentioned in the Bible. Student travel groups may even take a guided rooftop walking tour, taking them up spiral staircases that wind up to the very top of the cathedral. Since Saint John the Divine is located in an academic neighborhood, groups can take the opportunity to spend part of the day touring famous nearby institutions such as: Union Theological Seminary, the Manhattan School of Music or Columbia University. Riverside Church: History and Architectural Grandeur Morningside Heights is also home to Riverside Church. As the tallest church in America (and the 24th tallest church in the world), Riverside covers two full city blocks and boasts a 392-foot bell tower. It is also known for its impressive stained glass apse dome, and for the labyrinthine ""maze"" inlaid on its floors. The church has a rich cultural and social history. Dignitaries such as Martin Luther King to Nelson Mandela have spoken there. The Riverside Church has its own theater, which is has been host to many musical and dance performances. New York City has many cathedrals in different neighborhoods, as well as churches with longstanding religious and political histories.  These three itinerary selections were made because they are in Manhattan and all student groups visit this part of New York City. To further enhance the student travel experience, work directly with an educational travel company for even more ideas on cathedrals to visit in NYC. Inquire about booking a cathedral tour that's bound to be as spiritually enlightening as it is fun and educational: email Educational Travel Consultants at info@educationaltravelconsultants.com, or visit http://www.educationaltravelconsultants.com."
8,My Favorite Las Vegas Thanksgiving Bus Tours To The Grand Canyon,travel-leisure," Vegas is such a great place to visit because it has so many exciting things to see and do. It's also the most popular place from where you can set off on a Grand Canyon bus adventure. You can take a tour any time of year, so if you want to make this Thanksgiving break special, why not take a trip to Vegas and include a canyon tour? There are tours that go to both the West Rim and the South Rim. The West Rim is closer to Vegas and you can get there in about 2 1/2 hours by bus. The ride to the South Rim takes a lot longer since the rim is situated in Arizona, so it takes about 5 1/2 hours to get there. Tours include lunch, and there are no hidden fees for taxes or other charges. Tours That Go To The West Rim The West Rim is the most popular part of the Canyon to visit, partly because it is closest to Vegas and partly because of all the fun adventures you can have there. The area is part of an Indian Reservation for the Hualapai people. The Hualapai administer some of the attractions in the area too. The Skywalk is one of the most famous of these attractions. It is a huge structure made of glass that juts out 70 feet past the edge of the rim and hangs over the canyon. You can look through the transparent floor to the bottom of the Canyon and the Colorado River that flows 4000 feet below you. Even though it takes a while to ride to the Canyon when you go by bus, you'll see lots of interesting sights along the way, including the Hoover Dam. Once you arrive at the park, you'll be given three hours to explore on your own, which is plenty of time to take a helicopter ride to the bottom of the Canyon. South Rim Bus Tours Although there aren't as many options at the South Rim, there is just as much to see. You can even add on a helicopter flight to you bus tour. One helicopter tour is a 30-minute flight that goes to the North Rim and back, and another 50-minute tour flies to the North Rim and over to the eastern edge of the park before flying back to the South Rim. The South Rim is home to many famous landmarks, including Dragoon Corridor, which is the deepest and widest part of the Canyon. You will be able to see it close up on board a helicopter. Also, buses that go to the South Rim make a quick stop at Hoover Dam just like the West Rim buses. Deluxe Tours The basic bus tours carry around 40 passengers each trip, but there is a deluxe option you can choose instead. The deluxe tours use smaller vehicles that only take 12 people per trip, so they are great if you want more comfort and privacy on your tour. Get The Best Deals Online Booking online is not only convenient, but it will also allow for you to take advantage of the best tour deals. You'll find the lowest prices on the tour operator's website because there are no added fees and commissions from third party sellers tacked on. Just buy your tour online with your credit card, and you'll lock in your seat reservations and low price. That being said, tours are incredibly popular, so you will need to book early to ensure that you won't be disappointed on Thanksgiving. Try to book your seats about two weeks in advance if possible . Conclusion A Thanksgiving tour will make this holiday one to remember. Remember that you have plenty of options, whether you want to go West Rim or South Rim, Deluxe or Standard. Book online, book early, and use your credit card for the best deals and a confirmed booking. Your tour of the Canyon is sure to be one you'll remember, and going by bus makes the tour affordable and leisurely, so you can enjoy every minute."
9,Student Trips to Washington D.C.:  Social Studies and History Students Participate in Democratic Process,travel-leisure," A student tour of Washington D.C. often includes a visit the White House or Capitol Building. Putting a visit to these sensitive government buildings on the itinerary does take special planning. For educators who want student groups to meet with representatives from their region or state, I recommend at least six months of advance planning or more. Teach Students About Participatory Democracy Social Studies and History teachers will take students through an exercise to illustrate exactly how a participatory democracy works.  First, select a representative, either a Senator or Congressman from the group’s originating district. Be open to having the group meet with aides and/or staff if the representative is not available, to discuss important issues.  Choose an experienced educational travel company to ensure a smooth visit and the optimal learning experience. Learn More About How the U.S. Capitol & the Democratic System Really Works. What would students gain from meeting with their representative and/or their staff in the Capitol Building?  A knowledge that within the democratic process, national and international as well as smaller, more personal issues can be discussed. Some smaller issues may even be resolved through participation in the democratic process.  How would a teacher initiate such a meeting between students and representatives?  A competent student tour consultant will be able to step a teacher through this process.  The result of this exercise will be to engage students in the process of democracy and the relevance and importance of expressing their views. Here are some things to consider, when organizing a student trip to Washington D.C. that includes a visit to a representative’s office in the Capitol Building. A representative or senator must be selected to approach.  The educational travel company will approach a staff member of the chosen representative and schedule a convenient time during the trip to visit the representative. The educational travel representative will conduct follow-up with the representative’s office in preparation for the visit. Teachers will prepare the class before the trip so students will visit the representative with a clear objective, and be able to communicate this precisely in speech or writing. If students have specific questions related to the topic at hand, they may ask the representative. Be prepared to meet with an aide, should the representative be called into session, or is traveling on other official business. Before or after initiating a conversation with the representative, take students on tour of the Capitol Building and watch Congress or the Senate floor in action.  Have students observe the process of democratic discussions while representatives conduct the necessary business of this country. After the trip is over and students return to the classroom, instruct them to write or give an oral presentation on their views of the democratic process. Ask them if they feel participatory democracy works. Through this exercise, students will learn that democracy is not just about voting. This real life lesson will teach students participatory democracy is what the founding fathers envisioned when they modeled the U.S. system on Grecian democracy from the classical period. At this time in Greek history, the Forum could be equated to the floor of the Capitol.  The only difference was that Ancient Greece allowed anyone to step into the forum and voice an opinion to the public.  Because of a large population - this sort of discussion is not entirely possible in the contemporary era. Instead Americans have representatives who argue on their behalf. Having a ‘Forum’ or Capitol building is one way of bringing people together.  This means the individual and groups must participate in governmental decision-making that affects them directly. Visiting a representative before he or she casts a deciding vote on a bill, budget item, military action or other concern is the way to influence political outcomes.

10,Grand Canyon National Park Chopper Travels for Thanksgiving Holiday Vacationers,travel-leisure," Thanksgiving is coming up, and that means it is time to get a little bit of relaxation, hang out with family, or even go on a sightseeing adventure. This time of the year is the perfect one to visit the Grand Canyon, and with air tours you can visit either the West Rim or the South Rim of the Canyon. Don't Miss Out One advantage to touring the canyon this time of year is the cooler weather. The cooler air temperatures actually improves visibility, so you'll have fantastic views. Because of the ideal touring conditions and the fact that holidays are busy at the canyon, you'll want to book your tour early. It's a good idea to book seats on your tour at the same time you book your hotel room so you don't forget. If you leave things too late, you will end up paying the highest prices, or even worse, you might miss out on seats. I also recommend that you book your tickets online, and pay using your credit card. This process confirms your transaction, so you can be sure your seats will be waiting for you. Another good reason to buy your tour online is the good deal you'll get by using the discounted Internet rate. The West Rim You will fly to the West Rim if you take Grand Canyon helicopter flight from Las Vegas. A lot of people prefer the West Rim because it has a lot of fun things to do and interesting things to see. You'll even get to fly over Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam on your way there. One other advantage of going to the West Rim is that it's the only place in the canyon where helicopters can fly below the rim and land on the canyon floor. The landing tours are great fun. You can land at the bottom of the canyon, where you could enjoy a Champagne picnic and a Colorado River tour. If you land at the top instead, you can visit the Skywalk. Walking on the Skywalk is an exhilarating experience because it is made of glass and you can look down to the canyon floor that's 4000 feet below you. You can even book a combination tour that lets you land on top of the rim and on the canyon floor so you can experience the Skywalk and a boat ride on the river on the same tour. Helicopter Tours Of The South Rim The Grand Canyon is so big, it is also a convenient tour if you'll be staying in Arizona rather than Nevada. Arizona travelers tour the South Rim, and all the tours depart from the airport in Tusayan where you can fly to the North Rim and back. The tour that goes over to the North Rim and back takes about 30 minutes, but you can also opt to take a longer, 50 minute tour that goes to the North Rim as well as the eastern border of the park. In that extra 20 minutes you will have the opportunity to see more of the National Park, totaling up to 75% of the total area. You'll see a lot of sights on the longer flight, and it doesn't cost that much more, so the extra expense is worth it. While your helicopter won't be able to land at the South Rim, you can still see the canyon up close if you add on a Jeep tour. The Jeep tour is a great addition to the helicopter tour because it gives you the chance to see the canyon from different perspectives. To Wrap Up Grand Canyon helicopter tours are among the most popular tours in the US, and it's easy to see why. With so many options, you'll be able to create a tour package that's filled with fun and scenic views while not busting your budget. If you want to fly for Thanksgiving, don't forget to book early, and book online. With a little bit of planning you will be set up for a trip that you will remember for the rest of your lifetime, and you will ensure that you can experience it all for the best available price."
11,Grand Canyon Helis - Enjoying a Tour Over the Fall Holiday Season,travel-leisure," There may be a cold nip in the air, but there is still plenty of time left for another fun outdoor adventure. Summer may be gone, but cooler weather has its perks. The weather has calmed down and the air is crystal clear, so there is no better time to take an air tour of the amazing Grand Canyon. Lift Off These fun tours set off from two different locations. Tours take off from Arizona in Tusayan, which is near the South Rim, and from the Vegas Strip and Boulder City in Nevada. The tours are a little different in each location, so lets see what they entail. Vegas Area Tours Las Vegas is about 100 miles from the West Rim. When you fly from Vegas to the West Rim, you'll get an aerial view of the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead too. You can take an air-only tour out of Vegas or you can take a landing tour where you are dropped off at the canyon for some fun. If you pick a landing tour, you can decide if you want to land on the top of the rim or if you want to fly down into the canyon and land on the bottom. The choppers that land on the canyon floor let you out near the Colorado River, which is the force responsible for carving out the canyon in ancient times. A champagne picnic awaits you on the bottom of the canyon, and when you finish your snack, you can take a relaxing boat ride along the river. If you're going to book a landing tour that sets down on top of the rim, be sure to buy tickets to the Grand Canyon Skywalk too. The Skywalk is an interesting structure made of huge glass panels you can walk out on and peer down to the canyon floor 4000 feet below you. Air-only tours are fun too, and although you'll miss out on fun adventures on the ground, you'll still see all the highlights from the air. South Rim Tours Departing From Arizona Although most tours depart from Vegas, you can start a tour in Tusayan if you'll be staying in Arizona or if you want to tour the South Rim instead of the West Rim. If you are in Vegas and want to take a tour of the South Rim, you can book a tour package that comes with an airplane ride to Tusayan where you can transfer to your South Rim tour. The South Rim has two tours to choose from. One is a thirty-minute flight that goes from the South Rim to the North Rim and then comes back. The other option is an hour long tour that covers the same ground as the shorter tour and then some. This flight also goes all the way to the eastern park border, and in total it flies over 3/4 of the National Park. The longer tour is definitely worth the small increase in price because you get to see so much more. Not a lot of people can say they've seen that much of the Grand Canyon. Choosing The Deluxe Tour You'll also have to decide if you want to take the basic tour or if you want to upgrade to the deluxe version. The basic tours fly on older-style helicopters while the deluxe tours fly on modern sightseeing aircraft. Deluxe tours fly on EcoStar choppers and these were specifically designed for sightseeing so they have roomy cabins, bucket seats with no obstructed views, and panoramic viewing through the wraparound windshield. If you want to tour the Grand Canyon from the air, then you'll have the best experience in one of these choppers. The deluxe tours lift off from the Strip in Vegas, so you'll get complimentary transportation from and back to your resort in a limousine. you'll get to see the resorts from the air on your return flight. The view of Vegas in the evening is a beautiful and exciting sight from the air. Wrapping Up Taking an air tour of the Grand Canyon is quite an adventure, and you should do it as soon as you can. First, decide if you want a landing tour or an air only tour, then decide which rim you want to see, and finally select a basic or deluxe tour. Since there are so many options, your sure to find something you like. You'll find the best deals on Grand Canyon tours online, and when you find one you like, book it early because they fill up fast. The canyon deserves its designation as a world wonder. Be sure to see it while you can. Visit the canyon this autumn and you can enjoy the cool weather and crisp air that lets you see for miles."
12,Grand Canyon National Park Heli & Airplane Tour Promotions for Halloween Weekend,travel-leisure," Halloween is just around the corner, and it's the perfect occasion for taking a little vacation. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary to do, why not try a Grand Canyon flight from either Las Vegas, or Arizona. You can take a helicopter tour or an airplane tour and customize your tour package with a variety of options. All you need to do is choose one that fits your taste and your budget. Best Grand Canyon Chopper Tours Flights run all year around, except for Christmas Day, so you don't need to worry about special schedules over Halloween. The Nevada flights lift off from the Vegas Strip, Henderson, and Boulder City in Nevada. If you'll be in Arizona instead, then departing from Tusayan is more convenient since the airport in Tusayan is near the gates at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. One reason you may prefer to book a Vegas tour over a Tusayan tour is that the flights that depart from Vegas are allowed to land at the Grand Canyon's West Rim. The air-only tours are fun too, but the landing tours pack in extra adventure. You can book a landing tour that sets down on top of the rim or one that flies deep into the Canyon and lands on the Canyon floor, plus, you can choose to do both if you want. At the bottom you could indulge in a Champagne picnic or even a Colorado River tour, whereas the top of the Canyon has the famous Skywalk. The Skywalk is a stunning glass and metal platform which sits almost 4000ft above the bottom of the Canyon. It seems like you're walking on air. You can purchase air flights that include Skywalk tickets in the package. Although you can't take a landing tour from Arizona, you will still be in for some spectacular sightseeing. There are two choices in the tours based on the amount of flight time they offer. One tour lasts about a half an hour, while the second tour is nearly an hour long. I recommend the second option because it shows you much more of the park, taking you to the North Rim, the eastern boundary, and back to the South Rim. In all, the longer tour covers about 3/4 of the national park, and it is one of the most comprehensive tours available. Basic And Deluxe Tours You have your choice of flying on a basic or deluxe tour. Basic tickets offer fantastic views, albeit inside slightly older helicopters. Even though they aren't considered the ultimate in sightseeing aircraft, they are still safe to ride in and you'll have great views. The best flights are on deluxe tours, and they are worth the extra cost. Deluxe tours use EcoStar 130 helicopters. They have roomier cabins and you'll be a lot more comfortable during your tour. They also have the best seating arrangement for sightseeing, and they also have a huge viewing windscreen that is designed for sightseeing. If you choose deluxe in Vegas, then you will fly from the Strip and receive a limousine shuttle service. Basic tours depart from just outside of Vegas, and use standard shuttle services. Grand Canyon Airplane Tours There are also airplane tours that offer the same routes as helicopters at the North Rim and South Rim. The drawback to an airplane tour is that the airplanes have to fly higher, so the views aren't quite as good as what you get in a helicopter. Plane tours are fun and scenic though, and they are the perfect option if you're touring with a group because an airplane can hold up to 19 people per flight. Airplane tours also cost less than both basic and deluxe helicopter tours, so if you're flying on a budget, you should seriously consider taking an airplane. Conclusion So, which tour sounds like fun? Deluxe or basic? Will you tour by plane or chopper? Will you tour the West Rim or the South Rim? You'll have a lot of choices, that's for sure. My recommendation is that you fly from the area that's most convenient for you, and choose the best package that you can afford. Booking a tour with a fun perk like a champagne picnic on the canyon floor is something you'll never forget. Halloween is right around the corner, so you should make your booking within the next week. Book online for the best deals and seat confirmation, and prepare yourself for a sightseeing vacation that is unlike anything else on earth."
13,Staying Healthy Whereas Traveling,travel-leisure," Traveling On this topic, I will be focusing on traveling by air. The constant flyer, who tours totally different countries, across totally different time zones is long-faced with lots of stressors which can contribute to the degradation of the best health standing. An unobserved and unsuspected lenience on traveling across time zones may also result in affected psycho-social behavior due to the new places and environmental catalysts that are bombarded on the various senses of the body. Staying healthy whereas traveling could be a key issue wherein the individual ought to maintain a high state of wellness to forestall complications towards diseases after his/her trip. Jet lag Blues The most common impact of constant traveling across different time zones is that of  jet lag. Jet lag is outlined as the feeling of a person getting similar symptoms like extreme tiredness, lack of sleep, and general moodiness caused by a tired mind. The new environment and therefore, the new culture, furthermore because the new body clock system could distort the traditional time for rest of an individual. This is able to cause consistent stress on the body functions, ensuing to an inefficient output of energy by the various organs that are dependent on round the clock settings. Jet lag is usually completely established some days at max by an individual, till such time, that internal equilibrium is achieved by manually adjusting sleep and dietary patterns with the new place. Dehydration is one in all the most offender Another reason that causes discomfort on an individual such as headaches and nausea is caused by fluid deficiency during the flight.

15,Grand Canyon National Park Choppers - Finest Halloween Tour Deals Ever!,travel-leisure," Halloween will be here at the end of the month, and while many will be out trick-or-treating and taking part in some spooky festivities, there are plenty of people who like to take this time of year to fit in a short vacation before Christmas. What better vacation is there than an air tour at the Grand Canyon? These tours depart from Tusayan in Arizona, and Boulder City and Las Vegas in Nevada. Flights are operational as usual on Halloween, in fact, the air tours operate every day except Christmas Day. High demand is expected for the end of October, though, so make sure you book as soon as possible. Las Vegas Helicopter Tours The helicopter tours that operate out of Vegas and Boulder City in Nevada all fly to the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. There are several fun things to do at the West Rim such as taking a boat ride on the Colorado River and seeing the Grand Canyon Skywalk. Of course, you'll have to take a landing tour if you want to add some fun adventures to your flight package. The West Rim is the only part of the Canyon where you can land at the top of the rim, or at the riverside below. The air tour is a lot of fun in its own right, even if you don't add on a landing adventure. You will fly out past Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, before making a scenic pass over of the Canyon. The best way to see the Grand Canyon is from a chopper, and you'll have plenty of beautiful sights to see. If you can work it into your budget, I do recommend taking a landing tour. Landing tours travel the same route as the air-only tours, with the added bonus that you can land at the Canyon. Plus, walking out on the Skywalk and standing 4000 feet above the Canyon floor on a plate of glass is an experience you don't want to miss. While the view from the air is amazing, you'll also be amazed at the view of the Canyon walls while floating along the Colorado River when you add on a boat tour. You can even combine different packages to make sure that you experience everything that there is to see. One of the bottom landing tours includes a Champagne picnic so you can toast your thrilling descent to the Canyon floor and the flight of a lifetime. South Rim Tours Even though you can't take a landing tour at the South Rim, there are plenty of other reasons to go there. One of the South Rim tours flies you over to the North Rim. The North Rim is interesting because it is so remote, in fact, it is so remote that it is one of the least traveled sections of the Grand Canyon National Park. Other Grand Canyon helicopters that fly here offer a longer flight that lets you see the remote North Rim as well as all of the park over to the eastern boundary. This second option is so extensive that you will see three quarters of the National Park. For just a little extra, it is easy to recommend the second option. Tour Helicopters Different types of helicopters are used on the various tours, and if you want the best ride, you should book a deluxe tour. Deluxe tours ensure that you will fly in an EcoStar 130 helicopter. This chopper is roomier and has comfortable seats, plus it is quieter and best of all, it has a huge wraparound window that gives you panoramic, unobstructed views. As an added bonus, the deluxe tours that take off from Vegas depart right from the Las Vegas Strip and pick you up at your hotel in a limo. Compare that to taking a basic tour, which requires a shuttle bus ride to Boulder City where your chopper departs. Paying more to upgrade to a deluxe tour means you will receive the most convenience, comfort, and views on your tour. So if it fits in your budget, be sure to book a deluxe tour. However, don't worry if you want to book a basic tour instead, even a basic tour of the Grand Canyon is a fabulous experience. Conclusion Halloween is an exciting time of year, but yours could be even more special with a Grand Canyon helicopter. When you book an air tour, you can add on different fun adventures to create the perfect getaway for your schedule and budget. Also, book your tour now, or it might be sold out if you wait. Book your tour online too, so you can use the low Internet rate and get a great deal on a fun holiday adventure."

17,Las Vegas Strip - Best Chopper Trips to the Grand Canyon,travel-leisure," Taking a helicopter tour from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon is one of the best ways to see the national park. Here are a few tips you should know before you book your tour. Although it seems like all the tours depart from Las Vegas, some of them actually lift off from the nearby cities of North Las Vegas, Henderson, or Boulder City. Those departure points are okay, but you can save some commute time by booking a flight that departs from the Strip in Vegas. Lights Of Vegas One fun reason to book a helicopter tour that departs from the Strip is that you get to see Neon Boulevard and all it's colorful lights on your return flight from the canyon. You'll see the lights twinkle in the sky as you travel from Stratosphere Tower to the famous Luxor Pyramid. Not only that you'll see the Manhattan skyline of the New York-New York, the Bellagio fountains, the Paris Eiffel Tower, and the MGM Emerald City. As a bonus, this selection gives you free pick up from your hotel and back in a stretch limo. If it's a special occasion like an anniversary, birthday or honeymoon, this will make it even more memorable. Another benefit of the Strip departure tours is that they fly on EcoStar 130 choppers. The EcoStar is the premium sightseeing chopper and it is ideal for touring the Grand Canyon. It features a cabin 25% larger than basic tour helicopters, climate control, and comfortable stadium seating. The aircraft has a 180-degree panoramic windshield for the best views below you, plus the chopper is designed to give you a nice, smooth flight. The other helicopters used in basic tours just don't compare. Tour Options The first decision you have to make is if you want to take an air-only tour or if you want to land at the canyon. Both types of tours follow the same route so you get to see Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, the canyon, and the Colorado River from the air, but the landing tours are the only ones that actually land at the canyon. The air-only tours take you over all the main landmarks and scenic high points in the region and the fly on back to Vegas without landing. You'll see the same sights on a landing tour but you'll also get to land on the top or bottom of the rim and get out and enjoy fun activities on foot. One tour that is really fun is one that flies down to the canyon floor where a champagne picnic is waiting for you. A Colorado River boat ride and Skywalk VIP tickets can also be added on this tour. It is very important that you book your flight online as early as possible. Seats on Grand Canyon helicopter tours fill up fast. Plus, if you book early, you will have your flight secured and save money. You should book your room and your flight the same day. Even waiting as long as 48 hours in advance could be too long, and if the tour isn't sold out, you'll probably have to pay more. Once tour day arrives, be sure to dress for the weather at the canyon. It's hot there in the summer and it can get up to 100 degrees easily. Wear loose clothing with breathable fabrics to keep you cool. Carry extra water with you and protect yourself from the sun by wearing sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. If you take one of the landing tours wear sensible, comfortable tennis shoes with grip; the canyon floor is often rugged. Bring a salty snack to keep up your energy, there's a lot to see. Get Ready For Some Fun The chopper tours that depart from the Vegas Strip are convenient and offer the utmost in comfort and options. You'll get an aerial view of Vegas as well as free limo transportation. Fortunately, these tours utilize the EcoStar 130 chopper, so no matter where you sit, you'll get a great view. Since these air tours offer it all, you want to make sure to book these trips well in advance. If you delay, the tour may be sold out, and if you do get a seat, you'll probably have to pay more for it."
18,Try A 1-Day Grand Canyon Float Tour Before Season Finishes,travel-leisure," If you're looking for a fun outdoor adventure to help you beat the heat, then a raft tour of the Grand Canyon could be the answer. The tours operate daily at the Grand Canyon National Park. These are some tours that you don't want to miss out on. Tours Are Popular Each tour only runs once daily, so that means seats are limited. When you book your rafting trip, you can make it even more exciting by adding some upgrades to your tour. The basic tour takes you by bus to the Glen Canyon Dam, but if you want to add some fun, you can book a trip that comes with a Jeep tour and airplane transportation to the Dam. This tour takes you through stunning landmarks like the Horseshoe Bend. There are so many interesting things to see, you'll want to take lots of photos. Touring By Raft The rafting tour covers 15 miles of the Colorado River as it winds through the Grand Canyon. It goes through Horseshoe Bend and some other beautiful landing nooks along the way. There is lunch included with the package, and on one of the stops you can even enter the secret canyon at Petroglyph Beach. Here you can connect with the energy of the ancient settlers, before you get back to the excitement of Grand Canyon rafting. The rafts can hold up to 19 passengers, and they're built for adventure. This tour stays on the smooth water section of the Colorado River, so there are no dangerous rapids or currents to navigate. Since the waters are smooth, the tours are kid-friendly and kids have a blast on these trips. Since the raft carries so many people, it's a perfect outing for an extended family trip or a company adventure. Just be sure you book your tour early so you can get as many seats as you need. Don't forget to bring everything you need for a full day outdoors. Bring a waterproof bag where you can keep a change of clothes, and any snacks and accessories. Bottled water comes in handy too. Don't forget to apply sunscreen at appropriate times throughout the day, and try to wear lightweight clothing that covers up as much as possible, and bring a wide brimmed hat. It gets very hot in the canyon from the intense rays of the sun, so you definitely want to be prepared for it. Wrapping Up As an added bonus, you'll have an expert guide on your river tour that will bring the area to life. The tour guide makes sure you don't miss seeing important landmarks and other areas of interest. So don't forget to book your tour early, and do it online. If you're looking for the budget tour, book the one that transports you to the Dam by bus. If you can afford to spend more, opt for the upgrade that comes with a plane ride and Jeep tour, because it's a lot of fun. The Grand Canyon is a popular tourist destination for a reason, it's one of the most unique places in America. Supercharge your summer with a trip to the Canyon and a day out on a Colorado River float tour."
19,Grand Canyon National Park Helicopters Are The Top National Park Thrill Trip,travel-leisure," Try a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon and you'll enjoy an adventure that surpasses your wildest dreams. Any other experience will not compare to doing it all in a chopper. These tours take off daily year round and have so many options available that you are bound to find the flight of your dreams. Get Going! An air tour can depart from two main sites, directly from Las Vegas, NV, or the South Rim, close to Tusayan, AZ. While both tours offer various air or ground tours, only those leaving from Las Vegas and the West Rim offer flights that venture beneath the rim and land on the canyon floor. The National Park Service has banned flight below the South Rim because of noise restrictions. Vegas Voyage! The Vegas tours start your sightseeing immediately. You'll see Lake Mead, the 16th largest man-made lake, the Colorado River and the vastness of the Grand Canyon. Landing tours fly to the bottom of the canyon, the top or a combination of both. One tour even lands for a Champagne toast and picnic on the ground. Another amazing tour combines a helicopter tour with a peaceful float on the Colorado River for 11.3 miles. Your rafting journey begins below the towering Hoover Dam and takes you through the dark volcanic rock walls of Black Canyon. The rafting portion ends in Willow Beach's emerald waters. Don't forget to swim in this oasis, worlds away from the desert. This tour departs early morning once a day. South Rim Views South Rim tours are famously air only and offer spectacular views. Two options are available, depending on how much time or money you want to spend. The 30-minute tour flies round trip from the South Rim to the North Rim. The 50-minute tour, goes from rim to rim, but also includes views of up to 75% of the entire Park. If you're looking for more, consider the package that bundles a 30-minute helicopter tour with a Jeep ride. This combo visits the most recognized stops in the park and gives the best canyon experience. At Mather Point, you see the canyon stretch out in brilliant colors for miles. The path the Colorado has cut through the canyon will be on full display at Yavapai Point. You can also take a break at Grand Canyon Village, a century-old site full of spectacular views, shops, and historic buildings. This is a definite tour for those eager to see the most of the canyon. Which Way To Fly? The basic or deluxe tour type depends on the helicopter used. Basic tours utilize the standard Bell Ranger or A Star. Fine crafts for flying, but they lack climate and noise control. The deluxe tour uses the EcoStar 130 that boasts a cabin 25% larger than basic tours, deluxe stadium seating, and climate control. The EcoStar is also quieter and offers a smoother ride than other choppers. Plus its 180-degree wrap around windshield allows for amazing views. So Many Choices There are a lot of great helicopter tours from which to choose. Hopefully, this article has narrowed the choices down. Deluxe flights generally have more value, not to mention they're comfortable and offer much more of the Grand Canyon experience. I personally recommend the Las Vegas Champagne picnic tour or the South Rim tour that includes access to a Jeep tour. Whichever one suits you, make sure you book online early before these popular air tours sell out."
20,Shuttle Service to Port Canaveral,travel-leisure," Transportation is the most convenient way to go from one place to another.

1,Living History Makes Student Travel to Washington DC and Williamsburg Memorable,travel-leisure," Watching history come alive can be a great way to engage student travel groups when visiting the Washington D.C. area.  Living history programs are character reenactments from Revolutionary, Colonial and Civil War eras of American history. Attending one will give historically accurate information garnered directly from texts. Living history programs challenge students to take a deeper look at the characters that created the historical accounts read in the classroom today. Mount Vernon, a Treasure of American History, Inhabited by Characters What sorts of characters become known throughout time? Leaders do.  Mount Vernon is a well-preserved site of one of the favorite founding fathers, George Washington and his second wife, Mary.  The Mount Vernon property is teeming with life.  Also known as Ferry Farm, this estate is populated with many of the characters of living history, including the proprietors, George and Mary Washington themselves.  Students can inhabit different parts of the estate and be exposed to different viewpoints, from viewing slave quarters, to the working farm and mill, to the interior of Mount Vernon itself. Recreating Mount Vernon as a Working Colonial Estate Today, students might refer to a property like Mount Vernon as ‘sustainable living.’ Everything needed to feed, clothe and house the many inhabitants and visitors of the estate was cultivated here. A tour of Mount Vernon that includes living history presentations could easily take half a day. Students groups will watch and listen as re-enactors make wool and refine locally grown flax into fiber and show how horses treading wheat to remove seeds. Student tour groups can listen in to a conversation of the overseer, the blacksmith, or George Washington himself. Living history makes learning more interactive and gives students an entirely new perspective of history. Social Studies and history teachers may want to combine a tour of Washington D.C. and Mount Vernon with a few days in Williamsburg, Virginia. Give student groups the opportunity for total immersion in the 18th Century time period while they tour the former capital of Virginia with Living History around every corner. The 18th Century Capital of the Colonies: Williamsburg, VA Colonial Williamsburg is the largest living history museum in the world. In the 1920s, John D. Rockefeller invested in the languishing historical buildings in Williamsburg. He hired the best artisans and restoration experts to rebuild the town correctly. Today, the former 18th Century capital of Virginia is the perfect setting for students to experience living history. Imagine walking the streets of Williamsburg and being immersed into the 18th Century style of living. Students will see many of Colonial Williamsburg’s character actors passing in the cobblestone streets in 18th Century garb. The old buildings all look the same as they did then - made of red brick and mortar.  The shops include a blacksmith, candle maker, and a silversmith, among others. Inside some of the Colonial homes, the servants are busy with everyday tasks.  Students will watch and listen and may ask questions. As they walk through, they will see servants working in the gardens or kitchens of an authentic Colonial home, clothed in the garb of the 18th Century and using implements and foods harvested there and common in that era. For another type of interactive experience, group leaders may opt to prearrange a lunch or dinner at an authentic tavern in Colonial Williamsburg. Each of the characters encountered on the streets of Williamsburg speaks in Colonial tongue and has a story to tell about their place in time.  The Court House and the Armory have been restored to their former character. Student groups may watch living history programs in the courthouse specially designed for learning about Colonial law in Virginia, through the eyes of those who were judged.  Or, take a student group on an evening tour of the ""Ghosts Among Us"" or ""Pirates Amongst Us"" to stimulate their imagination and recollection of the way history unfolded for some. Jamestown Settlement Students will love visiting Jamestown Settlement - another full immersion into the 17th Century.  Just down the road from Colonial Williamsburg, situated on the James River, is where the first colonists landed in 1607.  Board the replicas of the three ships, see a Powhatan village as it was in the 17th Century, and enter the replica of James Fort, the original home of new settlers in this country.  Students will hear character actors speak from a variety of perspectives, including: common sailors, maids, Indians, and even the King James I. Learning about history through books and film can be a great foundation for a student trip to Washington D.C. and Williamsburg. Living history programs provide a more intense and focused investigation into history, one that engages the student and makes a definite mark upon memory. After experiencing the characters of history the memory is attached to a real place. ""The willing suspension of disbelief"" is required for a full (and fun) immersion into Early American history. The character actors do an excellent job of bringing all of the props, setting and the stories to life.  Teachers can augment the experiential learning by assigning follow-up writing exercises or creating quizzes for students to observe and answer questions while on tour.

2,Blended Learning: Art Students View Guggenheim & MOMA Collections Online and Tour NYC,travel-leisure," The virtual tour of a historical site, art museum or even a college or university has become the standard for many websites’ online visitors.   As an educational tour consultant for many years, I do not recommend that students gain their whole experience from the online tour of an art museum.  There is no replacement for seeing art in person. I always encourage a visit to at least one major museum when student groups travel to a city like Washington D.C. or New York City. Nowadays, teachers can more easily prepare students for a student trip to New York City by virtually taking their classroom to the destination and specific sites in that place, such as museums.  This is the beginning of a blended learning experience. Visiting the actual destination and seeing current exhibitions and authentic paintings or sculptures complements the online viewing experience. A visit to New York City allows students to wander inside the museum, the district and the community – learning to see art as part of the fabric of life. I want to focus on two specific international art museums in New York City – The Guggenheim Museum and Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).  Part of these museums’ permanent collections are available for viewing online - with more being digitized and added. The permanent collection of many museums is not available for viewing at all times. Often major works of art are in storage. Some are in the restoration process, while some are only displayed for special shows or regular exhibits and rotated back into storage. The work of famous artists also goes on tour and is leant to other museums.  Traveling art brings notoriety and resources to a museum. All of this may frustrate the art student and teacher.   Exposure to the works of the masters helps students acquire new techniques and gain inspiration from fellow artists ideas about color, form and theme. Teachers can more easily develop lesson plans around the work of specific artists in these digital collections.  Or, perhaps teachers will focus on studying periods of art, and the type of work and artists who defined that era. Let’s step through a sample blended learning exercise, utilizing digital works in these two collections to understand Modern Art of the first part of the 20th Century. First, go to the page on the MOMA website where you can search for artists: http://www.moma.org/collection/works?classifications= Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) MOMA is named after the Modern Art period and has an outstanding collection, with 200,000 works of modern and contemporary art in the collection and 61,000 works available online.  A look into Pablo Picasso’s work will show students that Picasso was an adept painter who also made lithographs. Students can even view the drawings that later became paintings - gaining insight into Picasso’s artistic process. Guggenheim Museum Now, let’s visit the Guggenheim’s collection, and see more work by this master painter who took Paris by storm. Visit:  http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online and search for ‘Picasso.’  Guggenheim’s collection contains many selected and famous paintings by Picasso, beginning in the early part of his career in 1900 and ending in 1965.  Art students can observe and analyze the evolution of an artist, beginning with an interest in painting the figure and people, and evolving into a fascination for abstraction.  By viewing Picasso’s work, students will understand why he is often referred to as the progenitor of Cubism. As students are tasked with viewing Picasso on their own, they will learn more from Moma.org and the Guggenheim’s website about the subject matter of individual pieces. Picasso’s contemporaries, such as Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are also mentioned in painting descriptions and Picasso’s biography. Complementing these studies in the classroom, a visit to MOMA or the Guggenheim Museum to see some of the actual works of Picasso or his contemporaries is an excellent way to blend the classroom experience with real world encounters.  Students can wander around the interior of the museums, viewing real works and learning more about the Manhattan communities where MOMA and the Guggenheim are located. The number of masterpieces in museum collections in New York City is staggering.  To have these works available for viewing online is a phenomenal leap. This can be said for other large urban museums housing collections as well.   The number of digital masterpieces available will continue to grow and expand. Use technology and student tours as a means of inspiring students to gain insights through careful study of the masters who have gone before them.

3,Vegas Helis: Top Flights Landing at Bottom of Grand Canyon,travel-leisure," Although you can fly to the Grand Canyon from both Nevada and Arizona, only the Las Vegas tours offer you landing packages. If you want the best flight you can get, then you will take a deluxe tour from the brightest city in the desert. Get To The Canyon In Under An Hour A side trip is a nice break from the excitement of Vegas since it is just a short 45 minute to the West Rim. The flight is scenic in itself, and you get to see the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead along the way. Touring the canyon is an amazing experience. And seeing it from the air in a helicopter makes it even better. Actually being able to land inside the canyon and step outside, is something that cannot be compared to. You can only do this from Las Vegas, with flights that go either inside the canyon, or that land on the top of the West Rim. If you want to descend to the bottom of the canyon, then the champagne picnic tour is a good one to take. Your helicopter will land near the Colorado River where you can toast the experience as you gaze at the colorful canyon walls towering above you. This tour comes with other upgrades too, such as a boat ride on the river and a flight to the top of the rim for some more sightseeing adventures. The Amazing Skywalk Try to visit the top of the rim so you can try out the Skywalk. The Skywalk is a huge platform that's made from glass panels that lets you look down to the canyon floor 4000 feet below you. Even after spending time on a helicopter tour, the Skywalk is an exhilarating experience. Choosing Your Tour You can choose a basic helicopter tour or upgrade to a deluxe one. Either one provides great views and a fun experience, but the deluxe tours have some nice perks. One thing that separates the tours is that the basic tours lift off from an airfield in Boulder City, which is a suburb of Las Vegas. If you can swing the extra cost of a deluxe flight, you should consider it. The tours utilize the state-of-the-art EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. They are roomy, comfortable, quiet, and provide unobstructed viewing. Getting to ride in a helicopter that provides a comfortable ride and panoramic viewing makes the price of a deluxe tour worthwhile. Deluxe tours come with a complimentary limousine service, they depart from The Strip, and you will also be able to enjoy a Las Vegas flyover, which is especially impressive if you choose a sunset tour. Buy Your Tour In Advance My rule of thumb is to book right after you have organized your accommodation. Helicopter tours of the canyon are always popular, so try to get your seats locked in about two weeks in advance. Also, buy your tickets online so you can cut out the markup added by travel agents. Buying your tour online is easy when you use your credit card, and it will qualify you for the low Internet rate and instant confirmation of your flight reservations. Get Ready For Some Fun A helicopter tour of the West Rim is a lot of fun. With so many options to have the perfect adventure, there's no excuse not to take an air tour while you're in Las Vegas. Don't forget to buy your tour early and buy it online. Don't miss out on your chance to witness one of the world's great natural wonders, from a vantage point that only a helicopter can provide."

5,Grand Canyon National Park Attractions - Try A Summer Sightseeing Flight,travel-leisure," Summer is almost gone, so it's time to plan a fun getaway to send it off in style. What could be more fun than taking an air tour of the Grand Canyon? If that sounds like a good plan, then here are some tips for having a great time and getting a good deal. Prepare For Hot Weather Even though summer is about gone, the temperatures are still hot at the canyon. Temperatures can soar about midday, so if you want to stay cool, pick a tour that leaves early in the morning or later in the afternoon. Sunrise and sunset tours are idea because it's cooler then, and also, the scenery is a lot more colorful. The helicopters used on these tours offer climate control, so you'll be comfortable while you're in the air, but if you take a landing tour, be prepared for the intense heat when you get out of the chopper. You'll want to wear lightweight clothes and sun protection in the form of sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. EcoStar 130 Choppers Offer Deluxe Flights Some Grand Canyon flights that depart from Vegas fly on the EcoStar 130 choppers. You'll get optimum views from one of the helicopters, and your ride will be comfortable too. The comfy seats are arranged stadium style, and that means there are no bad views, so you'll be able to see everything without obstructions in your line of vision, and you'll have plenty of personal space for added comfort. You'll be glad you booked a tour on one of these helicopters when you see the massive windscreen that wraps around the front of the chopper giving you panoramic views. As an added bonus, you'll get complimentary limousine service to and from your Vegas hotel when you book a deluxe flight in an EcoStar 130. In addition, the deluxe tours depart conveniently from the Vegas Strip, and the basic tours depart from Boulder City, which is a shuttle ride away. Helicopters on the Grand Canyon flights that take off from Las Vegas go only to the West Rim, and this is the only portion of the canyon where choppers can descend into the canyon and land on the floor. You can book a landing tour that lets you out on top of the rim or on the canyon floor Both options are fun, and if you have enough time, you can explore both areas of the West Rim. South Rim Air Tours If you want to take a helicopter tour of the South Rim, you'll need to depart from the airport in Tusayan, Arizona instead of Las Vegas. These tours are a totally different experience since they fly along the North and South Rims. You can choose from two tours. One option is a flight that goes to the North Rim and back, and this one lasts about 30 minutes. The other tour option follows the same flight path as the 30-minute tour initially, but it also adds on a jaunt over to the eastern edge of the national park. This longer tour is very comprehensive since it takes you over about 75 percent of the Grand Canyon National Park on its flight that lasts nearly an hour. Although your helicopter won't land in the canyon, you can still explore the canyon from the ground by booking a Jeep tour out of Tusayan. The Jeep tour is a fun way to add some adventure to your trip and see the canyon up close and personal. Booking a tour package that includes an air tour with a Jeep tour is the ideal way to experience the beauty of the South Rim and all it's wilderness area and famous landmarks. If you plan to be in Vegas, but you want to tour the South Rim, all you have to do is fly from Vegas to Tusayan by plane, which takes about an hour, and then you can begin your helicopter or Jeep tour. Book Now And Lock In Your Seats Helicopter tours of the Grand Canyon are very popular and they fill up fast. Book your tour in advance so you can claim your seats before they're gone, and if you buy your tour online using your credit card, you can get the best deal. The best price on Grand Canyon tours is the internet rate you find online, plus when you book online, you'll get confirmation your seats are locked in as soon as you pay. If you're planning on taking a popular tour like the sunset or sunrise options, then you definitely want to book in advance. Buying your tour two weeks in advance helps you get the tour date and time you want. A Grand Canyon tour is a fun way to wrap up the summer. Seeing the massive chasm from the air is an unforgettable experience. Start planning your tour now, so you can enjoy a fun-filled summer adventure you'll never forget."
6,Latin American Wedding Traditions,travel-leisure," Every culture has its own wedding traditions and the Latin American marriage ceremony is no different. There are countless unique Latin American wedding traditions that are still followed to this day and are part of what makes the day special for every Latina bride. Processions In Latin American tradition, the night before the wedding, a procession takes place from the groom's house to the bride's family home. Hand lanterns are carried and the groom's family take a gift-filled chest as a present for the bride's parents. Secrecy As in many other cultures, the Latin bride and groom are forbidden to see each other before the wedding ceremony. The bride's father's responsibility is to keep the bride hidden away and then to give her away as part of the wedding service. It is the groom's job to escort his mother down the aisle. Flower Girls and Ring Bearers As in many other cultures, Latin American wedding traditions dictate that there should be a flower girl and a ring bearer and that they should wear clothes that are copies of the bride and groom's outfits. Coins 13 gold coins representing Jesus and the apostles form an important part of the ceremony. They are presented by the groom to show that he can provide for his wife and are blessed by the presiding priest to be given to the bride as part of the service. Bridal Dress Every Latina bride knows how important her wedding dress is. In traditional Latin American weddings, she a mantilla veil and orange blossoms in her bouquet and hair are wore to symbolize happiness and fulfillment. Although Latin wedding dresses are now often white, traditionally the bridal dress color was black to show devotion for her husband until death. Rings Traditionally, both the bride and groom wear rings following their engagement on their right hands. After the ceremony, they swap the rings to their left hand. Binding Together In Latin American tradition, the lasso cord is used to bind the couple together during the ceremony. This is either a rosary or white rope tied around the couple's' shoulders symbolizing their union. Favors As in many cultures, giving guests wedding favors is an important part of the ceremony. Capias, or small gifts, are given to guests during the receiving line and took the form of ribbons with the names of the bride and groom and the date of the marriage on them. The White Bell During some Latin American weddings, there is a white bell hung outside the church filled with rice and flour to symbolize prosperity. As the couple enters the church, the bell is broken by the mother to wish the couple luck. Godparents In traditional Latin American culture, it is the godparents (or sponsors) who bear the cost of the wedding and also play a big part in the ceremony. It was their responsibility to carry in the arras (gold coins) and the lasso cord into the ceremony. First Dance After the ceremony, the bride and groom dance their first dance while the guests take to the floor in a heart shape surrounding them.

7,Student Travel Update: New One World Trade Center Graces NYC Skyline,travel-leisure," For many high school and junior high students today, the tragedy of 9/11 in New York City happened is already a part of history. It happened when many of this age group was young children – or they were not even born yet.  As a new generation considers the tragedies of 9/11, the event is already making its way into the shrouds of history. Students Travel to NYC & See the New One World Trade Center This year, the new One World Trade Center has arisen, and it is ready for commercial occupancy. Fortune 500 companies and successful tech companies are securing decade long leases on office space. For student trips headed to New York City, the New One World Trade Center is certainly worth a look.  Groups may also want to visit the 9/11 Museum - a separate building nearby. One World Observatory spans 3 floors and is open for public, ticketed admission.  Ask a student travel company representative about group rates and scheduling tickets. A trip to the 100th Floor is a phenomenal way to see New York City from a bird’s eye view and learn more about the history of 911 as well as present day New York. Workers Hoist the New Sign to Top of Building As the sign, One World Trade Center, was hoisted to the top of the 1,776 foot building, workers on site took photos. The written signatures and messages of loved ones were visible on the back of the street sign.  Many who live and work in New York City lost loved ones: family and friends, work associates and neighbors.  After 9/11 the city was never to be the same again, with tightened security and heightened anxieties at large public events. Yet the spirit of New Yorkers has survived the catastrophe, and this new building stands today as a testament to those who were lost - and those who remain. The project to rebuild the World Trade Center began in earnest post 9/11 as collaboration between government and private industry.  It was to illustrate that the U.S. has an indomitable spirit, not easily broken.  The building is immense, covering 3,500,000 square feet, including:  offices, observation deck, parking and storage and more.  Shopping and dining is available beneath the building, as well as PATH and subway train access.  One World Trade Center has 70 different elevators and nine escalators. Five elevators are reserved for access to the top of the building where the Observatory is located. One World Observatory Student travel groups will be interested in visiting the One World Observatory, an innovative, contemporary space that gives more information about 911 and the new One World Trade Center’s construction, as well as present day New York City. Timed ticket entry is part of the scheduling for student tour groups, so prompt or early arrival will be necessary. Students will ride the elevator to the 102nd Floor on a sky pod with windows on three sides. As students enter the Global Welcome Center, digital signs in many languages will greet them. On the 100th Floor of One World Trade Center, students can enter the Main Observatory to see 360-degree panoramic views of New York City and beyond.  The sky portal is another observatory where students may enter a 14-foot wide circular disc that opens up an astounding view of the streets below.   To find out more about NYC neighborhoods below, students can question the City Pulse - a video monitor system that provides close-up street views. The new One World Trade Center was designed and built to showcase the latest state-of the-art technologies, and to encourage public engagement. Plus it sets aside three floors for public access and enjoyment, while the floors below are teeming with work and productivity. One World Trade Center offers its tenants a prestigious address, a work environment with a contemporary design and one stupendous view of New York City.  Its presence has already enlivened the lower Manhattan neighborhood. One World Observatory has opened a brand new gift shop called the Gallery at One World. Here, students can obtain exclusively designed mementos of their trip to the top of New York City.  Dining at One World Trade Center may be a bit over budget for many student groups or simply inconvenient for touring.  Instead, take groups on a walk through the restaurants and stores below the building’s street level to find lunch or dinner.

8,Do A Grand Canyon National Park 1-day Rafting Tour Just before Summer Ends,travel-leisure," While summer is the perfect time to visit the Grand Canyon, the temperatures can get quite hot. There's no reason to let a little heat spoil your fun. One way to beat the heat is to float along the water on a rafting tour. Instead of whitewater rafting, a relaxed float down the Colorado offers fun for ages 4 and up. You can take one of these 1-day tours out of the South Rim daily, but you'll want to book your tour early since they sell out quickly. Begin Your Tour You'll begin your tour at the Grand Canyon National Park airport which is located near the South Rim in Tusayan, Arizona. Different packages are available. The basic version includes a 2 1/2 hour bus ride from the airport to the base of the dam in Glen Canyon. Also included is transportation to Maswik Lodge which is located in the Grand Canyon Village. If you opt for the deluxe package, you'll go to Glen Canyon by plane instead. Also, for some added adventure, the deluxe tour allows you to tour the canyon by Jeep, including visiting the Horseshoe Bend slot canyons. You don't want to miss these glorious caves of brightly colored sandstone that are sculpted into slopes and curves. South Rim River Tours The river portion of your tour begins at the base of the Glen Canyon Dam. You need to budget a whole day for the tour, which depart once daily around 7 in the morning and return around 5. For the trip down the Colorado River, these tours use motorized pontoon rafts that can carry up to 19 people, including children as young as four. The raft is operated by a skilled captain, who is also able to tell you interesting bits and pieces about the history of the region. Floating By Horseshoe Bend When your trip is underway, the raft heads for the colorful and mysterious Horseshoe Bend. After the bend, you will stop at different beaches, including a view of Native American petroglyphs on the canyon walls. These drawings were made over 800 years ago by Pueblo Indian ancestors. This area is easy to miss if you're on you own, that's why having an experienced river guide is a benefit. Make sure to bring along swimsuits so you don't miss the opportunity to take a dip in the cool blue-green waters of the Colorado. Swim shoes or comfortable tennis shoes suitable for hiking are important for this trip. Come prepared with sunscreen and a good hat or visor that will protect you from the sun. It's also a good idea to bring along a jacket and a lightweight shirt with long sleeves, and you'll probably want dry clothes to change into when you're finished swimming for the day. Lee's Ferry The final stop on your tour is Lee's Ferry. Once a Mormon settlement and then a fort, this spot marks the line between relaxing float tours and whitewater tours. Lee's Ferry is where you will find Cameron Trading Post. Established in 1916, the post specializes in Native American crafted arts. In addition, there is a store, restaurant, and a walking garden. This last stop will leave you relaxed for your ride back. Grand Canyon Rafting Is The Ideal Summer Activity A rafting tour is a lot of fun and scenic too. Everyone in the family can enjoy rafting along the smooth water section of the river. Deluxe tours cost more but save you the basic tour's long road trip, with a short enjoyable flight to the Grand Canyon. These tours sell out every day, so if you're ready for refreshing fun in the canyon, get your trip scheduled today."
9,See what sets the Los Angeles nightlife apart from any other city,travel-leisure," The Los Angeles nightlife scene is a lot different than the New York and general East coast scene. With that said, the Supperclub Los Angeles nightlife offers its own unique experience. Here’s why: Bar hopping is logistically more difficult. Sure, in places like Hollywood, Venice, or Santa Monica there are a few bars in the area. However, generally, bars are twenty minutes apart on average and it’s far more difficult to bar hop which makes the bar hopping scene less prevalent overall. As a result, the clubbing scene is more prominent. Moreover, it’s harder to be spontaneous in Los Angeles. Bars and restaurants fill up more quickly and because the city is more spread out, compared to the big East coast cities, you don’t always have a backup plan in case plans fall through. Therefore, it can be a pain to go out on weekends. This brings me to my next point, Weekdays versus Weekends. In LA, some of the best times to go out are Monday through Thursday. These are the days that most cool, interesting locals and even celebrities go out. On weekends, people from neighboring cities flock to the clubs, bars, etc., which makes the weekend crowd completely different than the weekday crowd. Now, you’re probably thinking that stepping outside your house in LA is a hassle. Truth is, it can be. But, there are defining characteristics that make going out and clubbing in Los Angeles all the worthwhile. Remember how I talked about the weekday crowd being full of interesting locals and celebrities? Well, if that’s not a reason to want to party in Los Angeles then I don’t know what is. Everyone lives in LA. You have a prime opportunity to meet some of the most awesome people. This brings me to my next point. Meeting people at clubs often segues into after parties. People in LA love to party, and don’t be surprised to find yourself partying on Hollywood rooftops after most would call it a night. Perhaps on your way you’ll find yourself up against another signature of the Los Angeles nightlife: the street (hot) dogs. After a long night of clubbing, you’ll often find street vendors cooking up bacon wrapped hotdogs to help wash down the night of debauchery. All in all, while the Los Angeles nightlife scene might be different, it has a unique experience to offer. Enjoy and share your own experiences at Supperclub Los Angeles!"
10,Vegas Adventures - Best Airplane Tour to Grand Canyon South,travel-leisure," While in Las Vegas, don't miss the Grand Canyon just because of the distance. The canyon is 270 miles from Vegas, but if you take a plane tour, you will get there quickly. Plus, when you go by plane, you won't waste time driving that you could spend exploring the canyon instead. Flights Everyday You have your choice of three daily flights to the Grand Canyon. Your time in the air isn't wasted as you'll see plenty of interesting sights such as an aerial view of Lake Mead. You'll also get a unique view of the Hoover Dam as it towers 725 feet above the Colorado River. Your plane will head to the Grand Canyon National Park in Tusayan, Arizona and you'll get glimpses of the canyon along the way. For the best views from the plane, try to get a seat on the left side. There are different options to choose from. The most affordable option is the basic tour with a bus tour inside the National Park that lasts two and a half hours. This tour hits main spots but isn't as convenient as the Jeep tour. The Jeep tour lasts about 2 1/2 hours too and takes you on a 4x4 expedition. You'll see more on the Jeep tour and the Jeep makes it easier to get around. When it comes to touring the South Rim by air, a good choice is the helicopter tour that takes you to the North Rim and back. This tour goes over the Dragoon Corridor, which is the widest and deepest part of the canyon. You'll have to pay a little more to fly by chopper and combine it with a land tour, but the expense is worth it. You will see more of the canyon in the air and get a bus tour that goes into the National Park. Sightseeing Planes A tour airplane can offer luxury and comfort in two different styles. The de-Havilland Twin Otter or the Beechcraft 1900D planes are more commonly used. There are both good for sightseeing, so pick the one that suits you. The de-Havilland Twin Otter is perfect for sightseeing with customized wings on top of the plane and large windows. The seats are nice and roomy, but some of them are not window seats because one side of the plane has a double row of seats while the other side has a single row. There is a recorded flight narrative you can listen to in your choice of 10 languages including Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. The Beechcraft airplane looks more like a traditional jet and it has wings positioned in the middle of the plane. This plane also has comfortable seating and as an added bones, every seat is a window seat. You'll have to pay more for a Beechcraft tour, but you'll be guaranteed a window seat, so its worth it. All fees associated with the tour is included in the price. That means the surcharges, taxes, entry tickets, and other fees are included in the price of your tour package. Round trip transport to Vegas hotels is part of packages as well as expertly trained pilots who double as your guide and host. You'll get everything you need in one package for one price. Luxury Awaits You An air tour is the best way to see the Grand Canyon. You'll tour in comfort, hit all the important landmarks, and save a whole lot of time over driving to the canyon. If you drive to the South Rim from Vegas, it will take about 11 hours round trip, while it only takes about an hour to fly there. Book these trips on the internet now while there are still some available."
11,5 Holiday Destinations for Single Men,travel-leisure," For most unattached men, the word ""single"" brings a dual, or should that be duel, feeling. Being single is synonymous with freedom, but on the flip-side, very few men look forward to a lifetime spent alone. Thankfully, there are many destinations for a single vacation where a guy can tackle this conundrum on his own terms, in due time, but always after a hot experience in paradise. Here are five places that are custom-made for a singles holiday. Medellin, Colombia: Made for: Adventure-seekers, and romantics The draw: Endless jungles, and seduction as a culture The terrain surrounding this ancient city is one of the most diverse in Colombia and a great vacation for singles. It has tall mountain peaks, jungle highlands and lowlands, deep gorges and canyons, and amazingly hypnotic farming areas. Every type of terrain offers the opportunity for extreme guided excursions. Places like the Abbura Valley are unmatched in the world for seasonal color. Temesis offers endurance hikes and waterfall rappelling only minutes from the city. Of course, there are thousands of private places like Los Katios National Park, where the jungle meets a crystal clear pool, perhaps with a cave or hot spring. This is the ideal spot for a single guy to entertain a lovely local girl, or fellow traveler in a dream-like setting. Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Made for: Fit men who can dance and who crave noise The draw: 24 hour socializing and parties Party Mecca for single men is Carnival, and Rio is its home base. Almost all year long, people in this city throw back the curtains for tourists. This is especially true for single guys who are extremely comfortable with leaving their self-loathing behind the moment the step off the plane. Festa (Portuguese for feast/celebration), is ingrained in Brazilian culture. In the ancient world, all roads led to Rome. In Rio, all roads lead to the beach, or a world class nightclub. There are the classics like Ipanema and the Copacabana, but other venues are becoming popular, especially if you have a favorite beach activity. Praia Vermelha is a surf hub, and Praia da Barra da Tijuca is famous for motor sports and parasailing. After working on the tan,go for dancing, drinks, and booty-watching at clubs like Leviano with its massive mosh pit, and Casa Rosa for laser-lit, edgy interaction. Rio might well be the perfect place for singles to holiday. Bangkok, Thailand Made for: Urban-oriented, tryst addicts The draw: Food, adult entertainment, and more food Men from all over the world find Bangkok to be a fascinating study in opposites. There's no argument that adult entertainment in all forms is a major draw, but local laws and customs must be respected at all times. It's absolutely possible to find any type of entertainment that you want, but it must be enjoyed on the culture's terms. Bangkok is like a single traveller’s fantasy theme park, but definitely...ahem, lives up to its name. The people of Bangkok are exotic creatures in familiar westernized, U.S. and Euro-style packages. They are very accommodating to the expectations of single male tourists, and have the inviting currency exchange rate to boot. Restaurants like Xing Fu satisfy a guy's stomach. Fitness and outdoor gyms help a guy retain his muscle tone while away from home. Elephant riding in the Khoa Yi National Park provides opportunities for selfies to make friends jealous. Adult clubs, lounges and hotel concierge like will certainly where out a single guy's eyes (if not his entire body). As a single guy wrestles with the notion of settling-down in life, he can get the ""wildness"" out in this huge bachelor party of a destination. Ibiza, Spain Made for: History-lovers, mermen The draw: Genuine locals, The Mediterranean Ibiza is an island getaway steeped in old world culture including religion, sport, and cuisine. The deepest blue imaginable comes from an interface with the Mediterranean Sea, and the deepest brown is found in the eyes, hair and skin of some of Europe's most alluring women making it the dream holiday for singles. A network of inviting villages each have town centers emerging from a catholic chapel like the Capilla de la Virgen de Lourdes, or a school or monastery. As far as social activities, anything having to do with playing on the sand or in the water is available. This area is very family friendly, so singles fun remains extremely intimate and low key. Single men should try offering a lonely local girl a glass of wine followed by a conversation on art, and a paddle board session afterward. Cancun, Mexico Made for: Penny-pinchers, beach bums The draw: Oceanside recreation, tequila, tans This resort city is obviously popular with the college Spring Break crowd for reasons that also appeal to any single man. Every dinner plate, public transport, cabana, fishing charter, beach chair rental, and bottle of Jose Cuervo is affordable. This means single guys in every stage of life can find a way to have fun. Spend a few days hiking in the Yucatan inland camping near the Chichen Itza Pyramid, then join a beach rave with some new Mexican friends for the rest of the trip.

12,Grand Canyon Chopper Tours from Vegas During Labor Day,travel-leisure," There's no better place than Las Vegas to set off on a Grand Canyon helicopter tour. Labor Day marks the end of summer vacation time, and it is also the last three day weekend of the year. There's no better way to celebrate than by taking a helicopter tour of the canyon. Air Tours Of The West Rim Las Vegas is closest to the West Rim of the Grand Canyon, which is just 125 miles away. The Las Vegas helicopters fly over Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on the way to the canyon, in all, it takes about 45 minutes to get there. The West Rim is the only place in the canyon where helicopters can fly to the canyon floor, so you can take air-only or landing tours there. The aerial tours offer spectacular panoramic sightseeing, and they are more affordable than the landing tours. However, the landing tours come with a flyover too, plus some fun adventures after you land on top of the rim or on the canyon floor. One tour to consider taking is the bottom landing champagne picnic tour. This one will take you right inside the canyon, allowing you to see the beautiful rock walls from an angle that few get to experience. You could even supplement this with a riverboat ride on the Colorado River, or for the full experience, add in a top landing, and take a walk on the transparent Skywalk that is suspended thousands of feet above the canyon below. About Deluxe Air Tours Buying your tour online is the way to find the lowest price, and you'll also get to choose between a basic or deluxe tour before you buy. While you'll have a great time on a basic tour too, you should be aware that they fly on older style traditional helicopters. The deluxe tours are more comfortable, so you should try to book one for your Labor Day excursion. Deluxe tours use the newer EcoStar 130 chopper. This high performance machine has bigger viewing windows, a 180 degree panoramic windshield, a larger cabin, and a seating plan that has been designed to provide unobstructed views to everyone on board. These helicopters also depart directly from the Strip, and tickets come with a complimentary limousine shuttle. While you'll have to pay more for a deluxe helicopter tour, it is worth the expense.

13,"Grand Canyon Tours - Chopper, Airplane Voyages During Labor Day Holiday",travel-leisure," Are you looking for something fun to do over the 2015 Labor Day weekend? If you're looking for something to make the holiday special, then you can't go wrong with Grand Canyon flights. There are both helicopter and airplane tours available, with plenty of options to suit any budget. Las Vegas Air Tours If you want to take an air tour to of the West Rim of the Grand Canyon, then Las Vegas is where you want to start. You can choose from a landing tour or an air-only tour. As the names suggest, an air only tour will give you a flyby of the Grand Canyon, whereas a landing tour will set you down either at the bottom of the canyon near the Colorado River, or at the top rim. You can save money by taking an air only tour, but if you can work it out with your budget, a landing tour will provide the best experience. Even though the landing tours set down at the canyon, they also fly over it so you get an aerial tour along with some fun activities on the ground. One could allow you to have a champagne picnic at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and you could even add on a boat ride. You could land on top of the rim instead and add on VIP passes to the amazing Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is a glass platform that suspends you 4000 feet above the canyon floor. A helicopter tour is thrilling, but even it doesn't match the breathtaking excitement of walking on the Skywalk. Touring The South Rim By Airplane If you have a larger group, or you just want the most economical way to tour, then an airplane tour could be best for you. Airplanes take the same flight path as helicopters, although they fly at higher altitudes. They cost about 80 percent as much as a helicopter tour, and one thing to keep in mind is that the airplanes can't fly down to the canyon floor. Another difference is airplanes fly from Vegas to the South Rim, but helicopters do not. It would take you over five hours to drive to Tusayan from Vegas, but in a plane it will only take one hour. From here, you could take a bus tour around the South Rim, enjoy a breathtaking Jeep tour, or you could even board a helicopter to see the South Rim, North Rim, and the far eastern boundary of the Grand Canyon National Park. The helicopter tours of the South Rim are thirty or fifty minutes long. The 50-minute one is a good choice because it flies over 75 percent of the entire Grand Canyon National Park. You can combine tours too, so you can take an air tour as well as a Jeep or bus tour to get the most out of your experience at the South Rim, what you choose depends entirely on your budget and time. Buy Your Tour Online Before It Sells Out Because Labor Day is one of the busiest holidays of the year, you will need to book soon. In fact, you should go ahead and book as soon as you've confirmed your accommodation. Book online to save money on agent fees, and pay with your credit card to confirm your seats on the day that you want to fly. There are some things that you should experience at least once in your lifetime, and Grand Canyon flights are amongst these things. Breathtaking views, thousands of years of natural history, Native American culture, and a sense of exploration make the Grand Canyon one of the best places to visit this Labor Day."
14,Grand Canyon Airplane Flights During the Labor Day Holiday,travel-leisure," Labor Day will soon be here, and that means the opportunity for a summer airplane tour of the Grand Canyon is about over. Lots of people are taking their last vacations of the summer, so the tours will fill up fast. Airplane Tours Departing From Vegas Heading from Vegas, travelers can take air tours that go to either the West Rim or the South Rim of the canyon on a tour plane. It takes about a half hour to fly from Vegas to the West Rim and around an hour to fly to the South Rim. When you consider it can take almost six hours to drive to the South Rim, you save quite a bit of time. There are two kinds of airplane tours. One is a landing tour and the other is an air-only tour. Both will fly you above Lake Mead, Hoover Dam and the Colorado River, before flying over the canyon. The tours that are marked air only will only take you in a loop over the canyon, while a landing tour will let you explore it. If you need to watch your budget, then an air tour is ideal since it is the least expensive. However, you'll see more if you do a landing tour. The airplane tour that lands at the West Rim is especially popular. It's exciting because you can upgrade the tour to include a helicopter descent to the bottom of the canyon and a boat ride along the Colorado River that wends it's way along the base of the towering rock walls. Another landing tour option is to buy VIP passes to the famous Skywalk. The Skywalk is a huge bridge made from glass panels that allows you to stroll beyond the edge of the rim for 70 feet. You can see the canyon floor an amazing 4000 feet underneath you. It's scary and thrilling at the same time. Touring The South Rim The plane tour of the South Rim gives you about 45 minutes of flight time. The tour takes off from the Grand Canyon National Park Airport in Tusayan, Arizona. The plane takes you over the pristine wilderness area of the North Rim as well as the land that borders the eastern edge of the park. Then you'll head back to the South Rim and have witnessed 75% of the park after all is said and done. The airplanes used on these flights are designed to hold up to 19 people. Two FAA certified pilots are on each tour to offer you a safe and fun experience. You'll be comfortable on the plane too. They include oversized windows, cabins, and wings that won't obstruct the views. You can feel confident when you book your tour that you'll have the best views possible from one of the airplanes. Plane Tours Are More Affordable Airplane tours follow the same paths that you take on a helicopter tour. The difference is they are cheaper and will accommodate more people, while flying at a higher altitude.

Las Vegas Air Tours When you depart from Las Vegas, you can take a landing tour or an air-only tours. Book a landing tour if you can, one of the most popular ones is where the chopper flies to the canyon floor and sets down by the Colorado River. This tour includes a nice champagne picnic and you can also add on a river boat tour that is very scenic and fun. You can even do more fun things. You could even combine the bottom landing tour with a rim landing one. Then you can take a walk on the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is a thrilling attraction with a floor made of thick glass that allows you to stand over the canyon floor thousands of feet below you. The view is simply amazing and it is a great addition to an aerial tour of the canyon. If you're in a larger group or are looking for the most economical tickets, you could try an airplane tour. Airplanes can't fly down to the canyon floor, but they fly along the same flight path as helicopters, so you'll see the same sights from a higher altitude. If you're looking to see the South Rim, however, then an airplane is the best way to get out to Tusayan in Arizona. South Rim Helicopter Tours If you start your tour from Tusayan, or even if you fly there from Vegas, you'll be able to choose from two helicopter tours. One gives you thirty minutes of air time and flies over to the North Rim and circles back. The other tour is highly recommended because it give you 50 minutes of flight time. It takes the same flight path as the shorter tour, but includes an extension out to the eastern boundary of the Grand Canyon National Park. This tour is so comprehensive that you'll see about 3/4 of the entire Grand Canyon when you take it. Helicopters cannot land on the canyon floor at the South Rim, but you can add on a fun Jeep tour instead. The Jeep tour is a scenic 2 1/2 hour ground tour through the park. You'll appreciate getting to see the park from the ground as well as from the air. Deluxe Tour Upgrades The basic tours cost the least. They fly on AStar and Bell Ranger choppers. They provide excellent sightseeing, but if you have a little extra to spend, then it's worth booking a deluxe tour. Deluxe tours are provided in newer EcoStar helicopters. They are made for commercial sightseeing, so they offer a more comfortable ride. There are no bad seats on these choppers because the comfy bucket seats are positioned stadium style. These helicopters are roomier and they're quieter too, but the star of the show is the huge windshield, which provides unobstructed viewing for 180 degrees at the front of the helicopter. Another perk of deluxe tours is that they come with free shuttle transportation from your Vegas hotel to the helipad located on the Strip. Airplane tours are given on custom Twin Otter planes, which have seats for 19. These sightseeing airplanes offer great views too through their large windows.

16,Grand Canyon Helicopter Tours for Labor Day Holiday Visitors,travel-leisure," A Grand Canyon helicopter is a fun way to spend a weekend vacation. Since Labor Day is nearly here, it's the perfect time to start planning a weekend in Vegas and a canyon tour. The great thing about taking an air tour from Las Vegas, is that you can choose from landing and air only tours. Since the tours all fly along the same route on the way to the canyon, you'll get to see the impressive Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on both types of tours. Of course you will end up at the highlight of the journey, the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon itself. While the air-only tours circle the canyon and head back to Vegas, the landing tours stop at the canyon so you can get out and explore the area. Landing Tour Options There's one Grand Canyon helicopter tour that I recommend above all others, and that is the deluxe landing tour that leaves from the Las Vegas Strip. Deluxe tours offer extra in that you will receive a limousine shuttle to and from your hotel, and you will fly in the state-of-the-art EcoStar 130 helicopter. You can take one of these tours on a chopper that flies down to the canyon floor so you can get out near the banks of the Colorado River. As a nice touch, this tour comes with a champagne picnic, and you can even take a boat tour along the Colorado River if you like. South Rim Tours If you're closer to Arizona, or even if you just want to experience the more remote areas of the canyon, then you could try an air tour from Tusayan. You can drive to the helicopter tour starting point in Tusayan from any location in Arizona, or you can fly there from Vegas in about an hour. You get to choose from the least expensive half hour air tour of the South Rim, or the longer tour that lasts nearly an hour, which is highly recommended. The longer tour takes you from the South Rim to the remote wilderness of the North Rim and on over to the eastern edge of the Grand Canyon National Park. It is the most comprehensive air tour available and lets you see a great deal of beautiful scenery and landmarks. Helicopters can't land inside the canyon at the South Rim, but you can still take a fun 4x4 tour of the park. For instance, you can book a tour package that includes a 40-minute air tour and a 2 1/2 hour ground tour. Seeing the canyon from the ground is a thrilling experience too, especially when you combine it with an air tour. Deluxe Tours If you do choose a deluxe tour, you will be treated to the best sightseeing helicopters that are available at the Grand Canyon. The EcoStars have more room inside the cabins and they are extremely comfortable to ride in, plus they have huge wraparound viewing windows for panoramic sightseeing. The choppers deliver a smooth ride and are nice and quiet inside the cabin. If you can get a deluxe tour ticket, then you shouldn't even think twice.

20,African Safari,travel-leisure," Today I am a bit excited as I write this blog. First it’s because I bumped into a longtime friend of mine who we share a great history of our childhood moments. She later moved to the States with her parents and recently she came to tour her motherland and she was trying to explain her experience to me. Therefore, I am going to share her experience here because for a second it made me appreciate the fact that I am an African. Well, for lack of better words, it gave me a sense of belonging. I believe that almost everyone from overseas who has done a tour to East Africa will tell you how great it was and all great experiences that come with East Africa. This is because Africa is renowned for being wild, authentic, spectacular and rugged and here is my friend’s story who kept wondering if it would live up to her expectations. She left Africa when she was 6, therefore Africa sounded so new to her.Her name is Maxwell and she went on a safari to    Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania. She decided to start describing the game viewing as according to her it was the most exciting moment of her tour. ""Never would I imagine seeing so many animals in such a short period of time. In Rwanda we hiked deep into the forest to spend time with a Gorilla family – a Silverback, mature males and females, juveniles and babies! Watching these primates interact with each other and recognize us as friendly visitors truly made me believe in evolution. We also trekked to see the Monkeys, an experience that filled me with the joy of a child. Watching these small monkeys swing, play, flight, feed and run through the jungle in their natural habitat was thrilling. Then there was Serengeti- within less than an hour of arriving at the reserve we had seen, heard of zebras, wildebeest, giraffe, buffalo, elephant, hippos and more! On an early morning game drive we saw a cheetah devouring its prey. We watched three, yes three leopards, a mother and her cubs feeding on a Thompson Gazelle in a tree. We watched as a lioness hunted down a warthog just as a snack. That afternoon we spent watching a pride of lions walking for their evening hunt. We saw hyenas, which later that night, uninvited, visited our camp site. Then the very next morning we quietly observed a pride of lioness stalk a herd of buffalo and later spotted two male lions watching on the other side of the herd in wait. In Ngorongoro crater we counted seeing nearly all the same animals again in one day. In Lake Nakuru we spotted Rhinos! We watched as a giraffe casually walked the length of the local air strip and our group followed a lioness and her three cubs as they started their evening hunt. In Lake Naivasha we walked, yes walked, with zebras, gazelles and more. We motored a boat past hippos and flamingos. And the Maasai Mara had been just amazing, we saw beautiful herds of hoofed animals. We watched a pregnant cheetah finding a place to rest. What you would enjoy most is meeting the East African people"". Most are the times when you would get to learn of travel advisories against travelling to most parts of Africa. Unfortunately, these days terrorism is something that can happen anywhere and to anyone, if I can put it better it is a worldwide concern as we sadly see time and again. The East African people are friendly, welcoming and respectful. They work together towards a brighter future and what will shock you is the Rwandese knowledge of ecotourism. East Africa is a place that anyone would most definitely feel safe throughout their travel."

1,Grand Canyon South Rim Helicopters And Your Top Choices,travel-leisure," The South Rim of the Grand Canyon encompasses an impressive one million acres of natural beauty. There's no way you could see it all on a land tour. The best option is to take a helicopter tour, since one of these enables you to see about 3/4 of the entire Grand Canyon National Park in about an hour. You would take months trekking around the park if you wanted to take in all of the sites that you can see from a helicopter tour. And even if you managed to make it around all of the park's beautiful spots, you wouldn't be able to see them in their full splendor. The South Rim is incredibly beautiful, and taking a helicopter tour ensures you won't miss a thing. South Rim Tours There are some different tour options for South Rim visitors, so you'll be able to choose a package that suits your sense of adventure as well as your budget. The basic 30-minute tour is the least expensive and it flies you over the North and South Rims. This tour will even take you down into the Dragoon Corridor, a spectacularly beautiful part of the Canyon that is also its widest point. If you like the sound of the shorter helicopter tour but still want a little more, why not try a tour that includes a 4x4 Jeep ride. So along with the exciting aerial tour, you'll get to take a fun ground tour to famous spots such as Mather Point, Yavapai Point, and Yaki Point, as well as Grand Canyon Village. The roads in the Grand Canyon are often quite busy during the peak summer tourist months. That's why a Jeep tour is a good idea, you get to see the main landmarks without having to travel on the busy main roads. Besides the thirty minute helicopter tour, there is also a fifty minute air tour available. The longer tour covers a lot more ground, so you see the same sights as the shorter tour and the Jeep tour combined. Some major landmarks you'll see include the pyramid-shaped rock formation called the Temple of Ra, the Colorado River Confluence, the isolated sections of the North Rim, and Imperial Point. This is by far the best package available, allowing you to see almost all of the National Park. (There is an airplane tour which follows an identical route to the 50 minute helicopter tour. However, if at all possible, you should book a helicopter tour, because you'll have a better view. The helicopters can fly a lot lower than airplanes, so you're closer to the canyon, plus the windows in the airplanes are much smaller than the big wraparound windows in the choppers that provide superior viewing.) Try A Deluxe Tour You can choose the 30 or 50 minute tour in either a basic or deluxe package. The main difference in the type of tours is the type of aircraft used. Basic tours use the traditional Bell Ranger or Eurocopter AStar choppers, while deluxe tours use EcoStar 130 aircraft. The EcoStar is built for comfort with extra leg room, comfy seats, and wraparound windows for the ultimate viewing experience. In addition, the choppers are quiet on the inside, so your ride is more comfortable. I recommend paying extra for a deluxe tour if you can, but that's not to say that a basic tour won't provide you with an unforgettable experience. South Rim helicopter tours have become increasingly popular in recent years, and today a helicopter tour is usually the first on the priority list for those who visit the Grand Canyon. That means the flights can fill up fast. For that reason, you should buy your tour well in advance, you may even want to do it as soon as you book your hotel reservations. If you wait too long, you'll probably have to pay more if you can even find open seats available. A helicopter tour is the perfect way to top off a trip to the Grand Canyon. There's simply no better way to see the Grand Canyon."
2,Sudden Death of a Timeshare Project,travel-leisure," It seems like it is something right out of the super bowl play book. We run the same play over and over again with the same results. We stumble, we fail down, drop the ball, throw incomplete passes and continue to loss yardage on every play. It is like someone is reading our play book word for word. They know just what we are doing and how to counter every move. New ideas come into play and our opponents already have in their defense play book. Yes, we are talking about the typical timeshare project today. Everyday is a practice right out of the play book. We try new things with mediocre results and think we are making progress. In reality each day we are taking a step backwards. Today's timeshare projects in general make little or no headway. The Board of Directors hold a special meeting to try to rectify the issues. It's always the same result in every meeting, ""we need more money"". Why is ask? We need more money because people stop paying for a product that no longer fits their lifestyle. As the population of the original timeshare owners age, the hand me downs do not want what they are being left. People desperately try anything to get out of paying for something that they will never use or cannot justifying paying for something that is only going to used once in a great while. With the Internet at everyone's finger tips why would anyone want to spend a week in the spring at the Wisconsin Dells? Or spend a week in the Blue-ridge Parkway in December? How about the beach on Virginia Beach in February? Again, because the old style timeshares were sold as a week. Fifty Two weeks in a year, half good the other half, well not hard to figure that one out. Hold on, there is help at hand, but let the Board of Directors beware. As the industry revolutionizes, resorts must also move with the current trends. Most will fight the change. The resorts doing well, will prosper while the others, well a blind person can see what will happen. When looking for the right company to guide your resort through the changes in the industry, caution should be used. There are many companies who make claims of progress, but the industry has been burnt by those same people who created many of the problems the resorts are dealing with today. Yes, we have heard them all and feel the effects everyday of the unscrupulous individuals running around in timeshare industry claiming to rescue those who are already well below the water. A couple of good check points a resort can make before hiring a consulting company to help move your resort forward. How do they approach the current owners? What types of programs are they using? What is the cost to the resort for their services? What references do you have for success? You can avoid the hassles of promise that were made to be broken by hiring the right company to walk your resort through the process of being updated and generating cash flow and owner longevity by contacting Resort consulting with integrity.

3,"Devon Falls – Talawakale, Sri Lanka",travel-leisure," Sri Lanka - a country rich in its heritage and is famously known as one of the famous tourist destinations in Asia. It also is proud to home a number of places that boasts the naturally gifted sightseeing locations spread across the whole country. Whether you are visiting Sri Lanka for the first time, or a frequent traveler to the beautiful nation – Devon Falls definitely is among the top list of places to visit. Devon falls is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Sri Lanka. It is located on the A7 highway, 6km west of Talawakale in the Nuwara Eliya district. The name Devon originated from the man himself – Devon, who was a pioneer coffee planter that owned a plantation located close to the waterfall. If you’re travelling to the hill capital of Sri Lanka, experiencing the true beauty of nature seen at Devon Falls is definitely an thrill not to be missed.  The waterfall is 97 meters high and 1159m above sea level, and one would have to walk roughly up to a kilometer from the main road in order to get closer to the waterfall. However, you could also view it clearly from the main road without getting too close as well. There are two locations on the A7 route from which this remarkable waterfall could be observed. One would be the lower point, which is preferred by most tour guides and tourists since this observation point gives its visitors a glimpse of both Devon Falls and St.Clairs’s too. 	The second point of observation would be in the railway at Watagoda place, which is roughly 10km away from the railway station. Whether you are travelling with a bunch of friends, or whether you are travelling with family – it is mostly recommended to rent a car which would ease the trouble of getting around in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, you also have the freedom to take a detour and visit other locations as well. Prior to your visit in Sri Lanka, rent a car services could be arranged in order to avoid last minute change in plans in your travel itinerary. Many rent a car services such as  Kings Rent A Car Colombo offer a range of vehicles in their fleet and you could choose from an SUV or a car, anything that makes you comfortable during your travel. The hill capital and Devon Falls is just one of the few awesome experiences that Sri Lanka has to offer – however we recommend that you plan a full itinerary prior to your visit in order to make the most out of your holiday in Sri Lanka."
4,Hunker Down Or Bug Out,travel-leisure," Hunkering Down is Urban Survival, but the minute you step outside your door, you have entered Wilderness Survival, which requires a whole different skill set. Now, a lot of you military guys will probably do fine with that change, but I don't think a lot of the civilian folks have given that the thought it deserves. First and foremost, the packs that most people talk about carrying are so heavy that they won't make it for more than a mile before they are exhausted. If they pare away too much else, they won't survive. Most people are going to have to Hunker Down whether they want to or not. If all the pooky hits the fan, there are going to be a lot of really bad, crazed people running around, so now along with having to add mobility and the weight of a heavy pack onto your outdoor adventure, you are going to have to evade all the bad people trying to kill you or steal anything they can get their hands on, and that doesn't include the military who are probably also going to be out looking for people to throw in the back of trucks for transport. And if you do get attacked, and have to fire a gun, everyone is going to know that you are there, so now the bad guys have enforcement's heading your way. Additionally, if you are on foot, you are not going to be able to take much food with you due to weight, so how do you plan to eat? I read a study that was done, I believe by one of the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries that said, if people had to survive on wild game, the state would be depleted in a matter of three or four weeks. Now what? And let's say that you make it to the wilderness, and you are safe, right? Except that if you are using a gun to hunt, then everyone for two or three miles around knows that someone has killed something, and if they are hungry, they know right where the sound came from, and they are going to be looking for you. Guess you are going to need a good bow and some arrows... oops, more to carry. Let's take it a step further... you take some game down with a bow... how do you plan to eat it? Do you know how far the smell of cooking food travels? And we are right back to uninvited visitors, unless you plan to eat it raw. Okay so you have a get away vehicle, huh? How many other people do you think are going to have vehicles? If you are lucky and don't end up in a gauntlet set by the military to herd civilians to ""other"" locations, you are likely going to face thousands of other people, who also have vehicles, and who are also trying to get out of the containment area. Can you say massive traffic jams on choke points like bridges, on ramps, exit ramps, etc.? If you are stuck in your car in the middle of said traffic jam, you are more vulnerable than you would have been at home, and you still have to walk out. Next, let's consider that most of us have family. My mom had a stroke this past November, and my dad is pushing 80. He is probably more fit than most 45 year olds I know, but still, he is diabetic, and on top of that, it would be terribly hard to try to carry my mom. That would mean that someone would have to leave their pack behind. My folks wouldn't make it. How many of you are willing to leave your parents or grandparents behind to fend for themselves? What about an old person who has been your neighbor for the past twenty years? Karma has an interesting way of bringing things back to you, so take care how you answer this question. My point here, and I haven't even scratched the surface of likely problems, is that most of us talk about Bugging out, but in reality, for most people, there is very little chance of that being a successful venture. It might be time for a lot of folks to really think about this, and then rethink it. It might be time to start building up that group of like minded neighbors, who will be willing to stick together and protect each other. Now from a different perspective: Family who can barley take care of themselves makes it almost impossible to bug out. As far as the weight issues and surviving, I know that most of the population would soon find out how much physical abuse a human body can take. Yes the packs are heavy but you also want to live, once you get moving it gets easier as you go on and you redefine the phrase pushing your limits for yourself. Depending on what does happen to cause this change in our world. Staying in a populated area could mean inevitable death. You might survive for a wile, but in a lawless environment people create gangs and do terrible things, if your odds are not 3 to 1 you will more than likely die. I believe in situations like these, the first ones out, will be the ones who rebuild over the ashes of those who stayed. What I said may not be true for all, but I have come to this through a good amount of experience. I intend to stay put unless something occurs to make my ao uninhabitable. I know the land, the surrounding area, the available resources, the people, and what to expect from them, in short, home field advantage. The life of a refugee is seldom pleasant and often short. As mentioned you should make initial plans, but make contingency plans as well. As things unfold in any situation you may find that you need to enact any combination of these plans. There is no way to say what to do in each situation, but make a decision, any decision. No decision is still a decision albeit a very poor one. I guess my decision to Bug Out and abandon my ranch is when I hear that the 17 million people 2 hours southwest of me are bugging out. Then based on the level of response you may want to up it one, if things are getting worse. I have 4 levels of response with a few different plans for each. Bug In/hunker down. This is the most preferred. All your stuff is with you. You know the area. You might even have friends /family that can band together. You also maintain title to your house even if renting, a very important thing. This is where I have one years of preps, but I am willing to abandon it if my children's lives depend on it. Bug out by vehicle to a BOL [b]Bug Out Location[/b]. This is a whole range of discussion. My true BOL is 2100 miles away, not really feasible. But I have a temp BOL/Staging area 8 easy miles away. I have also setup a sanctuary on the other side of the desert. More on this some other day. Currently working on totes that are pre packed for this. I have a F350 and F150 and trailers for this. One of my threads just the other day on my former site was working out the logistics of living in the desert for 30 days. Campgrounds In my opinion could be a very dangerous place in a SHTF (crap hits the fan) scenario. Bug out by animal packing. I have 2 horses and 2 llamas (one is only 5 months old) plus packs for them. Currently between 3 people and 3 animals I can carry 650 pounds of gear. Currently working on fixing an old goat cart that I can use, also teaching one horse to pull this. That picks me up another net increase of 200 pounds. I have done extensive research as to where I could head. The advantages of living next to big canyons. Bug Out on foot. This is the least desirable but is also the most discrete and mobile. This will get into the whole Bug Out Bag thing which could be hundreds of posts. I keep mine down to 35 pounds. If it's a bug out for good I have another pack that I can hump on my front also weighing 35 pounds, containing survival gear. So the point is have more than one level of response and be ready to enact any one at any time. Your gut will help you with knowing what is best. But prepare and train for all. I also have a variety of plans for each. Staying put I can either fortify the house or hide everything and open my doors for inspection Bugging out by truck, as I've mentioned, I have different BOL's and Staging Spots. Right down to going straight into the desert. follow me if you dare. Not everybody will be carrying 30 days of food, 450 gals of water, 100 gallons of diesel, and 50 gallons gas. Thank god for an F350 with 24' foot enclosed car hauler, Plus my daughter's F150 and cargo trailer. 3 and 4. Bug out with animals or on foot. Also as mentioned, I have studied the back country around here extensively, since I live right next to huge canyons and the and miles and miles of desert. I have my secret map with secret decoder ring marking out these sites with numbers scaling different benefits or disadvantages. Water, concealment, etc. Bugging out may be the only option for some. We now live on a five acre property in a rural area north of Dallas, so one may think we're in good shape. However, if you look at a Google image of our area, you see that although we live in a forested, low pop area consisting of maybe 7000 acres, we are surrounded by urban sprawl in all directions, and the fact that we, and most of our neighbors, have at least poultry, if not livestock, make our little piece of the world very inviting for a savvy raider, pilferer, or plunderer. Now, with six kids, all under 9, and another on the way, the ""Bug In v. Bug Out"" debate is one my wife and I have had, and continue to have often. No way our place is going to be ignored for long by refugees or raiders from Houston, and very few of our neighbors would really be reliable in a SHTF situation, as I believe at least some of them are involved in illegal activities on their property. I know for a fact that at least two of our neighbors are being watched by LE agencies of some sort (I pay more attention to whats going on in our neighborhood than they do, I guess). Plus, Uncle Sam just built a brand new military installation consisting of about 2.5 acres not far from us. It has obviously been built as a defensive structure, if I ever nut up enough to take some pics, I'll post them, and you'll see, it's pretty scary. So bugging in is only a short term solution for us. I always think in worst-case-scenario terms, so when I think of bugging out, it's on foot. but thats what horses are for. We have two horses, and have access to several others. There are two public stables in what we would consider our AO (within 1 mile). Not that I would steal someone elses horse, but I will definitely be riding over there to scout for any obviously abandoned horses before we leave the area. Having run a stable before, I know that most folks who own horses but no land usually put their horses pretty low on their priority list when money gets tight. I got one of the horses we have now because someone couldn't/wouldn't/didn't pay their stall fees. No point in letting a perfectly good horse starve to death while YOU ride Shanks Mare... Of course, our horses could be killed and eaten or stolen, so then- When it comes to heavy pack- mine weighs about 65 lbs. But, since I take it to Spring Creek and hike with it pretty often, I'm confident that I'll be able to struggle along. Won't be fun, but with the kids, I can't afford to have a Bug Out Bag, it's an INCH bag for me, and a lot of that weight is ammo. I have rat traps, snares, snare wire, a small Victory steel trap, fishing gear, and I know how to rig some pretty savvy snares, I've got carbs, protein, and calories packed, enough for 9 days for the whole family at full rations. My wife has to carry our youngest in a front-facing chest carrier, plus she'll almost certainly be carrying our second youngest (who would actually ride inside her pack thanks to some old cloth diapers and ingenious sewing), so her pack is relatively light, mainly with survival gear in case something should happen to me and she lost my pack. The three oldest have their own packs, but there's nothing essential in there, extra clothing, a little food, nothing crucial or heavy, as theirs would be the first packs to be ditched if speed or stealth were required. The big issue for us is ""Where to Bug Out???"" If we owned land suitable for bugging out, we'd already live there instead of renting in Dallas! I know ONE guy with land around here, and he's a bit of a d-bag. We really dislike each other, but he needs my knowledge, and I sometimes make some good money off him. Whether he would see me showing up at his place with my family as a good or bad thing would depend on his mood at that particular moment. I think the fact that his 100 acre farm is 300 yards off THE main East-West artery spanning this country would help convince him that he could use me. Plus, the small and unfortunately informal group we have put together includes one ex and one active duty Marine, an EMT who is currently working on his paramedics (plus both his parents are doctors and he and his wife work in his mothers medical clinic, yeah, I'm talking about YOU, JonSamuels lol), and another guy who's just pretty darn savvy, and shoots straight, figuratively as well as literally. Then there's my wife and I, who are purity expensive considering the ""baggage"" we bring in tow, but our knowledge and experience in different fields hopefully off-sets that. So, our plans are by necessity are left malleable, they can be changed in minutes to compensate for unforeseen circumstances, but ultimately, as one person has already noted above, it's in Gods hands, if the whole world were to gather together to harm you, or to help you, it would be impossible without the consent of The Creator... I think another thing that most people don't think realistically about is the distance that you can travel in one day, especially while on foot. I think some may believe they can make it from their current location to nearly any other location on the map with little to no delay; the reality is that if teotwawki occurs and you plan to remain nomadic or have a long distance goal in mind, you may only actually cover a few miles a day. Not dozens, or hundreds. It could takes weeks, even months to do what you can do now in hours or days. I would prefer to be on the west slope of the Rockies as it is less populated, yet there is one big huge BUT to that - getting there. The roads (to call some of them roads is questionable in my humble opinion - I have an intense fear of mountain roads that drop off a 1000 feet) could quickly fill up as every hunter in the state as already mapped out every possible bug-out route possible using those ""side"" roads. No way am I going south - if you need to ask why, then you need to read more. That leaves north and east. North would be where many who have bug out locations in Montana and Idaho would be heading and traffic again would turn into a parking lot. Don't think all the back roads haven't be figured out by thousands of other preppers/survivalists? First sign of problems and those roads will ALL be full. So now that leaves me only east, which is a high possibility if an area can be found that is a ravine, gully, arroyo or something like that, as you would want to be hidden and not in a building. Yup, I have given this a great deal of thought. Bugging In - is really our only possibility, at least at first. Some say if you can't get out in the beginning you are dead. Some say if you can't bug in until things calm down in a little (2-4 weeks), you are dead. Without a two day notice - ahead of the herd that is - bugging out is just not going to work for my little family. We would have to bug in and make it look like we are no longer there. There would have to be hidden areas we could get into if someone came into the house. The house would have to look like it had already been looted and nothing worth taking there. Trash the place, take every bit of food and hide it. Where do you hid it? My aunt told me about what her close friends have done. Inside drywall. They made shelves and then put up old fashion wood paneling, made it fit well but not attached. They then put dressers, book shelves and other odd things up against the paneling to hold it in place. This was done along one very long wall in their basement. Because they made shelves inside the sub-wall, they also made the inside pocket deeper and a 5 gallon bucket fits in there fine. There is 3 years of food in that wall. There is 3 months worth of water in that wall. In the closets of are other buckets and kits within the walls. This friend of hers did this 30 years ago and rotate their long term storage every 10 years, water once ever year and a half to two years. The other thing with bugging in, well even bugging out is FIRE. Fire will spread quickly. No matter what your plans are, fire will quickly change the whole game. Five years of LTS could go up in smoke and then, where will you be? Surviving is a lot of hard work and a great deal of luck. If the good Lord means for me and mine to survive, he will make it so and if not, we are ready to meet our maker in a much better place than this old worn out world. Never lose touch with that fact. God is in change of all things, even when it doesn't look like it. Have faith and pray often."
5,"Discover the Japanese American History Museum in Los Angeles, California.",travel-leisure," Discover the Japanese American History Museum in Los Angeles, California.

The idea behind the creation of this riveting museum was originally thought up by Bruce Kaji. A local to Los Angeles, Kaji was born nearby in the neighborhood of Boyle Heights. With help from his local peers, Kaji was able to make his idea come to life. The reinvented museum first opened its doors to the public in 1992.

6,Explore Pershing Square – A park in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles.,travel-leisure," Explore Pershing Square – A park in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. Pershing Square is in an exquisite, intimate, one of a kind park located in the center of Downtown Los Angeles.

8,Use Your Vacation Days in Sedona for a Better You,travel-leisure," It’s common knowledge that employees in the United States are some of the hardest working in the world, but there are times when that isn’t such a good thing.  Americans accumulate more than four hundred million unused vacation days every single year, which adds up to a 224 billion dollar vacation liability for their companies.  This number is more than twenty-four times the annual revenue of the National Football League and almost half the size of the Gross State Product of half of the states in the country.  Even though the number does not include sick leave or personal time, it has still managed to grow by over 65 billion in the last year alone.  These liabilities average out to about 1,800 dollars per employee that the company must pay out when an employee leaves their service.  It seems unlikely that these numbers are going to go anywhere but up; according to the Time Off Project started by the US Travel Association, Americans are taking less time off than ever before. Employers aren’t the only ones losing with this system of long hours and ""always on"" work schedules.  Employees who don’t take the time to take care of themselves often see health and productivity decline as they continue to grind away at the office with no break in sight.  It can often be difficult to take that time – there’s always the possibility that a boss or a coworker might call and interrupt a trip – but that is not reason enough to pass on paid time off.  Taking vacation days provides a boost of happiness and wellbeing that stays with employees when they return to the office. Taking vacations also provides workers with a chance to remember how to relax, which in turn gives them a chance to develop resilience in the work place.  Taking time off renews the neural connections in the brain that produce feelings of calm and peace, according to clinical psychiatrist Deborah Mulhern. Taking the body out of a stressful environment gives it a chance to restore and makes it easier to return to that environment and function in it. People who are worried about losing an edge in the office shouldn’t be so concerned either.  There is no evidence of a link between putting in more time at the office and getting a pay raise or bonus. In fact, employees who left eleven to fifteen days of paid time off unused last year are ctually less likely (6.5%) to have received a raise or bonus in the past three years than those who used all of their paid time off. Taking time away from work to rest and rejuvenate is a great idea for both economic and health reasons, and there’s no need to go across the Atlantic or Pacific to find those benefits.  There are many places here in the United States to vacation where it would be impossible to hold on to stress.  For instance, the American Southwest is known for its beautiful weather, gorgeous natural spaces, and an eclectic mix of traditional and modern.  In Sedona, Arizona, vacationers can access incredible state and national parks like the Grand Canyon and miles of hiking trails where walks through nature can help shed off office worries and anxieties.  There are museums and cultural sites to see as well, including Native American ruins from hundreds of years ago that are incredibly well preserved for visitors to experience.  Sedona is also becoming increasingly known for its vineyards, art galleries, and shopping – there’s no need to travel far abroad for these experiences! Of course, a vacation can be made or broken by what accommodations are booked, but visitors to Sedona need look no further than El Portal Sedona Hotel.

9,"University of Tampa College Students Take Theater, Dance and Cultural Tour  in New York City",travel-leisure," As Liza Minnelli once sang in the Broadway Musical Cabaret  ""Life is a Cabaret, Old Chum/Come to the Cabaret.""  The New York City Broadway Musical is the place where a serious actor, dancer, singer or musician arrives in his or her respective profession. The Broadway Musical, like jazz, is uniquely American. Successful Broadway shows and their creators are respected as the top talent in their profession across the globe. The Broadway musical is a form of art that takes a multi-talented ‘village’ of people to produce.    At the core of this is the acting and singing, as well as staging and costuming.  With all of the power of modern technology and imagination Broadway musicals have become even more glamorous then in days past. The sheer spectacle and unbelievable energy of a Broadway show is the reason many want to attend. Yet for a college student, a trip to New York City may be financially beyond their means – or perhaps they would not see the importance of arranging such a journey. So, Paul Finocchiaro, Assistant Professor of Speech, Theater and Dance for the University of Tampa, brings his students to New York City whenever he can.  They attend several Broadway Musicals and expand their life experiences at the same time.  ""This helps them to decide at a young age if going to New York City is even for them,"" says Finocchiaro.  ""Some students will go to New York City, while their classmates will go to other cities to pursue their careers,"" he added.  Orlando is a great city for theater and dance and it’s right in the heart of Florida. Yet when any theater and dance student reflects upon the trip to New York City, it will be a special memory. Many will attend Broadway Musical(s) for the first time.  ""On our Trip we saw three different musicals,"" said Finocchiaro. ""I had the opportunity to talk about how each had a different vibe, style, approach and story line.""  The trip further enhances ""the variety of subjects being taught on a semester by semester basis,"" said Finocchiaro. Plus the student group interacted with diverse ethnicities and cultures while traveling in and around New York City.  Finocchiaro observed, ""These students need to see everyday life:  neighborhoods, good areas, bad areas, dance classes and all of the offerings of a major East Coast city."" Speaking of dance classes, students loved the dance class their professor and the student travel company arranged for them to attend.  ""They were so impressed that the dance captain from Wicked taught it,"" said Finocchiaro. ""Even the acting major loved it. The talk back at the end was SO beneficial. And of course, they loved being invited to the stage door after the performances. "" For some students, a treasured remembrance may be a chance to visit the most famous sites in America, such as the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and the 911 Museum and Memorial.  These sites can also be included on an itinerary, but for theater and dance students, visits to these sites may or may not be a priority. One night, the University of Tampa students even visited a cabaret. The student group visited the Iridium Jazz Club.  ""We saw a different kind of cabaret,"" said Finocchiaro.  ""The students really enjoyed it, and the food at the Iridium Jazz Club is REALLY GOOD!  That was unexpected,"" he added. At home in Tampa, Florida, Finocchiaro says one of his favorite things to do is walk.  ""There is the longest continuous sidewalk in America here,"" he says, ""It’s 7 miles.  One side is Tampa Bay and on the other are multi-million dollar homes.  This walk is breathtaking every time I do it.""  Known by his students as Fino, he also says he’s a fabulous baker and he LOVES landscaping.

12,Grand Canyon Helicopter - What Occurs If I Cancel My Excursion?,travel-leisure," Although you have to pay more to tour the Grand Canyon by helicopter than it does if you take a different type of tour, the cost is well worth it because of the fantastic views you see. Because they do cost more, you definitely want to choose a tour company that gives you a good cancellation policy. That way you won't be out a bunch of money if your travel plans change. You want to read all the fine print and understand the terms and conditions of your tour package before you buy it, don't skip over them like a lot of people do. A helicopter tour might cost $300 per person in your family, so you need to make sure you understand what it is you're buying. Although reading the terms is probably pretty boring, it just might save you money in the long run. One thing you should find in the terms is the company's policy for 48-hour cancellations. The best policy is one that gives you a full refund on the price of your tour if you have to cancel it up to 48 hours in advance of your tour date. Since it is a good idea to buy your tour in advance, so you get the best options, ensuring there is a good cancellation policy in place protects your money in case something unexpected happens and changes your plans. Try To Avoid Same Day Bookings You should plan on booking your helicopter tour at least two weeks before your planned tour date. Even better, you may want to go ahead and book your Grand Canyon tour right after you book your hotel reservation. Then you won't have to worry about booking your tour later, because if you forget, you may be forced to get a last minute tour. The problem with last minute tours is they have no protection in the form of a cancellation policy. If for some reason, you can't make it to your chopper in time, you'll just be out the money you paid. Tour operators need to protect themselves in the event you don't show up, so you can't blame them for not refunding your money, however, you can protect yourself by avoiding these last minute tours altogether. Cancellations Due To Bad Weather While it's not likely you'll have to worry about bad weather grounding your helicopter, there's a remote possibility it could happen. In the event that happens, you don't have to worry because the tour operator will give you your money back or reschedule your tour for you. Feel Safe About Booking In Advance It really isn't hard to find a tour operator that will give you a good cancellation policy on the tour you buy. Tours on Grand Canyon helicopters are very popular with travelers, so booking early is the best practice, and avoiding last minute buys is important or you might lose your money. If you don't book early, the tour you want will probably be full anyway. Booking early is even more important if you have several people in your group and you need multiple seats on the same chopper. When you book a helicopter tour out of Vegas, you can buy an air-only tour or one that lands at the canyon. Both tours offer plenty of scenic views including a flyover of the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. If you take a helicopter tour of the South Rim though, you won't be able to land there. Regulations prohibit Grand Canyon helicopters from flying below the rim and landing on the canyon floor at that end of the canyon. Although you won't be able to take a landing tour, the air tours are definitely worth taking because the scenery is so beautiful. The better tour there is the long one that gives you 50 minutes of air time and lets you see about 75 percent of the entire Grand Canyon National Park. If you want to tour the South Rim, but you're staying in Vegas, you can hop on an airplane and get to the South Rim in about 60 minutes where you can transfer to a chopper for a helicopter tour of the canyon. Conclusion You can see there are a lot of options when it comes to aerial tours of the Grand Canyon, and no matter which tour you choose, it's sure to be a very memorable experience. Just remember to read all the terms so you understand your rights if you need to change your plans. Try to stay away from same day bookings, and if your plans change and you need to cancel your tour, be sure to contact the tour company at least 48 hours ahead of your tour date. And don't worry about bad weather cancellations, because your money will be refunded if your chopper is grounded due to a storm. Start planning your tour now!"
13,An Art Focused Student Trip to New York City,travel-leisure," Desmond Cormier is an art teacher at the Buford Middle School in Charlottesville, Virginia.  He has taught at the school for 16 years. Cormier lives at a nearby farmstead with his wife, Virginia, a sheep farmer.   He became an educator after many years in an entirely different profession.  ""My first career was a commercial deep sea diver and I was also involved in the offshore drilling industry for 17 years,"" says Cormier.  Thanks to the demands of his first profession, he has traveled all over the world. Now Cormier believes his art students should gain exposure to the world through travel at an early age. Each year, Cormier organizes a student trip to New York City and invites students to take a deeper look at ‘the city that never sleeps.’ ""When I was young, I toured all over the world,"" says Cormier, ""I think it’s a valuable experience to bring these students to New York City and let them see the world through their own eyes,"" he added.  Basically, Cormier attempts to schedule a class trip to New York City for those interested in taking a long weekend. Student trips to New York City took place in 2013 & 2014. In 2015, Cormier says he couldn’t get the number of students needed to travel, yet he’s planning to travel again with his students over the long term. While on tour of New York City, students visit world famous art museums, such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Cormier says this is an excellent opportunity to take in some masterpieces.  ""Students see these famous works of art in real life.  These artistic treasures are totally different in a museum, in their original form,"" he observed. Touring such large museums may be a daunting endeavor for a teacher and his class. Cormier says ""The Metropolitan Museum of Art was overwhelming and MOMA is such large museum it is hard to take it all in.""  However, the Guggenheim Museum’s set-up is perfect, because, students have to go from the top down to the bottom. ""The way the museum is designed, they have to see the entire collection and exhibitions,"" commented Cormier. In addition to touring art museums as a complement to their studies, students also immerse themselves in the New York City experience. Here there are exposed to the diversity of the U.S. population, by visiting immigrant neighborhoods, and experiencing a lively artistic culture as well as global cuisine choices. ""We had dinner in Times Square and the kids loved the excitement of it all. It was Saturday night,"" said Cormier.   The student group also visited Chinatown, toured the New York Harbor, and saw the Empire State Building, among other sites. After touring the world, Cormier eventually returned to Charlottesville, Virginia, because it’s home to him.  ""My wife loves sheep farming.  I love Charlottesville, because I am an alumni of University of Virginia and it’s my hometown."" His daughter lives in Charlottesville with his three grandchildren and Cormier also has a son in San Francisco. His views about becoming a well-rounded artist include the incorporation of travel, consideration of great artistic works, and exposure to different cultures, cuisines, architecture and social customs.

14,Grand Canyon National Park Helicopters - Do These During the Spring Time Holidays,travel-leisure," Spring Break is upon us, and it's high time for students around the US to get out there and make the most of the time off, and the weather. If you're tired of the 'same old' Spring Break, or even if you just want to do something completely different, why not book a Grand Canyon Air Tour? You can fly to the Grand Canyon from Las Vegas or Arizona. From Vegas you will head out to the West Rim, whereas Arizona flights start their tours from the South Rim. If you're in Vegas and you want to see the South, North, and East Rim areas of the National Park, there are direct flights that can be packaged with helicopter tours once you arrive in Arizona. Tours Departing from Las Vegas When you head out from Las Vegas in a Grand Canyon helicopter you will pass over the iconic Hoover Dam and adjacent Lake Mead. This is a little extra sightseeing that actually improves the overall package. For the Canyon itself, there are both landing and air-only tours to choose from. I love the landing tours, especially the one that goes to the bottom of the canyon. Here you can experience a Champagne picnic on the banks of the Colorado River. These bottom landing tours can even be coupled with a riverboat ride, allowing you to see even more of the beautiful rock formations around the river basin. If you land at the top of the canyon, you will get to explore the nearby areas and even take a walk out over the famous Grand Canyon Skywalk. Looking down 4000ft to the bottom of the Canyon is a breathtaking and exhilarating experience. Tours Departing from Arizona If you're starting in Arizona, or even if you take a flight there from Vegas, you'll be departing on your helicopter ride right outside the gates of the National Park. Helicopter tours begin at the South Rim, and the standard tour will take you to the remote North Rim and back again. This is a 30 minute tour which takes you over some beautiful landscapes. Even though there are no landing tours at the South Rim, there are still unique benefits when you depart from Arizona. If you take the deluxe 50 minute tour you will get to see a staggering 75% of the park. These almost hour long Grand Canyon helicopter tours go from the South Rim, to the North Rim, and then out to the Eastern Rim boundary. You will see more of the Grand Canyon on Spring Break with this tour than many will in their entire lifetimes. If you're looking for even more excitement, you can choose a tour that bundles a 30 minute air tour with a 2 hour jeep ride. This allows you to see all of the Canyon's most famous landmarks from the air, and close up on the ground. Helicopter Tours Are Popular, So Book Early Tours can easily become booked out during Spring Break, so it's essential to RSVP as early as possible. I recommend an advance booking of 2 weeks as a minimum, but if you can make it earlier, then go right ahead. Basically, as soon as you've confirmed your hotel bookings you should take care of your helicopter tickets as your next priority. Booking online is safe and convenient, and doing so will give you access to live schedules to see exactly what is available. Best of all, online rates don't carry any additional travel agent or booking fees, so as long as you complete the whole process online you can make significant savings. Conclusion Hopefully this article helps you to get the most out of your Spring Break trip to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon helicopter tours offer the ultimate in sightseeing. For those who want some adventure to go with the majestic views, a landing tour at the West Rim, or a jeep tour at the South Rim would fit the bill. Remember to book your air tour early. Spring Break means that tickets are already selling out, so the sooner you get in, the more chance you will have of confirming a flight on your preferred day."
15,Why opt for a Tanzania safari,travel-leisure," Tanzania is one country with the power of changing you. It starts with your outlook on vacations and makes you question everything you have ever experienced, then it moves on to prove that not everything you see on Animal Planet ever did justice to what you are seeing in person, and no, we are not talking about two elephants and a rhinoceros doing it in the middle of the road. Going on a Tanzania Safari makes you a true adventurer. So if you have a taste for such things, make sure that you book a safari for yourself. Safari is a journey that the 13th century traders came up with. They hunted the plains of Africa and boasted their prize on their walls. Today, most of travelers and tourists explore wildlife opportunities to take a selfie and find their inner-selves in the wilderness —do not expect to slay any beasts and take home any trophies— the experience of the journey is rewarding enough and makes the safari tour worth it. Witness the Majesty of Nature Life is way too short to miss out on occasions like seeing hundred of zebras migrating through the rich green grass lands or the life version of the flocks of flamingoes that cover a lake and make their own plane from afar. And if that is not scenic enough for you, Tanzania Safaris even let you see mighty lions feasting on their hard earned prey.The big five that make up a truly memorable Safari in Tanzania are the rhinoceroses, elephants, leopards, lions, and buffalos. The chance to get close to wild animals in their natural habitat is an unparalleled experience and is like a drug to thrill-seekers. That being said, don’t get too close to the animals (especially the elephants and rhinos) and stick with your guide. The Culture Safaris are not just good for seeing wild life. In fact, they help you introduce yourself to a whole new culture as well. You get to meet the people who have perhaps the longest history on earth and still practice the most ancient of traditions. This is something truly priceless and the memory of your interaction will stay with you forever. Who knows, you might even come across learning something valuable through the experience. It Is Not Like You Will Be On Your Feet All Day When most people hear about a safari, their excitement tones down after their brain reminds them that they will have to arrange for lodging and what not for their own comfort. Tracking the great five is fun but you do not want to be doing that all day, and for that, you need a place to crash at night. Only the greatest safari expeditions let you enjoy the tours and arrange for your lodging and everything that you will need as a guest in their beautiful country. So stop just day dreaming about your safari and make that dream come true with our Tanzania Expeditions where you can enjoy tracking wild life and have a truly one-of-a-kind experience that you can boast about forever. About Tanzania Expeditions Tanzania Expeditions is a travel and safari tour company that works to provide explorers and tourists with custom safari tours. Their main aim is to provide its clients with life changing experiences as they explore the plains of Tanzania, observing wildlife and the big five. The company has excellent safari guides and exclusive lodges and camps."

18,Summer Sights to be Seen in Sedona,travel-leisure," The American Southwest is rarely mentioned as an ideal vacation destination during the summer months, and Arizona has an especially poor reputation with its high temperatures.  However, there is a lovely place in the state that stays lively and much cooler than the rest – Sedona.  Mountains surround Sedona, Arizona, protecting it from much of the heat that makes other areas of the state much warmer. With national parks, festivals, and events throughout the summer months, Sedona is an excellent choice for a getaway spot.  Here are seven things to see in Sedona during the summer months. Sedona offers miles and miles of beautiful trails for hiking and biking that are suitable for explorers of all skill levels.  There are flat trails that wind their way around the foot of hills, offering spectacular views of the landscape and rock formations that make up the Sedona desert – perfect for those with younger families.  There are also more difficult treks that climb up from the bottoms of canyons or reach the tops of the rocks, where hikers can enjoy the sprawling vistas beneath their feet; giving the teenager and thrill seekers in the family all the excitement desired!  These aren’t just for human feet! Many of these trails are pet friendly, so bring your energetic dog along for the walk. The Sedona Hummingbird Festival is truly a sight to behold.  Held this year from July 31 to August 2 when the population of hummingbirds is the highest and most diverse, these three days are always filled to the brim with free exhibits and special garden tours or breakfast with these colorful little birds. But hurry, tickets for special engagements go quickly: http://www.hummingbirdsociety.org/purchase-tickets-2015/ The artistic soul of Sedona thrives vibrantly in galleries, shops, and squares peppered throughout the town.  Tlaquepaque Arts and Crafts Village offers frequent events, shows, and celebrations throughout the year, and summer is no exception. Also, the first Friday of each month, from 5:00pm until 8:00pm, the Sedona Gallery Association puts together a showcase to highlight artists, special exhibits, and events for locals and visitors alike – a great way to experience three of Sedona’s biggest art locations – Tlaquepaque, Hillside Sedona, and Uptown Sedona.  So come and see talent and creativity can flourish in the beautiful desert. First Fridays are free and they include opening receptions. Ride the trolley for free between venues! Don’t leave the kids out! There are many state and national parks located close to Arizona, but the one with the biggest draw during the summer months is Slide Rock State Park.  It was named one of the top ten state parks in the country just last year! The smooth, slippery natural waterslide that ends in a swimming hole is a fun and cooling way to spend a day with the family. Red Rock State Park also has activities for the kiddos with Ranger programs, guided nature walks, and special guest speakers or presentations. One area not to be missed is The Crescent Moon Ranch Picnic Area at Red Rock Crossing. There’s fishing, swimming, and lots of fun just wading in the creek; as well as a great picnic area and beautiful scenery to photograph. If history and culture are more interesting than hiking and festivals, there are plenty of places where hours can be spent learning about the history of the Southwest.  Sedona has a Heritage Museum with exhibits featuring art from across the region and educational exhibits about everyday life in the town from the nineteenth century until present day.  Sedona is also the location of two Indian ruin sites – the Palatki and Honanki Heritage sites.  Take time to see Montezuma Castle and Well, a National Monument about 30 minutes from Sedona. The walks involved in any of these cultural experiences are minimal, making them an excellent way to spend a day without working too hard! Sedona is also known as a peaceful and rejuvenating place, a spectacular and powerful place – attracting mediums, meditation experts, and many others. Some visitors come for a life-changing experience, rejuvenation of the spirit, or an energy specific vortex visit. Sedona offers numerous spiritual retreats, healing experiences, and psychic readings to choose from. If a life-changing or more spiritual experience is of interest, there are many retreats hosted throughout the year or energy vortex visits and tours visitors to choose between. Of course, what kind of visit to Arizona, the ""Grand Canyon State,"" would be complete without a trip to the Grand Canyon itself?  Sedona is located less than two hours away from one of the seven natural wonders of the world – there are many day tours offered that begin in Sedona, or visitors can drive themselves the short way up to the national park to enjoy the truly stunning views of the Grand Canyon and some of the walks around the rim. (Leashed pets are allowed on trails above the rim). Of course, these are not the only ways to spend your summer days in Sedona.  There are wine tours, jeep excursions, horseback riding, golf, shopping, and plenty of other things to fill up the day when you come and visit.
