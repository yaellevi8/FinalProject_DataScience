1,HOW AND WHEN CAN I GET AUTHORIZATION TO REMOVE GEESE FROM MY PROPERTY?,business," The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a wild native of North America that has been introduced to many other parts of the world. Post-industrialization, all birds are protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. What does the Migratory Birds Convention Act do? The Migratory Birds Convention Act (also known as the MBCA) is Canadian legislation passed in 1917 and significantly updated in June 1994 that regulates the protection of migratory birds, their eggs, and their nests from being destroyed by wood harvesting, hunting, trafficking, and commercialization. It is very important to note that the Canadian goose falls under this act. This means that it is illegal to harm one of these birds due to their migratory status. Can I kill Geese in Canada? No. This act also implies that the Canadian goose, like any other Canadian bird on this list, can not be hurt or killed without facing very serious consequences by law. The continuous expansion of residential areas near waterways has contributed to the Canada goose occupation of new habitats, which has continued to cause problems. Unfortunately, they are an aggressive species that can pose multiple threats. What kind of problems can geese cause? Geese can be dangerous or annoying to people in a variety of ways. Canada geese may be a significant safety hazard to aircraft at airports, producing hazardous takeoff and landing conditions, and most airports have aggressive hazing campaigns to reduce the danger. Nesting Canada geese will aggressively defend their nesting grounds, and aggressive pairs can sometimes result in injuries, especially to small children or domestic animals. Large flocks of Canada Geese can denude grassy areas, including parks, pastures, golf courses, lawns, and other landscaped areas where the grass is kept short and where there are ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water nearby, necessitating expensive turf-management activities by landowners. Goose droppings in specific locations where many people and geese co-exist, such as golf courses, parks, and beaches, can be a problem. Overgrazed pastures and poor water quality have increased as Canada’s Goose populations have expanded, causing agricultural and natural resource damage including depredation of grain crops. Geese may also compete with conservation agencies for other species or sensitive ecosystems’ objectives. This battle occurs when geese aggress other animals directly or indirectly via the grazing’s effect on habitats. What to do when you have a geese problem? Knowing how to get rid of them humanely but effectively is important if you have a Canadian goose problem. They tend to be stubborn once they decide to stay near your property, and eliminating them on your own without the right tools or expertise can be dangerous. You need experts that can scare and remove these birds in a safe manner. Here are 6 Things You Should Know When Dealing with Goose Removal in Mississauga of Canada: Canadian geese were once solely wild birds that had no connection with humans. Since the arrival of European settlers, these animals have adapted to the introduction of food sources offered by humans. Numerous studies have shown that well-fed geese are more likely to be aggressive towards people and pets than hungry geese. The reason is quite simple: hunger makes them afraid, so they try everything they can to protect themselves. Don’t make their task easier by feeding them! Canadian geese can fly up to 50 mph (80 km/h), and they will use this speed and their 1-foot long wingspan as weapons if they feel threatened. They might not hurt you, but the injuries caused by flying debris or a direct hit can be severe! Don’t approach Canadian geese or their nests, and keep your pets away from them as well. A mother Canada goose will do anything to protect her eggs or goslings. If you notice a nest on your property, stay away from it at all costs! Even if the parents are nowhere in sight, they could be hiding nearby, easily scared away by loud noise or sudden motion. If you need to clear a nest, it is best to have an animal control service do the job for you. Canada geese usually lay between 4–8 eggs, with the average clutch size being 6. During this period, make sure you keep your distance from nests, even if they are empty. As the date gets closer to hatching, the parents will be more protective of their brood. Canadian geese are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, which means that it is illegal to hunt or capture them without a special permit. If you notice someone harming Canadian geese in your area, call Animal Services right away. Getting rid of Canadian geese can be difficult, especially when there are young goslings in the picture. This is not something we recommend you attempt by yourself. With our years of experience in animal control, we have dealt with hundreds of Canadian geese and know just what to do to eliminate the problem safely and humanely."
2,Effective Compliance: A twenty point plan for business leaders,business," All businesses are subject to regulations, some more than others. In healthcare, financial services, energy, defense, and high-tech sectors, regulatory demands are onerous and complex, and more so if the business is global. Business leaders are compelled to respond. Apart from penalties and fines, violations or even lack of effective compliance programs can result in loss of customers, markets, investors, and at times, the ability to get financing and required licenses to stay in business. And, if a violation becomes public (easy in today’s information environment), the negative effect on the brand and reputation can be especially harmful, diluting trust in the business and its offerings for years to come. Of even greater concern is the possibility of individual prosecutions (civil and criminal) for even deliberate disregard or negligence in responding to regulatory mandates. The US Department of Justice continues to focus on prosecuting individuals (particularly those in authority) as a better deterrent. This article advises business leaders on how to respond to regulatory demands in a strategic way to satisfy their obligations and to establish a maximally effective compliance function. Leadership response Active leadership involvement is considered by regulatory authorities as instrumental to any company’s compliance effort. Per the US Department of Justice, (among factors impacting compliance) “… the most important is the role and conduct of management”. And, per the US Department of Treasury, “… for a compliance program to be effective, it should have the demonstrable support of leadership”. Obviously, regulators understand that without a modicum of direct and committed leadership, compliance is prone to weakness or failure. Even so, the impetus to respond to regulatory exposure varies. At one extreme, regulatory risk is overlooked, underestimated, or sacrificed in pursuit of other priorities. Consequently, compliance gets peripheral attention, only scrutinized event by event or, worse, ignored altogether. At the other extreme, there are outright demands for compliance by customers, the company board, regulators, key partners and vendors, or by risk assessors and auditors. Leadership is then compelled to respond. Ideally, compliance risks ought to be well understood and assumed upfront as integral to the organization’s overall risk posture. This should be followed by focused and competent response by the company leadership and the board. Taking Action So what should business leadership do? The usual advice is to cultivate “tone at the top”, pursue a “culture of compliance”, and “walk the walk”. These do help but are inadequate. Same applies to the singular emphasis on integrity and ethics. It helps but it is insufficient. What is needed is a deliberate approach to assimilate compliance in the actual workings of the organization. To put it another way, compliance must be designed-in so that it is intrinsic to how the organization routinely conducts itself. Too often compliance staff is sporadically added or the compliance team positioned as an appendage in the organizational architecture. This is akin to managing talent without an integrated HR function or ensuring accurate financial reporting without a standards-based accounting function. No wonder compliance is often a struggle and potential violations (of at least related policies and directives) a persistent source of angst. The solution is to establish a strategically positioned compliance function within the formal organizational hierarchy with sufficient reach and competence to become a participant in company decisions, direction, and relationships. The US Department of Justice expects compliance programs to be well designed, in good faith and work in practice. This means compliance is not simply a patchwork of policies, mandates, processes and alerts. And, it is certainly not an occasional distraction or after-thought. A practical checklist for company leaders Taking the range of regulatory guidance and expert advice into account, the following twenty questions can serve as a checklist, assessment tool, and action plan for company leadership to ensure effective compliance. Have you … Issued clear and unequivocal statements committing your company to regulatory compliance, including your approach to achieving it? (In a code of conduct, mission or values statement, corporate policy, and similar documents). Formed a board committee (or assigned an existing one) with sufficient expertise to regularly engage, understand, assess, oversee and respond to compliance concerns and challenges? Established a high-level risk and compliance committee consisting of operational and functional leaders to be informed, and to deliberate, resolve, and support the compliance function with mandates, direction and oversight? Appointed a chief compliance officer (CCO) and support staff, as needed, with sufficient stature, autonomy and direct access to company leadership and the board? Structured the compliance function for autonomy and independence from business operations and other departments, such as, marketing and sales, to ensure its objectivity and avoid conflicts of interest? Positioned the compliance department to have status comparable to other necessary functions, e.g., HR, finance, tax, sales, security, etc.? Delegated frontline compliance responsibility within operations and relevant functions, such as, through the three lines of defense COSO protocol, to ensure transactional oversight and control? Established compliance accountability (including disciplinary actions) and incentives (including promotions and bonuses) for the organization’s leaders and managers regardless of their assigned operational or functional responsibility? Added conflict of interest screening, compliance or policy violations, and overall commitment to compliance in your hiring, assignment, and promotion decisions? Ensured that all strategic decisions, including new business pursuits, product or service offerings, client and vendor agreements, partner and JV arrangements, and acquisitions or mergers are subject to review and input from the compliance function at the outset? Implemented regulatory due diligence processes to evaluate all third party relationships, including vendors, contractors, partners, and new hires prior to executing applicable agreements and onboarding? Implemented a third party qualification and control program to screen, evaluate, monitor, assess, support, train, integrate and commit third parties to meet company compliance standards? Positioned and empowered the compliance function to access relevant operational data and information to enable comprehensive regulatory oversight? Included compliance in company-wide risk assessments and mitigation efforts using specialized regulatory subject matter expertise? Directed the audit function to develop or acquire specific subject-matter capability, especially for high-risk compliance exposures, and empowered it to investigate and report critical findings to company leadership/board? Implemented a hotline, comment mailboxes, trip wires and other red flag reporting mechanisms (with protection from intimidation and retaliation for whistleblowers) to alert you to policy and regulatory violations, unwanted compliance events, and enforcement actions? Implemented a central company-wide program for tracking violations and remediation, supplemented by secure processes for self-reporting and voluntary disclosures? Ensured that costs of compliance are fully incorporated in the feasibility of any business expansion, project or venture? Regularly reviewed the compliance budget allocation to ensure that there is sufficient latitude for it to successfully execute its charter, including the cost of expertise and talent, training and development, legal resources, professional association memberships, travel, investigations, and technology? Mandated that business unit P&L’s incorporate compliance costs (objectively determined or verified by the compliance and accounting functions) as integral to their overhead? Note: Carrying compliance costs solely at the corporate level fails to truly assign compliance responsibility and account for the true cost of the operation or business pursuit. Many of the actions implied by the above questions are commonly prescribed. Others are suggested only in specific circumstances. But to achieve full impact, all are necessary to establish a compliance function that has legitimacy, authority, reach, resources, and feedback to effectively pursue its mission. And, for any compliance program to be truly effective. And, while rogue events can never be entirely prevented, diligently addressing each of the above questions will minimize such events and demonstrate that the leadership has done its part. Some caveats In the effort to enhance compliance, the following presumptions are essential: a. Execution of compliance initiatives and programs must be assigned to compliance professionals (not just a good manager or a smart lawyer — unless trained and experienced in compliance). Compliance is an established and specialized endeavor. b. Compliance critically depends on the effectiveness of other functions. For example, if accounting lacks adequate processes and standards, the compliance function will have difficulty implementing controls to prevent money laundering or bribery; if procurement is lax in vendor onboarding and monitoring, the compliance function will have difficulty screening for sanctions and imposing compliance protocols; if logistics is unable to control the supply chain, the compliance function will have difficulty preventing prohibited transactions, e.g., exports to embargoed destinations, and so on. c. The use of consultants may be helpful, but it is often a distraction. Only fully imbedded consultants will have sufficient knowledge of the company and its organization to define and execute compliance initiatives. There is no substitute for intimate familiarity with the people, operations, direction, challenges, and structural characteristics of the enterprise in the design and conduct of compliance. Final word None of the leadership involvements suggested in this article should result in additional outlays over and above what is already budgeted for compliance. If they do happen to materially increase compliance costs, it will be fair to assume that compliance is not adequately resourced. This in itself is a matter for leadership deliberation. On the other hand, positive actions resulting from the questions above could significantly reduce compliance costs, not just from preventing violations but because of the enhanced efficiency and effectiveness of the compliance program and function. And finally, it must be said that lack of direct and sincere leadership engagement in compliance is not only untenable but potentially a dereliction of regulatory responsibility. The guidance in this article is a practical way for company leadership to do its part to achieve effective compliance and to avoid being complicit in its weakness or failure."

4,What you need to know about Seagull Control in Peel Region.,business," You see them at the beach all the time, but did you know that seagulls can be a problem in your backyard? These birds love to roost and nest on residential rooftops and commercial buildings.   With their sharp beaks and loud cawing, a seagull infestation can cause problems for Mississauga residents. One large gull will make as much noise as 35-40 smaller birds. The biggest problem with having seagulls around is the mess they leave behind. Their droppings create an unsightly layer of residue on buildings and walkways. The nutrient-rich excrement also serves as a breeding ground for insects and bacteria, making it a public health issue. If that's not enough, seagulls can be aggressive and dive-bomb children and pets in an attempt to chase them away from their nests. The good news is that they are not difficult to remove when you call in the experts at Hawkeye bird and animal control. We provide humane methods for removing these pests from your property, and our professionals will make sure they never come back. Here are some frequently asked questions to which you may have already wondered about. After all, this may be your first encounter with the birds. Who Can Remove Seagull Nests? Only certified animal control companies like ourselves! When you try to handle the problem on your own, you run the risk of failure, with the birds returning or injury as a result of your unfamiliarity with seagulls and their territory. We've been dealing with a variety of birds for many years, and we're experts in handling every sort of wildlife removal issue. We have successfully removed seagull nests from commercial and residential properties in Mississauga in the past and can do the same for you. How Long Do Seagulls Stay in the Nest? Seagulls' nests are typically built in the springtime, but these nests can remain in place for up to four months. This means that seagulls typically only use their nests in the warmer months of the year, so if you are unlucky enough to experience seagull problems during this period then you will have to endure them until they leave on their own. Seagulls stay with their nests for about 30 days after they hatch.  During this time, they need to remain protected so that they can grow and thrive. Hawkeye's bird and animal control can remove the nest before any young are hatched, or we can relocate the entire nest to a safe area. Can I Remove Seagull Nests Myself? You can try to remove a seagull nest on your own, but these birds are extremely protective of their young. If you don't know what you're doing, then you can easily be injured. You can also risk having the birds attack you. This is why it is best to leave seagulls removal to the experts by calling Hawkeye. Do seagulls kill cats? As seagulls are birds of prey, they are capable of killing tiny animals, such as cats. However, there is no evidence that seagulls specifically target household pets. Seagulls do love fish and garbage, so these creatures will eat anything they can get their beaks on. So, if it smells like food, then a seagull will eat it. Can I kill a seagull in Canada that's on my property? It is not legal to kill a seagull in Mississauga, and in Canada in general as migratory birds, such as seagulls, are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, meaning it is illegal to shoot them. It's also dangerous because seagulls will defend their young and could cause serious injuries if they feel threatened. Instead of taking matters into your own hands, call the professionals at Hawkeye for all your seagull removal needs. What is the fine for killing a seagull in Canada? If you kill a seagull in Mississauga, then depending on the time of year it will be either $500 or $1,000.  Offenders can face fines up to this amount under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. In addition, killing a seagull could result in six months or more in jail as well as a criminal record. Bottom line?  It's just not worth it. What is the difference between seagull control and seagull removal? Seagull control is more than just removing nests from buildings. In order to fully resolve a seagull problem, it must be undertaken as a multi-pronged effort that includes prevention and deterrence. Hawkeye’s bird and animal control technicians will inspect your property for any areas where seagulls are gaining access to roost.

5,The Authentic Manager,business," The Authentic Manager What does it take to be an authentic manager? I think this can be summed up by the definition of authentic; according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary; “true to one's own personality, spirit, or character is sincere and authentic with no pretensions”©. No pretensions, this is hard to find in today’s society. We have grown into a self-centered group where the question is always in the back of most people’s mind “what is in it for me”. I believe business and management has evolved to a self-centered way of thinking, where everyone has started to look out for their own self and not the greater good. When was the last time that you have talked to someone, and they actually listened to you? They did not interject their own story or impede on yours. Managers need to act like coaches where they are looking out to build a team with the idea of the entire group succeeding instead of just their own good. What happened to the team concept? I believe much verbiage is given to it, but not practiced. To be authentic, you have to be true to yourself. To be able to look in the mirror and ask yourself, are you doing the best for the whole or just yourself? There is an old poem out there by Dale Wimbrow, 1934 titled The Guy in the Glass ©. The Guy in the Glass When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf, And the world makes you King for a day, Then go to the mirror and look at yourself, And see what that guy has to say. For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife, Who, judgement upon you must pass. The feller whose verdict counts most in your life Is the guy staring back from the glass. He's the feller to please, never mind all the rest, For he's with you clear up to the end, And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test If the guy in the glass is your friend. You may be like Jack Horner and ""chisel"" a plum, And think you're a wonderful guy, But the man in the glass says you're only a bum If you can't look him straight in the eye. You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years, And get pats on the back as you pass, But your final reward will be heartaches and tears If you've cheated the guy in the glass. I believe this says it all. People that are authentic listen to you and are genuinely concerned about what you have to say. They are supportive and process what you are saying. They are not thinking about themselves, but ponder how they can help you. Likewise, they are morally honest and upfront with you. You can tell they are different by how they present themselves. Their story is not about them, but about you. They think about how they can support you and the group as a whole. They also know how not to sacrifice themselves and hold on to their own integrity. What has happened to this type of manager? Where have they gone? I believe that the pressure to conform to society and the business world has caused them to bury themselves. It is no longer accepted to stand out or up for one’s self, but to conform to the group. If you don’t conform to the group, you are a threat to your fellow managers and to the management above you. Hence, it has become unsafe to be authentic in business. You have to sacrifice yourself to survive and maintain your job. This is sad and a shame that we are doing this. For it is not doing mankind any justice. We have become Jack Horner and chiseled ourselves a plum. ©"

Wondering how to get rid of pigeons or stop them from roosting on your roof, railing, soffits and deck? The trusted experts at Hawkeye can help! We have been helping property owners set up pigeon netting in Mississauga for years! Pigeons are one of the most common pests that you can find in your home or yard.

If you do find a way to keep them off the property, they could move on to your neighbour’s place! A good thing about hiring professionals is that we don’t just stop at getting rid of pigeons; we will also make sure they don’t come back. Are Pigeons dangerous? Pigeons can be dangerous and they can make a big mess on your property. They leave droppings around which can be dangerous to humans, especially children. If left unattended, these droppings will also lead to the accumulation of bacteria that is harmful for human health. No one wants pigeons hanging out at their place! Period! How can I get rid of pigeons? There are two types of netting that stop pigeons, standard weight and heavy-duty weight. Standard weight netting can be used to protect plants, prevent rabbits from getting into your garden. It also is a mesh type of material that will keep out most animals including raccoons if they try to climb or burrow through it. The quality of the fabric is not as strong as the heavy-duty weight netting. The heavy-duty weight netting is a much more durable material, though it is also more expensive. It can be used to protect livestock from coyotes and other predators. It will stop any animal from digging or climbing through it. This type of netting comes with a longer manufacturer’s warranty and will not tear like the standard weight netting. Does Netting stop pigeons? Yes, netting stops pigeons by preventing them from roosting or nesting on your property. It also keeps other types of birds such as starlings and crows out of tight spaces where they can cause damage to your home. These birds are known for building nests in these tight spaces which can affect the structural integrity of your home. Pigeons are great at finding the perfect little spot to build their nests. They will find a corner, crevice or opening that they think is out of sight and out of mind. These spots may be anywhere on your property and if you have a pigeon infestation it’s best to have the netting installed right away so they can’t find another spot. Why do pigeons keep coming back to my house? If you have had pigeons roosting on your roof, railing or next to windows you know how excited they become when they come back year after year. Their cooing and loud noises can be very aggravating especially if they are nesting right next to your bedroom window. Pigeons are very territorial birds, this means once they find a perfect spot on your roof or fence line they will keep coming back every year until something happens to make them leave. Netting is the best way to get rid of these pesky birds once and for all. It will keep them off your property and stop other pigeons from even thinking about roosting on your roof or next to your windows and doors. Large groups of pigeons can also roost inside water equipment on your roof such as the AC units. If you have been seeing pigeons on top of or inside of these items, it’s time to hire a professional to install some netting and get rid of these birds for good. Give Hawkeye’s Bird and Animal control a call if you have a pigeon infestation; we can professionally set up the netting for you so that you may enjoy your property without the fear of these birds damaging it."
7,Do you think you have a squirrel problem?,business," It's not surprising, given that Ontario has 22 distinct squirrel species. Squirrels are a problem for residents of Toronto and Mississauga as their population is ever-growing. More squirrels mean a greater chance of them invading homes and buildings. As squirrel populations continue to expand, these furry guys can cause damage to homes and commercial buildings by chewing on wires and causing fires. Yes, you read that right, squirrels have been known to cause fires! What are Squirrels? Squirrels are small rodents that adapt well to changing seasons and environments. They are not nocturnal animals. They are, in fact, diurnal animals, which means they prefer to be active during the day. This also means you'll notice them if you have them on your property. They are quite noisy when they are above you in your attic or playing on your walls. Where do Squirrels live? Squirrels thrive when there is plenty of food, water and shelter available to them. This means squirrels have no boundaries on where they can establish their homes - which means squirrels can choose anywhere to live, including inside your home or commercial property!  They frequently crawl into attics to keep warm during the winter months, where they may easily gnaw through the insulation to make their own home. Once they get comfortable, they will build a nest for their squirrel babies to live in. Because squirrels are very social creatures, they will continue to come back and make the same home year after year if not removed correctly. Squirrels are cute, but their presence in your home is anything but. Once they begin nesting, it's nearly impossible to get squirrels out on your own. Trying to trap or remove them yourself can be dangerous because squirrels are known for carrying diseases that can transfer to humans. They can also become aggressive when cornered or threatened, so it's best to leave squirrel removal up to our professional wildlife control experts. Here are 4 Things You Need To Know About Hawkeye's Squirrel Removal Services : First, we check to see whether you have squirrels and where they are nesting. They may enter homes and buildings via tiny fissures and gaps, which they can pass through as their bodies measure around a clenched fist in size. There are different signs of a squirrel infestation such as sounds in the walls, droppings,  nests, visibly chewed wires and obvious damage. Second, we go over the different methods of removal we have available. Rest assured that there are many humane ways squirrels can be removed from your properties and professional squirrel removal companies like Hawkeye Bird and Animal Control Specialists can take care of squirrels.

Saves us time and your money. Can I keep a squirrel as a pet? We're frequently asked if people can keep them as pets, which is understandable since they appear to be so cute. The answer is no. There are some videos online of people with pet squirrels that seem docile and domesticated.  But those are rare and special cases.   A squirrel will never be a pet like a cat or a dog, they need to live outside where they can enjoy their natural habitat. Sadly, many squirrels we come across in Toronto and Mississauga; especially baby squirrels who have been abandoned by their mother are in very poor health and need professional help that you cannot provide. It's very important to remember that they are not intended to be domesticated and you can never know how many illnesses they may carry. It may appear to be a good idea, especially if it's a baby squirrel, but in the long run, squirrels are wild animals that should be left in nature. No matter how cute they may look to you. We understand taking matters into your own hand might seem like a good idea if you think a squirrel is injured, but you need to remember that they can and will become agitated and aggressive, especially if they have a nest of babies nearby. Squirrel mamas are very territorial and will protect their babies which means they might bite if you get too close. If you're worried about the squirrels' safety, don't be. Our squirrel removal experts will remove squirrels in a humane way without harming them. We can assist if a squirrel is too sick to return to the wild. Wildlife rehabilitation centers exist that can help us. It's critical not to attempt to capture or trap the squirrel on your own! Hawkeye Wildlife Control has been solving Toronto and  Mississauga's squirrel problems for years, providing sustainable, safe, and humane squirrel removal services.

The most apparent example is court reporters, who must write down testimonies in real time. Law companies, on the other hand, require transcribing services in order to categorise and keep court or client records. Transcripts are extremely important for court proceedings since text cannot be interpreted in the same way that voice can. Transcriptions of each court session will be required to guarantee paralegals and attorneys can explore the facts of a case promptly and efficiently without mistakes. Healthcare Industry The healthcare business would struggle to function without medical transcribing. The whole industry needs tangible records of patient files, recordings of patient notes and procedures, and associated instructional material uploaded by medical receptionists. The usage of medical language distinguishes the necessity for transcriptionists. Without such information, a medical layperson reading their personal papers may feel as if they are reading a different language. Transcriptionists enable doctors to concentrate on their patients. Consulting Firms Formal interviews of their employers' products and services are required for both consulting companies. Most consultants will record all interviewers, if they do not have a transcriptionist on staff, they must type up a separate document for their findings. Qualitative interviews are pointless unless you record your results. Consulting firms use transcription services to provide precise and clear records of their participants' exact comments, which can then be carefully examined and utilised inside the organisation. Video Production Companies A video production team creates video material for social media, television, advertisements, and business promotions. A video production company should employ a transcription service to provide their clients with another option for creating non-audio material. Students, professors, and doctorates The transcribing of academic texts aids both students and academicians. Examples include class lectures, seminars, films or other source materials for research papers, and interviews. Many major universities and colleges now provide free internet access to their course content, which primarily consists of lecture transcripts. Market analysts If you go to the trouble of gathering feedback and other data as part of your market research by conducting interviews, focus groups, or other outreach, you can make the most of the information you collect by recording it and having it transcribed. This ensures that you have an exact record of your participants' replies, which can be carefully analysed for the intricacies of their views and emotions, making your data as helpful as possible. Individuals at events and keynote Speakers When organising an event, having the keynote address transcribed is an excellent approach to ensure that it is remembered. When a transcribed version of a keynote address is made available online, its reach is greatly expanded; also, the transcribed format serves as an excellent marketing tool for your firm. Podcasters Providing a transcription of your podcast allows folks who prefer reading information rather than listening to it a choice. Podcast transcription allows your audience to consume your material in a new way, broadening its reach. Content writers Transcriptionists are used by SEO content writers in digital marketing companies to turn podcasts and webinars into text for their customers' blog articles or websites. Transcriptionists can also help to convert videos with actors into written transcripts that may be recycled as content for such sites. Businesses In business, circumstances arise frequently where transcribing might be valuable for collecting and retaining information. As a result, businesses are increasingly relying on transcription to store and archive accurate recordings of interviews, meetings, and crucial phone conversations."
9,Here are 5 Signs that raccoons may be living in your attic.,business," We have seen time and time again that homes aren’t well secured to keep pests out. Raccoons tend to take advantage of this little fun fact. These annoying bandits are not only smart creatures but very adventurous ones as well. Whether it’s for food or adventure, there is almost no length they won’t go to get what they want. They can be very determined when trying to find their way into your home especially. But how can you tell whether your home is infested with raccoons? We’ve compiled a list of indications that might assist you in determining whether or not to contact us! This is one of the most common signs of any pest in the home! Raccoons are nocturnal animals, meaning they’re most active at night. That means you’re likely to hear them during the evening or early morning hours. You’ll often hear them up on the second floor of your home because that’s where they feel safest and it gives them access to both areas of your home without having to use any of the dangerous outside areas. Raccoons don’t like to be cooped up, especially when they’re living inside an attic. They’ll come out at night looking for food and water (and maybe some playtime!). Raccoon droppings are easy to spot, and you may see them in your yard, on your porch or any place else they can get outside. What do raccoon droppings look like? Raccoon droppings resemble tiny dog droppings in terms of appearance. They’re dark in colour, stinky, and frequently include undigested seeds or other food items. There’s a good chance that you’re hearing the young raccoons playing with each other while their mother is away searching for food. Raccoons are incredibly smart, and if you have young ones they might be more likely to make noise when they’re playing. Playtime often sounds like fighting or running on the floors above you, so it can sound a little scary. Raccoons are terrific climbers, and they can scale concrete walls or brick with ease. They’ll use small holes as entry points to your home, where they can slip inside for shelter — especially if it’s raining outside! If you have a raccoon family living in your attic, there will be multiple entry points so they can come and go with ease. The damage they cause to your siding or roofing may be enough for them to get in and, if you don’t notice the holes while there are still young raccoons inside, they could make their way into your living spaces and bedrooms! Raccoons have extremely strong-smelling urine that may be detected from inside the home, as well as their feces, which is also quite noxious and odorous. Raccoon droppings have a distinctive musky scent. The smell will often be strongest near an entry point or areas where you might find nesting materials. When you think you detect something dead or decaying (or both!) it’s because raccoon droppings smell so strong. If you see one or more of these signs, there’s a good chance that you have a raccoon living in your home. Don’t be alarmed! It’s always best to ask a professional if you suspect that you have raccoons living in your home — especially if there are baby raccoons involved! Even if you don’t see any of them, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t a raccoon hiding somewhere inside your home, and you should still call us to come and inspect it if you suspect something is wrong. Raccoons are common in the Mississauga region, and there is a team of professionals who can assist you to remove them without causing any drama. They are called Hawkeye!"
10,Facts and Myths about Seagull control,business," Forget what you have been told by the so-called ‘experts’. These are the real facts. In Canada, Gulls are protected by the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act — Environment Canada with the help of the Canadian Wildlife Service. Gulls are not affected by ultrasonic devices Gulls are not affected by microwaves Gulls are not affected by fake owls, no matter how real they look Gulls are not affected by pressurized air firing out of nozzles Gulls are affected by: Loud Noises: Gulls are affected for a very limited time by propane cannons. They eventually realize it does nothing to affect them and lift off just enough to get away from the concussion and resettle on their nests. Loud Speakers: Extensive tests have been conducted by the US Airforce trying to protect their runway with absolute failure. The only thing that seems to be successful is the LRAD or Long Range Acoustical Device. This works only on runways because of how straight and long they are. LRAD (Long Range Acoustical Device): Very difficult to use in the city as the glass in some buildings may shatter. You can’t bring the unit from the ground onto the roof habitually because it’s over 200lbs. Using from the ground does not affect the birds on the roof. Substantial cost, starting at $85,000. Pyrotechnics: Variations of rockets that fly out of a pistol or shotgun make a loud bang, crackle, whistle sound or star shapes. Some do multiple functions. These units come in several sizes: 22 blank 50–200ft range $0.50 per shot on average – 9mm blank 100–200ft range $1.00 per shot on average 12 gauge blank 150–200ft $1–2 per shot on average CAPA 200–600ft $15–25 per shot on average 40mm 800–1000ft $20–35 per shot on average Each of these has varying effectiveness and range. All of them are successful for a short period of time (1–2 weeks maximum) and are best used in conjunction with birds of prey. After a couple of weeks, gulls will habituate. They are not effective if the gulls have already nested and do not prevent nesting or laying eggs. The more you use pyrotechnics the less effect they will have. Traditionally used for gulls, terns, sparrows and starlings. Lasers: Using a high-powered laser to scare pest birds. Can work well if you hit the iris of the bird’s eye, but requires a lot of skill and time. It does not harm the bird. These only work in the dark (however there are high-end lasers that can work during the day at a significant cost). Lasers can affect aircraft and are not legal in certain countries or within certain jurisdictions. Dogs: Dogs are great resources at airports and golf courses and on the ground but cannot be used on the roof. There have been several fines by the SPCA to owners who have tried to use dogs on the roof for reasons such as dangerous if they are let loose to chase the birds and hurt themselves or fall off, leashed in the elements is not humane and has time restrictions and it can be difficult to hoist a dog up the side of a building. Falconry: Excellent at preventing pest birds from landing and therefore nesting and laying eggs. Has a high success rate, is humane and is a natural way of controlling and scaring the pest bird population. Disadvantages include: Expensive, time-consuming, requires a permit, the effect lasts a couple of days and needs to be recurring to ensure continued success. Firearms / Shooting: Excellent at preventing pest birds from landing and therefore nesting and laying eggs. Disadvantages include Trained shooter required (expensive), need several types of permits, may not be possible/legal in your area, and need constant watch (you will have to station a shooter on your roof for a period of three-six weeks from sun up to sun down shooting from April 1st until May 30th, until the gulls decide to nest somewhere else) and lastly, visually a media nightmare for most industries."
11,Canadian Geese: How to deal with them legally.,business," Canadian Geese: How to deal with them legally. The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a wild native of North America that has been introduced to many other parts of the world. Post-industrialization, all birds are protected by the Migratory Birds Convention Act. What does the Migratory Birds Convention Act do? The Migratory Birds Convention Act (also known as the MBCA) is a Canadian legislation passed in 1917 and significantly updated in June 1994 that regulates the protection of migratory birds, their eggs, and their nests from being destroyed by wood harvesting, hunting, trafficking, and commercialization. It is very important to note that the Canadian goose falls under this act. This means that it is illegal to harm one of these birds due to their migratory status. Can I kill Geese in Mississauga? No. This act also implies that the Canadian goose, like any other Canadian bird on this list, can not be hurt or killed without facing very serious consequences by law. The continuous expansion of residential areas near waterways has contributed to the Canada goose occupation of new habitats, which has continued to cause problems. Unfortunately, they are an aggressive species that can pose multiple threats. What kind of problems can geese cause? Geese can be dangerous or annoying to people in a variety of ways. Canada geese may be a significant safety hazard to aircraft at airports, producing hazardous takeoff and landing conditions, and most airports have aggressive hazing campaigns to reduce the danger. Nesting Canada geese will aggressively defend their nesting grounds, and aggressive pairs can sometimes result in injuries, especially to small children or domestic animals. Large flocks of Canada Geese can denude grassy areas, including parks, pastures, golf courses, lawns, and other landscaped areas where the grass is kept short and where there are ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water nearby, necessitating expensive turf-management activities by landowners. Goose droppings in specific locations where many people and geese co-exist, such as golf courses, parks, and beaches, can be a problem. Overgrazed pastures and poor water quality have increased as Canada's Goose populations have expanded, causing agricultural and natural resource damage including depredation of grain crops. Geese may also compete with conservation agencies for other species or sensitive ecosystems' objectives. This battle occurs when geese aggress on other animals directly or indirectly via the grazing's effect on habitats. What to do when you have a geese problem? Knowing how to get rid of them humanely but effectively is important if you have a Canadian goose problem. They tend to be stubborn once they decide to stay near your property, and eliminating them on your own without the right tools or expertise can be dangerous. You need experts that can scare and remove these birds in a safe manner. Here are 6 Things You Should Know When Dealing with Goose Removal in Mississauga: Canadian geese were once solely wild birds that had no connection with humans. Since the arrival of European settlers, these animals have adapted to the introduction of food sources offered by humans. Numerous studies have shown that well-fed geese are more likely to be aggressive towards people and pets than hungry geese. The reason is quite simple: hunger makes them afraid, so they try everything they can to protect themselves. Don't make their task easier by feeding them! Canadian geese can fly up to 50 mph (80 km/h), and they will use this speed and their 1-foot long wingspan as weapons if they feel threatened. They might not hurt you, but the injuries caused by flying debris or a direct hit can be severe! Don't approach Canadian geese or their nests, and keep your pets away from them as well. A mother Canada goose will do anything to protect her eggs or goslings. If you notice a nest on your property, stay away from it at all costs! Even if the parents are nowhere in sight, they could be hiding nearby, easily scared away by loud noise or sudden motion. If you need to clear a nest, it is best to have an animal control service do the job for you. Canada geese usually lay between 4-8 eggs, with the average clutch size being 6. During this period, make sure you keep your distance from nests, even if they are empty. As the date gets closer to hatching, the parents will be more protective of their brood. Canadian geese are protected under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, which means that it is illegal to hunt or capture them without a special permit. If you notice someone harming Canadian geese in your area, call Animal Services right away. Getting rid of Canadian geese can be difficult, especially when there are young goslings in the picture. This is not something we recommend you attempt by yourself. With our years of experience in animal control, we have dealt with hundreds of Canadian geese and know just what to do to eliminate the problem safely and humanely. If you are looking for Canadian goose control in Ontario of Canada or anywhere else in the GTA, contact Hawkeye today"
12,How do you get rid of a Skunk from under your deck?,business," How do I get rid of a skunk under my deck? So you're minding your business one day when you hear something. What's that noise coming from under the deck?  You go and investigate and you find a skunk! Now it's a skunk-mating season, so of course, skunks are looking for love. Unfortunately under your deck isn't the best place to attempt to woo another skunk because skunks can spray from as far as 10 feet away… not good when they're under your deck. The city of Mississauga and Toronto have had skunk sightings before, and skunks can cause a lot of damage to your property if not removed properly and permanently. However, don't worry. These nocturnal animals are rarely seen during the day, but they can be elusive creatures and do require professional services to remove. What are Skunks? Skunks are mammals that are native to North America. They can be black and white or brown and white depending on their breed. Skunks vary in size from 20cm (8 inches) to 62 cm (2 feet), but they all have a small head, short legs and a long bushy tail that is almost as long as their body. Skunks are common suspects for living beneath houses, sheds, and decks. Skunks have powerful short legs that allow them to dig beneath at least 2 feet of foundation to access crawl spaces. Even though you do not detect a skunk, one is there on your property. Getting rid of skunks requires a professional who can first assess the situation and give you different solutions for removal. Are Skunks Dangerous? Skunks are not dangerous animals to humans. They're actually very skittish and will run away from you if they can. They do however have a defense mechanism which is to spray anything they feel threatened by which is why you should leave removal and any interaction with them to the local experts in skunk removal services in your area. Will Skunks chase you? Skunks are docile and non-threatening creatures that mind their own business as long as they are left alone. A healthy skunk will usually avoid humans or bigger animals, so you should not be afraid of being chased by one. This doesn't mean you should go near skunks or try to touch them. Are Skunks Dangerous to pets? Skunks are extremely harmful to pets, and that is because they don't appear to be so. Your cat or dog will happily explore the skunk, and things may even be quite amiable at first, but one paw out of place and the skunk will swivel around and spray. Skunk spray is not just unpleasant; it's also highly toxic. It has a reason for smelling so badly. It is an enormous warning sign to any predator or attacking animal that it should flee as quickly as possible...and quickly! The skunk's poisonous brew contains both alcohol and Sulphur, which is a hazardous combination. It has an unpleasant odor and is not particularly welcome if it comes into contact with your skin. It can cause vomiting and nausea, as well as minor burns, and if it enters the eye, it may even result in blindness, although this is usually temporary. What to do if a skunk has sprayed your dog or cat? Skunk spray is quite poisonous to dogs, and if it enters your pet's eyes, nose, or mouth, he or she could become violently ill. If a skunk sprays your dog, you will need to call the veterinarian in order to eliminate the strong odor. Most skunks will only spray a dog if it feels threatened or cornered, so the best way to avoid this is by keeping your pets on a leash. Skunks are usually very skittish and will not attack unless they feel threatened, so as long as you keep your pet from antagonizing them, skunks should not become an issue for you. Skunk spraying is a defense mechanism, so the best way to avoid having skunks sprayed on your property is to simply leave them alone and call a specialist. If you have a skunk visit your yard, wait until they have left the area before going out there yourself. Most skunks will either leave within a few hours or wait until dark before emerging from their burrows again. How do you get rid of a Skunk from under your deck? If they're living under your deck, it means that there's a hole or tunnel for them to get in through. You'll need to seal up the area so that no skunks can get in or out of your deck.  Once skunks are out of the picture, you can use deterrents like skunk sprays and ammonia to keep skunks away. If this isn't done properly skunks will just find another way in and the skunk under your deck problem will continue. Bottom line, leave it to the experts so that you save yourself time, money and from being sprayed. Hawkeye Bird and Animal Control specialists have been helping residents of Toronto and Mississauga with skunk removal for years and are experts at wildlife control."
13,5 Types of Material you can consider for your Product Packaging,business," The perceived value of a product and the industry as a whole is heavily influenced by packaging. It might be difficult to find the appropriate packaging for your items in today's market, with so many package and box alternatives available. Let's look at five various types of packaging you may use for your products. Paperboard Packaging Paperboard is a paper-based material that is both light and strong. It may be carved and sculpted into a variety of shapes and structures. It can be used in individualised packaging. Fibrous materials such as wood or recycled paper are pulped to make paperboard. Paperboard packaging is available in a number of grades and can be used for a variety of applications. Cosmetics, medications, and frozen meals can all be packaged in paperboard. Kraft paperboard packaging looks to be both natural and environmentally beneficial. Kraft is less resistant to moisture, making it unsuitable for culinary applications. With the right package design, paperboard packaging may be both stylish and cost effective. Corrugated boxes Carton boxes are simply referred to as corrugated boxes. When most people think of a carton box for shipping or a shoe box, they think of corrugated boxes. Corrugated boxes come in a variety of durability and strength levels as well. It usually has three layers of paper: an outer liner, an interior liner, and a corrugated medium for strength and rigidity. Recycled paper generated on a corrugator machine is the major raw material used to manufacture corrugated board. Corrugated boards may be recycled and reused several times. Single-faced, double-faced, twin-wall, and triple-wall corrugated boards are available in a number of forms. For retail packaging, pizza boxes, and consumer product packaging, they may be cut and folded into a variety of sizes and forms. Plastic boxes Plastic packaging may be used in a wide range of products, from headphones to basics. Several traditional materials, such as wood, leather, and glass, have already been replaced by plastic. Using a plastic packing box has a number of advantages. They are biodegradable and significantly more robust than paperboard. Plastic packaging may be made to be airtight, which keeps food fresh and prevents infection. Plastic packaging is also resistant to breakage and may be kept with food in a number of ways. Since of its transparent properties, plastic is a popular packaging material because it allows the goods to be seen without having to open the box. It's also lightweight and flexible, and it's easy to customise with screen printing or self-adhesive film. Rigid boxes Rigid box packaging is a type of long-lasting and high-quality cardboard packaging. A rigid box is made of a thicker, higher-concentration paperboard than a folding carton box. Apple's iPhone boxes are the most extreme form of stiff packaging. Paperboard and corrugated boxes are less costly to produce than rigid boxes. Handcrafted stiff boxes are common. Because it is not collapsible, shipping charges will be higher. Cosmetics, jewellery, and high-end consumer products are frequently displayed in these boxes. A rigid box may easily accommodate windows, lids, hinges, and pieces. Poly bags Poly bags, also called plastic bags, are formed of thin, flexible plastic film. It is one of the most common types of packaging and may carry a wide range of items, including food, chemicals, books, and other items. Poly bags are durable but light, reusable, and adaptable. Poly bags are affordable and simple to make in a variety of shapes, colours, and sizes. Recycling is possible using poly bags. Poly bags can be designed with security features, tape attachments, hanging holes, or carrying handles to ensure that the products are suitably secured and visually appealing."
14,What is the job of a Transcriptionist?,business," A transcriber is another term for a transcriptionist. A transcriber and a transcriptionist are the same person. A transcriptionist's duty is to listen to an audio recording and transcribe it into text in a document, which is generally digital rather than handwritten. Transcription, on the other hand, might relate to the physical notation of music or noises from another source. A transcriptionist, sometimes known as a transcriber, is a person whose duty it is to listen to a recording of spoken word and transcribe it into written text. A transcriber's job is frequently performed remotely since most recordings these days are digital, which means they may be uploaded to a distant computer to be transcribed and then returned to the person seeking the transcription through email or file transfer. A transcriptionist's equipment is typically a laptop with a decent quality keyboard and, very often, a foot pedal. A transcription foot pedal is used to control and pause the audio recording while the transcriptionist is working. It is possible to conduct transcription without a foot pedal, but doing so significantly slows the transcriber down since they must use either a mouse or a button on the keyboard to stop and start the recording, whereas using the foot pedal allows them to do so much more rapidly. Transcriptionists are frequently compensated based on their typing speed. If a transcriptionist cannot type swiftly, it is quite probable that the task will not be properly compensated for them. There are extremely few options for poor typists to undertake this work, and most transcribing businesses need a minimum typing speed of 65 words per minute, if not greater. This is in the best interests of both the transcriptionist and the transcribe firm since, due to the nature of the work, if a transcriptionist is a sluggish typer, the revenue they will receive from the task will be significantly lower. Working as a transcriptionist may be extremely lonely at times because they are generally stationed away from home and the task requires lengthy periods of concentration on a computer and must be done in complete isolation in order to focus on the spoken word of the tape. To become a transcriptionist, you will need a computer with a fast internet connection, decent noise-cancelling headphones, an ergonomic keyboard and mouse, word processing software, audio enhancers, a foot pedal, and a comfy chair. Because transcribing work is seasonal, there will be times when there is no work at all. There are frequently turnarounds for work that requires rigorous periods of completion. However, if you are the type of person who can concentrate on work for a short amount of time and complete assignments on time, this may be gratifying."
15,3 Types Of Transcription Services Explained,business," Importance of Transcription Transcription services are a vital tool that allows businesses to save time and money. By translating voice, audio, and video recordings into written or electronic text documents, a company may meet project deadlines and stay focused on its main goals. Important meetings and discussions are documented, resulting in accurate accounts that may be utilised for issuing client reports, providing trustworthy customer service, and retracing and executing sales and marketing plans. When used as a bridge between customers and companies, transcription enables firms to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of their target audience's purchasing behaviour. Transcribing also improves business flexibility by making it easier to determine which concepts and information may still be rehashed or improved into a way of branding and reaching out to clients. #1 Edited Transcription An edited transcription is a type of transcribing that prioritises the delivery of high-quality materials. It entails removing sentences or phrases that are judged unneeded, excessive, or grammatically wrong. The core and overall meaning of the text are kept regardless of the words or phrases eliminated. Edited transcription is best utilised for content that business owners want translated into a specific foreign language or published as a book or printed material. This sort of transcribing frequently employs a more formal style of writing. The readability of the content is also prioritised in order to make it more appealing and relevant to anybody the company intends to reach with the transcribed material. Edited transcription is frequently used in conferences, seminars, and presentations. #2 Intelligence Transcription Accuracy is critical in intelligent transcriptions. Intelligent transcription, as opposed to modified transcription, focuses on light manipulation of the audio or video material. Fillers stated by the speaker, such as umm or ooh, as well as pauses in between talks, repetitions, and statements of recognition and deep thinking, such as ok or got it are excluded from the transcribed text. Stuttering and stammering, slangs, non-standard vocabulary and any kind of detail portraying disturbances in speech, such as coughing and throat clearing, are also removed as extraneous features. The major goal is to delete sentences that are unrelated to the main topic of the conversation or debate. To be honest, removing unneeded fillers and fragments from the tape being transcribed is merely scraping the surface. The capacity to detect the substance of the message and keep it in the transcribed document, even after the emotional component of the source file is removed, is critical in intelligent transcription. As a result, intelligent transcriptions' end results are supposed to have substance while properly expressing the tone and character of the original material. Intelligent transcription, also known as smart transcription, is most typically employed in medical disciplines and corporate communications. #3 Verbatim Transcription The verbatim transcription preserves both the verbal and nonverbal components of the recorded dialogue. This implies that all fillers, slangs, stammers, and other features that are removed in intelligent transcribing are preserved. Given that the majority of information required for verbatim transcription is greater, the work is more involved and harder than it appears. Aside from the message's content, every aspect recorded in the audio or video is considered in the final textual output, from changes in breathing, emotion, and tone to pauses in speech and background noise. The use of verbatim transcription implies that the contents of an audio or video recording are literally transcribed. It is a dependable and important research tool, particularly for new initiatives or campaigns that a brand desires to adopt. It is also used in court proceedings, police investigations, and employment interviews. Each type of transcribing service serves a distinct function. Transcribed audios and films may aid firms with market research, document publication, and controlling and analysing critical dialogues about improving the services they provide. Business owners will have a better notion of how to sell their products and advertising techniques to their customers if they keep records of how and what a target audience says about a product or campaign. Similarly, transcribing facilitates greater coordination among CEOs, managers, and members of a company's many departments by providing precise references to meetings and conversations. The incorporation of transcription, either as a tool or as a service provided to a brand's clients, implies a desire to increase flexibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Thus, when used wisely and deliberately, it may help a company's growth and expansion in the long run."
16,5 Advantages of Using a Lanyard,business," Security Lanyards are excellent security tools. Lanyards may be personalised with logos, text, and photos, lowering the danger of a security breach. Intruders can be immediately detected by looking to see if they are wearing a lanyard. Lanyards are commonly used in the workplace, paired with an ID badge that permits access to various portions of the building. Lanyards of different colours can also be used for different persons within a facility to boost security. Security staff promptly recognise them and determine if they are at the proper location. Branding Lanyards are typically used during events when many other businesses are fighting for the attention of clients. Wearing a lanyard with a company logo and tagline that matches other marketing materials creates a strong sense of harmony and cooperation while projecting a professional image to consumers. This improved branding through exposure creates a favourable vibe for your company and may even entice prospective clients or future talent to Google you or contact you. Unity Wearing similar lanyards with your brand's colours and emblem may assist foster staff pride and solidarity. While every firm is made up of various people, a branded item like a lanyard may serve as a uniting component.

Convenient Lanyards are very convenient tools for workplaces. Lanyards may be used to secure IDs and access badges while also freeing up your hands for other duties. Many lanyards now have a metal clip or ring at the end that may be used to retain small things such as keys, business cards, pens, and USB flash drives. Using lanyards to keep commonly used goods on hand is n useful approach to avoid misplacing or losing objects. When you need a pen or a USB flash drive, just take the one linked to your lanyard and use it straight away. Professionalism Wearing a lanyard around your neck is simple and may make you seem neat and polished. This will provide each employee a more professional appearance, especially if you work in an organisation. Lanyards are an excellent way to maintain a professional impression without wearing uniforms."
17,The Importance of Video Editing,business," When creating video, the necessity of video editing should not be overlooked. A business video, a marketing campaign video, a music video, or an educational video normally goes through three stages: pre-production, production, and post-production. Post-production is largely concerned with editing the video and is the final opportunity to ensure that everything flows well before releasing it to the viewers. A proper editing technique may radically affect and improve the quality of a video. On social media sites, video material is immensely popular and simple to distribute. It's an excellent approach to give valuable material while also increasing brand exposure. You may get your message in front of your target audience without leaving the office. Having video material that you can publish about your company as well as videos that you can share with your target audience can help you get a competitive advantage in today's market. You must prioritise video editing if you want to generate amazing video content. This is the technique of sequentially merging multiple segments of video to tell a story or deliver a message. With a clear grasp of the significance of video editing, make certain that you have nice concise, well-made films placed where your audience can see them. Because the job is done behind the scenes, the significance of video editing is not often obvious. However, skilled video editors may transform a mediocre film for your company into an exceptional marketing tool that can attract new consumers and maintain existing ones. Your crew may be skilled at capturing intelligent, insightful film. However, if that film does not fit together in a logical manner, your message will be missed. Cuts are one of the most popular and efficient strategies to produce the correct flow in video editing. Cutting is simple in and of itself: you select a start and finish time, and it's gone. But that's not the only thing that goes into a cut. To make your movie flow smoothly, you must trim shots at the appropriate times. Timing is everything! If you cut it too soon, the audience will be surprised by the abrupt halt. If you cut it too late, you'll get a shot that seems to go on forever. Transitions also assist to emphasise the significance of video editing. Without transitions, the movie bounces from one scene to the next, disrupting the flow and making the video appear cheap and low-budget. Video editing aids in making these transitions appear smooth and seamless. Transitions and cutting aid in controlling the film's pace. When the speed is controlled, it results in a genuinely delightful watching experience. The editor can then go to more subtle editing techniques. When most people think about video editing, they instantly think of the visual aspects of the film. However, just because the graphics have been edited does not indicate that the music will automatically flow together. Throughout the film, the editor must change the volume levels and synchronise the audio segments with the movie clips. This sort of sound editing ensures that a video flows as it should. It contributes to the film's tone and mood. The significance of sound editing cannot be overstated, as it is an integral element of the video editing process. Video editing is vital because it is the key to combining pictures and sounds in order to make us feel emotionally linked and, at times, actually present in the video we are viewing. It is reasonable to state that video editing is one of the most significant positions in the film business. You can create an emotional masterpiece with expert video editing, and it can make or break your film, which is why it's just as vital to pick the appropriate video editor as it is to choose the proper camera equipment."

19,Things That Will Lead Your Small Business A CRA Audit,business," The last thing a business needs is an audit letter from the CRA. Not only will it disrupt the smooth business operation, but can also put you in a pretty tough spot during the tax season. If the CRA finds any discrepancies in your books, it can also lead to a severe tax audit penalty. To avoid this, you need to be extremely careful when filing taxes. Also, get yourself a professional tax consultant. It can significantly reduce errors and ease the process of tax filing. Now, let us take a look at a few reasons that might result in a CRA audit. The CRA knows the typical income of every industry. When your income is higher or lower than the typical income, it draws the interest of the CRA. It brings your small business to their notice. The CRA will use various methods to compare your revenue against many others in your sector and arrive at a conclusion. Listing the same revenue on all your tax forms is crucial. When the CRA finds discrepancies in different tax forms, it will probably result in an audit. Make sure that the revenue you enter matches with the ones provided by the employers and third parties. Applying all the business expenses deductions is the most exciting part of the tax filing session. However, you need to be cautious when doing it. Large deductions in the area of promotion, meals, travel, entertainment, and the internet charges will pique the interest of the CRA. Hire a professional tax consultant to prevent false deduction claims and reduce the audit risks. It is not logical to think that you will only use a vehicle for business purposes and not anything else. The CRA knows this and will put you on the audit list in no time. If you have no other vehicle, do not use this as an opportunity to save some tax amount. Keep a logbook to back up your claims if you do use a separate vehicle only for business. In case of an audit, you can submit the proper documents to support your claims. Losses in small businesses are not uncommon. But, the same kind of loss every consecutive year raises suspicion. When those losses help you reduce the income tax by a large percentage, you are definitely going to receive the audit letter. Be reasonable and list the losses you actually experienced and your revenue expectations. The CRA knows the limit companies of your size spend on charity. So, when you have incredibly large donations listed, it will raise doubts. They will then start the procedures for auditing your business. Especially, donations that involve capital property receive much greater attention than those that don’t. Having your family on the payroll helps you keep the overall revenue of the family stable. But, when you pay unusually large amounts to the family members and use that in your deductions, it attracts an audit. To prevent that, seek the help of a professional tax consultant. They will help you understand the rules of employing a family member and reduce the chances of getting an audit. If you have a super expensive car and a multimillion-dollar home but your reported income doesn’t support that, it will attract the CRA. Being honest with your income and the tax you have to pay for it is the best way to avoid audits. If caught with tax evasion and fraudulent tax practices, you can face severe legal issues. However, if you are great at budgeting and have reasonable claims, all you need to do is have credible documents to support the claim. Finally… Tax planning is not a one-month job. You need to spend at least three months preparing for the tax season. Moreover, you need to secure all the documents that can help support your claims. Remember, an audit is not always a bad thing unless you are intentionally making false claims."
20,How To Calculate And Manage Capacity in an Agile Environment,business," Any IT company working with Agile methodology has to have a flexible approach to its operations. However, resources are not always that flexible, and they definitely cannot be molded to manager’s needs right away. That is why capacity management is essential in this business. What is capacity and capacity management? Basic definitions In the IT industry, capacity is generally defined as a maximum production output a company can sustain in its production processes or services. In other words, it is a number of hours an employee or a team can spend working on all work-related activities. For IT companies, that value is of the utmost importance, as such businesses often bill their customers based on the time employees spend perfecting their projects. As a result, using capacity to the fullest is a source of income for such entities. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that capacity management is a base of all the operations in the IT industry. This process does not have a single definition; it simply consists of all the actions aiming to maximize the company's output. Types of capacity Even though the definition of capacity may seem simple, there are many types of capacity companies use to differentiate between the time dedicated for different tasks. Those include: total capacity - the number of hours an employee is to spend working in a given period. It does not include holidays and absences. available capacity - total capacity minus absences and holidays. Should the employee already be assigned to another project, these hours have to be deducted from total capacity, too. billable capacity - total hours of billable time compared to employee’s capacity. These types of capacity are used in different cases - and we will cover all of them below. How to calculate and manage capacity? Basic capacity formula Agile means flexible - and that flexibility has a huge impact on capacity. However, it does not mean that capacity cannot be calculated in an agile environment. In fact, it is usually a base for all agile projects - especially in companies executing many projects at once. In general, capacity can be calculated using a formula: Total capacity = number of working days * number of working hours - number of hours off This formula covers a majority of examples you may encounter in an agile environment, however flexible they might be - and you can see it in the examples below. Calculating total capacity Let’s assume that you are a manager wishing to calculate a total capacity for a Java developer for an entire month. It’s February, with 28 days overall and 20 working days. One working day equals, of course, 8 hours. However, in your country there’s one additional day off - a public holiday on one of Thursdays. Therefore, his total capacity is: 20 (working days) * 8 hours - 8 hours (a public holiday) = 152 hours. This capacity is subject to change in a few cases. For example, hours should be deducted from total capacity if a specialist decided to take a sick leave, or go for holidays. Calculating available capacity Before the month started, it turned out that our Java developer is needed in another project. He will spend 5 days (or 40 hours) working on it. As a result, his available capacity for other projects is: 152 hours of total capacity - 40 hours for other projects = 112 hours Should a worker be assigned to any other project, the time he is due to spend completing the task should also be deducted from his available capacity. Calculating billable capacity Our Java developer is also busy helping with an internal project no client pays the company for. Internal work should take 16 hours of his time. As a result, the billable capacity for this specialist is: 152 hours of total capacity - 16 hours for internal project = 136 billable hours Should the internal project take longer than usual, any additional hours should also be deducted from the billable capacity. Calculating capacity for teams Calculating capacity for particular employees may be enough for businesses specializing in body leasing. However, some IT service companies rent out entire teams, or they need to assign specialists to many interwoven projects at once. As a result, calculating capacity for teams may sometimes be necessary. To do that, you can use a formula: Total team capacity = Capacity of specialist 1 + Capacity of specialist 2 + … However, while doing it, remember to calculate the same type of capacity for all the specialists; otherwise you will get incorrect results! Managing capacity in an agile environment - strategies Calculating capacity is a simple task; however, managing it may not be so straightforward. That is why IT companies generally assume how they are going to manage their capacity by choosing one of 4 strategies. These are: Lag strategy. Companies base their decisions on capacity on data they already have. This strategy does not require managers to create long-term predictions; instead, lag strategy only affects capacity for the nearest future. However, only very stable businesses can use this strategy successfully; any sudden changes in demand may cause problems with completing projects and force the specialists to work overtime. Lead strategy. A perfect solution for dynamically growing companies that expect to grow even further. With this strategy, the company assumes that all resources can be used to complete projects for incoming customers. As a result, the company keeps on recruiting new specialists. However, this strategy can only work for companies that intend to grow! Match strategy. It is a strategy that requires constant monitoring of all the operations. Its main objective is to constantly repeat capacity planning in order to adapt allocations to all the changes. This strategy minimizes the risks and is perfectly enough for a company to scale, but, on the other hand, it may be troublesome and time consuming. Adjustment strategy. Companies using this strategy adjust their resource plans and allocations based on historical data. As precise as this solution may be, however, it does not take into account any derivations and, in addition, it requires extensive monitoring tools. As a result, this strategy is a good choice for large entities with years of experience. Want to learn more about capacity? We realize that calculating and managing capacity may not be easy - with or without digital tools.

1,The 6 Most Common Lanyard Types Explained,business," What exactly is a lanyard? Lanyards are strings or straps worn around the neck and shoulder to carry things such as keys or identification cards. The fundamental goal is to define your position and duties in various situations such as organisations, businesses, hospitals, prisons, conferences, and trade exhibits. As a consequence, we should consider picking the best lanyard for you. The style, design, and substance of the lanyard will be decided by its intended purpose. Lanyard materials include nylon, polyester, satin, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), braided leather, and braided paracord. Lanyards were classified according to their functions as polyester imprinted lanyards, nylon imprinted lanyards, dye-sublimated lanyards, tubular imprinted lanyards, and weaved lanyards. Lanyards were used to secure the goods and were attached to a hook or a clip. The ID badges were secured in place with a metal clip, allowing visitors to readily view the badges and find service workers. Small items, such as USB flash drives, can be kept in place using a metal J-Hook and a lobster claw. The metal ring was created to keep keys and small plastic items, and it's an excellent alternative to carrying your keys outside. The lobster claw is highly resistant and may be used to secure your phone to the lanyards. When a child wears the lanyard around their neck, or when safety is an issue, a safety breakaway can be added. Polyester imprinted lanyards Polyester imprinted lanyards are the most common type of lanyard due to characteristics such as cost, durability, and flexibility. Lanyards were made from polyester fabric, which has a low cost and a long duration. Polyester lanyards are also good at letting air travel through. It's perfect for people who engage in a lot of physical exercise. Polyester is the most pleasant fabric to wear. If you want to use the lanyards for an extended length of time, this is the option to select. Nylon imprinted lanyards Lanyards made of nylon can be used for a variety of purposes, including carrying ID badges, security cards, or ID cards at most enterprises, and avoiding the loss or drop off small electronic devices such as cameras, MP3 players, and USB flash drives. Nylon imprinted lanyards are thicker and shinier on polyester imprinted lanyards, and they have the best and highest quality when compared to other materials. That is one of the reasons why nylon lanyards can support large objects such as cameras. Tubular imprinted lanyards Tubular imprinted lanyards are made of polyester and resemble shoelaces. They are quite comfortable to wear around the neck. This lanyard is quite popular among sports enthusiasts. If you want to feel comfy while wearing it, this is the one to go for. They're also a good option if you're on a tight budget. Dye-sublimated lanyards Lanyards that have been dye-sublimated are exceptionally durable and high-quality, making them excellent for custom logo printing. Lanyards of this type are extremely vibrant, delicate, and colourful. It belongs to the high-performance lanyards category. All of these lanyards are printed using advanced dye-sublimated printing technique. Lanyards can be coloured with the colours. This ensures that the design of your lanyards will not fade, even if they are used in severe settings. Woven lanyard Woven lanyards are a premium lanyard type in which custom patterns, phrases, inscriptions, or logos are woven directly into the polyester material. Threads are used to weave the basic phrases on the weaved lanyards. Because embroidered patches and woven lanyards employ comparable weaving methods, simple logos are more suited for the weaving process. As a result, if you choose woven ones, you will have to forego some complexities. If you require a lanyard with a high-quality design imprint, the woven lanyard is the ideal alternative. Beaded lanyards Beaded lanyards are decorative lanyards that may hold ID cards and other small things. They are fashioned like beaded necklaces and are occasionally mistaken for jewellery. Most ladies and young girls choose beaded lanyards because they are fashionable. The beaded lanyards were made with glass beads, pearls, and crystal beads. The material used determines the pricing of various beaded lanyards."
2,What is a Lanyard and How Do You Use It?,business," Lanyards are accessories that may be worn around the neck, wrist, or shoulder to carry anything. Lanyards were invented by the military to attach equipment and weapons to their uniforms. These lanyards were especially handy for troops on the move, preventing accidental weapon loss. Lanyards aren't commonly utilised for military equipment, but they perform the similar function: keeping important items close at reach. Lanyards may be used to carry almost anything, including cell phones, keys, and ID badges. Lanyards are often used for a number of functions, including as ID holders, badge holders during events, and holding commemorative souvenirs. Many event planners and business owners realise that providing promotional lanyards to attendees enables them to save money since the badge or ID is less likely to be forgotten when it is attached to the lanyard. When an employee's badge or ID goes stolen, the company pays for the materials and time it takes to replace it, as well as the employee's lost productivity while dealing with the matter. Lanyards can be effective as promotional goods during a major event or trade show. Lanyards are seen as an essential aspect of the event by many attendees since they keep the ticket or ID in place while each participant goes through the expo. It is quite simple to notice a person's name, business, and credentials when they are wearing a lanyard with their ID. The greater exposure during the event encourages networking and other connections. Lanyards are occasionally purchased as a memento or souvenir. The lanyard may be used to carry the proper passes during the event, and afterwards it can be used to keep keys or other personal things on a continuous basis. Every time they see the lanyard, they will remember how much fun they had at the event. Corporations, trade fair organisers, medical firms, and institutions commonly utilise lanyards as promotional tools. A lanyard might be beneficial if you ever need to carry an ID or badge. These lanyards may be used to show credentials and are especially handy when organisations have RFID technology implanted in their ID cards, allowing visitors to easily enter the building's secure areas. Many businesses are adding Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) into their badges, and they provide promotional lanyards to hold the RFID cards, making it easier for employees to move throughout the premises. When the tags are affixed to the lanyard and worn around the employee’s neck, the firm can track each person’s time and attendance. Lanyards are popular among college students because they provide a convenient method to carry the student ID. These promotional lanyards, which may be customised with the school emblem or colours, are excellent school pride presents."
3,Home Office: Save Time and Money by Working at Home,business," So you want to have a home office? In the past decade, people have been opting out of the home office in favor of going to fast-food restaurants, cafes and coffee houses to do their business. And that’s definitely a way to do things. But there are many reasons why you might want to consider having some type of office in your home. First, there are two reasons why you might want to have a home office: You have a small business or side-hustle. You are a human. Well, you don’t have to be a big-city CEO to have an office.  Just make one yourself. Objectives in this Article: -Why you might want a home office for non-work/business reasons. -Why you might want a home office for business reasons. -Why it can save you time and money. You Don’t Have to Be “Important” to Have a Home Office A lot of people think that they have to actually do something professionally to have a home office, like a home business, or a so-called “work from home job”. But having an office in your home, apartment, room, or dorm room can be a great way to get organized. So it’s even more of a top priority if you do have a private business. Having a home office is a great way to stimulate visual orderliness. Visual orderliness is the relation between your behavior and the environment around you. On the contrary, visual disorderliness in your environment can influence you to engage in disorderly habits. So here are some reasons why you might want to have a home office: People can get a little irritating in public. If your “office” is a place with wi-fi, where people drink coffee and eat french fries, then you might have to deal with: -Noisy teenagers. -Complaining employees. -Everyday busy-bodies at lunch chatting about their workplace gossip. -Other people who are also doing business talking loudly on their phones. -When you have a home office, it can much more quiet. Coffee shops can be full of loud music and you don’t always need that when you’re trying to do work. The ‘night life’ isn’t what it used to be.  A lot of coffee shops used to stay open past midnight. Back in the day, there were a lot of creative types, college students, and professionals hustling until the early morning hours. Even before computers and restaurant wi-fi, this was a primary use for the late-night cafe. For some reason, people today generally do not like to be out late. They want to be at home with their social media. People use coffee shops to perform office-style work while getting away from the easy distractions of staying home.  So if you have a day job, you possibly won't find many coffee houses/shops open past 5 pm, in which to work on your side hustle from your laptop. That leaves no alternative but to stay home and hustle as long as you want. That way, you’ll be getting to work past everyone’s curfew.  When most people will be laying on their porch tapping on their mobile phones, you’ll be getting things done. Adults should have an office. So it might be a good idea to transform that so-called ‘man cave’ into an office where you can do more than just drink beer and hang your sports jerseys on the wall. It should be a room where you are prompted to do things like email, paperwork, spreadsheets, finances.  If you can’t even have a ‘man cave’, then just make a space on the floor or somewhere and make a “virtual” office. So you don’t have the big office at your job?  Then make one for yourself.  That way, you can put yourself in a position where you call the shots, get things done, and take control over things that you think are important. You get to run your business the way you want to and do things the way they work best for you. So, if you want to start a dog-walking business, your home office can be a “command center” for all the things you need to do to start and run your business — aside from walking peoples’ dogs, of course. If you want to be a guitar teacher, you can use your office to make calls, prepare lessons, and keep records of payments. Okay, so you have a side-hustle business, and you feel like you need to jump to having to pay for an office to be ‘official’.  Don’t be so impulsive. Office space can be very expensive. It may not be worth the monthly price for things you can do at your own place.  However, if you have a starter business where you don’t have to conduct business that involves meetings/conferences, and you are willing to do all the office work yourself, there’s really no reason to pay for an office. Learn the basics before you pay hundreds of dollars a month for an office.  In this sense, a home office is fine whether you have a small business or not."
4,3 Killer Questions Every Manager Should Follow Daily,business," Every morning I used to come into work, take off my jacket and immediately crowd around the performance boards for the 15 minutes morning huddle. At 8:30 am the office would simply pause and teams would get together. It was not a regular sit-down meeting where everyone turns up a few minutes late with freshly brewed mugs of coffee and a moleskin notepad. You were more likely to see people turn up with scribbles on a sheet of paper. Neither was it scheduled in the diary. As you looked up and down the open-plan office, every team was doing the same. Everyone was up on their feet, dotted around the floor in small groups taking a quick 15 minutes to get the day up and running with the same daily routine. At 8:45 am when the meetings were over and the teams got back to work the team managers moved on to another huddle with the department heads. By 9 am, the department heads were doing their huddle with the senior leaders. Across multiple floors, across multiple sites, the same meetings were taking place face to face, with remote workers on the telephone or on web conferences Within 30 to 45mins, the key information from the front line was being communicated to the senior leaders either as “we are all good” or “we are going to struggle today” so that the necessary support could be offered from a senior level. In the book Mastering the Rockefeller Habits, Verne Harnish states that the morning meeting — the “huddle” is one of the key features of any successful business. They have become a common feature in many organisations across an ever-expanding wide range of sectors. In the automotive industry, they have been called morning “pitstops”, in the healthcare, they have been called the “Healthy Huddles” and in the banking sector, they have been called “morning shouts”, which describes what can happen if the meetings are not set up correctly. So what are these meetings? how should we set these meetings up? The Huddle Itself These meetings tend to be taken standing up. For a simple 15 mins meeting, you will spend more time finding a suitable room, organising chairs and potentially lose 15 mins in getting to the meeting and getting back to the tasks at hand. The huddle should be done as close to where the actual work is done as possible. This is what is known as the “Gemba”, the place where the value is being created. They should also be done around some form of Huddle board The Huddle Board: The Huddle Board is the centrepiece, in my experience, of driving successful teams daily. It’s a board, perhaps a chalkboard, whiteboard or an electronic dashboard (for a remote team), that visually communicates in a simple way what the team set out to achieve and what they did achieve. The goal is to develop a visual communication tool that allows key performance metrics to be communicated quickly. Not only does this drive efficiency within the team but also clarity. A good way to think about it is the 3-second rule. Let me explain. If I was to walk into your business area, how could I tell if you were doing well or having issues? Was it a good bad day or a good day? Should I be rolling up my sleeves to help or see if other people from other teams could come and support you? Or are we on target for today and perhaps we can grab an informal 1–2–1 or skip-level meeting? The 3-second rule is simply the time it should take for me to understand this. It's the time it should take for everyone in your team to know how they are doing today, yesterday and perhaps over the last week. So when you design your huddle board, make sure it has some form of target and it uses green and red or perhaps smiling faces or different colours to signal how things are going. It’s got to be part of your visual management and visual communication toolset. With the board in place, we can move on to the huddle and the 3 Killer Questions! The 3 Killer Questions What was the plan? How did we do against the plan? What can we do better? These three questions form the basis of any quality discussion about performance, goals, targets and improvements. While we refer to them in the example of the huddle, these questions should form the basis of any performance review, 1–2–1, individual action plans, and project action plans. They are very similar to the “PDCA” (Plan, Do, Check, Act) which is the beginning of driving performance improvements which lead to the development of high performing teams. What was the plan? The first part of the meeting is to review yesterday's performance. In yesterday's meeting, you would have planned to achieve something and set out some targets and some goals. This might have been to phone 15 clients or to ship every order that was received online. What is key, is to have a look at the plan that was sent out. And then ask … How did we do against the plan? So if we set out to phone the 15 clients, did we manage to do it? Did we ship every order that was received online or did we have some holdover that we failed to send out due to a system error? Perhaps we received a lot more orders than expected and we did not have enough resources to meet the demand. Then finally, and this is where the whole idea of continually looking to find better and better ways of working comes together. What can we do better? If the team failed to phone 15 customers as planned why was that? Did the team have an extra-long lunch or was it the fact that one of the calls took a lot longer than planned? Perhaps someone had to leave early due to an issue with childcare. Or perhaps we simply had not planned our resources correctly. The goal with the 3rd Killer Question is to delve into what can be done better to improve things and that begins with some basic 5 Why Problem Solving to highlight the root causes. Not every problem can be solved in 15 mins. Perhaps you failed to ship every order that was received online because the shipping process took too long. Or that the pick up took place at 2:30 pm but orders come in until 8 pm. You might not be able to fix why the shipping process took too long straight away. But in today’s workload, or later in the week, you could plan to put an hour slot together with some of the key team members to review the shipping process in more detail and figure out how to improve it. What’s key is that everyone engages in this final question. By asking what could we have done better every day, you begin to create a culture of improvement. And you might have succeeded in the plan perfectly yesterday, but could we have done more, done something different, found new customers or found a new way to do something. Everything can be improved — always. Begin again Obviously, the day should never begin without a new plan, so rather than looking at the past it's key to look forward. The team needs to agree on today's plan and identify in advance anything that might stop today’s plan from being achieved Doing this forward-looking part is essential and makes sure you can ask the same 3 Killer Questions tomorrow. The Goal The goal of a huddle is firstly to point everybody in the same direction and ensure we all know what today’s plan is. It’s then to make sure any good or bad news is escalated and actions can be taken if needed. But it's also to build a culture and a place to work where we are always looking to improve things and find new ways to do things. Just because it’s not broken today, does not mean we don’t look to improve it. So a few rules Keep them to 15 mins. Short, sharp and focused Focus on the 3 Killer Questions Plan for today Begin again and try to do it better"
5,5 Advantages of Using Electrical Hoist in The Workplace,business," In the construction industry a hoist or a crane are valuable tools on site. These products are designed to lift loads off the ground and place them where they need to be to get the job done. They can also be used to load or offload a truck, so the transport industry benefits from using them as well. Actually, any type of business that handles heavy loads should have either a hoist, or a crane for its daily operations. Let’s have a look at the benefit of using an electrical hoist at the working place. 1 - Protect the health and wellbeing of workers The benefits of using these products are immense. First, the business protects the health and wellbeing of the workers by not having them to lift and carry heavy loads. Besides, the lifting task is done faster and the risk of accident is eliminated, as good hoists have safety systems in place to avoid the load to be dropped if the equipment has a malfunction. If a worker is lifting multiple 20kg boxes every day, he or she will certainly feel the negative impact on his or her health within time. It is just not worth it! An electrical hoist is very simple to use, all the worker has to do is hook the rope properly on the load and push a button; so it is not time consuming at all! Hoists and cranes must be used as first resource even for small loads, such as 20kg or so, especially since there are many of these loads to be handled on a daily basis. 2 - Emergency Stop Good electrical hoists will feature an emergency stop button. Press this button at any time and the hoist will stop immediately and hold the position. If the load is half way into the air, this is where the load will be after the emergency stop is activated. To resume the normal operation, all the operator has to do is press the start button again. 3 - Steady operation time It does not matter how heavy the load is and how many loads need to be handled. An electrical hoist will always take the same time to handle the load. It means it is easy to predict how long it takes to get the job done. This is particularly important to businesses as they have to predict operating times to allocate labor and budget. 4 - Reduce operation cost The business that uses an electrical hoist instead of using manual labor to handle heavy loads minimize the risk of health problems and accidents to its workers. A person should use his or her abilities to solve problems and improve productivity, and not lifting heavy weights on a daily basis for living. There is no place for manual tasks like that in the modern workplace, and the managers and directors of companies that have banned manual heavy lifting have the correct and modern attitude. It is only about the workers, but also about the operation cost. In the long run, it is way more economical to run a business that relies on automated lifting rather than manual handling by the business workers. Besides, the insurance premium will be lower, as the risk of injuries and accidents is reduced significantly. 5- Increase productivity Automated lifting tasks means more loads can be moved in short periods of time. The process of loading or unloading is predictable and quick compared to manual handling. It means the business can do more in less time, improving productivity. With high productivity comes higher profits. Even though there will be an initial investment in the hoist, and ongoing maintenance. The benefits outweigh the investment, bringing better opportunities for the business."

7,"Employee Retention Credit: Get Up To $26,000 Per Employee",business," The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) was created through the CARES ACT in March of 2020. It was designed to reward and strengthen small to medium businesses with 500 or fewer W2 employees that were retained during the pandemic. Due to emergency government orders, businesses shut down or were restricted during the pandemic. To keep the economy intact during this challenging situation, the government released several programs aimed at supporting those businesses negatively impacted by the pandemic.  ERC was one of those programs. If qualified, ERC allows up to $26,000 per employee. This means that a company with 10 W2 employees can receive up to $260,000 in funds for 2020 and Q1-3 in 2021. It is important to know that this program does not have a cap on funding and is not a loan. It is a refundable tax credit with a government incentive attached to it. Businesses receive funds from the IRS in 6-8 months. However, as more businesses apply for this credit, there could be additional delays. Unlike the PPP, these funds do not have to be paid back and you can use them for any purpose. Only 50 billion of the 400 billion allocated for this credit has been claimed. Although this program was released simultaneously with the PPP and EIDL programs, it has been poorly utilized nationwide because it offered much less funding, restricted qualification to a few businesses, and has been amended several times causing enormous confusion. The most recent amendment was signed into law in November 2021. Now the qualification rules have been significantly reduced. Qualification is based on business operations that have been affected by the various government actions that were taken to stop the spread of COVID 19. There are three different ways your business can qualify for employee retention credits: revenue reduction, supply chain disruption, and partial or full suspension of operations.  This makes it easier for business sectors such as manufacturing, food service, retail, and construction to qualify because disruption was significant and widespread. 501c3 businesses may qualify as well."
8,Social Media Influencing: A Tool For Entrepreneurial Growth.,business," The term Entrepreneurial growth means systemic plans to achieve a Brand's, Business or Organization's objective to grow and expand it's products and services by quality, quantity, and turnover. Entrepreneurial growth can be in terms of innovators, business developers, radicals, expanders, customers etc. An entrepreneur who undertakes the risks, and effort to grow the business will certainly have entrepreneurial growth whereas the person who is not willing fails to achieve objectives. Your business or Brand is like a plant, where the only healthy way forward is to grow. Entrepreneurial growth focuses on that early seed stage where you’re still always reaching for more sunlight and struggling to break free of the soil and leaf out above the competition. The good news is that while your business is our metaphorical plant, you can be the gardener who prepares the soil, tends to the leaves, waters, and makes it a secure place to grow. All of those elements are strategies for entrepreneurial growth. In this blogpost, we have narrowed down to discuss Social Media Influencing as a tool to achieve the type of expansion you desire for your business and brand. What is Social Media Influencing? The question, What is Social Media Influencing is what pops up on the lips of anyone who hears someone introduce himself as a Social Media Influencer. Social Media Influence is when someone has the ability to affect other people's thinking and decision in an online social community. The more influence a person has, the more appeal that individual has to companies or other individuals who want to promote an idea or sell a product. Companies and brands can take advantage of social media influence to help increase customer engagement, generate brand awareness and make sales. This can be done by increasing the company’s own social media influence or by hiring established, trustworthy influencers in the same niche. Social Media Influencer marketing works. That’s the reason why it seems everyone wants to become a social media influencer these days. This type of digital marketing continues to grow as a real and effective way of advertising and keeping your audience engaged in order to make a profit. Today, there are over 3.7 billion social media users and the influencer marketing industry is worth an impressive $5 billion! How to Measure Social Media Influence. Fundamentally, influence can be estimated by examining the magnitude of a person's or company's social networks, such as Instagram followers, Tiktok followers, LinkedIn connections, Number of WhatsApp Status views, Twitter followers or Facebook friends. However, a more thorough analysis is required, to determine how a person makes those social connections, who those connections are and the level of trust and engagement between the person and their connections. Professionals have advocated the use of some social influence measurement tools. Klout is one such tool, which provides a score between 1 — 100 based on an individual’s online activity on popular social networking sites. Other industry experts have raised concerns about the validity of the metrics provided by Klout, however, pointing out that Klout does not measure all types of online activity.  For example, a blog post from a trusted Blogger could reach a small but highly-targeted audience and potentially be more influential than a simple tweet that reaches thousands of people. Who are Social Media Influencers? A social media influencer is a user that has established credibility in a certain niche or content type that has access to a wide audience or subscribers. An influencer has a large enough following and the power to be able to spark a conversation and inspire an action or change in behaviour or choice. Companies can hire Social Media Influencers to help expand their social reach, become more relatable and sponsor products or services. Types of Social Media Influencers include: Celebrity influencers: These are the most popular influencers as they have acquired their followings from their celebrity status. Since certain celebrities attract specific demographics and target audiences, companies can hire these Celebrities to reach their or endorse their product to their fans. Consumer influencers: These are everyday people that have gained a following due to their personality and relatability. They are typically active on their social media through content creation, text posting, involving in trending social issues, blogging or photo sharing. Because their audience considers them “real” or “relatable” they tend to take their advice closely, such as when they vouch for a service. Microinfluencers: Also known as expert influencers, these are everyday people that have gained a following and substantial topical authority due to their knowledge in a specific area. When they recommend or praise a product, their audience is likely to trust their opinion. Most times times, microinfluencers may have to use the products or service, make necessary review before recommending to people. 4  Content creators: These include professional bloggers, vloggers and photographers. Their role includes developing new content that readers are interested in keeping up with regularly. Part of a company’s marketing strategy could be to send products to a content creator in the hopes they will review and speak positively about it to their followers. Another option is to write sponsored posts for their platform. Before choosing Influencers, companies consider a few qualities. The first is if the influencer’s personal message aligns well will the company and is relevant to the same target audience. The second is how engaging the influencer is with their following, or how trustworthy their following considers them. Lastly is to consider the influencer’s reach or follower count as this can help predict return on investment (ROI). This same should apply with your brand or Business. You should get on the job as if you are an employee at your company who has been saddled with Social Media Influencing as sole responsibility."
9,Actually Useful Advice On The Differences Between Leaders And Managers,business," Do you know the differences between leaders and managers? Most business owners answer with a resounding “yes,” but reality says otherwise. Behind the success or failure of any business is the quality of leadership. There are five tell-tale differences between leaders and managers. When you can spot the differences, you’re well on your way to unlocking your success. Leadership is even more critical if you’re thinking about a liquidity event. Your enterprise value hinges on your team’s quality and their results.

Of “successful” liquidity events, sellers leave 50% to over 100% of the deal value in the buyer’s pocket. Who am I, and how do I know? I said “no” to a 7-figure offer and “yes” to mastering the art and science of a liquidity event. I said “yes” to a 9-figure offer from a different buyer two years later.

Differences Between Leaders And Managers Has Leaders Play The Long Game Vision with action can change the world — J. A. Baker. One of the differences between leaders and managers is that leaders play the long game. Leaders thrive on creating a vision that makes a market disruption. The long game has leaders avoid doing what is easy and instead focus on doing what’s right. Playing the long game for leaders correlates to your enterprise value. So part of the long game is identifying the X-Factors that increase enterprise value. Of course, one downside of the long game is that it can delay growth and profits. But it’s the long game that ensures growth and profits are sustainable. Read “The 5 Absolute Best X-Factors That Increase Enterprise Value.” While accolades, rewards, and recognition are welcome, leaders don’t rely on them. Leaders aren’t looking for external validation. Instead, validation for leaders comes from achieving their vision. On the flip side are managers who have short-term goals. Managers are happy to work within the system as it is today. The rocket fuel for managers is accolades and rewards. As you look at your business, which of your team members are leaders? Leadership transcends title. One of the traits of a successful business is that all employees exhibit leadership. From frontline employees to the CEO, leadership is a central theme. Leaders understand that goals are essential, but they are one part of a much bigger picture. A Manager’s focus on goals may win the battle but lose the war. Achieving goals for the sake of achieving goals can be a fool’s game. Do you know the next key difference between leaders and managers when playing the long game? Please keep reading. Differences Between Leaders And Managers Has Leaders Choose Relationships Over Processes Business relationships are what separate the winners from the losers — Jeffrey Feldberg One of the main differences between leaders and managers focuses on relationships. Leaders put relationships above everything else. When thinking about relationships, let’s look to your stakeholders. Your stakeholders are your employees, clients, suppliers, media, and board members. So when you look at your stakeholders, they all have the same currency. Do you know what the currency is for all your stakeholders? In business and life, the currency is trust and not money. Stakeholders prefer to do business with friends over strangers. The main difference between a friend compared to a stranger is trust. Leaders understand that they are enablers to help stakeholders achieve their goals. When leaders help stakeholders achieve their goals, leaders achieve their vision. Leaders can put in place company comprehensive initiatives. One example is that everyone in the company has a salesperson’s mindset. Read “The 5 Absolute Best Tips On Why All Employees Must Be Salespeople.” Leaders understand that the world’s favorite radio station is WII.FM (What’s In In For Me). By tuning into WII.FM for stakeholders, leaders create a win-win-win. In the process, leaders build trust by doing what they say. To help achieve the vision, leaders create cohesive teams. Instead of focusing on relationships, managers focus on individuals and their goals. For managers, the reliance on teams is not the same level as leaders. By focusing inwards, managers often exclude stakeholders, not in the business. As the saying goes, when the team works, the dream works, which is the essence of leadership. When thinking about leaders and managers, do you know where leaders shine? Please keep reading. Why The Vision Is Everything When Pursuing Success We are limited, not by our abilities, but by our vision — Khalil Gibran. Behind the success of every business is a vision that inspires all stakeholders. There is a stark difference in vision between leaders and managers. Leaders create an exciting narrative around a compelling vision. The vision talks about a bright and prosperous tomorrow. Leaders understand that people want to be on a winning team. Read “Employee Turnover: The 5 Best Strategies To Have You Thrive And Prosper.” When leaders look at people, they don’t see what’s in front of them. Instead, leaders see and understand the potential of what each person can do. Knowing the potential of people, leaders create potent teams. In turn, these powerful teams help achieve the vision. Focusing on the big picture through teams is where the business magic happens. Once again, managers operate at a lower level than leaders. As a result, managers take comfort in controlling the situation. Instead of creating and focusing on a vision, managers focus on the smaller picture. The smaller picture means focusing on the goals of individuals. Of course, individuals achieving goals is essential in any business. But individual goals pale in comparison to the vision. Both leaders and managers have an equal amount of time at their disposal. After all, there are 1,440 minutes in a day. The game-changer between leaders and managers is the use of time. By pursuing the vision, leaders achieve more simultaneously as managers. Period. End of story. There’s another critical difference between leaders and managers. This one difference can make or break a business. Would you like to know what this difference is all about? Please keep reading. The Game Changing Difference Between Taking On Risk Versus Managing Risk Risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing — Leo Buscaglia. The difference between leaders and managers shows itself in the area of risk. Leaders, through their narrative and vision, look at the big picture. Effective leaders welcome calculated risks for market disruption. In chasing after a market disruption, leaders know that they will fail. But, to a leader, failure provides lessons learned and a path to success. Managers choose to play it safe and manage problems instead of going beyond the problems. For managers, the saying “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is their motto. Instead, hitting existing goals and KPIs is what managers focus on. There are positive aspects to ensuring the team achieves milestones. Where managers hold your business back is believing that everything stays the same. For customers, a business is only as good as it can do today. Yes, there are heroic stories of achievements in days past. But yesterday is a distant memory. What worked yesterday for your clients stops working today. The only question is if your business is proactive enough to be ahead of the game so that you can offer the solution. How do you find the next problem for your clients? You ask the “magic question.” The magic question is an X-Factor which is step two of the 9-step roadmap.

The Power Of Innovation Over Keeping The Status Quo There’s a way to do it better — find it — Thomas Edison. The differences between leaders and managers shine through for innovation. If managers had their way, horse-drawn carriages would be our mode of transportation. Managers focus on what works and improving it. Going back to horse-drawn carriages, managers would focus on improved carriages. Leaders embrace change and market disruption, which go hand-in-hand. Innovation is the key that unlocks a leader’s vision. So the question is not what can we do to improve our offering for leaders? Leaders, instead, ask how we can put ourselves out of business? We’ll put ourselves back into a bigger and more profitable business. Both life and business are not always about the extremes. Of course, improving an existing offering is a necessity. But it’s knowing that improvement is taking place to buy time to enjoy a market disruption. Read “Why You Need To Create Market Disruption To Lead, Succeed, And Prosper.” In the 9-step roadmap, leaders are in step two, X-Factors that increase the value of your business. World-class X-Factors allow a company that thrives and profit or one you sell tomorrow. Either choice is a great one.

The power of the 9-step roadmap is preparing today for a prosperous tomorrow. Knowing the differences between leaders and managers helps ensure you welcome massive success.

10,There's No Universal Hiring Methodology,business," Of all business activities, the most subjective is the hiring process. The hard truth: Human bias and gut feel are intricate parts of the hiring process, and therefore, there’s no universal hiring methodology. Ultimately the hiring process is an emotional process from both sides of the desk. What may be a dealbreaker with one interviewer would be shrugged off by another interviewer; such is the hiring process, such is life. Do you like pizza? If yes, what toppings? When it comes to movies, are you into westerns, sci-fi, romances, action, thrillers? Do you find Seth Rogen funny? Dog, cat, or fish as a pet? Milk or cream in your coffee? Your infinite combination of preferences is your own. Apply this human truth to hiring managers and thus why the hiring process is fraught with human biases. Every job seeker asks: What are employers looking for? The answer: There’s no coalition of “employers.” Employers are individual HR managers, C-suite Executives, department managers, business owners, recruiters, with personal, specific pain points, coupled with their respective human bias looking for employees to solve their problems. My advice: Don’t overstress your résumé format, clothes, LinkedIn profile, mannerisms. While these do have importance, their importance varies widely from employer to employer, from industry to industry, from region to region—from interviewer to interviewer. Well-meaning career coaches tell job seekers the formula for successful job searching is A + B + C = “You’re hired!” If at the core of every hiring decision is “gut feel,” how can there be a formula? On both sides of the hiring desk, everything goes into “the mix” — past hiring mistakes, biases, commonalities. If you want to increase your job search success exponentially, stop chasing the wrong jobs and employers! Think: I’m not looking for a job; I’m looking for my tribe. Look for employers who get you. Look for like-minded people. Look for where you feel comfortable. Look for employers you identify with and like to be proud to be associated with. I know, easier said than done, but well worth the effort. Yes, there are fundamental principles for searching for a job, such as your résumé being typo-free, not chewing gum when interviewing. However, “principles” are elastic. Consider this: I hired someone who was over 20 minutes late for their scheduled interview. I’ve hired candidates who asked, within 5 minutes of starting the interview, “What does this job pay?” I’ve hired candidates who were unemployed for more than six months. I’ve lost count of how many candidates over 50 I have hired. Everyone I ever hired came down to me being able to relate to their story. Chances are you have a friend whom your other friends can’t understand why you’re friends with. Either you relate to some part of their story, share a commonality or in some way serve each other’s best interest. Whatever the reason, there’s a connection between you and your unpopular (misunderstood) friend. A similar scenario plays out every day throughout the corporate world. An employer’s employees don’t have to be perfect as long as they achieve the results their position requires. As a job seeker, your primary goal is to connect with people who can assist in your job search, a topic I’ll cover in a later column. This explains why networking is the most efficient way to find a job. Networking lengthens the connection building runway, making you familiar. Therefore, when you participate in the hiring process, you have a much stronger connection than most of your competition will have. After reading this, I hope you embrace that all you can do is your best and be more of yourself. Stop trying to contort yourself into what you’re told employers are looking for. Keep top of mind that every job search journey is unique. Focus on the hiring manager’s pain and how you’d solve the problems the position you applied to exists to solve. Seek companies where you’d most likely fit in. During interviews, focus on making a connection with your interviewer. The positive shift in your job results will astonish you."
11,As a Job Seeker Look for Your Tribe,business," If you’re having a tough time with your job search, I guarantee it’s because you’re trying to fit yourself into companies where you don’t belong. The advice I give most often to jobseekers: “Search for your tribe!” Years ago, my wife was working for a printing company. A colleague was describing a party he had attended during the weekend. The people in attendance didn’t feel right, thus he didn’t stay long. He then said, “I always go where I’m celebrated, not merely tolerated.” What a great mindset to have! I believe much of our mental anguish, frustrations, unhappiness, and failures stem from trying to “fit in.” We’re desperate to hear: “We want you.” “Please join us.” “We like you.” “You’re who we need.” “We love you.” (the ultimate heart-tugger) Seeking employers who’ll most likely accept you, where you’ll feel you belong, will expedite your job search; you may even hear the above-mentioned words. Making finding where you belong a priority is the best compass a job seeker can use. Don’t look for a job. Instead, look for where you’ll be accepted. Think: “I’m not looking for a job; I’m looking for my tribe!” Envision you’re joining a group that makes you feel you’re one of them (e.g., community theatre, professional organization, church, car club, soccer team). Being part of a group of people who share your values and interests, who welcome you into their circle, who, when they say “we” mean you also, is a good feeling. Joining a company is the equivalent of joining a group. Work takes up a significant chunk of your time. It makes sense to ensure your workplace embraces your individualism, age, gender, values, and beliefs—that it’s a place where you can be yourself rather than always trying to belong. From personal experience, the extra mental load of trying to “fit in” created stressors resulting in anxiousness when arriving at work, coming home frustrated and angry, and having trouble sleeping. Sound familiar? It wasn’t the job, but the atmosphere and conditions I was trying to mold myself into that were causing these mental torments. During my working hours, my internal dialogue revolved around trying to convince myself that my experience was typical of all employees. After all, I wasn’t at work to have fun—I was there to work. Eventually, I started to realize my approach wasn’t working for me. So, I asked myself: What do I want to be accepted for? (age, gender, affiliations, values, beliefs, skills). Answering this question required soul searching. If you’re more comfortable working for a female boss, so be it. If you want to be surrounded by Millennials because you feed off their energy, so be it. Who has the right to judge you if you get along better with people who are politically conservative? Are you more at ease dealing with people of your cultural background—who isn’t? The difference between feeling like you’re the only freak show at the circus versus feeling like you’re sitting right at the heartbeat of where you’re meant to be is the people you surround yourself with. There’s an enormous benefit that comes with searching for workplaces where you won’t need to constantly spend your energy trying to fit in; you’re job-hunting with a purpose beyond simply trying to secure a steady paycheck. Being a fit is at the core of every hiring process. When you get to the formal interview stage, it’s because you have the qualifications to do the job; otherwise, you wouldn’t be interviewed. The hiring manager is interviewing you to gauge if you’ll be a fit. Since being a fit, is a 2-way street, use the discussion to gauge if you’re a fit. At the end of the day, only you know you and what works for you. Finding your tribe boils down to being honest with yourself about the kind of people, conversations, connections, and social interactions that feed your soul and, therefore, where you’ll do your best work. On a parting note, not being a fit, either early in your employment or down the road, is the number one reason employees are fired. Don’t underestimate the correlation between being a fit and your employment longevity."
12,Before Joining ‘The Great Resignation’ Rethink Your Current Employer,business," My addiction to job hunting (“the hunt”) has made me somewhat of an expert at landing jobs—and a job hopper. “Look at me! I’m moving on to greener pastures!”, “I’m going to where I’ll be paid what I believe I’m worth!”, “At my new employer, management will get me.” I know firsthand how job-hopping can make a person feel as if they’re in control. I’ve also experienced firsthand, more than once, starting a new job and realizing within a few days, even hours, that leaving my previous employer was a mistake—I’d made a hasty decision. The media is reporting that everyone is quitting their jobs; as a result, employers are experiencing “The Great Resignation.” This mass reshuffling of employment is attributed to the pandemic prompting employees to seek better jobs. Actually, the Great Resignation represents the peak of a long-term trend of rising quitting rates that began over a decade ago due to five factors: retirement, relocation, reconsideration, reshuffling, and reluctance. If the media is to be believed, employers have trouble filling job openings; hence, job candidates are now in the driver’s seat. In contrast, the emails I receive from frustrated job seekers paint a different picture. Don’t let wishful thinking lull you into believing today’s job market isn’t populated with hyper-competition, especially for sought-after jobs at sought-after companies. I don’t have a crystal ball, so I can’t predict the future power dynamics between employers and employees. However, I’m certain about one thing, the employer-employee relationship, and the economy, which is cyclical, is in constant flux. Inevitably employers will be back in the driver’s seat, which, given the rapid growth in AI, robotics, and self-service, not to mention using contractors and contractors, might be sooner than employees would like. Additionally, Bay Street and Wall Street are nervous, central banks are hiking interest rates, attempting to curb inflation, and geopolitical unrest is worsening supply chain issues that began in 2020. Based on history, the recent spike in inflation will cause the economy to contract. The warning signs of a looming recession, possibly a major one, are flashing. It’s not a matter of if there’ll be an economic contraction/recession; it’s a matter of when, which means employers will downsize. If you’re considering joining the Great Resignation, keep the following in mind: Last one in, first one out. No one’s ever accused me of not being pragmatic. I’m not saying you should stay with your current employer forever. Considering my track record that be hypocritical of me to say. Changing jobs for the right reasons and at the right time—making a well-thought-out strategic move—is often required for career advancement and income growth. What are your reasons for wanting to join the Great Resignation? We’re talking about your career. I assume you have career goals other than “to make lots of money.” Are you just jumping on the Great Resignation bandwagon? Is now the time for you to move on? Don’t let your ego make your decision. An article I read on the Ultimate Kronos Group (UKG™) website, ""15+ Million Pandemic-Era U.S. Job Quitters Say They Were Better Off in Their Old Jobs,"" makes the point that we seldom give our decisions the serious consideration they deserve. According to the article, 43% of people who quit during the pandemic admit they were better off at their old jobs, and 1 in 5 have returned to their old employer. Maybe the media should be reporting on “The Great Regret.” To avoid regretting having left your employer consider the following: TIP: Write a pros and cons list of leaving your current employer. Don’t just chase money. The most common reason to change jobs is to earn more money, but is the “more money after taxes” worth it? More money means more accountability, headaches, stress and hours, higher expectations, etc. Are you running away from your present employer because the going is getting tough, and you believe elsewhere will be easier? What is your reasoning for believing that elsewhere will be better? What do you expect from a new employer? Are you being realistic? How will changing your employer now advance your career? There’s nothing wrong with wanting a shiny new job, new colleagues, a new boss, etc. I know what the need to get out of Dodge feels like. However, upon reflection on whether the grass will be greener elsewhere, you might conclude staying put, for now, is in your best interest. Staying put could be the best career decision you ever make."

14,How To Use Professional Bid Writers To Boost Your Business,business," If you're an owner of a small business, you find you have a lot of tasks on your plate. From the completion of jobs to admin and managerial commitments, many business owners find that they are short on time and often simply aren't in the right 'headspace' to sit down and formulate a well-written, succinct, and persuasive proposal when responding to an opportunity that has been put out for tender. Fortunately, the outsourced bid writing market is blossoming, and there are many experienced professional bid writers available and looking for work with companies like yours. If you’re new to hiring bid writing specialists, you may feel overwhelmed by the choice of professionals available. Here’s how to sift through the proposals and find a writer who matches the style and culture of your business. Why Hire A Professional Bid Writer? Technical Knowledge: Prequalification Questionnaire (PQQ) documents must be filled in when responding to contracts put out for tender, but they can be diﬃcult to navigate if you are not experienced in writing your own bids. The specifications are often long and complex, may be daunting if you aren’t used to them, and can require a lot of time and eﬀort that many busy business owners simply don’t have. However, specialist bid writers are experienced in writing to a brief, and can produce a professional and polished application in a fraction of the time. Experience: Bid writers will already have years of experience under their belts, meaning that they can complete the PQQ documentation more quickly and eﬃciently than an inexperienced writer. They will have completed hundreds – maybe even thousands - of bids before, so will know what the client is likely to be looking for, and how to meet the requirements of the brief. They will also know exactly what is required of each question, meaning that you are more likely to be successful in winning the bid. Ultimately, this should place your business in a better position to win the tender! Rigorous Process: If you were to write your bids in-house, what would happen if your writer went oﬀ sick, quit, or had to focus on other, more pressing matters? Would you still be able to meet the application closing date? Professional bid writers will have a rigorous process in place, and will usually operate in a team with other experienced writers. This means that no matter what happens, you have peace of mind knowing that your tender will be completed in an eﬃcient and reliable manner. Having the process planned out in advance helps to ensure good pacing and continuity, and that time can be allocated for quality checks and deadlines for each section. This will keep the writing process to a schedule and ensure that there is no rush to complete sections further down the line. Writing To A Brief: Writing to a brief using an appropriate tone and structure is a skill in itself. Your brief will need to cover the unique selling points of your business, while also meeting the requirements of the specification. If your business is lacking in certain areas, the brief may also need to gloss over these points. Using a professional writer means that they will have experience in accentuating the positive qualities of your organisation, while also covering your tracks in areas where your business might struggle to meet the criteria. More Successful Outcomes: Hiring a professional writer gives you access to experience and writing skills that you might not otherwise have. This increases your chance of success when writing bids for new contracts, and will give you increased insight to be able to build your own skills. Choosing The Right Bid Writer For Your Business There are lots of diﬀerent companies and writers out there that specialise in bid writing. Look for companies and writers that have experience in writing for your trade; this ensures they will know your industry inside out, and what your clients are looking for in an application. Don’t be tempted to go for the cheapest option - writers who pitch their prices low may be less experienced, and/or have fewer skills than a professional who does it as their primary source of income. Choosing A Service Bid writing companies often have several diﬀerent services that they oﬀer. Choose a service based on the requirements of your company, and what will suit your long-term vision. Training: If you would like to train one of your in-house writers to write bids on behalf of your company, this service is a good option. A bid writing company will take on one of your employees, and train them to write bids according to precise specifications. Your writer will receive support to meet their goals, and you get a qualified bid writer at the end of it. Review: If you - or writers within your company - are capable of producing your own bid proposals, you may choose to write your bids in-house and then submit them for review by a professional bid writer. This is usually cheaper than getting a bid written from scratch. The bid writer will draw attention to anything that requires re-writing, and you will get feedback so that you can improve your bid writing for future applications. Partial Completion: You can also choose to write certain parts of the application yourself, and simply pass on the bits that you find more diﬃcult or don’t have time for. The writer will review your application and let you know if anything needs changing. Full Service: This includes the whole package: planning, writing, management, review, and feedback. This is the best way to maximise your chances of winning the opportunity being bid on, and outsourcing the whole process to a professional will also give you peace of mind that the job is in the best possible hands!"

18,What Are Good Backlinks To Get in 2022?,business," What Are Good Backlinks To Get In 2022? If you are in SEO or have tried to hire someone recently to do SEO for you, then you’ve probably heard about backlinks. Either you go out and claim backlinks on the behalf of your clients, or you have had someone try and tell you that backlinks are the important part of SEO. First, let’s be clear, the most important part of SEO is content and not backlinks. At its core, Google is trying to show the websites that have the best and most relevant content to a search query. If you do not have great content, you will not be able to rank. Okay, Content First Then Backlinks But What Backlinks? The type of backlinks you will want to get will depend on the type of business that you run. Local Business A dry cleaner, contractor, appliance repair, house cleaning, or any other local business. Getting backlinks for your business is easy, but not all backlinks are equal. The first thing you need to know is to focus on getting local backlinks. Blueprint Digital Marketing & SEO head office is located in Calgary, so we focus on finding other local backlinks for our business. Here are a few examples of directories local to us. SE Calgary Businesses Converge Calgary Calgary Business Listing Why do we want to network with our local businesses and directories?  The answer is that we want traffic from other businesses that are local to us, as that helps establish our local relevancy. SEO Gear & Flow Chart For 2021 seo gear industrial illustration with arrows and words. Design over white Ecommerce or National Businesses The good news is that if you run an eCommerce shop or a business that services an entire Province, State, or Country, finding directories will be easy for you. This is because almost every directory will provide a little bit of traffic and/or value to your website. The bad news is that your competition also has this advantage, so if you want to outrank your competition you will have to try extra hard to find good quality backlinks. Good Examples of Backlinks Yellow Pages Canada One Canadian Business Directory These are good directories, because either they have a recognizable brand or lots of organic traffic from having existed for a while. If you need to check and see how much traffic a directory has, the Hoth has a good and free website traffic checker. Free Vs Paid Backlinks This is hotly debated amongst SEO agencies, but from our experience, it is fine to pay for a business profile that provides a link to your website. What you don’t want to do is pay for a link exchange, private link network, or a website that exists only to provide backlinks. The key to good link building is that it should be natural, not automated, or giving signals to Google that you’ve found a way to get dozens or hundreds of backlinks in a matter of weeks or even a month. Like all things in life, if you consistently build backlinks to your website, you will get good results. Content Marketing This is another great way to get really good backlinks for your business website. By creating high-quality content and promoting it across the internet, other businesses and websites will want to link to you. Think of any website that has ever had a blog and needed to reference something for one of their posts, a good example is the Hoth website traffic checker linked above. The key to a good content marketing strategy is to provide content that is useful and written in an engaging manner, to achieve that you should hire a professional copywriter. In closing, the key to getting good backlinks for your business will depend on the type of business that you have. Always make sure the links you are getting come from quality websites and try to start as relevant as possible to your business and city or town. Once you have exhausted all of the good backlinks, you can then start working on finding more generalized or poor-quality backlinks."

How to decide if you want a Franchise carpet cleaning business. If you are looking to start a small business, consider the carpet cleaning business. This is one of the most affordable businesses to start. Many homes have carpeting, and carpets should be cleaned at least once a year. Sometimes people may have their carpets cleaned several times a year, depending on their lifestyle. If there are small children in the home, frequent spills make that necessary, and if there is a pet in the home, there are always a lot of stains to deal with as well. People who suffer from allergies also like to have their carpets cleaned frequently. The dust and dander that accumulate in carpet fibers can be an irritant that aggravates an allergy, even if the carpet is vacuumed frequently. A professional cleaning of the carpet will remove the particles that have been ground in. If you want to start a carpet cleaning business, you can take different approaches. First of all, there are franchises in the field and they will offer you the opportunity to start a carpet cleaning business using their already established name. These franchises provide the new business with training, and guidance on running a business. When you buy a carpet cleaning franchise, you will be required to buy the carpet cleaning equipment from the main company, as well as any products that you use. If your carpet cleaning franchise becomes busy very quickly, the cost of the equipment will be recovered in no time. If the idea of a franchise is not appealing to you, you can just strike out on your own. In this case, you should have some background or training in business management, since you will not be given the guidance that the franchise company can give you. If not. you can hire a manager who has this expertise. The main skill in this business is operating the carpet cleaning machine. but you really need to manage the administrative and marketing side of the business as well. If you are not successful in attracting customers to your business, your business will not survive, let alone thrive. Marketing is an essential component of this. Get the work out to the public about your new business by sponsoring a promotion of some kind, perhaps by offering a discount or offering a two rooms for one special, This is a business that can be very successful because of the demand, and you can have a lot of fun and make a good profit if you manage it well.

2,Cleaning Business Opportunities,business," If you are looking for a business venture to get into, then a cleaning business opportunity could be right up your street. In today’s busy world more and more people are turning to hiring house cleaners to take care of their homes. The cleaning business provides several options and opportunities to start and run a successful full or part time business, big or small. People want and need all types of cleaning, from regular full general house cleaners to laundry specialists, carpet and upholstery and janitorial services.

3,How to start a cleaning business with no money,business," One of the biggest mistakes that many people make when they decide to go into business is they spend way too much money up front, and then when the bills arrive and the business isn’t making enough money yet, their ventures ultimately fail. One way to get around this problem is by starting a business that you can start with little or no up-front capital. There are a number of businesses that this can be done with, and many books and magazines dedicate space to talking about them. Headlines like “100 Low Cost Startups” are common in business how-to magazines. In this article we are going to discuss one of these low-cost startups: the cleaning business. There are several keys to starting a cleaning business with no money. The first and most important point is that you should NOT, under any circumstances spend money until you absolutely have to. It may sound strange, but it’s an obvious point that people miss. They think (wrongly), “I’m going into business, so I need a new computer, a new desk, some office supplies, files, cleaning supplies, a dedicated phone line…”, and the list goes on. This is not just wrong thinking, its bad thinking. It’s thinking that will cause your business to go broke before it even gets off the ground. Do some businesses require a big upfront investment? Sure they do. But a cleaning business is NOT one of them! The second key to starting a cleaning business with nothing is being sure to start the right type of business to fit your goals, and your budget (or lack thereof). For example, you wouldn’t want to start a business that requires a lot of expensive equipment like a floor-care service. It would be difficult if not impossible to start a floor-care service with no budget. However, it is possible to start an office cleaning business or a home cleaning service with no money. The supplies you need are much less, and it’s possible that you already have many of them. The third key is to utilize free methods and resources to get your first customer(s). For example, if you are starting a home-based cleaning business you might go door to door in a neighborhood you’d like to clean in. This costs you nothing but your time, and will allow you to not only get your name out there, but to make contact with your prospects and better gauge their needs. The fourth and final key is to use what you have in terms of supplies and business resources. This means that you should look around you, and see what can be used in your own house to help you start your business. Do you have a fax machine? Great. You have a tool at your disposal. Do you have a phone? Perfect. Hopefully you get the point here. Just utilize what resources you have, and if need be, get creative. Find ways to save money. Many people over-complicate and under-plan for their businesses and as a result they completely miss the four key points mentioned here that are necessary to start a cleaning business on little or no budget. It might seem over-simplified, but it’s really not. If you apply the four ideas mentioned here to their fullest, you will be able to get started cleaning with very little… and if you’re smart, probably nothing. Think through each ahead of time, and plan how you will tackle each key point. By doing so you’ll have set yourself up to start a business for next to nothing."

5,Survive and Thrive: Langtons International Agency,business," How Linda Langton successfully led her boutique literary agency through the COVID minefield. Linda Langton Linda Langton, CEO of Langtons International Agency, is a survivor. Her entire career has been about taking chances, surviving obstacles in her path, and thriving. Although she was born in Manchester, England (her father was the Lord Mayor), she married and moved to Australia. She eventually became a highly successful award-winning businesswoman. After creating and operating The Ink Group, an award winning $50 million international greeting card and calendar company, she packed up and moved to New York, where she began her agency. “Having left Australia behind, I followed my dream to live here. I knew no one in New York and had no idea what I was going to do. A client from my previous company asked me to agent his photography book. Being a very can-do person, I said, ‘Of course, I will!’ I hadn’t a clue about being an agent in the publishing industry and knew no one in New York at that time.”- Linda Langton This “can-do” attitude that Linda has in abundance led her to create Langtons International Agency. She has successfully made over 100 writers into published authors from every genre over the past twenty-two years, from well-known women’s fiction to commercial fiction and almost all nonfiction categories. Recent successes include a women’s business book sold to Atria Publishing for a 6-figure deal, a memoir by one of the lead voice actors of major anime, sold to Running Press in a 5 figure deal, and a six-book Sherlock Holmes series in an international deal to HarperCollins UK, each book a 5-figure deal. Several more books are in the pipeline for publication later this year. They range from two new true-crime books by an award-winning journalist and a thriller by a NY Times best-selling author. In addition, some of Langtons International Agency’s books have been turned into films, such as Trumbo, and four true-crime books, including “Dancing on Her Grave,” published by Berkley. “Linda is tough, committed, and knowledgeable, all key traits for a successful agent. She believed in ART IN THE BLOOD, my first novel, and persisted past many rejections to land me a sale and then a three and then a five-book deal at HarperCollins. Now that is persistence, I’m so grateful.” — Bonnie MacBird, International Best Selling Author Langtons International Agency did not slow down during the pandemic. Instead, the company transferred to an online work-from-home paradigm, as many did during this period of quarantine and uncertainty. As a result, Linda found that the market grew with more people reading books and more writers reaching out to be published. Because of social isolation, writers and would-be authors had time to concentrate on their books and submit them to agencies like Langtons International. Using zoom and video chat to connect to publishers and clients has become a basic method of communication, and Linda doesn’t see this changing anytime soon. “Our reputation online and word-of-mouth has been a driving force in finding potential clients. We have been incredibly busy in the past years of the pandemic, and post-COVID.” — Linda Langton Over the past few years, the company has been focusing on the global market. In the next two years, the agency will be concentrating as well as the US and Canada, on the UK, and European markets. Publishing has changed over several years and not because of COVID, but that didn’t help. The five remaining large publishing companies swallowed up many of the smaller publishers. With the pandemic, agents and the industry have been inundated with new writers and submissions, causing agents and publishers to be more selective. Langtons International Agency invites authors to submit manuscripts in the Mysteries/Thrillers, True Crime, Women’s Fiction, Memoir, Narrative nonfiction, Business books, Historical Fiction,and Biography genres. Linda has recently recorded and is distributing several vlogs (video blogs) about what a writer needs to do to prepare and write a manuscript, how to find an agent and what to expect next. As a subsidary to Langtons International Agency, Linda also recently started an author-assisted publishing company for books that are outside of the commercial publishing purview. Central Park South Publishing provides a full range of services to help writers get their books polished and published and offered to the bookstores and online through Amazon and the 8 online publishers. Central Park South encourages authors to submit their work for review. Contact the agency at langtonsinternational@gmail.com if interested. Linda Langton and her staff are always happy to speak with potential writers. https://medium.com/@pmkptk/reinvention-linda-langton-and-the-central-park-south-publishing-story-49fdd8a615aa"

In this article, we'll walk you through the moves and systems you want to initiate to purchase the most blazing NFTs when they drop, which could be the distinction between getting the dopest NFT or missing out on different authorities and flippers and purchasing on the optional market at greater expenses. As a matter of fact, these may be the absolute most significant hints out there. In any case, we should investigate what an NFT drop involves. Above all, I really want to reveal I'm not a monetary counsel and coming up next isn't monetary or venture exhortation. This article is rigorously for diversion purposes. What is an NFT Drop? NFT specialists discharge new assortments for financial backers, fans, and gatherers to purchase, similar as when your number one artist delivers another collection or Lucas Films delivers another Star Wars film. This assortment is stand-out, just like with NFTs. Since NFTs can't be copied, replicated, or controlled in any way, their uniqueness makes them significant. Since NFT drops are fairly uncommon, they offer fans the opportunity to possess an extraordinary work of advanced craftsmanship for a potentially modest expense of section (contingent upon the maker and craftsman, obviously). Numerous famous and very much advertised NFT drops are intensely challenged, in this way, naturally, hundreds or even a huge number of members are scrambling to get their hands on the most sought-after things. I as of late gotten a collectible drop made by a craftsman I appreciate named Tristan Eaton.' Luckily or tragically, this is where flipping becomes an integral factor. Some of the time ""flippers"" will get in on a well known drop and exchange the NFT following the drop for somebody who couldn't get in on the drop. All in all, to be a piece of a notable craftsman, brand, or planner's NFT drop, you should be pretty much as ready as could be expected. How about we currently take a gander at the means you really want to follow to procure NFTs when they drop successfully. All things considered, most drops are either coordinated open releases or restricted version drops. 1 Planned Drop Open Edition: this is where an NFT is delivered to buy for a specific time frame outline. As many individuals can purchase inside the time span yet assuming 2,315 individuals purchase the NFT that implies the version will be 2,315. Basically, there are 2,315 confirmed duplicates of that specific piece's craftsmanship that are fit to be kept, exchanged, or exchanged. 2 Restricted Edition Drop: these drops are where a craftsman or maker sets the released sum and it transforms into a first-come first-serve premise. For instance, suppose a craftsman needs to deliver a release of just 25 duplicates of an NFT making it more uncommon than say a version of 1,000. One of my #1 specialists Lushsux participates in the two kinds of drops."

9,Understanding Affiliate Business Model,business," Affiliate marketing is a business model where a brand or company uses the service of online influencers and publishers to promote their products and services. Affiliate get monetary compensation for every sale or signup he generates. The Affiliate business model started in the 90s and it has been on a steady growth. The Affiliate business model has made companies profitable and individuals millionaires. What makes Affiliate marketing interesting is that the Affiliate or Publisher does not need to know every detail of the company or vendor whose products he promotes what is required of the Affiliate is to have a deep knowledge of the product and have an idea about its workings. This is to ensure the product delivers on its promises. The Affiliates that spend time researching a product before recommending the same to their audience tend to win their trust and every recommendation from them is a win. top Affiliates don't just promote any products, first, they review and use The product to ascertain its quality. The amount of money an Affiliate makes directly from the level of trust his audience place in him. The difference between top Affiliates and poor Affiliates is the amount of time and quality of tools used to analyze, and promote their Affiliate business, and the systems used to deliver the content to their audience. A poorly prepared Affiliate will get a poor buy-to-action response from his audience. Getting positive results in Affiliate marketing requires you to follow certain rules, we will discuss some below. Do not recommend a product you have not used, Audience loose confidence in Affiliates when a recommended product fails to deliver its promises, Affiliates main job is to research and recommend a product that solves the audience's problems, there is always a loss of professional trust when a recommended products fail to deliver on the purpose of its purchase to the customers hence the buyer may never buy any product the Affiliate recommends in future. Get marketing materials from the Vendor/Brand: After analyzing and testing the product and discovering how great it is, request marketing and promotional materials from the Vendor. The vendor's promotional materials explain the products better and more concisely, it gives a deeper explanation in addition to your discovery about the product or service. Promote products relevant to your audience, do not overload your audience with offers, they are on your platform for quality content don't disrespect them by loading them with lots of offers to buy. There are in your blog or website to learn, in the course of their learning they will need a product or service to enhance their learning or improve their business, hence your recommendations. Build a different list for each audience. a list is necessary for your Affiliate marketing, List building is the collection of names and emails of your audience or readers who showed interest in your blog or website.

10,The Difference Between Carbonless Paper and Carbonless Forms,business," Carbonless paper and carbonless forms are often confused with each other because they look very similar to the untrained eye, so it’s important to know the difference between the two products. Carbonless paper is typically used for legal documents and receipts, while carbonless forms are used in everything from invoices to order forms to check stubs and more. Here’s what you need to know about these two products so you can make the right choice when you buy them. https://carbonless.com/ Understanding Carbonless Paper A common question among business owners is whether carbonless paper or carbonless forms are more appropriate for their business. While they seem similar, there are differences that distinguish them both from each other. If you’re looking to print invoices or business forms in a professional manner, it’s important to understand what distinguishes these two products so you can choose which is right for your company. Let’s take a look at how carbonless paper differs from carbonless forms by highlighting a few of their key characteristics Who Uses Carbonless Form Order forms are used widely to enable a record of transactions and actions. Since everything is written in one place, carbonless forms help prevent double ordering errors, for example. They also provide a means for keeping track of past orders, which is helpful when you are running low on stock, need to reorder products, or would like to refer back to previous orders. There is also no risk of information being lost because it’s all kept on file. This can be extremely valuable as an audit trail for accounting purposes as well as when handling credit card transactions. Many people also use these order forms when entering data from applications or questionnaires that have been returned from customers or participants. Where to Use Them You can purchase either carbonless paper or carbonless forms for just about any type of project that requires a basic record of transactions. Typically, these records are used for invoices and receipts, but businesses often use them to keep track of inventory as well. Whether you’re a small business owner or a bookkeeper looking to streamline your filing system, it’s important to know what each option offers so you can decide which is best for your organization. Here are some guidelines: •Carbonless paper is more common in everyday office situations. Since carbon copies have been around since 1882, they have become more standardized than their counterpart forms. How to Sell More Part of selling more is knowing your product. If you want to sell more carbonless paper, for example, you should know how it works, what advantages it offers clients, and why your customers should purchase from you rather than from a competitor. Before you can sell any type of carbonless paper or form you have to be able to tell people what they’re buying. How To Print a Voucher on Carbonless Form First, you’ll need to have carbonless paper. While there are many ways to print a voucher in carbonless form, some methods work better than others. We recommend using 2-ply yellow or white 20# offset stock with your laser printer, as it is designed specifically for high-volume printing on forms.  If you do not have access to a laser printer, then an inkjet will also work well. If possible, make sure that you use an inkjet that has photo quality paper (such as Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II). This is because inkjets can be less reliable when printing on plain office copy paper. As long as you use good quality paper and ink then your vouchers should look great!"
11,"With large companies buying out smaller ones, innovation dies.",business," It is often argued, and many articles have been written by various authors that state “Big companies can innovate like small companies”, this may as well be possible, but I would suggest that this will be the exception rather than the rule. When you look at work environments and also at the personal freedom employees have, a smaller company will almost always outperform a larger company. This is of course is typically the case if the small company is a leader in a niche market, and as it grows, it either steps into becoming itself a large company or it attracts the attention of a larger cooperation. A recent example is a regional Canadian company, Hibar Systems Ltd. that for many years with the innovation, engineering spirits from its founder Heinz Barall, the company thrived and achieved a more than 90% market share in the dispensing of battery electrolytes. Which happened to be the original purpose of the inventor and founder, as he had created the dispensing pumps for this purpose. Under his guidance, the company thrived and innovated its way to become also the leader of assembly systems for alkaline batteries. Then after his untimely passing away, the company was eventually sold to no one else, but the current media darling Tesla. Now, nearly 2 years after the sale, the company Hibar Systems Ltd. does not exist anymore. Tesla Automation has formally told all the previous customers of Hibar (many as long as the late 1970s) that from now on the products are not available anymore. Of course, many would argue that Tesla is a champion of inventions and so on, but let’s face it. The company is the same as most other larger co-operations, stifling innovation and trying to do this with a weak attempt by limiting access to the technology they had purchased. And like in so many cases, a unique personality and a champion of innovation is wiped off the business landscape, and no one is the wiser. And as it is in this case, and many others, a trove of employees are usually forced to retire or are simply shown the door, such as was the case here. Interesting articles relating to this topic are “Why Big Business Can’t Innovate” by Maxwell Wessel, published in Harvard Business Review, or “Big companies are swallowing up smaller ones. Why that’s not good for the economy” by Don Lee, published in the Los Angeles Times."
12,What To Do If You Find a Leak in Your Roo,business," The roof is one of the essential parts of a house. It keeps the inhabitants dry and sheltered from the elements. There are many different types of roofing materials available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most commonly used roofing material is asphalt shingles. They are cheap, durable, and easy to install. They also come in a variety of colors and styles to match the look of your house. Another popular roofing material is metal. Metal roofs are long-lasting and can withstand severe weather conditions. However, they are more expensive than asphalt shingles and can be challenging to install. The weather is finally starting to warm up, and that means one thing for many people, time to start working on their tan. However, it means it is time to start worrying about roof leaks for others. No matter what time of year it is, having a roof leak can be a major pain. It means you have to spend money on repairs, but it can also lead to water damage in your home. It's not often that homeowners think about their roof until there's a problem. But by then, it may be too late. A little bit of preventative maintenance can go a long way in keeping your roof in good condition and avoiding costly repairs down the road. Here is what to do If you find a leak in your roof Move Things Out of the Way Before you start fixing your roof, it is good to move any items from underneath it. It's not only going to make your repair easier, but it will also allow you to spot any potential problems before you start. Contain the Water One of the most common causes of water damage is roof leaks. If not detected and repaired quickly, a roof leak can cause extensive damage to your home. The best way to prevent water damage from a roof leak is to contain the water. If you notice a roof leak, immediately put a bucket or container under the leak to catch the water. If possible, use tarps or other materials to divert the water away from your home. Do not ignore a roof leak - it can lead to significant damage and expensive repairs. Have the Right Tools You will need many different tools to get the job done right when replacing a roof. It's essential that these tools are in good condition and that they are clean. You don't want to damage your roof in the process of trying to fix it. Check the Roof for Leaks Once you have everything moved out of the way, it is time to start checking your roof for leaks. This can be done by simply walking around the roof or using a tape measure to check for any areas where water could be coming in from underneath. Check the gutters One of the most common causes of roof leaks is clogged gutter. If water can't flow freely off the roof, it will drip down and seep into the roofing material. This can cause extensive damage and costly repairs. Clogged gutters can also lead to other problems, such as water damage to the fascia board and soffit. It's essential to check your gutters regularly and clean them out when necessary. If you aren't comfortable cleaning out the gutters by yourself, hire a professional to do it for you. It's well worth the investment to avoid a costly roof leak. Check your shingles If you can't find any problems with the gutter system, then it's time to check your roof shingles. Look at the shingles in different roof areas for any signs of damage or wear. In some cases, a few small spots on a shingle may cause water leaks, but most serious leaks will occur on large roof sections. A leak could also be caused by a loose or missing flashing around chimneys, vents, skylights, or other areas where water can get into the roof. Check for damaged flashing. The next thing to check is for damaged flashing near chimneys, vents, and skylights. It is good to have a professional roofer check your roof for leaks every year and make sure that the flashing is in good condition. If there are any signs of damage or wear, then it's time to replace the flashing. Check the chimneys You should also check your chimneys for leaks. If you think your chimney has damaged flashing, you should replace it with new flashing as soon as possible. It is a good idea to install rain gutters above your chimney so that water can flow down into them instead of into the roof. Check the roof vents and skylights Make sure to check the roof vents and skylights for damage or leaks. You should also check your roof vents to ensure they are not cracked or damaged. If you have a skylight that is missing its gasket and is leaking, it's time to replace it Relieve Water Pressure Water pressure is something that should be relieved when it becomes too high. This can be done in a few ways, one of which is to release the pressure from the roof. If there is a roof leak, the water pressure will become very high and cause water to come into the home. You must relieve this water pressure as soon as possible to avoid any further damage. One way to relieve water pressure is to find the source of the leak and fix it. For example, if a roof is leaking, the best way to stop the leak is to find where it is coming from and patch it up. If there is a plumbing problem, the sooner it is fixed, the better. Another way to relieve water pressure is by using a pump. A pump can be used to move water out of a flooded area or remove water from a basement. It can also be used to transfer water from one place to another. A third way to relieve water pressure is by using a siphon. A siphon can be used to move water over long distances or uphill. It can also be used to remove water from a flooded area. Contact a Professional Roofing Company If you don't want to do the work yourself, it is good to call a professional roofing company. They will be able to check your roof for leaks and damage and make sure that the flashing is in good condition. The best prevention against leaks on a roof is to have it inspected and repaired as soon as possible. If water leaks into the attic or onto the ground, it can lead to damage in the house that can cost hundreds of dollars to repair.

13,Virtual reality and digital economics,business," Virtual reality is when you immerse yourself in a completely virtual world through the auditory, visual and tactile senses and are completely separated from the real world, while augmented reality is based on the real world but adds more virtual detail to the real surroundings. With regard to commercial uses, there are important considerations that should be taken into account. The first is the expected costs and complexity of developing solutions in virtual or augmented reality. Virtual reality is more complex as the programmer has to create a complete background using graphic techniques along with all of the auditory and tactile senses, and this requires hard-to-find technical skills and a very long time in order to develop the final product. In terms of commercial uses, the health sector has used virtual reality to treat people suffering from phobias of various kinds, such as fear of crowds, heights and flying, where patients are immersed for the first time in such an environment to get used to it. Both virtual and augmented reality can help with phantom pain from an amputated organ such as a hand, as these technologies can trick the brain into believing that the organ is still present and the pain will decrease as a result. The other potential uses are limitless and the imagination can be run freely, but cost and complexity can be a problem, and progress can be paralyzed. However, these unique skills and expensive equipment will become more available and cheaper, and in time will be available and affordable for everyone. The actual life span of full-time employees in the metaverse world has practically increased. Instead of getting a job with a good salary after graduating from college, individuals can get rewarding career opportunities at a very early age, such as: Michael Syman, who got a job at “Meta” formerly known as “Facebook” at the age of 17, and is considered Tanmay Bakshi is the youngest programmer at IBM Watson at the age of 15, and many others. Not only will the workforce be able to start their career journey sooner, but they can also continue to work for longer than is the norm in the real world. People usually need to retire at the age of 65 or 75, depending on the country in which they reside. It goes without saying that their skills and cognitive abilities may decline as they approach retirement age, but these individuals, during their careers, acquire a wealth of knowledge, experience, and contacts that can be passed on to the next generation. In the world of ""Metaverse"", the elderly will be able to sit comfortably and conveniently in their homes, teaching, holding meetings, mediating deals, and much more. With the advent of the concept of non-redeemable tokens (NFTs), they will also be able to create unique, salable pieces of art. Which ultimately means endless opportunities. The world today is moving strongly towards the digitization of the global economy, as many developed countries have begun to prepare all the infrastructure requirements for this. As long as everyone seeks to use the digital economy, it has become an objective necessity and everyone has no choice but to do so. Hence the importance of the digital economy, especially for developing countries, which have the duty to plan from now on the preparation required for integrating into the world of the digital economy. The fact that investing in the digital economy will provide wide potential for economic growth and development, because digital technology has become an essential element in achieving sustainable development in all countries of the world.. The digital economy also depends on transforming the traditional forms of economic performance in business, trade and the movement of money into very fast patterns, which makes it achieve rapid growth in these areas due to its use of advanced information technology, which is developing day after day, such as the Internet and the global web. At the same time, the digital economy provides a competitive advantage for people Those who rely on their minds to develop programs and innovate what is new in order to obtain the highest level of economic performance for business, trade and others...

14,The role of small and medium enterprises on the country's economy,business," Any country, whether developing or developed, needs small and medium enterprises to participate in the growth of its economy through the service sector and assistance in the industrial sector as well. The importance of small and medium enterprises or companies appears in that they are the mainstay of the economy of any country, whether developed or developing, as they are distinguished by the following: •	It is characterized by its high ability to provide job opportunities. •	You need a relatively low capital to start the activity. •	It is characterized by its ability to employ semi-skilled and unskilled labor. •	It gives an opportunity for on-the-job training to raise capabilities and skills. •	The percentage of risk is lower compared to the major companies. •	Contribute to improving productivity, generating and increasing income. Many actors in some countries, governments and investors aim to revive the economy and raise job opportunities in their country by searching for opportunities to invest in businesses, reduce unemployment, and provide aid to modern sectors such as the renewable energy and technology sector. On the other hand, most of the projects that receive focus from investors, either by the public sector or the private sector, are often managed by an integrated management team or require large investments. What also distinguishes it are the high costs associated with launching the project such as large machinery and expensive research. It does not mean that a project of this size cannot be built, but it requires you to work in a serious way from preparing the plan to work in detail and based on accurate and correct information; In order for the contributors to know that you have done all your duties in terms of studies so that there is an awareness of all aspects of the subject. You should also define a strategy to convince the investor to help you build the project. Small projects are a reflection of the performance of the elements of comprehensive development, so that the researcher points out, in light of his findings, the necessity of determining the required role for small projects. 260 thousand, working in all economic activities, and that 97% of these companies / establishments, no matter how different the criteria, are classified as small and medium enterprises, whether the criteria are legal or the criteria of size in relation to capital and the number of workers and so on, to end up with the fact that 97% Among the projects or companies operating in the country are small and medium enterprises. The study leaves these digital data, to indicate the role of small projects in social development, so it mentions them: •	The successful implementation of the idea of self-employment, by a family member, led to everyone's solidarity and the restoration of family cohesion in many families, through women's projects at home, home licenses, or natural projects. •	Many young people considered establishing a small project an actual alternative to not having a job in the government sector, as the study here indicates that unemployment is a social problem resulting from economic conditions, and not an economic problem. Small projects established by women have led to changing the society’s view and its interaction with its ambitions and adoption, whether at the family or state level, such as the establishment of businesswomen’s councils and joint-stock companies for the advancement and development of women, and their participation in the boards of directors of major companies and institutions. The positive results of self-employment were reflected in pushing and encouraging children to invest in talents and turn them into an economic activity, especially the women who took up designs for clothing or decoration projects. The innovation of small projects led to an increase in the development of human capabilities. Small projects play an important role in investing the educational and mental skills of university graduates, by transforming this knowledge into projects related to these practical and academic knowledge. The role that these projects play in facing local difficulties, especially at a time when major companies reduce their business, can be offset by an increase in the activity of national small and medium companies, through compensation through the provision of alternative services or products, given that national small and medium companies are Which can continue, as their options are limited to staying in their market, unlike foreign companies that constantly keep the option of moving to other markets, or returning to their homelands from which they came. These projects are a major factor in achieving economic stability, providing imports that replace foreign imports, and producing products aimed at export to foreign markets, and do not require great efforts and expenditures from governments to provide infrastructure, and they exploit and manage the resources available in the local environment well, as they are any projects Small scale is a distinctive method of redistributing income among members of the community."
15,"Launching a New Brand: No Guts, No Glory",business," They say that creating a new brand and launching a new product is not for the faint of heart. I found that out over the last couple of months. You can’t help but have some personal skin in the game. My reputation on the line. Months of strategy sessions, market research, logo, product design and sleepless nights should all, hopefully, result in a meaningful brand and a financially successful business. The months of comprehensive research didn’t happen. Just good old seat of your pants marketing- generally a recipe for failure. Yet, within 45 days, we had a strong brand and product. We’ve had nothing but positive feedback and some sales. I can’t remember a time that I had so much fun and worked so hard. Our little marketing team had a success on our hands. Over the next few weeks, I will be sharing our story of creating a new brand and product offering. I’ll cover everything from brand development to post launch. I'll share all our successes, the trip-ups, dirty secrets, and fumbles during the launch. I haven't worked for an agency nor have had any formal branding education. This isn’t a comprehensive list of steps for a successful brand. This is more of a story of a marketing generalist being asked to add “branding expert” to his long list of other competencies. It’s worth a read if you do any sort of branding or like to watch other people cry. It could be worth a laugh. I am the Marketing Manager for two multi-location moving companies. My responsibilities include marketing strategy, lead development, sales support, SEO, PPC, website design and graphics. That was what was listed on the job description. As with all small to midsize companies, the actual list of responsibilities is just a bit longer. Oh, and brand development wasn’t on the list. I certainly didn’t do this project alone. We have a small marketing team of very talented individuals, Rob Schmidt, the VP of Sales and Marketing and Ashley Towne, our Marketing Administrator. When Ashley joined our team a few months ago, she had no idea of the important role she would play. We were all in the boat together. So, here is how it all happened. “By the way, we are going to start a new business venture,” shared the owner. I was on a very short vacation- my first since I had joined the company. I was told that an online meeting was being called by the owners at 2PM TODAY and that I was encouraged to mandatorily attend. I guess that made it a working vacation. So much for a little beach time. During the call, it was announced that the owner had decided to purchase over 150 new containers for mobile storage use. Wow. Didn’t see that coming. It was discussed that over the next week we would be meeting in person to develop a strategy. Originally, it was suggested that we would name the company after one of the other well-known companies under common ownership. As a Marketing Manager, I of course, was salivating at the opportunity to create a new “lasting and memorable brand.” Maybe I was doing a little kingdom building too. And clearly, I was jumping in over my head. Most of the competitors in the market, including the market leading national brand, have fairly nondescript (nice way to say boring) names and visual components. Maybe we had an opportunity? Unfortunately, the top competitor is so popular and successful that their name has become synonymous with the industry as a whole-- sort of like Kleenex in the facial tissue industry. Does anyone say, ""hand me a facial tissue?"" When a whole product industry gets referred to by a brand, you know you have some tough competition. In the executive meeting, the venture was discussed. My boss, Rob, the VP of Sales and Marketing, brought up to ownership our proposed concept called “Jump Box”. There was a moment of silence. At that point, Rob gulped and thought about updating his resume. Then the owner said, “Hmm, we haven’t thought of going that direction.” Rob breathed again. Our strategy was to create a stand-alone brand concept having no benefit of the initial well-established affiliated brand name being initially considered. We wanted to create a new brand that would resonate with our target demographic. We wanted a fresh brand, not stodgy, but catchy and memorable. The executive committee liked it. Jump Box. Catchy name. An initial concept of the brand logo was presented, and they even liked it more. I’d like to say that months of research had gone into the development of the name. In fact, it was literally one of those “thinking in the shower” moments. No research, no focus groups, no agency think tank. The first things I did after coming up with the name was to: ·      Check to see if the domain was available ·      Checked the USPTO (United State Patent and Trademark Office) to see if there was a trademark on the name ·      Discuss it with one of my daughters, Betsy, who is a branding expert for a large marketing firm ·      Dry off from the shower Being over 60 years old, I made a very adult decision to not run it by my parents for their permission and approval.  Not that they could even navigate to the web address, Jumpboxmove.com (shameless promotion). Next Week: The Kangaroo #digitalmarketing #brandingstories #storagesolutions #mobilestorage #humor"

17,The 3 Most Neglected Factors in Affiliate Marketing Success,business," The 3 Most Neglected Factors in Affiliate Marketing Success There’s no shortage of affiliate marketing success blueprints out there. These blueprints supposedly walk you through all the steps you need to achieve success with your affiliate marketing business. They give you all sorts of technical information. Many come with great-looking pictures and charts. So far so good right? The problem is a lot of those resources simply hype you up and get you all excited about affiliate marketing, but at the end of the day, they leave you hanging. How come? Well, it’s one thing to figure out what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. As important as these pieces of information may be, ultimately if you don’t know why you should be doing things, you will fail. It’s only a matter of time. Failure will get the better of you sooner rather than later. This is why it’s really important to understand the power of purpose as reflected by the three factors I’m going to talk about below. Ignore these and you should not be surprised if your affiliate marketing business doesn’t get the results that you had hoped for. In fact, don’t be too shocked if it doesn’t get any results at all. It may well turn out that you have put together an affiliate marketing business that lacks the three most important ingredients for ultimate success. Mindset The most important factor for affiliate marketing success is the right mindset. You have to attack it with the right attitude. You can’t just believe the hype. You can’t just be excited about the prospect of making money. You have to do something more. You have to approach it with a mindset of a student because if you were to look at it from the perspective of somebody who is mining for gold, a string of disappointment would be enough to derail you. Failing to see that money materialize would be enough to discourage you and you end up quitting. When you allow yourself to approach your business like a student, it will be very hard to shake you off. You’re always on the lookout for learning. This way even if you fail, or if you meet with one challenge after another, you still feel positive. You still keep at it-- to keep experimenting until you overcome. Think like a student, not a gold prospector. Return on effort At some point in the game, you have to know when to fold your cards. You have to know when to call it quits. If it turns out that you’re putting too much time and effort into your business even though it’s making money, it may not be worth it. You have to be completely honest with yourself regarding the return on effort threshold, which you will not compromise on. If you don’t get that return, get ready to sell your website or shut it down. Focus on something else that will earn you more money. Time is your most important asset and you’re wasting your time and you’re wasting a tremendous amount of opportunity cost sticking to something that has a low return on effort. Content strategy Even if you’re just promoting a link, you still have to have a content strategy. The strategy must make sense. The strategy must deliver value to the people you are trying to turn into your customers. If you don’t have this kind of value-based strategy, or if you have absolutely no content strategy at all, then it’s only a matter of time until you fail. Maybe you make a few sales here and there but that is still a failure. Focus on having a solid content strategy right out of the gate. Keep the three neglected factors above in mind if you take your affiliate marketing business’ success seriously. These three factors will take you to where you need to go. You have to focus on them. You need to make sure that they guide you. Thank you!"
18,Types of custom soap boxes,business," Soap boxes are the ideal packaging for a variety of items. If you're planning to use them for gifting purposes, you'll need to choose a box with a silver or gold substrate to make them upscale. This will prevent them from effervescence and preserve their look. There are many types of soapboxes to choose from, including custom ones and recyclable versions. Read on to learn more about these options. Custom Soap Boxes When it comes to selling soaps, nothing shows your brand image like custom soap boxes. This type of packaging allows you to customize the design and create an unforgettable packaging to showcase your products. There are two basic methods of printing on custom soap boxes: silk screening and inkjet printing. Silkscreen printing is best for small business owners, as it is cost-effective and allows for full customization. Silkscreen printing requires a high-quality, glossy paper with a good finish, which will last longer than plain paper. If you have a handmade soap that is colorful and has a pleasant scent and texture, you can opt for a sleeve-style box. This type of packaging will let your customers smell and see the soap, which can affect the quality of the product. Besides being eco-friendly, soap boxes come in a variety of shapes and colors. To spice up the appearance of your soap packaging, you can choose to have different cutout shapes. While you can also choose to have your box printed with your own design, you should always consider your product's size and weight before ordering a custom box. The custom box should be large enough to fit the soap comfortably. It should also have a window so that customers can see the soap as they wash their hands. Custom packaging will also increase the visibility of your product and create a brand name. If you're considering using a custom soap box for your product, it's always best to choose a high-quality box, and we're sure to meet your requirements! Customized Soap Boxes with Silver Substrate The window in a soap box allows the customer to view the soap inside. It is the perfect way to advertise your brand and can be used for many purposes. These boxes are typically made of cardboard and can be customized to have a window or text information. They can also be in any shape or size and feature a glossy finish. A window also allows for easy identification of the soap's color. These boxes are also great for gifting purposes. The custom soap box is also a great space to print a logo, tagline, or other promotional material. Branding your products with your logo or other identifying information is a simple, effective way to increase your revenue and customer satisfaction. It is also an eye-catching, cost-effective way to market your business. As long as your company's packaging is eye-catching and appealing, it will attract customers and increase sales. The box is made of double or single-layered cardboard, which prevents the product from being damaged during transport. It is also made of recycled materials. This helps your product protect from the elements during transit and increases its market value. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the box can be easily folded to fit any size. This makes it easy for customers to store your soap. You don't have to wait for a large shipment of soap to get it. Recyclable Soap Boxes Recyclable soap boxes are a great way to present your products and promote your brand. The box can be customized with a customized label, and can be used for gifting purposes, too. In addition to the packaging material, you can also choose a design for your logo and other helpful information. If you want to attract more customers, choose an appealing design, and don't forget to include a call to action or other promotional message. Recyclable soap boxes are an excellent option for those who are concerned about the environment. They reduce packaging costs while keeping the environment clean. This type of packaging is also easy to recycle. There are many options to choose from, and it's important to consider the trends of your market. Most soap boxes are packaged in Kraft paper, which is environmentally friendly and doesn't add much weight to the product. Because soap boxes are lightweight, you can save on shipping costs by buying in bulk. When considering the benefits of custom-printed recycled soap boxes, keep in mind that you can choose a design that fits your brand image perfectly. These eco-friendly boxes are not only eco-friendly, but they don't contribute to land-debris. They will also promote your brand and encourage customers to shop at your store. As you can see, these boxes are perfect for soaps and other similar items. Moreover, custom-printed boxes are a good way to promote your brand."
19,7 Creative Content Marketing Examples to Inspire Excellence,business," To stay ahead of the curve in creative content marketing, you need to be aware of the latest trends and strategies. 2022 has already seen some incredible examples of creative content campaigns, and 2023 is sure to bring some new and exciting changes to the field. If you’re a publisher, brand, or marketer it’s crucial to stay well-informed and at the top of your game. You can rest assured that your competition most assuredly will be. Listen, we know that developing new and exciting content ideas can be tough day after day, but luckily, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of creative content marketing examples out there to help get your juices flowing. And, if you need just a little more inspiration, take a look at some of the best brands across a broad range of industries  – but we’ll get to that in a moment. First, we want to discuss some of the best strategies, tactics, and trends that are likely to impact the coming year. Then we’ll get to some rocking examples. Why is Creative Content Marketing Important? If you’re reading this, you likely recognize that creative content is a powerful way to connect with your audience and should be an essential part of your marketing strategy. But, here’s the thing: The content you produce and the overall tone of your messaging are vital in establishing trust with readers, viewers, and potential customers. They want to feel like they’re in good hands, and that starts with the content you create. With that said, there’s a motive that goes beyond connecting with your audience. Right? After all, why do you want to connect with them in the first place? It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in; isn’t at least one of the primary goals to make a profit? (It’s pretty challenging to stay in business if you don’t.) And, the right content can advance that bottom line goal. For instance, it can: Bring people to your website Engage customers by offering value Generate leads Move people through the customer journey Drive sales Provide post-sale care So, the right content published at the right time provides heaps of benefits directly related to making money. Many executives look at their marketing people and demand to know the ROI for a content marketing campaign. It makes you wonder how they got a job as an executive in the first place. Seriously. Because the answer is so glaringly obvious. As Robert Rose over at the Content Marketing Institute has said, “ROI is the wrong metric for campaign-oriented marketing and advertising,” and, “You should measure content marketing as an asset to the business.” You can create a piece of content, and depending on its purpose in the stages of the buyer’s journey, it can inform and persuade for as long as the content is publicly available. You could have leads being funneled to your sales department in perpetuity. That’s a pretty high ROI over time wouldn’t you agree? Bottom line: creative content production is a strategic approach that focuses on creating and distributing consistent, relevant, and valuable content to draw in and retain a clearly-defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. Evergreen Content Marketing Strategies Standing out in a competitive content market is tough, but it’s not impossible. If you can produce genuinely helpful and different content, you’ll be well on your way to success. Remember, your business is unique, and so is your audience. One of the best things you can do is capitalize on that fact. With that said, the following strategies are basic, but they’re also evergreen. In other words, they won’t get old with the passing of time. Focus on Quality over Quantity Here’s the fact of the matter: The web is already packed with low-quality, fluff content. If you want your target audience to read your materials, your message to be heard, and for your company to succeed, you need to rise above the noise and produce beneficial and interesting content. Think about it this way: Would you rather have 100,000 pageviews from unengaged readers or 1000 pageviews from engaged readers? The answer should be obvious. It’s better to have fewer engaged readers than many unengaged ones. Create Evergreen Content Evergreen content is a type of content that stays interesting and relevant long after it’s been published. It doesn’t go out of style or become outdated like current events, news, or pop culture. For example, an article about the top 12 fashion trends for 2020 would not be considered evergreen because those trends will eventually go out of style. However, an article about How to Clean, Care For, and Maintain a Black Velvet Dress would be considered evergreen because the advice in the article will remain relevant even as fashion trends come and go. Other reasons creating evergreen content is essential: It can help you attract new readers long after you publish it. For example, someone might stumble across your article about black velvet dresses while searching for information on Google months or even years after you originally posted it online If your article is well-written and provides helpful information, that reader may become a loyal follower of your blog Evergreen content can also help you build credibility and establish yourself as an expert in your industry Repurpose and Republish Your Content Repurposing and republishing your content help improve your organic reach and lead to more traffic and engagement from your target audience. Plus, by repurposing and republishing your content, you’re effectively giving yourself a second chance to make a first impression with potential customers or clients. Who doesn’t want that? Here are some creative ways you can repurpose and republish your content: Create an infographic from a blog post Convert a blog post into a video or podcast episode Turn a series of blog posts into an eBook or Share your content on other content creator’s platforms and allow them to share on yours (provided the themes, values, and voice are similar) Creative Content Marketing Tactics Part of attracting your audience is keeping them interested in what you have to say long enough to arrive at the points you want them to think about and remember. There are a few tactics you can use to ensure they do. One way to do this is to use cliffhangers. You can end a blog post, video, or podcast episode on a suspenseful note that will make your target audience want to come back for more. You can also use stories and personal anecdotes to connect with your audience on a deeper level and make them more likely to remember what you have to say. And using visuals such as images, infographics, and videos can help break up the text and add another layer of interest for your audience. But, here are a few more tactics to keep in mind. Use Humor to Your Advantage It’s not all about providing valuable and informative content to your customers – it’s also about keeping them happy. When they enjoy their experience on your website or reading your blog posts, they are more likely to react positively. Of course, there are moments when you may want to create some discomfort on the part of whoever is consuming your content. That’s particularly true when you’re trying to drive home pain points before you start future pacing them. (Future pacing shows the reader what life is like after they’ve purchased your fantastic thing, which eliminates their pain point.) In any case, you can use humor and fun to great effect. Think about the fact that some of the most memorable Superbowl commercials were also the funniest. Put Your Copywriting Skills to Work As much as possible, put skills typically used in direct response copywriting to use. You can do this even if your audience is another business. For instance, you can ensure that your headlines are on target, designed solely to get people to open your emails or articles. More importantly, though, writing headlines is a skill that you can use in other areas of marketing too. For example, let’s say you’re running a Facebook ad campaign. You’ll need to write a headline for your ad that will get people to stop scrolling and pay attention to what you have to say. There’s an excellent article on writing headlines from esteemed copywriter Dan Kennedy, entitled “Writing Headlines That Close In For The Kill… And Get It.” Definitely recommended reading. (In fact, any book by Dan Kennedy should be on your content marketer’s bookshelf.) Let Customers Take Over Your Content This next tactic isn’t for the faint of heart. However, it can be wildly effective when it comes to driving engagement. In essence, you give your most loyal audience base the chance to use your social media account as if it were their own. The caveat is that they have to talk about your products or services from their point of view. Neil Patel has talked about this tactic in a great article over on Forbes. Create Interactive Content Interactive content is any content that compels the reader to do something other than reading. That could be anything from taking a quiz to playing a game to watching a video. And, people love it. For example, 43% of consumers prefer interactive video to standard video. Moreover, 88% of marketers say interactive content helps brands differentiate themselves. So, if you’re not already using some form of interactive content in your content marketing strategy, now is the time to start. Take Advantage of Data-Driven Storytelling Data-driven storytelling uses data to back up specific points in an emotionally compelling story that resonates with your audience. People make decisions based on emotion and fact. It’s rare that someone makes a choice based on either alone. Stories backed by data can provide a lot of direction to your content in the customer’s mind. In fact, when you create a case study for your website, you can present it in the form of a story. When you can tell a story supported by quantifiable evidence, you are more likely to close a sale or convince someone to try out your product or service. Creative Content Marketing Trends Competition is challenging regardless of the industry. There are many companies out there vying for attention, and if you’re not keeping up with the latest trends, you’re going to fall behind. But more importantly, understanding the latest content marketing trends can help you better understand your audience and what they respond to. By staying on top of what’s resonating today, right now, this very moment, you can make sure that your content is always relevant. So what are major brands doing? What kind of lessons can you learn from their examples? We got in touch with three content and digital marketing influencers and professionals to get their take. The question posed was what the greatest examples of creative content marketing they’ve recently seen happen to be? Here’s what they said. Successful Brands Go The Extra Mile When it comes to outstanding examples of creative content marketing, Marcus Miller from BowlerHat said: “There are just so many, even very recently, but it depends to some extent what you class as content. This year already the teaser website for the Matrix Resurrections where you could take the red pill or the blue pill and got a unique teaser trailer each time was super cool. Last night, I went to see The Batman with my kids and at the very end, in place of a more traditional post-credit scene you get a question mark and then a URL flashes up briefly. The site then relays some more information, in the style of the Riddler from the movie and has a download with some film-related goodies in as a teaser for the inevitable sequel. Link: www.rataalada.com Obviously, for these big event movies, the teams have so much budget and can do some great stuff but even smaller businesses, if they are creative, can come up with world-class campaigns. I know GymShark asked for agency recommendations on LinkedIn last year. Obviously, that opened the doorway to hell and they got bombarded. One savvy agency called ORB did something a little better, they rolled up outside the GymShark offices with several digital advertising vans to get the attention of the GymShark marketing team. They then spun that into a content marketing campaign about their brand values which are built on the premise of Better. That was very cool to watch that play out. I work in the SEO and PPC industry and we are awash with (mostly dull) content marketing. However, I stumbled across this piece site that aggregates all the great learning resources out there into a learning SEO roadmap – very cool.  https://learningseo.io/ For the average small business, where we mostly do our work, being creative with your content often just means going that extra step. Write an article, but have a downloadable checklist as well. Just go the extra mile. That tends to be what we see working.” Super Examples of Creative Content Marketing Mark Schaefer, one of the world’s leading marketing futurists, keynote speakers, and the author of “Cumulative Advantage,” said, “There are so many amazing content concepts that it is hard to choose, but here are three favorites: The North Face “Question Madness” campaign takes UGC to meteoric heights. “Worlds Apart” by Heinekin shows you don’t have to be polarizing to take a stand. Everything being created by Glossier. Every skincare product they ship is content marketing because of how people interact and share their purchases.” Mark W. Schaefer, Executive Director, Schaefer Marketing Solutions (Remember how we talked about letting your audience “take over” your content marketing for a day? Glossier used “user generated content” to turn fans into micro-influencers who then spread the word about Glossier products online.) The Metaverse is Content Marketing’s Next Big Thing Metaverse marketing may be the future of most marketing efforts, and it’s essential to start preparing for it now. If you’re not acquainted with what the Metaverse is, consider what Wired had to say about it: “Mentally replace the phrase ‘the metaverse’ in a sentence with ‘cyberspace.’ Ninety percent of the time, the meaning won’t substantially change. That’s because the term doesn’t really refer to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad shift in how we interact with technology.” That could be the future of the internet, a video game, or some other virtual world created entirely in a futuristic neural net (Matrix-style). International speaker, author, and Time’s “man of action,” Glen Gilmore stated that: “The ‘Metaverse’ is a shift to a place that merges physical and digital. It is the next great challenge for content marketing. To succeed in the Metaverse, brands must literally join digital worlds or create such worlds where consumers can immerse themselves, ala avatars, in lifestyle, products, and services. Luxury brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Balenciaga are succeeding by partnering with platforms like Fortnight and Roblox to create experiences that celebrate community and brand awareness with the newest generation of consumers through virtual offerings."" Summary Content marketing as a whole is going to be an effective marketing method for the foreseeable future. Businesses that invest heavily in it will be building a firm foundation that they can use to scale for years to come. While striving for innovation, brands shouldn’t ignore the fundamentals. Evergreen strategies and tactics will continue to be effective. That’s even more true if companies are able to take inspiration from brands that are clearly crushing it in terms of their content marketing campaigns. At the same time, publishers, brands, and marketers need to be looking to the future and paying attention to clear trends such as a move toward making content interactive and gaining visibility within the developing Metaverse. Remember that the Metaverse is likely to offer a wealth of opportunities for marketers and advertisers to be experimental and disruptive in their approach. While there undoubtedly will be challenges to overcome (the very definition of the Metaverse remains in flux), the potential benefits make the concept and the technologies surrounding it well worth exploring."
20,A day in the life of an SEN teacher,business," Being a special education needs (SEN) teacher is an extremely rewarding career. Of course, it has its challenges, but being able to make a real difference in young people’s lives is fulfilling. An SEN teacher plays a vital role in helping children with special education needs get the most out of their education. What does a day as an SEN teacher look like, though? Continue reading to find out. Prepare for the day Special education needs teachers will usually arrive at school on or before 8am to give themselves a headstart on the day. This gives them the time and opportunity to prepare for the day ahead. This includes lesson planning, printing off the activities for the day, and completing some administrative work, like responding to emails and completing paperwork. Teaching students with special education needs often requires different techniques and approaches to learning, so this time taken in the morning to complete preparation is vitally important. SEN teachers can either be a part of a school, or teach in a specialised school. In the mornings, after the teacher has done their preparation, there will often be a school briefing to make all staff aware of what’s planned for the day ahead. The children will then start to arrive, and this is where the SEN teachers will greet them with a positive attitude, ready to start the day in a good atmosphere. This is ideal for the students to set them up for a successful day at school. The school day In some schools, the children will have their breakfast after arrival, and then head to classrooms to start learning. Each school day, the typical subjects of English, maths, literacy and reading are taught to the students. SEN pupils will be given a tailored approach to help them understand as best as possible, giving them the best opportunity to learn alongside their peers. In a standard school setting, SEN students are placed in their usual classroom as much as possible to promote inclusion and to avoid feeling like they’re separate from their fellow classmates. As well as the day-to-day subjects that are taught to pupils of all needs, SEN students will sometimes be taught a personal development lesson like social skills or personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) studies. Art, history, and physical education (PE) are also included in their education, but not every day of the week. These will be staggered throughout the week around their normal studies. End of the day Once the school day is over, SEN teachers and other support staff can often undergo a debriefing session to discuss what happened during the day, what went well, what didn’t go well, and things that can be improved upon moving forward. This gives everyone a chance to review their performance and how best to approach things with SEN pupils in future. Once this has finished and before heading home, the SEN teacher will look over, review and mark work from the day and potentially get a headstart on the next day with some small preparation. Teachers have a lot of work to complete and will often take some home to finish in their free time, so their day can, on occasion, continue past the normal working hours. Fancy a career change? If you’re looking to make a career change and step into the teaching profession, then search for SEN teaching jobs today."

2,How To Have The Best Landing Page For Your Website,business," The  landing page of your website is extremely important. Quite often it’s the page that most visitors come to first.

Therefore, it makes sense to make sure your landing page is as well designed as it can be. There are a few key elements for a successful landing page. They each are important independently, but they work together to provide a unique and effective experience. Before you take a look at these key elements, however, it’s important to answer a question first. Landing Page Goals Your landing page needs to have a goal – an objective. What do you want visitors to do? What action do you want them to take? There are many possibilities. You may want them to: Dig deeper and explore your website Click through to a sales page Opt-in Once you know what you want visitors to do, then you can make sure your landing page supports that goal. Now you’ll use the seven key elements. They include: Images – The images you choose on your landing page are important. You want them to support the overall goal. Images, in the form of graphics and photos, can quickly overwhelm a landing page and become a distraction. If you choose to use images, and they really can enhance a landing page, make sure they support your goal. Make sure they adequately represent your brand, too. A common image to use might be your photo. This helps connect the reader to you. It helps brand your business and build a relationship. Headline – Your headline is often the very first thing a visitor will see. If it doesn’t grab their attention, then it’s not doing its job. However, in addition to grabbing their attention, it also must support your page’s purpose. Take time to craft a headline. This is also an important element to test and track. Create two landing pages with two different headlines. Determine which headline is better at helping you accomplish your goal for the page. Emotions – Emotions are what people use to make buying decisions. They’re incredibly important if you’re trying to motivate any action. You can tap into your visitors’ emotions with images and words. Navigation – Make sure that your visitor not only knows what they’re supposed to do, but also that they can quickly figure out how to do it. If you want people to dig deeper into your website, then make sure your buttons and call to action support that. If they cannot figure out how to get to a page that interests them, they’re going to leave. Proof – You might notice that many of the elements of a successful landing page are also sales copy elements. This is because you are trying to motivate an action. Your landing page has a purpose. Proof can be demonstrated by: Awards Testimonials Endorsements Organization membership Facts and statistics The proof you use depends on your goal.

Call to action – A call to action is required for every successful landing page. It’s the only way your readers know what they’re supposed to do next. Test it and track it for success. Opt-in form – Finally, if your goal is to motivate an opt-in, then you must have an opt-in form on your landing page. In fact, everything on that page needs to support that goal. Your landing page is perhaps the most important page on your website. Make sure the elements on your page support your goals and your success. Test and track various elements until you get the best results. Once you’ve built your landing page, ask yourself the following questions to ensure that they are going work effectively: A Captivating Landing Page- Does your landing page capture attention? Ideally it will have a compelling headline followed by keyword-targeted content that supports the purpose of the landing page. Additionally, your landing page shouldn’t be distracting. Everything on that page needs to support the purpose of the page. The Purpose of Your Landing Page- Different landing pages have different purposes. If you have a theme-based website for example, then your page’s purpose may be to motivate visitors to dig deeper. You want them to get to the pages where your affiliate and PPC links are so you can earn money. You may want visitors to sign up for your opt-in form. If so, then make sure that’s the action your landing page copy and graphics support. If it is designed to motivate a sale, then you want the page to sell a product or a service. Everything on the page needs to support that action. You don’t want to distract with opt-in forms or content links. If your landing page is struggling, take a look at it and see if the entire page supports your purpose for the page. If not, rework it. Call To Action On Your Landing Page- Regardless of your purpose, your landing page needs a call to action. Visitors need to be guided to what to do next. If this guidance is missing, they may likely click away. Support your page’s purpose with a compelling call to action. If you want them to sign up for your opt-in list, then ask them to do so. If you want them to dig deeper and read your content and information, then tell them to click through. If you want to make a sale, provide a number of opportunities for them to make that decision and take action. Test and Track- Test and track various elements to optimize your landing page to fit its purpose. Test which headline works best. Test which call to action works best.

3,The Best Questions to Ask Your Security Consultant,business," When looking to create the best security solutions for your company, you will want to look to your security consultant for assistance. You can do to make it less anxiety-inducing to have a list of questions that you can ask them ahead of time. This way, you’re taking charge, getting the information you need. Here are some questions you can ask a security consultant to ensure you have the best security team possible. What security services do I need? When looking to find the best security solutions possible, you should start with an overall environment audit. You can present all of the information to the security consultant to give them the best picture possible. When asking about a security solution, you have to understand what you’re asking for. Do you need to try penetration testing? Or are the users giving you issues, not the technology you’ve acquired? Research is an essential part of this process, giving you the best knowledge to aid in your meeting with the consultant. What is my security response team’s action plan? An essential part of any security consulting team is to have an overall incident response plan that handles breaches bugs in the system, even just answering questions when running into issues. A security response team should be able to handle a lot of chaos. If something goes sideways, you’re going to want a response team that can stay calm, cool, and collected as they handle the problem without giving away sensitive information. Who can I go to that can help me translate the technical jargon? Let’s face it– you’re not going to know everything. That’s why you’re hiring a security consultant in the first place. You can make sure that you have a baseline of knowledge in the technical field so that you can translate some of the jargon. When bringing in people who have experience in the technical field, you’re not relying 100% on the people you’re hiring. Also, it will help the security team immensely if you have a baseline knowledge of how the technology works. However, if you’re strapped for time, you can bring a security consultant to help have the tougher to learn technical conversations. That way, you know that you’re getting the most out of the security that you have for your business."
4,6 Resources for Leadership Development,business," Leadership development is invaluable whether you’re a seasoned leader or an aspiring young professional. Even for professionals who never work in a management role, taking time to foster leadership skills affects how they work with colleagues and approach their work. It is always worth it to invest in continuing education and personal development. Below are six resources for developing practical leadership skills. Business Schools Especially for professionals who don’t have degrees in business, taking some courses at a business school can be a great way to learn professional leadership skills. In addition to learning valuable business information, business school is a great way to expand a professional network and connect with helpful contacts. Plenty of excellent business schools offer online courses, so researching a few options and choosing relevant courses can be a perfect opportunity for leadership development. Mentors and Coaches If the cost of business classes is a prohibitive factor, there are plenty of free options, including finding a business mentor. Especially for young professionals, connecting with a more experienced colleague in a mentorship context can offer invaluable advice and feedback. For professionals who want a more structured experience, professional business coaches are available for hire that will provide consulting and advising services. Books and Podcasts One of the best opportunities for professional leadership development is through books and podcasts. There are books and podcasts produced by professionals from almost every industry, offering personal insight based on experience. It can be easy to get stuck only reading or listening to content directly related to your industry or business. Still, one of the best ways to expand leadership skills is to seek out information from various sources. Expand your knowledge by picking up a book on something you know next to nothing about, or listen to a podcast about mental health to learn how best to support your team’s wellbeing! Feedback This can be an intimidating way to learn, but soliciting feedback from team members can be an excellent way to identify weaknesses and decide what skills to focus on. However, this technique is only effective if team members feel comfortable sharing constructive feedback. It can be helpful to set up a feedback system in which people can remain completely anonymous so no one is afraid of possible repercussions for offering negative feedback. Online Resources In addition to the previously mentioned resources, fantastic leadership development resources are abundant online! There are ways to explore almost any professional skill, from free education and certification platforms like HubSpot Academy to public speaking resources like Speaking.io. Whatever skills you might want to develop, there are likely resources online to help you get started."
5,The Role of Equity Research,business," Equity research is a powerful tool for investors. Investment firms employ analysts to perform in-depth research and analysis on companies, producing reports that explain current trends and projected performance. While smaller firms may only staff a couple of analysts to target specific industries, large firms can have thousands of analysts covering a wide range of companies and industries. These analysts are usually academics, former executives, or people with a long history in their industry. In the following sections, learn about the role equity research plays in guiding investment decisions. Helps Investors Make Informed Investments With so many businesses looking for investors and constantly changing market conditions, investors want to be careful about where they invest their money. Equity research provides investors with detailed information to help them make informed investments. Big investors don’t usually have time to dig deep into every single company they invest in–they rely on these reports to help inform their decisions, calculate risks, and hopefully get a good return on their investments. Offers Professional and Objective Analyses of Investment Potential Research reports generally disclose any connections with the company in question and the analyst preparing it, so investors will know how biased the report might be. Since analysts are experts in their field and have the time and resources to dive deep into these companies, investors can usually trust their analysis. Analysts compose these reports with current market conditions in mind, giving more optimistic projections to businesses operating in hot markets. Makes Recommendations on Whether to Buy, Sell or Hold Stock Equity research reports offer an overview of past and projected performance and make direct recommendations as to what to do with the company’s stock. If they’re projecting high growth, the analyst might recommend buying stock, whereas they might recommend selling if the industry is on a downward trend. Whether or not investors decide to follow these recommendations is up to them, and analysts can never guarantee their predictions, but they offer a great starting point. Helps Generate Business Valuation Another crucial role of equity research is providing business valuations. These valuations can be run on a couple of different models but usually either represent a company or asset’s inherent value or that value relative to another company or asset. These valuations are helpful for investors who need to know the worth of their investments and the businesses themselves."
6,Why Do Contractors Need Insurance Coverage?,business," As adolescents enter adulthood, they begin to realize the enormous need for insurance. Not only does insurance apply to your car, home, health, and overall life, but there are various legal requirements for insurance across different industries. General liability insurance is just as much a necessity for contractors as it is for any other individual, as it can help protect against lawsuits and other sensitive issues found in a contract. This type of insurance protects contractors from third-party claims of bodily injury or property damage that came as a result of conducting business. Given the physical nature of the job, general liability insurance is an essential aspect of running such a business. What Does General Liability Insurance Include? When picking a policy, it is recommended to read the fine print and choose the option that will best guard your company and employees against any potential damage. General liability insurance typically includes coverage for bodily injuries, which can range from minor to major. Let’s say a customer trips and breaks a toe at a job site. Without proper insurance, they could decide to sue you, making you solely responsible for their medical and rehabilitation costs. However, general liability insurance does not protect the company from claims made by their employees, which is why most experts recommend worker’s compensation insurance on top of this. Property damage is also another aspect of general liability insurance, which would protect your company from having to cover the cost of any damage done to possessions belonging to the customer. General liability insurance also contributes to personal and advertising injury, usually including slander and related issues. As an extra add-on to this insurance, your company can also include coverage for equipment damage, which would help cover replacement fees if your work-related equipment falls victim to any damages or thievery. This option is very appealing to various contractors who rely on their equipment to get the job done. If there were to be any damages incurred to their tools, they could be looking at a deep financial setback. A little lesser known in the contracting industry is data breach coverage. This add-on to general liability insurance can help cover costs associated with any detrimental results of a data breach. What Other Insurance Coverage Should Contractors Use? Although general liability insurance covers a broad range of possible issues, there are some other insurance coverage options that contractors should obtain. Worker’s compensation insurance, as mentioned earlier, is wise protection to have. However, contractors should also look into commercial property insurance, professional liability insurance, commercial auto insurance, builder’s risk insurance and product liability insurance. Although insurance costs can add up, it is wise for contractors to take advantage of these protective measures in order to avoid higher costs associated with being sued or paying out of pocket for damages or injuries.

DEGI-EREMIENYO. Felicity Enyinnia Legal Associate (Osborne Law Practice) INTRODUCTION A person’s name is his identity. Names are generally given to people from birth. However, bearing a particular name is not immutable. It is subject to change by occurrence of certain event(s). For instance, it is the practice in Nigeria and in most commonwealth countries for women to change their surnames to that of their husbands upon marriage. There may be instances where husbands change their names to that of their wives. Some people also change their names when they experience a change in their faith. Some change their names upon the discovery of the true state of their paternity, upon divorce, upon a decree of jactitation of marriage or by mere adoption. In some cases, people change their names for no reason at all. In the case of NMCN vs. Adesina , the Court of Appeal affirmed the right of the Respondent to change her name as she pleases, when it held as follows: “The Appellant never challenged the deposition that her change of name was consequent upon becoming a Christian…it is pursuant to her constitutional right of freedom to change her religious belief that the Respondent became a Christian with the consequent change of name,.. Names are meant not only to identity. In Nigeria, names are borne for a variety of reasons some for ethnic, religious reasons as well as circumstances of birth. In the instant case where the reasons advanced for the change of the names are religious and marital, the names are interwoven with the fundamental rights to practice religion of her choice and not to be discriminated against on that account.. Section 42 (1) of the 1999 Constitution.” From the above decision, it is settled beyond any disputation that a Nigerian is at liberty to change his/her name as he/she pleases. Also, change of name is not a contemporary phenomenon. In the book of Genesis 17:5, God changed Abram’s name to Abraham. Saul’s name was also changed to Paul (Romans 13:9). The foregoing shows that change of name is not a recent phenomenon but has been the practice from time immemorial. Name is to identity as air is to life. Names are so important that the re-arrangement of it may disentitle a person of the benefit of it. For instance, if the official arrangement of my name is in this sequence: Okoro, Tessy Muna, the re-arrangement of my name to Tessy Muna Okoro in another document may create an insinuation of a different person in the mind of the receiver of that document. The Supreme Court, in the case of Esenowo vs. Ukpong , while elucidating on the importance of order in which names are written held to wit: “There is a world of difference between “J.E. Esenowo” and “E.J. Esenowo” for the purpose of registering a name in a professional register sanctioned by law. A person cannot at random re-arrange his initials or the order in which his names are written for the purpose of registering a name in a professional register sanctioned by law.” To this effect, for an individual to properly lay claim to a name as his identity, he must proffer, not just proof of usage of the name but that, the name is arranged in the manner as contained in the official document allocating the said name to him. CHANGE OF NAME: THE EXTANT POSITION IN NIGERIA Having given the above background with respect to the jurisprudence of names in Nigeria, it is now important to state that the purpose of this write-up is to examine the issues arising from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of P.D.P. vs. Degi-Eremienyo , on the procedural steps and implications of change of name in Nigeria. In that case,  the Appellants, pursuant to Section 31 (5) of the Electoral Act, 2010, commenced an action at the Federal High Court, claiming that the information supplied by the 1st Respondent in INEC Form CF001 was false, and prayed the Court to disqualify the 1st Respondent (consequently, the 2nd Respondent) from contesting in the Bayelsa State Gubernatorial Election. The Appellants predicated their action on the fact that, in his sworn INEC Form CF001, the 1st Respondent attached several educational certificates containing various names other than his name.  To reconcile the nuances in the names contained in the several educational certificates, the 1st Respondent deposed to sworn affidavits of ‘correction and confirmation of name’, ‘regularisation of name’ and ‘addition of name’. However, the names contained in the said sworn affidavits were at variance, and as such, not sufficient to show that the 1st Respondent is the holder of the educational certificates which he claimed to have obtained from different educational institutions.  It was on the basis of the irreconcilable differences in the educational certificates vis-à-vis the 1st Respondent’s name and those contained in the sworn affidavits that, the Appellants moved the Court to invoke the provisions of Section 31 (5) of the Electoral Act, and declare that the 1st Respondent gave false information, by the fact of his multiplicity of names, to INEC. In its decision, the trial court held that, the 1st Respondent gave false information in his INEC FORM CF001, and accordingly, disqualified the 1st Respondent from contesting in the election. Peeved, the Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was allowed and the decision of the trial court was set aside. Aggrieved by the decision of the Court of Appeal, the Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, affirming the decision of the trial Court held thus: The trial court also correctly stated the procedure for regularisation and correction. Its statement at pages 575 and 576 “that affidavit of change, correction and confirmation of name has to be by deed poll and not mere deposition.” By extension, the Supreme Court further held: “In the instant case, the trial court was right that it is only by a Deed Poll, and not by mere deposition, that a change in a name on an official certificate can be effected and further that since the procedure necessarily affects official record and archives of the nation, it is after the Deed Poll that the deponent approaches the Nigerian Civil Registry to have the change published in the official gazette.” Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in the instant case, it has been the procedure for any person intending to have a change of his name to simply depose to an Affidavit of Change of Name, before any of the designated authorities, and thereafter, cause an advertorial of the change of name to be placed in a National Newspaper of wide circulation. In this case, where an Affidavit of Change of Name is properly deposed to, presentation of the said affidavit, simpliciter, suffices as prove of change of name. However, the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the referenced case has set out the legal and acceptable procedure for change of name in Nigeria. Therefore, in the light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the above referred case, the recognised procedure for change, correction and confirmation of name in Nigeria is, by Deed Poll, properly executed by the party; thereafter, the party is expected to lodge the Deed Poll with the Nigerian Civil Registry, a department of the National Population Commission (presumably), to have the change of name published in the official gazette. According to Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Deed Poll is a legal document made and executed by only one party. A deed poll, strictly speaking, is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. Therefore, a Deed Poll of Change of Name is a legal document whereby the party executing same expresses an intention to relinquish his old name and use a new name for all purposes. A Deed Poll of Change of Name is binding on the party upon execution. The outcome of the decision of the Supreme Court in the reference case is that, Affidavit of Change of Name is no longer a recognised instrument for change of name in Nigeria. To this end, persons who have hitherto this judgment, purportedly changed their names by Affidavit of change of Name are advised to, in line with the Court’s decision, execute a Deed Poll and thereafter, lodge same at Nigerian Civil Registry for publication in the official gazette. This is to regularize the purported change of name and to prevent eventualities that may surface to deprive one from taking benefit of rights accruing to him in his name. The reasoning of the Supreme Court that, executed Deeds of Change of Name should be lodged at Nigerian Civil Registry for publication and record purpose is rational. The names of Nigerian citizens are kept as part of the official records of Nigeria, and where alterations are made in the registered names, such alternations shall, for the purpose of rectifying the records, be brought to the knowledge of Nigerian Civil Registry. In Nigeria, parents and/or guardians are mandated, pursuant to Section 7 of Births, Death, Etc (Compulsory Registration) Act, 1992, to register the birth of every child born in Nigeria with the registrar of births and deaths for the area in which the child was born by entering in a register kept for that area such particulars concerning the birth as may be prescribed………..”. The particulars required for the said registration of births are provided for in Regulation 9 of Births, Deaths, Marriage, Etc, Regulations made pursuant to Births, Deaths, Etc (Compulsory Registration) Act, 1992. It provides to wit: (1) A person required by law to register a birth shall provide the following information concerning the birth of the child, that is‐ (a) in respect of the child‐ (i) its name, if any;   (ii) its date of birth;   (iii) the place where the birth occurred; and   (iv) the type of birth; By the provisions of the Sections of the Act mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it is correct to say that the official name of every Nigerian citizen is that as registered in the register of births with the National Population Commission and contained in the birth certificate issued by the said Commission. On the strength of the forgoing, where the name the applicant seeks to change already forms a data of the Nigerian Civil Registry, he/she must register the Deed Poll with the authority so that the database of same may be rectified. Also, where the old name forms part of any public record in Nigeria, it is mandatory that the new name be published in the official gazette of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. THE PRACTICE IN ENGLAND In England and Wales, any adult person may legally change his or her name by simple assumption and usage so long as the intention in so doing is not fraudulent. Change by usage and reputation is the only way in which a name can be changed. There is no legal requirement or procedure which needs to be adopted, save in the case of children. Change of name by Deed Poll and by various other recognized methods are merely ways of evidencing and advertising the change. Where it is intended to change a child’s name by deed poll, the form differs depending on whether the child is aged under 16 or over 16. In the case of a child aged under 16, provided the parents agree, or one of them is dead or cannot be found, the change of name can be evidenced in the same way as by an adult executing a deed poll, but the deed is executed by the parent on behalf of the child. Where the child is aged over 16, the child may execute the deed on his or her own behalf subject to the consent of the child’s parents; or the deed may be executed by the parents on behalf of the child, but it must be endorsed with the Child’s consent. In England, there is no legal provision which requires that a deed poll of change of name must be enrolled. An application to enrol is entirely discretionary. The enrolment of a deed poll does not make the change of name any more legally effective than the execution of the deed itself. The purpose and advantages of enrolling the deed are that it provides certainty and safe custody; copies are available when required; and the change of name is advertised in the London Gazette. A change of name which has been evidenced by a deed poll may be changed again by another deed. Also, a deed which has been enrolled may be cancelled . MY POLEMICS While I commend the Supreme Court for enumerating the proper procedure for change, correction and regularization of name in Nigeria, it is my humble opinion that, the decision of the Supreme Court in P.D.P. vs. Degi-Eremienyo (supra) was not predicated on any known law in Nigeria. In its decision, the Supreme Court failed to proffer the extant law that provides that, change or correction of name must be effected by Deed Poll. Neither did the Court refer to the Enabling Act that establishes and empowers the Nigerian Civil Registry to oversee publication of change and correction of name in Nigeria. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the instant case, with respect, can best be described as scanty. Having gone through the decision, it is my candid opinion that, the decision of the Court herein is not justifiable in the light of the known practice in Nigeria. On a second thought, could it be that the Court in its decision imported the procedure as it is applicable in England and other common law countries? As above stated, Deed Poll is the most common formal method of change of name in England. The use of Deed Poll (Deed of Change of Name) as instrument of change of name originated from the United Kingdom in the case of Re Parrott, Cox vs. Parrott . Nigerian Courts are empowered by applicable laws and Rules of Court to import rules and/or procedures applicable in England and other common law countries where there are lacunas in our laws. English law forms a fraction of the Nigerian legal system, so, it is presumable that, the Supreme Court intended and imported the procedure as it is applicable in England in this case. Although, the Supreme Court was not explicit on this point, it is implicit from the circumstances of this case, and in the light of the applicable procedure in England. In conclusion, it is my opinion that, the Supreme Court as the highest court of the land, should strive to be explicit in its holdings, and cover all grounds in its decisions, leaving no room for confusion and speculations in the minds of the public."

10,Madhavi Doki on Tips for Running a Successful Online Business,business," As more businesses turn to an online landscape, whether out of obligation due to the pandemic or out of convenience, the business competition in the digital environment is becoming more competitive by the second. For many industries, the old way of doing business is getting left behind in the new era of digitized workspaces. As you compete to stay relevant in this environment, consider implementing some of the following tips for running a successful online business. Have Secure Measures for Storing Customer Information An aspect that can make or break your business is how you handle your customers’ data. In an online environment, your business will be susceptible to hackers and identity thieves. However, there are various measures you can adopt in order to protect your data and significantly reduce the chances of this happening. By implementing these measures, you’ll set yourself up for greater success and ensure your customers’ private information is kept safe. Use SEO to Your Advantage Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of using keywords and other tips and tricks to build your website’s authority and rank higher on search engines.

11,9 tips for digital transformation success,business," What is digital transformation? Transformation is a word that is thrown around a lot in the business world. However, digital transformation is not only about technology, it's also about changing culture and mindset. Transformation of this sort may involve big steps like changing your business model or launching a new product. It could also mean smaller steps like implementing project management software to improve your team's productivity. Regardless of the size or scope of your Digital Transformation efforts, you need to be able to define exactly what those efforts will look like for your organization. A common definition for digital transformation is “the change associated with the application of digital technology in all aspects of human society” (Wikipedia). Digital transformation starts with a plan. Digital transformation starts with a plan. It is important to first establish clear goals and timelines, as well as outline the project scope, risks and costs. It is also essential to develop the business case for digital transformation; this could be because your customers are asking for it, or because you need to drive operational efficiencies within your organisation. Once you have defined the scope of the project, it’s important to make sure that you have all of the necessary resources available. Put the right people in charge of the project. The project leader for any digital transformation effort must have a good understanding of how to use the technology and how it applies to your business. The best leaders will also be passionate about the subject and understand people well. It's not just about technology. It's not just about technology. If you want your Digital Transformation efforts to succeed, then you need to think beyond the technology itself. This means understanding how technology can improve business processes, learning how to talk to the business about technology and what it can do for them, finding the right technology for the business and convincing them to adopt new technology. This is all easier said than done, though! Revise your KPIs to fit your new digital way of life. Many companies are finding that their legacy KPIs are no longer adequate. New technologies and new organizational structures, even new business models, often require a fresh look at how they measure progress. These metrics need to be re-aligned with the company’s digital strategy and its new way of working. As part of the digital transformation process, we conducted a deep analysis of our existing metrics and KPIs in order to understand which ones were still useful in our new reality and which ones we should let go. We identified the following characteristics for our desired metrics: They must be actionable. Know what you are measuring and why you are measuring it. Ensure that your organization's key performance indicators (KPIs) align with your business goals, as well as being measurable, realistic and timely. Our work on this project provided some very clear insights into what metrics add value from a user perspective — such as transaction volume or the percentage of users who rate products they have purchased — versus those that might seem important but actually don't provide much insight into customer behavior or intent — like pageviews or unique visitors per month."" It's okay to pilot several different solutions. Now that you know what a solid digital transformation plan looks like, it's time to start acting on it. You've identified your goals and defined the parameters of your space. Now's the time to choose your solution—and make no mistake, this is a huge decision. But here's something to keep in mind: you may need to try out several solutions before you find one that works for your company. A trial period can be a valuable opportunity. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! If one of the vendors offers a free trial period or even a pilot program with an option for early termination, take advantage of both if you can get them. This is especially true if there are many competitors out there offering similar solutions and pricing models. In fact, consider piloting several different solutions simultaneously and see which performs best for your purposes—this will help give you an idea of how each feature can benefit or detract from meeting your goals and will also help train your staff on expectations once the solution goes live Automate as much as possible. Automation saves time. Instead of manually doing something, you could have a smart system do it for you. By automating whatever process possible, you can free up your employees' time to focus on more important things. Automation also reduces human error. It's not that people aren't capable of performing certain tasks correctly; sometimes they're just too busy and make mistakes under pressure or in a hurry. When processes are automated, they are more consistent. Manual processes rely on people to get things done, but the way each person does the same task can vary greatly—sometimes for the worse. You'll be able to scale up your business when needed. If your business is growing at a rapid pace and your processes aren't automated, good luck keeping up! You need automation if you want to grow without having to take on new team members as quickly as you’re bringing in customers.*You can personalize the customer experience with automation tools like chatbots and bots that help users find what they need faster by asking them questions and making suggestions based on their responses (like Amazon's Alexa). Keep it simple from the start. Do you really need all those features on your first attempt at a new digital product? Imagine the look on your customer’s face when he/she opens it up for the first time. The more complicated it looks, the less likely they are to use it. Studies have shown that customers are more likely to use software if they can understand how it works within 5 seconds of trying it for the first time. If you keep things simple, you will have less bugs and less work maintaining the product in the long run. You can always add bells and whistles later – but getting people to use a new product is hard enough as is! Make sure you can scale up if needed. When starting a digital transformation project, always plan for growth. No business should be limited by its technology. Whether this means ensuring your software can be scaled up to account for future growth, or that the technology you use is built to integrate with others, it’s important to ensure your company will not be held back by its tech. Keep an eye on the future of technology and how that will impact business processes. You can't expect to stay relevant if you are not up to date on technology. It's absolutely imperative that you keep an eye out for how technology will continue to develop, and how technological advancements will change the way your business does things. You need to think about how these changes will impact your customers, suppliers, partners, and employees. What new capabilities are enabled by them? How will they change what you offer your customers? How can they help you work with other companies more efficiently? Digital transformation is not easy, but these tips will help you succeed! Any business that has undergone a digital transformation can confirm that it is not easy, but with the right people to guide you along the way and a solid plan in mind, your company will be on its way to success! Plan for the future. Set goals. Teamwork makes the dream work. Measure your progress."
12,The Arrogance Of Instant.,business," Ours has been called the information age. And it is likely the defining characteristic of the times we live in. Truly a marvel. We are able to communicate around the globe. Talking to faraway friends and family instantly. In the same manner, we take in news and information worldwide. Want to know how the Istanbul Stock Market is doing? Easy, there's probably an app for that. Want to know how weather conditions are in Nairobi. No problem. There can be no question that we are the most well-informed people in all of history. At our fingertips is: data, opinion, and reporting all in the style and format of modern media. It is quite an array. And it's all instant. Many have said it's overwhelming. In fact, that's become a cliché. But in reality, I don't think that's the real issue. The real issue is what we then do, with that information?. What do we assume that it provides for us? Because the great decisions that we must make, as individuals and as a nation, should be arrived at only after deliberate consideration, our best judgment. And that takes time. There is a reason that juries are asked to deliberate. Take their time, and consider all of the relevant facts. But today deliberation is passe in the world of the instant. And it has cost us as a nation dearly. Let me tell you a story. A story of how we became mired in the Viet Nam War. The place was the Gulf of Tonkin, just offshore from Viet Nam. The date was August 2nd, 1964. And the incident, as it became known, was the attack on the USS Maddox, an American warship. An attack by the North Vietnamese. At the moment, we saw the damage. The then-president,  Lyndon Johnson, was quick to tell us that it was an entirely unprovoked attack on an American ship in open water. In short an act of war. Johnson responded instantly (there's that word again). And before anyone could have a second thought, we were indeed at war. A war that would cost this country dearly in lives and fortune. To this day, historians still debate what really happened that fateful afternoon in the Gulf of Tonkin. But before the debate could even begin, we were already committed. Now, to a keen observer of recent American history, it is a pattern that repeats often. The War in Iraq, the American incursions in Libya, and Syria. And most recently the affair in Afghanistan. With the possible exception of Kuwait. Seemingly all of our military incursions recently follow this ""instant judgment,"" ""quick-to-act"" scenario. Just over a week ago, Russia invaded Ukraine. In that time, we have slapped some of the toughest sanctions ever on Russia. The American Press has united in calling for a condemnation of Russia. The Department of Justice has begun a complete investigation into Russian businessmen. The White House has asked for billions to be sent to Ukraine in various aid packages. And at least one Senator has asked for a Senate condemnation of Russia. While another Senator has recommended that Putin be assassinated Not bad for a week. You wouldn't want to miss out on the ""condemn Russia train."" But seriously, is this how a reasonable nation acts? Are we exercising considered judgment? Or are we just jumping in front of a cascading press event? Designed to show everyone that ""we know what we're doing.” Fully 100 times the Bible tells us to be “slow to anger, slow to judge.” Do you think a week's time is ""slow and deliberate?"""

The only way to achieve this is by using the right tools to communicate with them. For this the key is automation. Automation through automatic email templates and chat bots allows you to answer the most common questions quickly and easily while freeing up time for important things. Do Follow Up After-Sales If you want to retain your customers’ loyalty, it’s important to understand that they are a part of the process.

With the COVID-19 outbreak still running rampant and remote and hybrid employment reigning as the new normal, the concept of “office culture” has evolved – and we must keep up! From engagement to productivity, organizational culture to technological tools, companies must either adapt to the ever-changing landscape or risk going out of business altogether.

We are in unprecedented times, and thus, leveraging flexible work models means recognizing that we are all embarking on a new employment era and operating accordingly.

18,Moving Overseas: How to Move Efficiently,business," Moving Overseas: How to Move Efficiently Moving worldwide is, without a doubt, a dream come true. Even future ex-pats, though, should be able to move quickly and master each activity. To be honest, when you decide to relocate to another area of the world, you must be more efficient than before in order to keep on schedule. Moving across the globe is thrilling and exciting, and you feel as if you've spent your entire life preparing for this moment. You've probably been looking at maps since you were a youngster, and now the big day is approaching. Perhaps you've even attended language classes, so overcoming the language barrier will be a piece of cake for you. However, before you board a plane and fly away to a different life, you should make some notes on how to prepare for a move and manage all of the other responsibilities. Why Do We Feel Less Stressed When We Know How to Move Efficiently? We get worried about a great many things, and relocations are no exception. After all, no despite how much the international moving program assists us with our shift, other factors may cause us to become anxious. It could be something minor, such as forgetting to disconnect the utilities, or something more significant, such as forgetting to unplug the garments at the dry cleaners. We should improve our organizing abilities to eliminate these nerve-wracking circumstances and allow ourselves to take a big breath before moving overseas and diving into the unknown. What can I do to make moving a little less difficult? With the help of a binder, a to-do list, and determination, you can get things done. Because you've already decided to move to a different country for love or a career, you already have determination. How can you get around with a binder in an efficient manner now? Take one and start preparing a relocating abroad checklist, which you'll use to jot down all of the tasks you need to complete before your departure date. Sort all additional moving-related paperwork and papers (together with all receipts and contracts) into a binder, in addition to your checklist. It will be the ideal relocation hack because all of your key items will be in one location, and you will be able to go back and review your to-do list at any moment. You Can Also Use These Early Preparation Tips So you've made the decision to relocate to one of the world's nicest nations. However, before you toss your critical documents and garments into one suitcase and fragile goods into another, there are a few things to take care of. You'll need to think about how much money you'll need, who you'll need to contact about your transfer and other crucial details. Calculate how much money you'll need for an overseas relocation in your budget Whether you're moving abroad alone or with family, this is likely to be one of the most costly endeavours you've ever done. That is why it is critical that you carefully consider how much you will require. Calculate all of your costs along the route, from foreign vehicle shipping if you plan to bring your automobile with you to the money you'll need in the first several months as you get used to a new country. Notifying Everyone Necessary Before You Leave is one of the wise tips Although we often put off calling utility companies until we move closer, this should be done as early as possible when planning to live abroad. Inform your utility suppliers of your relocation and set a date for disconnection. Carry on with the rest of the vendors in the same way. The next step is to tell your bank and all other financial institutions of the situation. Both the USPS and the IRS have online forms. On the state tax agency's website, you'll find guidelines tailored to the state you're in. Cancel all of your memberships, call your insurance companies, and, most importantly, inform your friends and family. Contact an international mover and make a reservation for their truck as soon as possible This is when you call movers and work out the details. However, before you call any international movers, double-check that your movers are trustworthy. If you don't have any recommendations from friends and family, look them out online. Check out their client reviews first, and then investigate their background. If they've changed their names multiple times, it could indicate a fake past. Checking for a USDOT number with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is the most reliable approach to determine if a corporation is legitimate (FMCSA). Limit your choices to no more than six or seven businesses, and then call them for a quote. Decide the type of packing service you want to hire and educate yourself on how to move a car internationally. When Should You Begin Moving Packing? Not until you've decluttered a few things. Not whether you made the right decision to relocate is one of the leading reasons for relocation stress. Staying in touch with friends once you've relocated to a new country is often difficult. It's that hated and despised packing procedure. Because it's a hard and back-breaking job, it tends to dampen even the most daring people's enthusiasm. But there is one suggestion in particular that will be really beneficial to you: decluttering your home. And you shouldn't think of it as a spring cleaning; because you'll be moving abroad, you should cleanse your home without hesitation. The Big Day Is Approaching, and You're More Than Ready For a Fresh Start No move is easy, and this is especially true when we leave our home and embark on a journey to a distant and unfamiliar region of the globe. People who plan everything ahead of time, on the other hand, are stress-free and can concentrate on how to live abroad. Don't forget to look after yourself in the midst of the chaos that accompanies a relocation. It includes getting enough sleep, eating consistently, and sticking to your daily habits until you're ready to relocate to one of the best areas to live overseas."
19,Creating Psychological Safety through structure and human interaction,business," Manufacturing and psychological safety are normally not synonymous.  The current American manufacturing environment is very competitive and normally fear based.  If you miss a production goal, there is a negative consequence.  If you create a defect, there is a negative consequence. This type of environment has been in effect for the last 20-30 years.  This has created a workforce that is afraid to admit mistakes, speak up to superiors, or contribute.  In this type of environment, the workforce is not innovative, and focuses on protecting themselves versus improving the environment.   Companies have instituted processes and engineered equipment to mitigate the current unengaged workforce. Current leadership of companies equate psychological safety with allowing employees to do whatever they want or a passive leadership style.   There are multiple examples where companies have gotten it wrong and employees have made large mistakes or actually committed fraud by not feeling they could challenge the leadership direction.   There are also examples where psychological safety has been instituted and collaboration and innovation have grown.  Google is a perfect example of this.  Google completed a study in which it determined that “Psychological Safety is the #1 predictor to team success.”(1) With ample evidence on why psychological safety works, why then are current manufacturing environments so driven on the archaic style of leadership and fear based management.   The answer to that lies in the statement; Change is scary and uncertain.  The current environment provides mediocre but stable results.  These results are predictable.   This gives safety to the companies.  Change is scary and unpredictable. What if you could forge an environment where the average manufacturing worker could feel safe to contribute, safe to challenge bad ideas, was well informed on trends in the environment and was truly engaged and empowered to make the environment better.  This type of employee would work to improve the quality and speed at which they did the job.  When problems arose, they would be safe to stop and ask the questions, ask for help, or even admit that they made a mistake.  Employees that feel safe in their environment to make a mistake focus on improving the process so the mistake cannot happen to others, rather than protecting themselves.   Focus on innovation and improvement versus self-defense.  This type of employee is more collaborative and works better in the team, which then makes the team closer and more cooperative. Some leaders would think that this is not achievable or that this type of environment would produce less efficient results or more quality defects due to the lack of so called discipline or fear.  As the current workforce becomes more and more infiltrated with millennials this will become more and more important. This type of psychologically safe environment is achievable. This is the future.  It will be needed for American manufacturing to grow into the future.  If we fail to change we will not continue to be competitive in the ever changing manufacturing market. The answer for how to change the culture and erase 30 years or more of poor manufacturing practices is not easy.  It takes bravery and open mindedness.  There will be resistance and skeptics throughout the entire organization.  This cannot be done like the standard marketing campaign that companies often use when changing culture , or attempting to.  It is important to focus on creating the correct framework prior to actually shifting to a psychologically safe environment.  People will not believe you, as a leader, just by your words, but it will be how you live the vision. Create Structure First.  This seems like this is opposite to a psychologically safe environment, but this is the foundation of the environment.   Creating expectations and transparency in work areas will eliminate hostile environments of the past that bred animosity and conflict within the work teams.   These goals will be the framework for success.  They give the teams safety.  Goals breed a safe environment.  People know what success looks like and they will most of the time drive to achieve that success. When misses happen, these expectations gives the leader a launching point to start conversations focused on improvement. Allowing employees to explain misses in a safe way and focus on how they will improve their own performance can drastically improve their daily performance.  Build the system and the system will build the team. Empowering leaders of all levels to each own a piece of the leadership responsibilities will delegate duties while ensuring that the vision is spread at all levels.  Creating the ability to effectively learn and contribute in teams as leaders is important.  If the shop floor leadership feel that they do not have a voice to improve the environment, then this will follow to the rest of the work force.  It is important to realize that the other employees are watching how their front-line leaders are being treated and listened to.  Listen and empower them to contribute, disagree, and improve their environments. Focus on Human interaction next.  Making people feel as if they are important and have a voice. In a psychologically safe environment people feel like they are part of a team, they can learn effectively, and that they are empowered to contribute and challenge the team if needed.  This is critical.  Every employee at any level is a human.  Everyone is looking to survive and belong.  As leaders we have to care about the people in our charge in order for them to truly care about us and our companies.  The current manufacturing environment treats people as if they are disposable, and then we expect them to care about quality and efficiency of the same company that would discard them as if they were a piece of trash.  That is not realistic and we, as leaders, would struggle to do the same if we were treated identically.  Human interaction and investment of the team can change the culture from within the teams.   Invest in your teams.  Train them, talk to them and, most importantly, listen to them.   Make them feel as if they are critical for the team’s success.  Include them in planning, solution brainstorming and provide transparency and vision to them.   If they understand the vision and feel empowered, they will make the vision a reality.  Spend time trying to grow their careers, focus on personal interactions and be genuinely interested in their day or the specific interactions.  This builds trust, and through trust comes the culture change. Be brave, it will not be easy.  Excellence never is easy.   Be consistent and change at all levels.  One bad interaction or example will derail the culture shift.  Decide to be different and to make the people who are the backbone of the companies feel like they are the company.  There will be skeptics and people who don’t agree, but the future will show that they were wrong.   The future will be bright if leaders are willing to be different.  Lead through empathy, positivity, transparency and accountability.  Lead through psychological safety.  Change the environment and together we could change the face of American Manufacturing."

Take time to meet each team member, understand their role, and learn how to best support them. Don't expect them to instantly respect you if you never leave your office or interact with them. Practice Active Listening New leadership brings a period of transition. If you are exploring making changes to how the team operates, ensure you receive their feedback throughout the process. Early in the transition, ask about any changes they might like to see or challenges they are currently facing in their work. Don't immediately try to talk over them or offer solutions, but rather actively listen to what they say and genuinely consider their input. Communicate Honestly Employees don't like to feel like their managers are keeping things from them. Strive to communicate as honestly as you can. If there are limits to what you can share about certain matters, be transparent about that, and do your best to answer questions or concerns. It's vital for your team to feel like their leaders share critical information and aren't keeping secrets. Model Positive Behavior If you're asking for certain behaviors or attitudes from your team, ensure you model them yourself. Team members will struggle to trust you and follow your lead if you constantly emphasize maximizing productivity and avoiding distractions, but they see you chatting with colleagues in the breakroom all day. Hold yourself accountable to the same standards you set for your team, and they will be more likely to model the same behaviors. Trust Your Team Finally, do your best to trust your team. No one wants to be micromanaged. Checking in about time-sensitive projects on occasion is one thing, but if you're constantly hounding your team about everyday tasks, it's probably time to step back. Team members want to feel trusted in their roles, so give them space to work independently unless there are performance issues that need to be addressed."

7,What Skills Do You Need To Become An Online Notary?,business," Remote Online Notarization (RON) has become a popular choice for businesses and individuals around the world. Electronic notaries have the same job as a traditional notary, with a major difference, you perform notarization services online using video and audio tools. This means you do not have to be in the same room as the person requesting authentication. Over one billion documents are notarized each year with more than four million notaries in the United States alone, according to 2017 statistics. One notary can authenticate loan documents, affidavits, power of attorney, wills and child adoption papers. Notarizing documents eliminates fraud, ensuring the agreement will stand up in the court of law, should any disputes arise. Electronic notaries authenticate agreements and contacts for clients by verifying their identities and confirming they understand the contents and terms of the document. Once the party signs, the notary adds their signature, with an official state-assigned seal. The transaction is then recorded in the official journal, maintaining a copy for the record. In the United States, it can cost less than one hundred dollars to get a certification, based on the state laws.

8,Active Listening: Do You Listen to Reply or to Understand?,business," Think about the last interaction you had. Maybe it was a meeting with a client, a call with a prospect, or even just your nightly dinnertime banter with your spouse and/or kids. Regardless, I want you to stop and reflect on this singular question: were you really listening? Were you truly paying attention, or were you waiting to grab the mic and interject your own thoughts and opinions, before even processing what was shared? While the word “conversation” is tossed around lightly, most conversations are merely people unconsciously talking at each other, rather than conversing with each other. This, in a nutshell, is the difference between active listening and passive listening. Active listening is an essential soft skill in every aspect of life. The absence of this aspect of communication is detrimental across the board, no matter where it shows up in our lives. The cost of not listening effectively is clear, resulting in careless mistakes at work, family issues, lost relationships… you name it. The cost of not listening effectively in business? Your customers and prospects. Listening to understand (not to reply) There are so many components that comprise active listening, but as Stephen Covey so eloquently summed it all up in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: “The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand; we listen to reply.” While the majority of people listen to reply, active listening means listening to understand. It means paying attention without being preoccupied with what to say next. Active listening means fully listening, which can be demonstrated by the following: Not interrupting. Refrain from interjection (no matter how tempting). Wait until the speaker is finished sharing before you offer your two cents. Take a moment to process what the person you are conversing with has to say. This demonstrates that you are listening to understand, not simply reply. Take your time. Slow the conversation down and reflect on what the speaker has said. Dig into the details, connect the dots, look at the bigger picture, and ask meaningful questions where applicable. Showing empathy. If the person you are talking to shares something vulnerable, or even just mentions a difficult situation, express true, genuine concern. Validate their experiences, and connect to them on a human level. Prioritizing balance. Conversations should be an experience of give and take, and there should be a sense of equality and mutual respect throughout. If you find that one person in the interaction is doing all of the talking and the other is doing all of the listening, check-in with yourself. Identify whether you need to create space for the other person to be heard. Why is active listening important in business? In past articles, I’ve highlighted the importance of knowing your customer’s pain point. But there is more to it than just approaching people with what you know (or think you know). Responding to your target audience’s problem effectively means actively listening to them on a consistent basis. Truly building a relationship with your clients and prospects means delving into the nature of their situation, not just assuming you understand it from some data points and initial interactions. To truly resonate, you must show your clientele that you truly hear their pain-point as you engage with them. When you are in the business of selling products or services, there is a tendency to jump the gun and tell your target audience what you can do for them, before taking the time to listen to what they need. But there is so much to learn from the people you aim to serve. Costly mistakes happen when you don’t listen, and this is only amplified as a business leader, especially in your interactions with your target customers. If you are not actively listening, you may go completely off course, believing you have an offering that your audience needs… even though they are clearly telling you that they don’t! Active listening can protect you against this unfortunate fate. By truly listening to your target audience, you can identify your own blind spots and adjust accordingly... before investing time, money, and resources into an ineffective solution. At the end of the day, your customers and prospects are the experts on their own experiences… no matter how passionately you believe you have the answers to their problems. Your customer’s voice must remain your throughline as you iterate and evolve your offerings. Active listening leads to innovation & collaboration We all want to be heard. It is human nature. As such, “listening” might feel threatening. What if I don’t get the chance to express my voice? What if this interjection is my only opportunity, you might ask. While slowing down to prioritize active listening might initially feel like the complete opposite of being heard, this isn’t the case. The reality is, communication is a two-way street. Conversations built on a foundation of active listening are not just conversations… They are collaborations, in which you will not only be heard, but will also learn, grow, evolve, ponder, and expand your perspective. Active listening not only builds trust, rapport, and a spirit of collaboration between brand and customer but can also lead to innovation on a larger scale. By being truly present in a conversation, you can bounce ideas off of those you are talking to and consider new perspectives and possibilities that you may not have considered. When you approach customer interactions with the mindset that they have the insight to offer you, your perspective will inevitably grow and expand as a result. Through active listening, you will learn what your customer truly needs, and uncover everything that you can offer them, beyond what you’d ever considered before. The moment of truth Be honest with yourself. Are you truly an active listener, or are you guilty of taking over conversations (however well-intentioned)? Are you quick to speak your mind, or do you slow down to unpeel the layers of the person you are conversing with? Active listening isn’t a one-and-done act. It’s a soft skill we must continually work to sharpen. But one thing is fundamentally clear: prioritizing active listening will deepen your connections to others and expand your perspectives. And who knows... you may even expand your business in the process! Speaking of listening… Want some audio insight on the importance of active listening? Check out my Business Growth Cafe podcast episode on this vital soft skill!"

In marketing, new strategies and trends change how we must draw, connect with and sell to our customers. However, it's not always enough to keep pace with these transformations. Many search engine optimization companies are coming up these days as well.

This article will discuss what digital marketing trends are to come in 2022. When it comes to PPC, you probably only think about google ads; however, this isn't the only PPC network out there. Deciding where to invest in advertising can depend on several factors such as: a.	Platform user base b.	Volume for ad serving c.	Creative opportunities d.

Targeting Across the globe, over 665 billion households own smart TVs; with more people staying home due to covid, it has become their go-to source of entertainment, especially with YouTube at number one on the list of channels used. What does this mean? The idea here is to create video advertising content to promote brands through the internet, and this is to be able to display advertising campaigns on different streaming platforms. Alexa, Cortona, Siri, and Google are sure that you use at least two of these voice assistants to perform voice searches from your phone, laptop, smart device, or TV. Speaking comes more naturally and is relatively effortless than typing, which is why voice search makes perfect sense. It's a brilliant technological innovation that it's already altering how we communicate digitally. Include an ad group that focuses on conversational keywords: a. Long-tailed keywords b. Question Oriented Keywords Six seconds, that's all you have to make a good impression.

You are not alone. 66% of people hate it when video ads automatically play with sound.

Banner ads: Traditional banners shown in games. Mobile app development companies that also deal with digital marketing and advertisement, can benefit from this suggestion the most. Consumers will continue to become more demanding. That's why it's soundest to start 800 adopting alternative advertising methods experiment measures, and ensure they work. It's essential to be aware of what friends are coming up in the future so you can prepare for them now and stay ahead of the competition. As a marketer, you must continue to adapt and find ways to cater to the growing demands of the consumer. To prepare yourself and your business for future surprises, keep these trends in mind.

11,EPOH. A New Level of Web 3 Integration.,business," The first focused, community-driven bed and breakfast NFT that’s blurring the lines between the real world and Web 3 in the best possible way. The Epoh Lounge Club (ELC) is not an average, goofy NFT project. It’s a first-of-its-kind community/utility token that’s taking NFT technology and using it to build a project based on the idea of financial freedom and HOPE. This community goes beyond a simple discord room and involves physical, real-world perks and incredible knowledge-gathering opportunities. Sounds great, but how exactly are they doing that? A Deeper Take on Community. The ELC begins with a focus on community in the traditional sense with its initial offering of token-based membership in an NFT club. Own the NFT, be a part of the private club, and have verifiable ownership on the blockchain in the form of an appreciable digital asset. But that’s just the beginning: the ELC has plans to develop an entire ecosystem revolving around the creation of B&B businesses, including the management staff, owners, guests, and more. That means teaching the community as well as simply facilitating it. Community is about sharing knowledge and assets and the ELC shares generously in its physical assets, digital assets, and knowledge. Let’s dive in a little deeper: Real Life Perks. Each holder gets to partake in FREE stays in the project’s brick-and-mortar B&Bs, which are located primarily in Austin, but are quickly expanding (with sights set on destinations around the world). There’s an actual business behind this project, working to grow and expand the opportunities that it can offer the holders of its' digital asset (the Epoh Lounge Club NFT). And it’s also not only about doing all the work behind the scenes for holders: this is not simply a Web 3 version of a ""time-share"". It’s about showing holders what could be with the actual finished products that they get to stay in for FREE, and then taking it a step further by providing them with the community and knowledge they need to learn how to do it themselves! The founding team has experience and a proven track record creating a profitable B&B business and they’re opening up the vault of their knowledge to holders through courses and how-to content. In addition, there will be WEEKLY live info sessions where holders can get support in their journey to grow their own B&B business. One of the biggest drawbacks of traditional online video courses is the inability to ask questions as you go, which for many learners stifles their progress. With these live sessions held weekly, the ELC is expediting the learning process. By having already functioning B&Bs, they’re providing a real-life benefit and example of what can be accomplished. And through the community, they’re making sure holders aren’t alone in their journey and have everything they need to learn quickly. Web 3 Merged With the Physical World in a More Comprehensive Way. In addition to physical locations, each ELC token is actually a virtual destination where holders will be able to meet with friends and partake in a variety of activities, including meeting, recording podcasts, and other virtual activities. As society continues to move more digital, one’s access to digital assets will matter more and more. Each ELC token acts as its own premier digital venue, allowing holders to take full advantage of the growing digital landscape. Able to travel to one of the project’s destinations? Enjoy that B&B for FREE as a perk of simply holding a digital token (scheduling limitations may apply). It’s digital asset access tied to a virtual asset ownership: the first one like it in the world. The Future of the ELC The ELC is becoming the most fully integrated B&B Web 3 community, from hosts and guests all the way to the service-providers needed to make a phenomenal B&B experience possible. As regulations develop around the space, possible future passive income opportunities are being looked into by the team. The ELC team and its' holders have a lot to lose, so they’re taking every precaution and effort to achieve their goals the RIGHT way, bringing as much value as possible to each holder. The ELC is about helping members create and enjoy financial freedom and providing a blueprint for HOPE. Come create the future of Web 3 and the blueprint of the B&B landscape with us."
12,Powerful Leadership Tips Directly From The Pros,business," Take a minute and reflect on this question - how would you describe someone who is a strong leader? You would likely say they are powerful, dynamic, a great communicator and someone with excellent oratory skills. While these are all excellent leadership skills, they take time to develop. If you are looking to develop skills such as these, continue reading to learn more about all it takes to become the leader you want to be. When you're a leader, you'll need to be accountable. If you make a mistake, admit it and move on. It can be easy to push the blame onto other people, but this should really be avoided. If you're accountable when you've made a mistake, the people around you will feel the need to be more accountable if they've made a mistake. To help your employees reach goals, set monthly as well as yearly goals. These goals will help spur your employees and help them know what your expectations are. By understanding your expectations, your employees will stay on task and strive to reach the goals. Monthly goals should be easily attainable with hardwork. Be a communicator. Communication is a major aspect of what makes great leadership. If you can't communicate your goals and vision, then what is there for your employees to follow at all? If you have a tendency to ""loan wolf"" at work, break out of that habit and begin communicating with your teams. Talk to other leaders. This can be a great way to get feedback on ideas and to figure out how best to address concerns and problems. This will also give you time to observe other leadership styles and techniques. You may find something useful, or you might inspire someone else. How you behave will directly effect how your employees conduct themselves in the office. A leader that is hostile and aggressive can expect a combative atmosphere and lack of trust in the workplace. By displaying confidence and remaining calm in tense situations you set an positive example for your employees to follow. A good leader is able to help develop strong leadership skills in others. If you try to micro-manage every detail of your business, you won't have time to look at the bigger picture. Having trustworthy employees who can lead others will give you the chance to delegate responsibilities as your company continues to grow. Own your words. To be a good leader, you need to put your money where your mouth is. You are the center of your company, so what you say and do affects a lot of people and the business itself. If you have done or said things you ought not have, you must fix it. Avoid thinking others will fix your mess. Study the art of writing well. Leadership isn't all about how you hold yourself and your vision. Writing documents well is also very important. If your writing looks unprofessional, people won't respect you as much. Pay attention to how you write. Be confident. If you are not confident about a judgment call, make sure you think it through before you enact it. The respect your team has for you relies a lot on your confidence when you talk to them, when you give orders and when you make judgment calls. Learn how to laugh. Yes, you've got a serious job with a lot of responsibilities, but leadership isn't born out of tension and stress. Sometimes you need to learn how to lighten the mood. Not just for yourself, but for your employees too. If you've hit some rough patches, it's your responsibility as a leader to help your team get out of it. Be willing to learn new things when it comes to leadership. Enroll in courses and workshops that are designed to teach leadership skills. There are always new techniques to learn and skills to improve. Keep yourself in the know. Listen to people. Listening is a quality that a lot of people no longer value, but remember that there are people in your company or organization who have good ideas. Show that you are willing to hear from others, and they will feel appreciated. That is something a good leader can do. Let employees follow your good example. You should not expect your title to speak for itself. If you want employee punctuality and respect to be shown, you must put forth these traits yourself. Nobody wants to work around a hypocrite. Give your team a reason to respect you. Become a more effective leader by becoming a more self-confident individual. Research shows that a developed sense of self-confidence makes you look, sound, and act more like a leader. You can communicate confidence by maintaining excellent posture, speaking with certainty, and calling attention to key points by adding appropriate hand gestures. Good leaders identify and understand their obstacles before encountering them in insurmountable ways. Learn to anticipate a crisis and take steps to avoid it. It is possible to have a positive attitude and still not be in denial about potential pitfalls. Delegate team members to minimize risks using each person's individual strengths. A great motivational tool for leaders to use is to make employees examples of how to do things the right way. If a team member achieved a goal, or accomplished a special task, call him out in front of his peers, and give him the recognition he deserves. This will motivate others to do their best as well. A huge part of successful leadership has to do with the relationships you build and cultivate with the people around you. Networking with people in the community will be vitally important to your business' success. The relationships you have with your employees are also vitally important, and perhaps even more so. A great leader is developed through hard work and skills. This article has provided you with much of the information you need as far as the skills go, and now it is your turn to take the reigns and put in the hard work to develop those skills. With effort, you can become the leader you want to be and lead the team you want to have."
13,7 Ways having Lithuanian dual citizenship boosts your business,business," If you are a business person, you likely have big plans and a solid drive to expand your company and succeed. So here’s our two cents— all of your ambitious business goals will get a considerable boost when you restore Lithuanian citizenship. Restoring citizenship is an avenue worth exploring— not just for the sentimental and identity value of being connected to your ancestral roots but to obtain some genuine business benefits along with your Lithuanian dual citizenship.. One of the first lessons an entrepreneur learns is this: it’s always a good idea to have options. A plan B that can be acted upon at a moment’s notice is an asset when your business comes to a tough spot. Can you restore Lithuanian dual citizenship? Lithuanian law outlines a specific scenario in which you can obtain citizenship. First, you need to have a Lithuanian ancestor, and the process is about restoring Lithuanian citizenship by descent, aided by documents that prove your family tree. Then, there’s the three-generation rule. If your parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent was a Lithuanian national, you might be eligible to restore Lithuanian citizenship. Any further back (great-great-grandparents, etc.), and it’s no longer possible. 7 Business benefits of restoring Dual citizenship Lithuania Now that you know whether you’re eligible to restore Lithuanian citizenship let’s jump into the details. The most important thing about having a plan B is that it needs to be set up in advance. It’s no use rushing to the consulate when things go awry, everyone is trying to get a dual Lithuanian passport, and the process gets swamped. And recent events have shown that things can go awry fast— think pandemics, political and economic instability. The wisest course of action is to restore Lithuanian citizenship as soon as possible so that, should the need to emigrate become real, your business will be prepared to face the storm. People without an EU passport face many restrictions when setting up a company in Europe. The long-winded process involves red taping, substantial capital requirements, and many visa paperwork. But with Lithuanian citizenship, you get EU-citizen rights. This means you can start your business as you would in your home country, keeping the local regulations in mind. Because Lithuania is a member of the EU, when you get Lithuanian citizenship, you obtain the rights of every EU citizen. Among these the freedom to move across European borders and relocate to any of the countries in the block. Of course, each country has regulations that you should check. But overall, it is much simpler to relocate within the EU as a member state citizen than as a non-EU national. Besides, the Lithuanian passport is ranked 11th in the entire world. This means you get visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 181 countries— think of the mobility benefits it brings to your business travel. The common perception is that European banks are, above all, safe— and it’s true. Securing your (or your company’s) money in an EFTA or EU bank gives you peace of mind. There’s only one hitch: if you are not an EU citizen or legal resident, recent AML (anti-money-laundering) laws make it very hard to open an account there. On the other hand, if you have Lithuanian citizenship, you can open an account with more ease and fewer restrictions or paperwork. What is the tax regime like in your current home country? If you are heavily taxed when you set up a company or when your organization is still trying to take off, the appeal of enterprise decreases. Setting up your company in Europe can be attractive, especially if you want to run an international business. Not only does the free trade agreement within the EU facilitate operations, but some nations in the block apply only very light taxation on companies and innovators. The Netherlands, for example, rewards movers-and-shakers by imposing only a 7% tax as long as your company derives at least 30% of its profits from a self-developed patent. Lithuania itself only taxes companies at 5%-15% (depending on the revenue generated), closely outmatched by Ireland (12.5%) and Hungary (9%). Some European countries (which, as we’ve established, you can relocate to) are famous for their gentle approach to personal taxation. If you choose to move to Andorra, you’ll pay no tax on investment income or transfers and only 10% as a resident or company, and your capital will be grateful. In a competitive business environment, you need to seize every advantage you can. And being an EU national is undoubtedly an advantage. Common biases in your favour mean you’ll be perceived as more cosmopolitan, professional, and savvy. Because these biases do exist, it’s in your power to even out the field by getting Lithuanian citizenship. Summing up If you think you’re eligible for Lithuanian citizenship by descent— go through the process now. Being an EU citizen gives your company enormous advantages and the best chances to succeed. Be prepared. If you have Lithuanian descent and want to restore your citizenship? Write to us at info@lithuaniancitizenship.com. We support you through document acquisition, application preparation, translation, and guide you until the passport is granted. Email us today so we can assess your eligibility for a Lithuanian passport."
14,"Competitive Intelligence: Know Your Competitors, Don’t Copy Them",business," In marketing, it is crucial to establish a competitive intelligence program for your business in an effort to build more effective brand strategies. A process of improving strategic decision making, competitive intelligence (CI) brings a focus on your competitors, the markets they serve and the initiatives they have in place. When business leaders look at their competition, there is often an urge to take what a competitor has done well and attempt to apply those strategies and tactics to their brand. However, that may not be the best approach – at least not always. In today’s article, we highlight why you should use your competitive intelligence program to inform your decision-making – not dictate it. Competitors as a point of reference At first glance, the results of your competitive intelligence program may look like an indication of what others are doing well, and what you should be doing better. However, while awareness of relevant trends and techniques is a key aspect of market advancement, it is just that: awareness. Whether it’s operations or finance or anything in between, no two companies are alike in what strategic decisions are the ‘right’ ones to grow their business. There are so many factors to consider before launching a new initiative – no matter how profitable or successful it has the potential to be. Some of these factors to consider include: Brand Positioning: Consider the elements of brand positioning that are unique to your firm. What is the relevant message you want to communicate to your target audience? Think about how you differ from your competitors, as well as how you overlap. Will your customers understand what differentiates you from your competitors or are you creating market confusion? Brand Perception: Reflect on your unique relationship with your target audience, as well as existing brand perceptions in the eyes of your customers. What perceptions do you have about your company? Do the market and your customers have the same perception? If not, then there needs to be some alignment to ensure expectations are met and to ensure that how you are perceived is the way you want to be perceived. Don’t let the market define your brand. Market Position: Are you a challenger or a leader? Depending on whether you are a leader in the market or a challenger to it, will dictate how you market your brand. Understanding your role and that of your competition will help in defining the types of information you need to collect and analyze in order to ensure your competitive intelligence program is effective. When you look at the data from your competitive intelligence program, it’s important to maintain a consistent eye on what competitors are doing well (and, not so well). While your competitor’s actions can help guide you, they shouldn’t control your decision-making. The key to implementing a competitive intelligence program is to consistently gather and analyze the data you are collecting and put it into action. Share it with the team and ensure it’s being factored into your strategic decisions. The most important word in the phrase competitive intelligence isn’t competitive – it’s intelligence. Continuously learning about what is going on in your industry by having a full picture of the competitive landscape allows you to be proactive and not reactive in your competitive posture."
15,"Strategic Marketing, Inside & Out",business," Your plan is in motion, and you’re officially converting leads into committed clients. This means that your marketing plan has officially succeeded, right? Not quite. While successfully making the sale is undoubtedly one of the most difficult steps of the customer lifecycle, it is not the end of the marketing process. It shouldn’t be, at least. While many business leaders focus their marketing efforts on what occurs before prospects sign on the dotted line, an effective marketing strategy extends beyond the prospect’s perception before committing to the sale, or engaging in the partnership. Rather, an effective marketing strategy also extends internally, addressing a client’s experience inside the company. Today, we’ll share a few aspects of internal marketing that many business leaders overlook. Onboarding new clients Onboarding is the beginning of the official customer-brand relationship. As such, it is also one of the most crucial times to leave a lasting impression and build loyalty and confidence. As soon as a client begins working with your brand, how do you engage with them? What process does your team go through with new customers? Every onboarding process is different, depending on the nature of your company. Regardless, your process must be streamlined to be consistently effective. Establishing SOPs (standard operating procedures) for bringing new clients onboard is key to maintaining the messaging you’ve worked so hard to market to your new customers. First, you must determine your internal team workflow for onboarding clients. But beyond how you and your team get up to speed, you must make a plan for when, what, and how to lay the groundwork for your clients. Here are a few aspects to address from the get-go: How and when clients will be billed What clients can expect in terms of communications Who the brand’s point of contact is, should questions or concerns arise What the goals are within the partnership In the eyes of your clients, no message IS a message, but certainly not a good one. If you don’t take the time to engage with your clients from the start, confusion will arise, which will taint your brand image and lessen the chance of client retention. On the other hand, an organized process will remind clients why they were so excited to start working with you and keep them energized throughout their journey. Customer experience Setting expectations is still only the start, though. Once you’ve laid out the road ahead for your new clients, follow-through is critical to the customer experience. After all, no matter what you communicate to your clients in words, actions speak louder. In a recent article, we discussed why employees can make-or-break internal marketing, depending on how well they represent brand values. But brand vision alone isn’t enough — it must be met with action and execution. Not only must employees reflect brand values; they must also know how to respond to customers on a daily basis. This means training employees on the standard operating procedures you’ve established and addressing any implementation gaps that may arise. Setting expectations is still only the start, though.

Brand education Do your clients know the breadth of what your company offers, or only the services you are currently providing to them? At CRAFT, we have conducted numerous customer surveys for our clients. In doing so, we’ve found a trend: more often than not, customers don’t know your full range of offerings. Instead, they are categorized into one subset of the company, with little to no crossover. Imagine how many opportunities are lost, simply because your clients don’t know they exist! As you onboard your clients, ensure that you are equipping them with a full understanding of your brand. This will allow them to become true brand ambassadors, as well as open them up to other ways you can help them, whether now or down the line. All in all, the message is this: don’t let your marketing stop at the moment of customer acquisition. Rather, utilize the customer journey ahead — from onboarding to service and beyond — to weave your marketing efforts all the way through your process."
16,5 Ways To Create A Positive Workplace Culture,business," A positive workplace culture is enormously beneficial for both employers and employees alike. For the employee, a positive environment at work is less likely to result in stress, sick days, and professional conflict. Equally, for employers, fostering a positive workplace culture means that the overall wellbeing of employees is higher — meaning higher retention levels, attracting the best professional talent, and a thriving business in which everyone is committed to growth and results. But what does having a positive workplace culture mean, and how do you create one? Well, a positive workplace culture usually refers to a place of work in which there is minimal conflict, high levels of professionalism, a good work-life balance, and an opportunity to always be heard and included. It can also include opportunities to develop and improve professionally. Below, we explore five simple but effective ways that you can create a positive workplace culture in your business. When researching why employees switch jobs or resign, several studies have found that it was due to feeling ignored, excluded, or ‘not heard’ in the workplace. A great way to avoid this is to create and foster an atmosphere of open dialogue — meaning employees have regular opportunities to raise concerns, give feedback, and be heard by those in charge. This can take the form of regular meetings (whether as groups or individuals) to give feedback, or perhaps a more anonymous digital approach could be used, where individuals can raise their worries or concerns without feeling exposed. A multi-faceted approach is usually best, as is targeting feedback on key areas and issues rather than being too open-ended. Allow your employees to give their feedback and input, then implement changes and the best ideas accordingly. Remember that an engaged workforce feels valued and significant, and is far more likely to work effectively and remain loyal to a company. A workplace culture that encourages cooperation, community, and collaboration is far more likely to thrive. Whether for specific tasks or projects, or as a general approach, ensure that there are multiple opportunities for collaboration within the team. This also extends higher up the chain of command. Be sure to share your goals and targets with your team and encourage suggestions on how best to meet them. Then assign teams or individuals to the ideas that they have suggested. A feeling of ‘personal investment’ in an idea can often help to make it a success. Collaboration within a workplace culture also encourages good communication and strong interpersonal skills. While it is important to remain professional and lead by a good example, this should not be at the expense of transparency. If there are areas of concern or importance, be sure to share them with your team at opportune moments so that they always feel ‘in the loop’. Maintaining transparency and sharing information is not only courteous, but it also helps team members to feel valued and included. Their input may also give valuable insights into your business processes. It can be easy to feel overwhelmed when striving to create a positive workplace culture from scratch. But you don’t have to go it alone! It can be a great investment in your business to consult a professional — such as an employment lawyer or HR expert — to advise early in the process. That way, you are not only setting up a visible positive workplace culture, but it is reflected in your policies, protocols, and legal documents too. Consulting a professional can also be a great way to ensure that your company always stays abreast of the current optimal business practices and any recent developments in employment law. One of the best ways to create and maintain a positive workplace culture is to keep inclusivity at the heart of everything you do. How can you make others feel valued and included? Who might feel excluded, and how can you address this? Seek input on these topics and strive to address the concerns raised. This includes areas such as minority groups, or those with disabilities, but should extend to all forms of inclusivity and diversity. A diverse workforce naturally thrives because of the variety of skills, opinions, and approaches on offer. A diverse range of employees who feel valued and included will organically feel more connected to their jobs and strive to do well — and employers will reap the rewards as a consequence!"
17,5 Ways You Should Be Using Digital Signage in the Workplace,business," We’re all familiar with walking into a restaurant and seeing the gigantic television screens that are flashing all sorts of specials, ads, and promotions in our faces. This style of screen isn’t only useful for the lines at restaurants, though. You can leverage digital signage to enhance your workplace, no matter what industry you’re in. Here are five ideas for boosting your business with televisions displaying digital signage at your company: Reinforce safety as a pillar for your employees. Digital signage doesn’t always have to be customer, client, or public-facing. In warehouses, you can remind your forklift drivers of the importance of practicing safe driving with stills or short clips. Maybe employees need to pick up and move heavy objects, so you can display tips for proper lifting techniques and how to work smarter and not harder. Even in office spaces, you can reinforce safety by showing short exercises to improve ergonomics; it’s unhealthy to sit in a chair at a desk for 8 hours straight! Friendly competition to improve business. Use your digital signage to display a regularly updated graphic for your sales team, either with number of deals closed per quarter or customer approval rankings. For warehouses, maybe you run a competition for who works the quickest and most efficiently with the highest accuracy levels, and use your digital sign to update the standings at the end of every shift. The friendly competition ideas are endless, and nobody benefits more than the company does. Internal contests can enhance productivity by up to 50%! Boost employee morale. Use your workplace television to display team member birthdays for the week or a simple congratulations message when a specific employee is recognized by supervisors or peers for going above and beyond the call of duty. It’s an easy solution that makes people feel good and helps others strive for future recognition. Teach customers/clients about the business and what you have to offer them. Sometimes customers or clients might not know that a company may offer products or services beyond what they’re used to getting. What better way to open a new door for additional business from a current customer/client? Place your television with digital signage displayed in high traffic areas or in waiting rooms where customers will naturally view whatever you put on the screen to help pass the time. Enhance communication with employees. It’s possible all employees have emails and cell phones these days, but it’s sometimes difficult to get a message through the clutter of everyone else sending emails and texts! Place a digital sign in the employee break room or at the door with important company announcements. What better way to tell them that part of the employee parking area is going to be off-limits while it’s getting paved? Or maybe that you’re going to be offering an outside visitor to meet with them about banking, retirement, insurance options, or other future planning? Word of mouth will spread from there, but the digital signage will get the ball rolling and benefit the company and the employees. SignPresenter has an application that works on Amazon Firesticks, so all you have to do is design your information and insert the Firestick into the television to create digital signs for your business. It will display your message, graphic, or video. Our team even helps you with the content to make sure you always have something fresh to show off. It’s an affordable alternative to the big-market solutions and easy to update so you can keep the information you display relevant. To improve your business by enhancing communication, awareness, and morale with one simple solution, give us a call to request a demo today!"

19,Organization Development,business," Introduction In this case study, we will identify the factors that influenced workplace issues by researching the significant areas of concern at General Motors that resulted in a national strike. The goal is to identify core problems within General Motors by performing an in-depth analysis of their strategic, operational procedures and evaluating the data to determine the cause and effect of employees' and establish ethical and efficient management is executed. We will also be analyzing organizational behavior within various levels of business development and suggest strategies to improve the working conditions of employees. People are central to the success of a business; thus, an organization is highly dependent on practical and ethical management conduct and the competency and happiness of its employees who occupy various levels of operations within an organization's hierarchy. GM a brief history General Motors, a multinational corporation based in the United States and was founded on 16 September 1908. Detroit, Michigan, is the headquarters of General Motors (GM), an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, distributes vehicle parts, and offers financial services. GM is one of the most recognizable and well-known brands globally, with an instantly recognizable logo since it has been around as early as the turn of the 19th century. In many ways, General Motors is synonymous with of old corporate America due to its long history and historical contribution to the automotive industry. GM is also viewed as a company that once embraced and encouraged the philosophy of the American dream in its core values. According to the definition of the American dream, it is a philosophy of equal opportunity, allowing anyone to reach their highest aspirations. By contrast, GM has failed to live up to the American dream given the conditions employed by temporary workers. GM has sought to rise above adversity, rebrand its image in order regain its former reputation as a global dominating corporation. However, General Motors has been plagued by internal and external challenges such as competition, the controversy surrounding defective vehicles, unethical labor law practices, and the closure of plants led to the 2019 national strike, the first major strike in the American automotive industry over a decade. Therefore, the central focus of this case study will focus on the working conditions of GM employees from the perspective of organizational psychology and use scientific research to propose solutions to internal organizational challenges. Challenges at General Motors After the contract between GM and UAW ended, many workers were left with no job security and did not receive any form of compensation. The union stressed that GM employees were entitled to some form of compensation; this is particularly true for temporary workers, who performed the same duties as permanent workers but without receiving the same mandatory benefits or contracts.  Although UAW aimed to negotiate better contracts through collective bargaining, General Motors and UAW disagreed early on; this resulted in a prolonged national strike that saw both General Motors and its employees suffer the loss of revenue and earnings. The national strike was also due to various factors and organizational changes within GM, which negatively impacted both employees and GM. With the current crisis of shortage of chip semiconductors, GM CEO Mary Barra has raised some concerns with general motors' decision to shut down plants. This decision posed a threat to the United States automotive industry and the entire global automotive industry which resulted in the suppliers of the semiconductors directing their products to other industries, causing competition and shortage in the automotive industry. This negatively impacted GM's profits causing financial difficulties that made it challenging for GM to pay its employees. Due to a lack of sufficient funds, the managers can not pay the employees and poses an additional threat to employee health insurance. Proposed solutions Cause and effect analysis The first cause of action GM should take is to implement the cause-and-effect diagram to help management understand how the interface between human behavior and an organization works. To analyze organizational behavior, the cause-and-effect diagram, or fishbone diagram, uses a variety of metrics, tools, and scientific research methods such as meta-analyses and deductive processing to find core issues within an organization. Using the cause-and-effect diagram, it allows an organization to do an in-depth analysis of its operational procedures. By implementing the cause-and-effect diagram, we can assist employees by identifying core issues that result in job dissatisfaction and attempt to find solutions to some of those problems. Cause and effect diagram assists in the following. •	Evaluate individuals and organizations •	Identify the major challenges within an organization Develop a plan for risk mitigation •	Propose organizational solutions eg, Maslow's hierarchy of needs and organizational learning strategies •	Identity the effectiveness of training programs' proposed solutions. General Motors needs to focus on regaining their employees' trust by improving quality control, employee satisfaction and ensuring ethical procedures are present in all areas of business development. One of the main issues is job uncertainty, low wages leading to decreased motivation.  (Which relates to the hygiene factor theory) Since employees are unhappy and demotivated. A combination of Herzberg's motivation-hygiene dual-factor theory should be implemented along with Maslow's hierarchy of needs to increase motivation and increase employee job satisfaction. Maslow's hierarchy of needs Maslow's theory focuses on fulfilling physiological needs, which are the basic survival needs, followed by safety needs, which emphasize the importance of job security and health; following this are social needs, which address recognition, acceptance, and love. Furthermore, encouraging self-actualization offers employees the opportunity to maximize their potential. The wellness and happiness of General Motors employees remain a central and essential part of the company. The Unhappiness of GM employees in the workplace is caused by poor remuneration, underappreciation, and lack of support from colleagues and management. Low wages decrease safety and their ability to meet personal needs thus;, the employees should be paid salaries or wages to sustain their basic needs. Additionally, they should be provided with contracts, and their health insurance funds must be reinstated. All employees at General Motors, regardless of race or gender, should be eligible for mandatory company benefits and bonus incentives through performance-based appraisals and be provided opportunities for growth within the company; these benefits must be extended to workers under temporary contracts. Herzberg's motivation-hygiene dual-factor theory Employee satisfaction consists of two parts: ""hygiene"" and ""motivation."" Hygiene factors, such as salaries and recognition, decrease employee dissatisfaction with the workplace, the presence of motivational factors such as recognition and achievement increases productivity, creativity, and teamwork. In the absence of hygiene factors in the workplace, employees show less motivation to work; thus, it is in the best interest of GM to employ these strategies since it improves working conditions and help sustain productivity in order to boost profit margins.. Many of the theories listed above have proven effective in solving workplace issues. However, General Motors is a large corporation, and it will be challenging for one manager to oversee and solve every problem the company faces. Thus, GM needs to employ more organizational psychologists to assist executive management with the company's transformation processes. Since organization psychologists are skilled at implementing organizational strategies in the workplace it can assistant in executive management in this regard. Organization growth and competitiveness depend on many factors: high-quality products, well-trained teams, motivated and committed employees; therefore, it is critical for a business to identify and resolve workplace issues at an individual and an organizational level, As a final suggestion to GM, I would like to suggest introducing organizational learning (OL) to improve productivity, maintain worker satisfaction, and foster creativity to encourage innovation. The purpose of organizational learning is to encourage employees and other groups to interact and learn from each other and help them pursue a creative vision, learn, and collaborate effectively, and adapt to change. I/O psychologists use organizational learning programs to implement-and enhance-beneficial changes which involve management, assessment, and statistics. OL organizational learning Knowledge is created, retained, and transferred within organizations through organizational learning. Applying organizational learning in the workplace allows organizations to stay ahead of core issues. Organizational learning improves a wide range of critical human resource operations, such as job and employee satisfaction, by monitoring ethical conduct within an organization and addressing several aspects of human resource management problems, including employee morale, productivity, and employee behavior. GM should implement OL methods to challenge themselves and encourage innovation. OL will also help GM avoid using business models that have become obsolete or stagnate the creativity of employees. Furthermore, this adaptive business model can help unleash everyone's collective aspiration within an organization. Conclusion James Autry, a leadership, and management coach, captured the fundamental core and heart of an organization when he said, ""There is no business, there are only people."" Business exists only among people and for people,"" (Carter, 2020) An organization is highly dependent on practical and ethical management conduct as well the competency and happiness of its employees who occupy various levels of operations within an organization. For General Motors to function optimally and succeed, it can only do if the people are competent, skilled at their jobs, and possesses the necessary experience, training, and qualifications to lead others. Culture and people are also two essential components of any organization, as is the division of labor within the management that should work together harmoniously towards a shared goal. The corporate vision of General Motors is ""to become the world's most valuable automotive company."" The temporary workers who participated in the strike now have permanent contracts. However, General Motors remains a work in progress in need of management changes and organizational reforms to achieve the fantastic heights it once had. To achieve this, A future version of General Motors should embody modern corporate American culture, one that values inclusivity, technological innovation, and ethical treatment of everyone."
20,Some Advice about Affiliate Marketing,business," Welcome to the world of affiliate marketing! As you can see it is a very big world complete with all kinds of programs, products, and plans. The fact that there are many ways to approach this type of marketing can make it seem hard to find what will work for you. The tips below can give you some suggestions. Test the product. The only real way for you to know if you want this product to be affiliated with you, is to try it out! Saying you know something works because you have tried it is much more trustworthy and reliable than saying you read about it on their website. Do not ignore charts. We are visual creatures and your will start to recognize trends in a chart before you can find it in the indicators. Learn what the charts are showing you so you can act quickly on changes in the market. Be careful of using too many technical indicators as they can paralyze your willingness to follow the signs you see. Use your intelligence when you see something that is too good to be true. If you see something that sounds like this it probably leverages off of a scam. Do all of your research on legitimate products as you should never want to throw your money away with a deal that will rarely materialize. Trial and error plays a big part in the success of affiliate marketing. You may find that a link may work well on one site, but completely bombs on another. Be sure to check your numbers regularly in order to learn which links are working for you, and which need to be removed. To significantly increase your affiliate marketing profits, start blogging. Blogging can be an incredibly natural way to promote products. Blogs also rank very highly with search engines, allowing you to market products to a variety of visitors. A blog can also lend a personal touch to the way you sell products. It allows you to answer reader questions, and to guide them to products in a more direct way. Do not make the mistake of focusing on just one sales technique. You might have the best blog in the world, but you are still losing out on customers who need a little more push or don't like reading a blog. Advertise on other sites. Send out emails with value added sales techniques to take people from prospects to customers. Know who your audience is and choose products specifically for them. This is one of the keys to successful affiliate marketing. Anticipate your readers' needs, and seek out products that can make their lives better. Why do they come to your site? What are they looking for? Offer affiliate products or services that solve their problems. When working as an affiliate, you will find that a lot of the work you need to do can be outsourced, but one of the most important things you should be outsourcing is the testing of your methods. Find someone who is willing to follow your links around for a few bucks. They'll report back to you if anything is broken or out of place. Let your customer know what the real benefit is to him if they buy the product. Don't just tell him that the lawnmower is easier to use and more efficient, tell him that he will be able to cut the grass in half the time and spend the rest of the time drinking lemonade on his porch. Sell the benefit of a product, not just the facts. Be sure to think of your readers as you think about what affiliate programs to choose. Look at all the options, products and services that your readers may like, and that will encourage them back to your site. Change things up, such as graphics and text, to see what works best. Keep track of your statistics for every affiliate marketing program you are in and switch out those that aren't working for those that are. You need to constantly keep on top of which ads are being clicked and which are not, or which strategies work best like integrating links into content. Set goals for yourself that will allow you to improve your current affiliate marketing strategy. You can have a task bar that will give you what you need to do. If you're just getting into affiliate marketing, your best bet is to start with Amazon. Create a few niche websites which each link to a variety of products on Amazon that your audience wants to buy. From there you can branch out into other affiliate programs to ensure you have a broad portfolio to choose from. Start your affiliate marketing campaign with 30 articles first. Find good keywords, then write 30 articles with them and watch your results. If you do not make very many sales, then the product is not a winner and you should focus elsewhere. This allows you to test each product for free, since it costs nothing to submit articles to the article marketing directories. Once you find a winner, you may choose to spend money promoting it with paid ads. When you are building up your email list, give people lots of free information. Everyone is reluctant to give out their email address up front in exchange for information, even if it's free. Give them a bunch up front, and because if you only use high-quality information, they will WANT to sign up on your email list. Keep your focus on bringing leads to your site or landing page. Leads are the lifeblood of your affiliate business. Don't get too hung up on customer conversion rates just yet. Work out any kinks in your lead generation process, and when it works you can then move on to conversions. Leads are the fundamental source of your business growth and momentum.

1,Search Engine Optimization tips!,business," We all wish that a successful web business was only a few clicks away, but building a successful site or blog is something that takes a lot more than just some clicking. You need to write and market and traffic and share and do a wide variety of things that you've never even heard of. To put it in a better perspective, check out the SEO tips in this article. In order to improve your search engine optimization, use as much natural language as possible. Don't pack your text full of keywords as search engines will count this against you, knowing it has been a trick to boost search rankings in the past. Instead, use carefully chosen keywords sparsely throughout your text. As you begin to learn about SEO, you will run across terms like frames. Frames can be an attractive feature for your site, but they also cause your site to load very slowly and will make the spiders have to work extra hard to crawl your pages. If you do have frames on your site, make sure you also have a few pages offering ""no frames"" content. SEO SEO is a tool to improve a web site's visibility in search engine results. An optimized web site will help to keep your product or service in the first page or two of search engine results. After all, a web site doesn't do much good if no one can find it. Internal links can be very helpful when trying to create search engine optimization for your site. Embed links in blog posts or articles that use keywords to help a visitor to your site find other information about the information in your blog or article. This will also show an increase in your page-clicks. Searchable words are an important part of search engine optimization. Web crawling bots look for the keywords that a user enters into the search engine. You can help users find your page, by including those keywords in your website. Write advice columns on your site that include those words and people will read your advice, adding credibility to your sit. This will, in turn, bring your page rank up higher. tags When writing a page, for search engine optimization use bold tags on your target keyword for the page. The search engines recognize that what you have put in bold is important and treats the information that way. However, don't bold too many things or it will look bad. Use your location to your benefit. Type in the name of the location you are at to have search engines include you when someone types that same wording into the search bar. For example, if a searcher types ""Snyder Village shops"" and you had mentioned your ""Snyder village store location,"" you are very likely to show up in the search results. If you are running an internet search, it is useful to know, that the first page of search results, are the ones that have the most pertinence to your query. As such, clicking on them, should provide you with the best answers about the topic of concern. A fantastic way to get a more visible site is to use unique and relevant titles and descriptions on each and every page of your site. When you have a title for each page, your site will end up higher on the list for primary search keywords, increasing your visibility. Keyword phrase Whenever it is possible, use your keywords in your URL. Search engines pick up on keywords that are placed in the URL. Instead of using numbers or text in article URLs, try to use a CMS that will use real words. These should be the keywords that readers will, most likely, search for. Put your keyword phrase in a slightly larger font size. The engines value text that is in a larger font size slightly higher than the rest of the text so by doing this you are putting an emphasis on your keyword phrase to the search engines which can increase your rankings. Meta description It is important to write an engaging meta description tag for each page you create in order to achieve proper search engine optimization. Many search engines use it as a blurb to display under a page's title and a descriptive tag will encourage viewers to visit your page, increasing traffic. Place a suggestion box on your website so that visitors can let you know what you should do to increase traffic on your site. if you use any suggestions that are submitted you should credit the person whose idea it was and offer them some type of free gift. Constantly evaluate your website. If you want it included in the first page of search results, it has to be one of the best. Look at your competition and ask yourself how your site stacks up. Be realistic and continue to work to make it better. Get opinions about your website from your friends and family as well. Tips For the best SEO results, remember to have a strong title tag.

3,The world is in chaos: How to lead in times of uncertainty?,business," Once we saw the light at the end of the tunnel and when it started to show that COVID was going to be just a normal part of the normality of life as we knew it, another reality came, war. War is far from us but so close at the same time. A state of war that will be felt by all of us. But I will not write about the war; I want to write something that is useful for any situation of uncertainty, rapid change, or reducing the sense of security. Because this is the world around us and situations like COVID and war only shed more light on it. And I want to write something with a look ahead, beyond the boundaries of the current situation. I want to remind you of what awaits us and the fact that we have to get there and continue to build there. With all these facts, the most important thing is that we are all facing even greater changes than we have experienced in the past. Situations will require us to make greater adjustments than ever before. World policies and views are changing the way we do business. What changes the most is certainty, security, and a clear view of the future. The foundations on which people can function and create optimally are changing. And this is the new reality that companies that want to grow and develop in the long run must respond to. For some time now, the trend has been to ensure sustainability. Have you ever thought that it is essential to involve people in a sustainability strategy? Who has to play a key role in the process of this transformation, or rather, in the process of finding and laying new foundations? The answer to that is simple, everyone. We are all part of the solution, and we all have a lot of work to do and make a lot of changes in the way we work. The role of the owners Owners have a very strong dilemma on the path of sustainability, as they have a higher risk on the one hand and the greatest responsibility on the other. But it is the owners who can set performance criteria on the basis of which they will assess the growth and performance of companies. The excuse that they are being forced into current decisions by the situation in the capital markets is only a reflection of the need for security and anticipation of results. A sustainable view on investment at the moment requires a more visionary approach and even greater risk in the eyes of the owners. Higher risk, of course, brings higher returns. So what do the owners lack: courage, determination, empathy, foucus? The role of the leaders We work best in a state where our core is safe. But in today’s world of uncertainty, change, and personal vulnerability, our cores are at stake. How we protect them depends on each individual and is a complex internal process. In the light of sustainability, managers must ensure that employees strive for sustainable solutions and are healthy, and contribute their maximum input to the company's vision. So, leaders are at a historical turning point. Leadership, in the light of process optimization and cost reduction, is increasingly moving towards supporting employees at their maximum input but with protecting their mental state in mind. All of this requires much more skill and inner stability from leaders. Leaders must be visionary and uncompromisingly goal-oriented, but at the same time compassionate and humane towards their team. Many leaders feel distressed by the internal conflict between satisfying quick results and the owners. But at the same time, develop the team in the long run and prepare it for the next big goals. In addition to the development of competencies, in the light of sustainable management, health is also becoming increasingly important, both for the physical health and the mental health of employees. So leaders need to intertwine more and more segments. But who cares about leaders? We forget that the training of leaders alone is not enough. With all the new realities, leaders are under considerable stress, affecting all aspects of their lives. Even leaders are just people with their inner worlds, beliefs, needs, and fears. Sustainable management should make the mental health of executives one of the priorities of the HR strategy. The role of the employees In an economy where there is a demand and a supply, it is easy to stand and wait with an opinion. When society is ready, we in the company will adapt to this. But the company is dependent on your employees, employees of companies in your supply chain, employees of competing companies, customers,... For a moment, think about what employees are telling you, what their needs are, and what they expect from you. And can you honestly admit how responsive you are to their needs? And I'll ask a different question: how responsive are you to the needs of society? Employees need the same amount of attention in terms of their development and mental health as should be paid to managers. And employees should also take part in the responsibility to communicate the new needs of the company clearly and directly and be active in creating new realities and solutions. All too often, employees fall into a passive role, which is a step away from sustainability. And let me go back to the original thought of disease and war. Both illness and war leave behind sadness, anger, and destruction. How we, as a society, respond to this depends on each individual's ability to ensure a sustainable future that gives optimism in the light of hope and prosperity. The thing is very simple: If you are the owner, choose the management of companies that will take care of the sustainable development of products and businesses and the impact of organizations on society at large with a shaky hand. If you are a representative of the company's management, take care of yourself and your own development, as well as your employees' and their development. Keep in mind that only healthy and happy people can contribute to common victories. And be aware of your own strength and, above all, the responsibility you have for your own world and the micro-worlds of your colleagues. If you are an employee, take your part responsibility for a better tomorrow for you, your company, and your surroundings. Try to resolve all your troubles, misunderstandings, and dilemmas as soon as possible. Share your opinions with your superiors and, above all, strive to learn. What you did today, you can do even better tomorrow. This is how everyone can contribute a piece to the puzzle of sustainable business."
4,Is Change the Future of YOUR Industry?,business," Staying at the forefront of change is imperative as a business owner. You can never assume that “business as usual” will be the way forward. There is no better depiction of this reality than the major disruption that COVID-19 has caused across countless industries, and how we’ve all had to respond. This past year has forced companies to adapt like never before. While many succeeded, others failed to pivot and went out of business as a result. The book ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" by Dr. Spencer Johnson effectively illustrates this concept of change versus stagnation. Through a parable about two mice, Johnson describes by example how to effectively manage change and succeed. The two mice in ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" go to the same place every day for food, but as time goes on there is less and less cheese. One of the mice decides to be adventurous and finds a new place where he can be fed. In the end, trying something new worked for him, and he lives happily ever after. The other mouse keeps doing what he has always done, but the cheese supply runs dry and he finally withers and dies. As times change, seeking out new avenues is essential to the life of your business. One example of this changing landscape can be found in the automobile industry, as companies such as Tesla reinvent what it means to buy a car. Bypassing the traditional car salesmen and large dealership properties, Tesla now makes it easier than ever to buy your car over the internet, in the comfort of your own home — which is truly reflective of the “new normal” we’ve all found ourselves in. The automobile industry is just the tip of the iceberg — adapting to the future is something that all industries and brands need to prioritize. Finding a strategy to continue to find increasingly profitable customers, even as the world transforms, is key. In order to be equipped to help our clients deal with this issue, I’ve recently completed my CRO Thinking training, through professional marketing consulting firm The Revenue Game. The CRO Thinking model helps you escape the commodity trap and pivot seamlessly into products and services that are highly valued by customers, so you can stay on the leading edge of your industry, akin to how the auto industry is pivoting into an exciting and increasingly profitable future. We have a client in the construction industry. They did a lot of construction work for shopping center developers and retail centers. When the pandemic hit, many of the projects they were planning to work on for the balance of 2020 were canceled. We helped them create a marketing strategy around what retailers needed to do to create a safe shopping environment in their stores. As a result, starting in July of 2020, they began to pick up a lot of projects with retailers who were looking to open their stores back up when the pandemic receded and needed to make renovations to their shopping space. Another client was in the plastics industry, they pivoted to become a major seller of face masks that were designed and manufactured by one other their plastic industry suppliers. With respect to Blueprint, we began offering a fixed cost PPP loan application product which was successful in helping us attract 10 new clients. Sometimes the need to change isn’t as evident as what the coronavirus brought upon us. It may be more subtle than a major pandemic. Being aware of what your customer is looking for and being open to change in your business model is paramount to building a long-term stable business. Just like the car industry is moving toward electric vehicles so too is the bicycle industry. Our clients in the bicycle industry are pivoting in the e-bike space and are working to post high growth by offering cool and unique electric bikes."
5,"Leader, Are You Missing the Inventory Management Mark?",business," Do you use historical sales data by SKU to drive future inventory purchasing decisions? If you are basing tomorrow’s inventory demands on yesterday’s numbers, you may be tying up valuable company dollars in slow-selling inventory that no longer meets the mark. Most ERPs solely use historical data in their demand planning modules. While yesterday’s data can be a useful point of reference for future purchasing decisions, historical information alone shouldn’t be seen as an indicator of future demand. Like all aspects of your growth, product planning & purchasing must be forward-focused decisions, rooted in strategy and process improvement. As you look to the future of your product lines, you must integrate past evidence with future trends as you determine the best way forward for your brand. Looking to the future doesn’t mean leaving the past behind. Rather, it means analyzing historical information and identifying relevant metrics to determine future direction. In other words: what does the past say about how your company should respond in the future? Maybe your data shows that your business has been inadequately stocked with some of your most in-demand products, while low-selling items have crowded your warehouse shelves for months. This may indicate a need to better understand your cash conversion cycle, and the factors influencing it. If you’ve been heavily impacted by supply chain issues, that may be another point of consideration. What are you doing to prepare for the future — while protecting yourself from stock outs and lost sales? Having a full picture of what gaps are there in supply chain management, and what changes (whether in terms of order timing or otherwise) will help alleviate the gap between supply and demand in the future. While making process improvements based on your data can substantially impact your brand for the better, you must look externally to determine next steps, not just internally. This starts with having your finger on the pulse of your market, keeping current and future trends at the forefront of your mind as a leader. Not only must you be aware of your internal conversion cycle and product shelf life – you must also plan this against the external lifecycle of a trend in your industry, and key indicators that it’s time for a strategic move with your inventory. Timing is key… as is staying true to your brand’s roadmap. As a leader, you must always balance the lure of industry trends with the stability of your brand image and market differentiation. Stay aware of the landscape, but don’t be distracted by it – otherwise you will surely swerve off course. One of our clients at Blueprint CFO, a consumer products business, was having issues identifying bestselling SKUs and establishing inventory visibility. In fact, because of poor inventory purchasing planning, they were out of their bestselling product for ten months, significantly impacting company sales! Blueprint CFO’s Data Analytics team responded by building out an inventory management tool based on predetermined sales goals. The model strived to look beyond historical sales alone, forecasting future units sold by looking at current inventory (including units available on-hand, units in-transit and units that scheduled for production), as well as predicted trends in the industry, and in terms of product seasonality. Moreover, the tool helped elevate our client’s business by monitoring stock-outs and making recommendations based on top and bottom sellers. We call our report the Green Light/Red Light report. Taking warehouse stock into consideration, the Green Light report showed where the client was in their production plan and what SKUs they didn’t have enough of – resulting in $2.9 million in lost sales if not addressed. The plan indicated where to take action and fill in the gaps. The Red Light report, on the other hand, showed the client their “slow movers”. In other words, the SKUs where inventory exceeded demand. This client had $1.4 million worth of slow-moving products, which we advised them to liquidate, as to reduce storage and insurance costs, invest in their in-demand items, and preserve annual profits. All in all, looking at inventory challenges from a future-focused, strategic perspective, our client has been able to efficiently communicate with various stakeholders, coordinate the process, exceed sales goals and maximize profits overall. Do you have adequate visibility into the gaps and overlaps in your current inventory purchase planning? If not, our team of data-driven experts can help you transform your product planning experience for the better."

7,"Attaching PVC to Metal Piping; How, When and Why?",business," Working with different materials is best left to your plumber. However, it’s good to understand how, why and when a plumbing professional might use two different materials when working in your home. At bluefrog Plumbing + Drain, we fully explain the changes we make, including the materials and equipment used. We know that you want to know what’s going on when it comes to the health and welfare of your home and family. Learn more about PVC and Metal Piping and why it’s sometimes advantageous to mix these two types of pipes. PVC Pipe Many homes and businesses contain PVC pipes. They are useful for vent piping, drainpipes and exterior drainage. PVC is lightweight and has a high tolerance for chemicals used to clean drains and clogs. The durable material is far more flexible than traditional metal pipes such as steel or copper. Our plumbers often recommend it for homeowners upgrading their plumbing. Water flows more easily through PVC, which may prevent frequent clogs. Other Pipe Materials Galvanized metal pipes were once the material of choice for residential plumbing systems. However, other materials, such as PVC and plastic, have withstood the test of time better. White PVC pipes are ideal for outdoor plumbing because they are easy to find and replace. However, hot water comes through your indoor pipes under pressure, so your plumber will use CPVC or metal pipes to replace older galvanized pipes indoors. Some plumbing codes require CPVC for all indoor pipes. Your bluefrog Plumbing + Drain plumber is familiar with local codes and can provide the best options for your home. Galvanized pipes corrode as they age, restricting water flow and leaving your plumbing vulnerable to leaky, broken pipes. It’s a good idea to replace as many as you can when remodeling or upgrading your system. Retrofitting Water Pipes When transitioning to PVC or CPVC piping, it’s best to do so at an elbow, tee or coupling with a female connection. Bluefrog technicians then use male plastic adapters to connect the PVC to the existing metal. Female slip adapters often crack when pressure is applied to seal the connection. This could lead to unnecessary repair bills in the future. For connections from a male threaded pipe, a galvanized coupling creates the necessary female connection where the plastic and metal pipes meet. Using PVC-Metal Connections in Drainpipes Unlike hot water pipes, drainpipes are not under pressure. This entails less risks for leaks. Your bluefrog plumber handles the transition the same way for cold water pipes. However, we can replace a section of drainpipe without rethreading the end of the pipe. Using a flexible connector with the right diameter, we tighten it down to create a pressure seal. The appropriate connectors are made of rubber and have clamps on each side that tighten easily with a socket wrench or screwdriver. We place the clamp on the galvanized pipe, insert the new PVC pipe and tighten the clamps on both ends. To ensure that the seal remains watertight, our plumbers put silicon sealant on the galvanized metal before installing the connector. Since the PVC pipe will remain smooth, there’s no need for a sealant on that end. Glue is a very bad idea for PVC to metal connections. Some plumbers or DIY homeowners try to glue PVC to metal pipes. PVC cement only works with PVC to PVC connections. Again, making plumbing connections involves knowing local codes and having the necessary training. Bluefrog Plumbing + Drain hires licensed, bonded and insured plumbers to complete PVC to galvanized metal connections in your home. Irrigation Systems You can also find PVC to metal connections in irrigation systems. Plastic and metal piping connections work well if the installer understands how to complete the task correctly. We link the PVC to metal components using threaded connections. The plastic male threads link to a female thread on the metal pipe. As mentioned, connecting a female PVC thread with a male galvanized metal thread typically results in cracks and leaks due to the nature of the two materials. Polyvinyl chloride stretches more easily than metal threading. Therefore, a female PVC-male metal fitting strains the PVC thread, causing leaks and cracks. Also, the pipes and fittings don’t have the same diameter. As the threads meld at the connection point, the mail fitting compresses as the female fitting expands. This produces a tight, robust joint that will not leak. Teflon Tape and Dope When your plumber connects the PVC-metal joints of your irrigation system, they use sealer and lubricant so it’s easier to connect the male and female components. We use Teflon tape or Teflon pipe dope to prevent leaks."
8,Broadband Internet Services,business," What Is Broadband? Broadband alludes to different high-limit transmission advances that communicate information, voice, and video across significant distances and at high paces. Normal mechanisms of transmission incorporate coaxial links, fiber optic links, and radio waves. Broadband is constantly associated and eliminates the requirement for dial-up. Its significance is extensive; it takes into account top caliber and fast admittance to data, remotely coordinating, information transmission, and more in different limits, including medical services, training, and innovative development. KEY Important points •	The term broadband alludes to fast and high-data transfer capacity correspondence foundation. •	It usually connects with high velocity Internet services, which have become progressively vital to the two shoppers and states. •	New developments in satellite-based broadband services might actually expand the extent of access all through the world. •	There are six principle kinds of broadband advances: computerized supporter line (DSL), link modem, fiber, remote, satellite, and broadband over electrical cables (BPL). •	The majority of Internet clients (92.6%) across the globe access broadband through their cell phones. Understanding Broadband Today, the conversation of broadband regularly fixates on high velocity Internet access. All things considered, broadband Internet was characterized as being quicker than a conventional dial-up Internet association. Be that as it may, it is currently normal for more exact definitions to be required. For example, the Government Correspondences Commission (FCC) decided in 2015 that, to be viewed as broadband Internet, the assistance should offer download and transfer paces of something like 25 and 3 megabits each second, respectively.1 As a rule, notwithstanding, the two characterizing qualities of broadband are that it is rapid and that it is accessible consistently. Both of these attributes effectively recognize broadband from more seasoned dial-up associations. In addition to the fact that dial was up Internet association more slow, however it was just accessible when explicitly mentioned by the client. Worldwide utilization and velocities On account of its reasonable benefits over dial-up services, broadband Internet access is liked by both end clients and legislatures. The utilization of broadband has been expanding. As per information from the Global Media transmission Association (ITU), the Unified Countries particular office for data and correspondence advancements (ICTs), the assessed number of individuals involving the Internet hit 4.9 billion of every 2021, up from an expected 4.1 billion out of 2019. Broadband rates are additionally getting to the next level. By 2023, the worldwide normal broadband speed is relied upon to be 110.4 Mbps, over two times the normal speed of 45.9 Mbps enrolled in 2018. Versatile paces, in the interim, are anticipated to average 43.9 Mbps in 2023, up from 13.2 Mbps in 2018. Sorts of Broadband The six primary kinds of broadband innovations are advanced endorser line (DSL), link modem, fiber, remote, satellite, and broadband over powerlines (BPL). Advanced supporter line (DSL) DSL sends information over copper wires that as of now exist in homes and organizations from phone lines. The speed of DSL broadband reaches from a few hundred Kbps to a huge number of pieces each second (Mbps).5 There are two essential kinds of DSL innovations: uneven advanced endorser line (ADSL) and even computerized supporter line (SDSL). ADSL is awry on the grounds that its clients get a ton of information yet don't send a ton of information. Home homes where people utilize the Internet principally for surfing, watching films, and playing computer games fall under ADSL. In light of the client profile, ADSL has quicker speeds for the approaching stream than for the active stream. Then again, SDSL is principally utilized by organizations that require quick paces for both sending and getting information. Business Internet needs surpass the commonplace Internet needs of home homes and require sending a lot of information, for example, for videoconferencing. Link modem Link modems take into consideration information transmission on similar coaxial links utilized by link organizations to send pictures and sound to your TV. Link modems are outer gadgets that give paces of 1.5 Mbps or more. Speeds differ contingent upon the choice chose from your link supplier, the link modem, and traffic. On Nov. 15, 2021, President Joe Biden marked the $1.2 trillion Framework Speculation and Occupations Act, which remembers $550 billion for new subsidizing to reconstruct streets and extensions, water foundation, flexibility, and Internet, among different areas of foundation. The new regulation designates $65 billion in assets to grow broadband in rustic regions and in low-pay networks, which regularly need trustworthy admittance to the Internet.4 Fiber Fiber broadband utilizations fiber optic innovation that changes electrical signs over to light. The electrical signs convey information. When changed over to light, the light is sent through straightforward glass filaments. The speed at which fiber sends information is altogether more prominent than that of DSL and link modems, normally by tens or many Mbps. Fiber associations can likewise convey voice and video and go about as an option in contrast to customary link associations. Presently, admittance to fiber is restricted as it expects organizations to work out fiber organizations, which have been developing throughout the course of recent years. Remote Remote broadband is either portable or fixed and communicates information through radio transmissions from the specialist organization's office to the client's area. Remote gives long-range transmissions to regions that are remote and don't approach DSL, link, or fiber. The speed of remote is like the paces of DSL and link. Satellite Satellite broadband is a type of remote broadband however involves satellites in the World's circle to communicate information. Satellite broadband is basic for giving broadband network to distant regions on the planet and is a focal point of numerous innovation organizations that have the objective of giving Internet to the whole globe. Satellite broadband rates shift contingent upon many factors however are for the most part 500 Kbps for downloads and 80 Kbps for uploads.5 Broadband over powerlines (BPL) BPL sends information over existing powerlines, can be set up through a structure's current electrical framework, and offers speeds like DSL and link. BPL is a moderately new innovation and is just accessible in select regions. Notwithstanding, there is a ton of buzz encompassing it predominantly in light of the fact that its utilization of powerlines, which are introduced all over the place, diminishes the need to assemble new expensive framework to serve each broadband customer.5 Unique Contemplations Broadband has been around some time currently, having been acquainted with the world in the mid 2000s. Be that as it may, this space is continually advancing, with new advancements being created to support access, lower expenses, and speed up. One arising boondocks of broadband transmission innovation includes utilizing advanced satellite organizations to give Internet access without the requirement for huge scope interests in earthly framework. An eminent illustration of this arising approach is the Starlink Venture presently sought after by the private space investigation and development organization SpaceX, which is controlled by Elon Musk. The FCC has allowed SpaceX to send off 12,000 satellites intended to work couple to give rapid satellite Internet admittance to clients around the world. SpaceX has additionally recorded administrative work with a global controller to send off up to 30,000 more satellites.6 As of November 2021, Starlink has sent off north of 1,800 satellites.7 If fruitful, the expressed point of the task is to give minimal expense broadband Internet services to clients all through the world, possibly undermining ground-based broadcast communications suppliers all the while. What Is a Broadband Association? Broadband is the transmission of great information of wide transfer speed. In its least complex structure, it is a fast Internet association that is on 100% of the time. Broadband associations incorporate Wi-Fi, DSLs, fiber, and satellites. What Is a Broadband Modem? A broadband modem is an outside gadget that interfaces with fast Internet, for example, over a DSL or link organization. The association is generally on and doesn't need the client to interface prior to utilizing the Internet. What Is Viewed as a Decent Broadband Speed? For standard broadband, a decent speed is 11 Mbps. Quicker rates would be between 11 Mbps and 50 Mbps, and exceptionally quick paces would be 100 Mbps or higher. What Is the Distinction Among Broadband and Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi is a kind of broadband association. Broadband is admittance to the organization that gives the Internet, and Wi-Fi is one of the method for access. Wi-Fi utilizes remote network, fundamentally radio transmissions, to associate. What Is the Contrast Among Broadband and DSL? DSL is likewise a kind of broadband association, like Wi-Fi. Broadband is the technique for getting and sending information. DSL is one of the advancements that take into account this. It utilizes copper links in the house to interface with the Internet. The Reality Broadband is a top notch transmission innovation that takes into account the exchange of voice, video, and information. It is fundamentally utilized in the limit of the Internet, with people and organizations getting to broadband availability through fixed or versatile associations. Many organizations are endeavoring to offer broadband types of assistance to the globe since quick admittance to top notch information is viewed as an advantage to mankind.

9,What I Learned at Expo 2020 Dubai,business," When I was 17 years old I had the opportunity to visit Expo 92 Sevilla. At the time I wasn’t aware of the magnitude of that event. I was there as a musician, playing drums in a local band that went to perform at the Pavilion of Puerto Rico. The show became popular and we were hired to perform at a bigger stage of the expo for a few additional weeks. It was an unforgettable summer. Since then I became a fan of world expositions. Recently, I visited Expo 2020 Dubai, the World Expo currently hosted by Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. This time I went to the expo with a different mindset, and with the mission of learning as much as I could from the infinite knowledge presented at what is now known as The World’s Greatest Show. In simple words, it was a mind-blowing experience. With 192 pavilions representing all the countries recognized by the United Nations, there was no limit for creativity, culture, technology, and imagination. Every corner of this expo had an incredible magnetism that could connect with your mind, body, and soul. It should have been obvious that this expo would be amazing if you look at how the city of Dubai has been developed in recent years as a global point of convergence. Besides, you may not know this, but many of the things you use every day were invented or discovered in the Middle East a long time ago: coffee, algebra, algorithm, cheques, clocks, crankshaft, combination locks, soap, and windmills. I will share some of the lessons I learned at Expo 2020 Dubai that I think every business, organization, and government should adopt to be on the path to help create a better future for humanity. No group alone can define the future, but we all, as a collective, can develop new ways of conducting our human activities in tune with our planet and fellow human beings, to be co-producers of the future. CONNECTING MINDS, CREATING THE FUTURE This was the main theme of the exhibition and it was omnipresent through the Expo 2020 Dubai. Everywhere I looked I found collaboration, connection, imagination, creation, and diversity. People from all around the world have built this expo together. The best talent was brought from wherever it was in the world because the expo organizers wanted to create the best possible experiences. For example, Al Wasl Plaza, the dome at the center of the expo that had a unique projection system that amazed every visitor, is a building from the future. The organizers traveled the world looking for people that could design and build it. They imagined it, but they needed help to make it a reality. So they hired architecture firm Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill from Chicago to design the building, Brogan Group from the UK to help build it, and Creative Technology Middle East to install the audiovisual system. These connected minds created the immersive experience that became the beating heart of Expo 2020 Dubai. The lesson: Let your imagination fly, connect minds, and create your future. OPPORTUNITY, MOBILITY, AND SUSTAINABILITY These were the three sub-themes of Expo 2020 Dubai and the three main districts where the pavilions were organized. Each of these themes had a featured pavilion with an incredible never-seen-before futuristic architecture. Inside each pavilion, there was a message. Mission Possible – The Opportunity Pavilion was about how our lives and actions are interconnected, and how we can transform dreams and aspirations into the realities of tomorrow being an agent of change. Alif – The Mobility Pavilion was about human progress, mobility as an element of the transformation of the way we live and understand other cultures, and exchange of knowledge and ideas to move the world forward. Terra – The Sustainability Pavilion was about taking a sustainable path towards the future and living in balance with our only home, the Earth. Even in a high-tech future, we can live in harmony with nature. Besides these main pavilions, each district had country pavilions related to the themes. One of the most memorable pavilions was the Netherlands. They had one simple message: let’s take care of the oceans before it’s too late, and by the way, we have the technology. I was impressed about how they presented this unique positive message and at the same time showed off their technology as the solution. Brilliant! Another impressive pavilion was the United Kingdom. Also with one direct message: the UK is focused on Artificial Intelligence. Every visitor had to choose a word, and their AI system was creating a poem for each person. At the end of the expo, it would become the biggest AI-generated poem in the world. The other pavilion rated as one of the best by every measure was Germany. They were focused on education, knowledge, research, and human interaction as the key to innovation in the field of sustainability. Each person got a personalized electronic badge that registered each person’s activity to collect data about behavior and preferences related to sustainability. Since the expo had visitors from many countries it’s fair to say that Germany will have a good set of data for research. The lesson: Everything is possible. If each country puts the best of its talents to work towards a sustainable future, we can develop a high-tech world both physical and digital, and at the same time live in harmony with nature. BRANDS At Expo 2020 Dubai I witnessed a festival of brands making waves. Some brands were in competition, others were simply way ahead of their competitors and looked as if they were the only brand in their category. Emirates, the largest airline in the UAE, was the biggest brand of Expo 2020 Dubai. First, because almost everyone coming from other countries to visit the expo flew in one of their airplanes, with many of us lucky to fly their iconic A380. The Emirates brand was ubiquitous. At the airport, or in the sky, you could see the airplanes painted with both Emirates and Expo 2020 Dubai brand styles. The A380 toy models were displayed at every store. Their TV commercial with the flight attendant at the top of Burj Khalifa left everyone speechless. They had a brand pavilion where you could experience the future of commercial aviation, and it was fully booked in advance for weeks. But, most importantly, the Emirates brand is true to its customers and is providing a superior flying experience that can’t be matched by any other airline. Just imagine the glory days of TWA or Pan Am, that’s Emirates today. Even better. Aquafina, the official water of Expo 2020 Dubai, was the other iconic brand. It was present in every store, every kiosk, every restaurant, and even had its own brand pavilion. The brand made a genius move by combining the Aquafina water can design with the Expo 2020 Dubai brand. The result was a beautiful and memorable water can that will become a souvenir of the event. Of course, if you went to the expo then whenever you see the Aquafina brand in the future, you will remember Dubai. The lesson: Brands can become omnipresent using paid media, but when that powerful presence is combined with great customer experiences and authentic connections with people, the brand becomes unforgettable. From what I experienced at Expo 2020 Dubai the future looks amazing. We need to rethink what’s possible in order to overthrow the walls of mental limits. The people of UAE built Dubai, the city of the future, in the desert where others would have thought it would be impossible. That’s why UAE is known as the “Land of Dreamers Who Do”… literally, they dream it, and they do it."

11,How to choose the correct focusing lens,business," The laser focusing lens is the last optical device in the laser path. And the focusing lens is usually a plano-convex lens or a curved lunar surface lens. What is the purpose of the focusing lens? Laser cutting and engraving machines use a laser beam that is approximately one quarter of an inch (240 parts per thousand) in diameter. For high quality engraving and precision cutting, the laser beam uses a system of reflectors and focusing lenses to redirect the laser. The laser system uses a plano-convex lens to focus the laser. The laser enters the convex lens and begins to converge to a focal point, through which the light emanates. This focal point converts the laser beam into a very small and precise spot with very accurate results for a variety of applications. As the laser beam leaves the focusing lens and is positioned within the desired focal distance, it begins to cut or engrave. The focusing tolerance (depth of focus) is the area where the beam diameter is smallest. The larger the lens, the longer the focal length. This is especially important if you want to cut through thick material, in which case you need a larger lens. The shorter the focal length of the lens, the faster the convergence/divergence, the smaller the focal spot and the shorter the depth of focus. As the focal spot becomes smaller, sharper details can be seen in the processed laser image, resulting in a brighter, more detailed image. Which focusing lens is best for which type of project? The most common laser lenses are 1.5-inch, 2-inch, 2.5-inch and 4-inch. All lenses are suitable for cutting and engraving work. Which lens is best for your application? 1.5-inch lenses. High resolution engraving. Best for thin (less than 1/16 inch) materials. Small type or very fine detail engraving. Approximately 40% smaller than 2.0-inch focus lenses. Thickness of about 38.5 mm, suitable for very thin materials. 2.5-inch lens. Most commonly used in laser systems. Versatile, engraving and cutting applications. Graphics with medium detail and resolution. Most pieces are approximately 63.5 mm thick. 4-inch lens. Used for longer vertical distances. For cutting thicker materials. Approximately 101.6 mm thick for very thick materials. As an important conclusion, you can see that the more delicate and detailed the graphic is, the smaller the lens should be. For cutting thick materials, it is recommended to use the largest size lens. Important Notes The lens you need is directly related to your application. The following are some important considerations that will define the lens you must use. The output of the laser device (laser beam power) Material and application (cutting or engraving). The level of detail of the graphic. The thickness of the material. Our company specializes in the production of laser lenses and laser focusing lenses.

13,5 Content Marketing Trends for 2022,business," Content marketing is not a new concept, but it is arguably more important than ever from both a consumer and business perspective. Trust is high on the agenda of potential customers in the privacy age, especially given that consumers around the globe feel financially insecure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, where they look to spend their money looks vastly different to that of pre-2020, with dependability and confidence key criteria when selecting brands. Businesses too are looking to get back on their feet as COVID-19 has rocked the global economy. Content marketing focuses on the customer; a form of communication that focuses on educating and informing a target audience with the purpose of solving their problem. Businesses need to tap into this opportunity as consumers expect brands to understand their needs, and tailor content and solutions to suit. With that in mind, brands should look to have content as a key part of their 2022 marketing budget. Here are five key content marketing tips and trends that brands should look to implement in 2022: Communicating without insight is like shouting in a dark room and hoping someone responds. Worse, brands can fall into the trap of spending precious business resources - namely money and time - to produce content that fails to hit the mark as it is not informed by data. Content marketing focuses on the customer, so be sure to understand their problem and decision-making journey. Specifically, ensure that you connect your technology to the user journey. Ask yourself, “why would a potential customer land on my website or blog, and what would they want to see? And what action will they take?” Video helps grab attention, and more importantly, keep it. According to an infographic by Social Media Today, 83% of people claimed that video increases the time they spend on a page. In addition, 85% of people said they would welcome more video content from businesses. This represents a great opportunity for content marketers. If you have a blog, use video via social media, for example, to help drive traffic to your content. Also, look to embed video even in your written content to further engage your audience. The key is to understand your audience’s needs and develop videos to suit. 68.1% of all website visits in 2020 came from mobile. This was up from 63% in 2019. Smartphones are information hubs for users. More importantly, users are more in control than ever regarding their content preferences. So, it is crucial that content marketers continue to optimize the mobile experience, with speed the most important factor in an age where users have lower attention spans due to the instant gratification that smartphones bring. Trust is not only a key factor for consumers, but also for Google. A website’s authority is an important aspect in how Google determines its search rankings, and in a competitive digital landscape, brands need to focus strongly on their SEO. Yes, optimizing articles and content through checkpoints such as meta descriptions and image alt text is important, but a focus outside your own blog or website is also key. Building a strong backlink profile is vital in driving strong domain authority as the higher this authority, the likelier you are to rank higher in Google search. Guest posting on other high-authority, relevant websites and investing in PR are tactics that are not outdated. Bloggers and influencers work hard to build their own social media following and web presence, so tap into these where relevant to drive traffic to your site, and more importantly build trust in the privacy age. Factors such as isolation and time at home have seen a huge rise in social media use. There is a shift towards social shopping, and the numbers suggest there is a huge opportunity for businesses to implement this as part of their social media strategy: Number of social commerce buyers has increased by 25.2% in the US. Number of social commerce buyers is on track to cross 100 million by 2023. 18% of US consumers clicked a “buy” button on social media in 2020, up from 13% in 2019. Plus, as many as 70% of consumers look to discover a product on Instagram. Social shopping, in conjunction with thought leadership in content marketing, can allow brands to deliver a seamless experience for users online that can help build trust and drive economic recovery. Effective content marketing can play a key role in helping businesses rebuild. Consumers are seeking brands they can trust, so it is important for these brands to put themselves in front of their target audience in the decision-making journey."
14,Passive Income Secrets,business," If earning passive income is that easy, why is not everyone getting rich? Why are there still people struggling with their passive income stream? Why are there people who think passive income is a scam while others are making hundreds of thousands of dollar every year? The answer: Because they do not know the secrets behind the passive income opportunities. Secret #1 Passive income is not get-rich-quick scheme. Many people thought earning passive income is easy and never expect to put any hard work into it. The truth is, just like any business venture, a passive income opportunity will cost you time and effort before it brings you any decent income. For instance, to sell an eBook on Asian food recipes, you need to spend time planning its content, compiling information, writing it, editing it, formatting it and marketing it. The whole process could easily take months before you earn your first buck of passive income. Unfortunately many passive income seekers enter the business with the wrong mindset and give up when things do not meet their expectations. Secret #2 Persistence is the key. To be a successful passive income earner, one not only needs to be innovative but also be persistent. Receiving monthly rent of your property might be easy, but you still have the responsibilities as the landlord and you will be the person the tenants call when something in the property goes wrong. The same applies on selling eBooks online where you need to update your websites with new information and features to keep the clients coming back. Expect to do follow-up on the source of your passive income so that it keeps generating money for you in the long run. Secret #3 You need to work on your passive income alongside your permanent job. Many people misunderstood that active income and passive income are mutually exclusive. They are not, at least at the beginning! It is not practical to quit your day time job just to build your passive income streams. If you do, you are only creating more tension to your financial situation because you would have to rush and squeeze money out of your passive income. Instead, focus on developing your passive income while still receiving your steady monthly pay from your employer. How to Make Your First Buck Online- The advent of Internet has made money making easier than ever. Instead of being physically present at a certain location to promote and sell your products or services, you now have the whole world as your potential clients! It is no wonder that more and more people are turning to internet to make their passive income. How to start making your first buck online? One of the simplest way is to develop and market information products or in other words, an eBook. Pick a topic. Find an area of your interest or something you are familiar with. For example, if you are working in a publishing company as an editor, you can share tips on publishing magazines or self-publishing. Survey the market- Use “Google External Keyword” tool to find out the search volume for your market. Search volume reflects the interest of the online population on your topic. As long as the “keyword” of your topic has a decent search volume, you can assume that your informational product would have some demand when it is put up on sale. Brainstorming for ideas- Keep a list of ideas for your topic, either on your note book or on your computer. The single major benefit of writing down all your ideas as they come in is that you can avoid forgetting about them. This strategy would save you much time if you use it regularly. Get a website up- You need a platform to promote and sell your informational product. Start with using free blogsite such as Blogspot or WordPress. As your traffic builds up and you are really making an income, consider to upgrade to web hosting site where you have more freedom in customising the website for the content. Draw traffic to your website- A common strategy is by creating interesting content on your blogsite. This free information serves two purposes: first, to educate the public about the topic and secondly, prime them to purchase your ebook! You can also go to a similar blog, post relevant comments and share the link to your articles. From Passive Income to Financial Independence- Growing your passive income online to eventually achieve financial independence requires some extra work. Here are some tips to do exactly that – fire up your passive income! Sharing Is Caring- First rule in growing your passive income is you must demonstrate genuine interest and be genuine in sharing. Your potential clients can feel it from the content of your website. Be honest about your products. Generally people will not mind if you are recommending something useful however, you can turn people off easily if people realize what you recommend is actually of less value than you claim. Use social networks- As the popularity of the social media skyrockets, it would make no sense if you take advantage of them to promote your products. Use social media such as Facebook and Twitter to get in touch with your fans and potential clients. Reply to every comment and reply every email. Engage the readers in all conversations. Slowly, you will build a marketing army which will market your products for you in their network. Build a subscriber list- A list of subscribers to your blog is essentially a list of potential customers who are really interested at what you can offer them. It is much easier to promote your products to these subscribers and get them to buy your products rather than doing a general promotion online. Focus on value- This is one of the most powerful strategies. If you can deliver valuable products consistently, who would not want to own them? Put your passion into growing your passive income and aim to educate your clients with your products. It will keep them coming back for more. Now you are set to generate passive income online with your informational product!! To your great success on your passive income journey, Bob Edwards"

Reviews from other people who have worked with the lawyer in question can provide valuable information on their experience with them and the results of their case. A quick web search can reveal reviews of the lawyer, their law firm, and things they've written. Always read more than one review, if possible, to get a better sense of whether or not that lawyer may be right for your case. Look at the lawyers’ websites When you are looking for the right personal injury lawyer near you, you can also start by looking at the lawyers’ websites.

When you place convex mirrors in blind spots or areas that are out of view, it deters criminals and thieves. Mirrors are thus an excellent crime prevention tool that you should employ. Use Motion Detection Motion detection is regarded as the backbone of any security system. It's the feature to detect if a person is on your premises at a time when they shouldn't be. They instantly go off when the sensor gets tricked by movement. It, in turn, transmits a signal to the control panel of your security system, which then moves to the central monitoring centre.

Use Glassbreak Detection A Glassbreak detector is a sensor employed in electronic burglar alarms. It detects if a glass panel is broken or shattered. It utilizes a microphone that tracks any vibrations originating from the glass. When the vibrations go beyond a specific threshold, the sensor gets triggered, and the central monitoring centre of your alarm provider will be notified. Glassbreak detection is ideal for massive warehouses with ground-level windows. In such facilities, it's difficult to keep a tab on every part of the building. Incorporate a Building Access Control. Building access control technology is suitable for permitting and restricting entry into your warehouse or specific areas within it. Only relevant people who have permission can encroach into your premises with a suitable building access control plan. To limit the entry points into your warehouse, you can make use of a key fob entrance or key card plan. You can integrate access control systems into various commercial security solutions, like CCTV, for greater effectiveness. Test Your System Frequently. It's essential to test your security systems frequently to ensure that everything is working correctly. Security experts suggest that your alarm system be tested on a weekly basis. If you neglect timely testing, you'll only increase the chances of incurring a costly theft. Incorporate Environmental Control To protect sensitive materials and operations, it's essential to integrate process and environmental monitoring. Environmental monitoring can indeed be a lifesaver during emergency events. It can also enhance operational efficiency and bring down expenses. It also tracks the pressure, run state, flooding, power, and alerts you of any modifications in any of these categories. Checklist for Warehouse Safety Different processes should be monitored and updated when required. They should assess the effectiveness of present safety precautions and recognize safety hazards. It's important to conduct regular audits to enhance warehouse security. Here is an inspection checklist covering the significant areas you need to examine in your warehouse. Review of present safety precautions. Assessment of company records for workplace accidents. Evaluation of warehouse safety training program. Implementation of safety procedures. Assessment of storage for potential hazards. Finding if employees are following material handling procedures. Assessment of staff for ergonomic movement. Posture and workload while manual transportation of goods in the warehouse. The audits should be in compliance with Toronto's warehouse safety rules and regulations.

Yes 8 hinges are about to derail a store opening and cause a contractor a serious headache. These high-end hidden hinges proved to be much more difficult than originally thought. The contractor underestimated how difficult these European style hinges were, and at the last minute, what was thoughts to be a quick install, proved to derail the entire project, and cause a tense scene instead of a celebratory one. Fortunately, this contractor found about Mike and HexCorp 6 months ago. It was around the time when the supply chain was forcing companies to search for the possibilities of making parts or components they purchased regularly in the United States. That is exactly what Mike and HexCorp does. They are a prototyping and manufacturing company that helps design, consult, prototype, and manufacture. Located in Van Nuys, Mike has been assisting with people, and companies for more than 2 decades. With offices in China and the US HexCorp caters to a wide variety of clientele. Whether you are an individual with an idea, or you are a large corporation looking to save time or money producing a part or component HexCorp could be a valuable resource for you. HexCorp handles Laser cutting, CNC Machining, 3D Printing, Rapid Prototyping, Manufacturing, and much more. The contractor called Mike and consulted over the issue of not having a template, or routing jig to create the perfect holes for the hinges. A problem that was going to affect the contractor, the designer, and the owner. Mike suggested a laser cut template that would solve the problem. Within 2 hours the template was ready. Mike called me, and I went over to his office, and a test proved to solve the problem. “I picked up the product and went to the store to install the hinges. They worked perfectly and everyone was happy that the store would open in time.” Hector said. While we do live in a world where we assume everything is made overseas, and that it is not possible to get something built, prototyped, or manufactured locally there are still companies like HexCorp in our backyard. HexCorp handles everything from developing ideas with you, all the way through to cost effective contract manufacturing. Mike can share stories similar to the one the contractor above had over many camp fires. “I enjoy helping people and companies solve problems and realize dreams they only imagined. I guess it is kind of being a part of Santas Workshop”. - Says Mike. So if you are thinking about or currently buying parts or components give Mike and Hexcorp a call they just might save you time and money."

1,Effective Ways to Enhance Your Warehouse Security,business," Recently, security has taken on greater importance. Loss due to theft can be ruinous for any business. Warehouses contain special equipment and stock. They are thus a tempting target for criminals. In-house thefts plague warehouse owners worldwide. It's thus vital that you take effective security measures to protect your goods and your warehouse. It's best to always consult a 24-hour locksmith in Toronto if you want any security services for your warehouse. They will give you solutions tailored to your budgets, and your needs. Given below are some helpful ways to safeguard your warehouse's security. Employee Identification Many people frequent warehouses in a single day. It's thus crucial for you to identify your staff members from outsiders. Some good measures include giving your staff members a uniform to wear. You can also provide them with name badges to better differentiate them from outsiders. Another great measure is enabling your visitors to sign in, so you have a good idea of who has been on your premises. It will prevent any suspicious person from coming into your warehouse and stealing valuables. Install Mirrors Many warehouse owners don't realize how valuable mirrors are as a security tool. When you place convex mirrors in blind spots or areas that are out of view, it deters criminals and thieves. Mirrors are thus an excellent crime prevention tool that you should employ. Use Motion Detection Motion detection is regarded as the backbone of any security system. It's the feature to detect if a person is on your premises at a time when they shouldn't be. They instantly go off when the sensor gets tricked by movement. It, in turn, transmits a signal to the control panel of your security system, which then moves to the central monitoring centre. A central monitoring centre operates 24/7, thus taking care of the safety of your warehouse at all times. Use Glassbreak Detection A Glassbreak detector is a sensor employed in electronic burglar alarms. It detects if a glass panel is broken or shattered. It utilizes a microphone that tracks any vibrations originating from the glass. When the vibrations go beyond a specific threshold, the sensor gets triggered, and the central monitoring centre of your alarm provider will be notified. Glassbreak detection is ideal for massive warehouses with ground-level windows. In such facilities, it's difficult to keep a tab on every part of the building. Incorporate a Building Access Control. Building access control technology is suitable for permitting and restricting entry into your warehouse or specific areas within it. Only relevant people who have permission can encroach into your premises with a suitable building access control plan. To limit the entry points into your warehouse, you can make use of a key fob entrance or key card plan. You can integrate access control systems into various commercial security solutions, like CCTV, for greater effectiveness. Test Your System Frequently. It's essential to test your security systems frequently to ensure that everything is working correctly. Security experts suggest that your alarm system be tested on a weekly basis. If you neglect timely testing, you'll only increase the chances of incurring a costly theft. Incorporate Environmental Control To protect sensitive materials and operations, it's essential to integrate process and environmental monitoring. Environmental monitoring can indeed be a lifesaver during emergency events. It can also enhance operational efficiency and bring down expenses. It also tracks the pressure, run state, flooding, power, and alerts you of any modifications in any of these categories. Checklist for Warehouse Safety Different processes should be monitored and updated when required. They should assess the effectiveness of present safety precautions and recognize safety hazards. It's important to conduct regular audits to enhance warehouse security. Here is an inspection checklist covering the significant areas you need to examine in your warehouse. Review of present safety precautions. Assessment of company records for workplace accidents. Evaluation of warehouse safety training program. Implementation of safety procedures. Assessment of storage for potential hazards. Finding if employees are following material handling procedures. Assessment of staff for ergonomic movement. Posture and workload while manual transportation of goods in the warehouse. The audits should be in compliance with Toronto's warehouse safety rules and regulations. It will ensure that your warehouse remains safe for everyone."
2,Outbound Demand Generation Helps Drive Inbound B2B Leads | StartUP MQL,business," The impact between inbound marketing and outbound demand generation is often debated among sales teams. As a small-to medium SaaS business, you might wonder what the best approach for your company would be? What channel is going to deliver the highest quality B2B Leads and the most opportunities into the sales pipeline, in the shortest amount of time, while being cost effective? | StartUP MQL First, let’s quickly review the difference between inbound marketing and outbound demand generation and the impact they can have. Inbound marketing generates leads by engaging with your ideal audience and reaching them with useful content through organic and paid efforts, such as search engines (SEO or SEM), knowledge base videos or paid video ads, article or blog post, and even paid placement by placing banner ads on social media platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook. Outbound demand generation curates leads through proactive, direct communication initiated by an SDR or sales rep. This approach is highly targeted, offers a wider reach into many verticals and allows you to focus your efforts on your buyer personas. Outbound demand generation or outbound lead generation is usually done in the form of cold calls, email marketing campaigns, and by sending InMails to contacts in LinkedIn. Personally, I’ve worked on the ground floor with many SaaS startups as the Head of Marketing and Demand Generation, and historically outbound marketing generated more qualified leads, leads converted into customers faster, and resulted in higher revenue streams than inbound marketing. There any many variables to consider on how an inbound marketing strategy will perform, for an example; If someone on your team has to manually create and issue login credentials before a user can gain access your SaaS product, then you are creating an unnecessary barrier to entry and your audience may reject creating an account at all. This could potentially cost you tens-of-thousands of marketing dollars. I’ve witnessed this exact scenario with a SaaS startup I was consulting, however, after convincing them to enable Self Signup and to give their users immediate access to the platform their lead conversions went up by 46%. Outbound Marketing Helps Navigate and Prioritize Content Marketing For Targeted B2B Lead Generation Outbound sales are a great way to get in touch with an audience that you've carefully curated and know will benefit from your SaaS product or service. Because these targeted approaches work more quickly, they're often used in conjunction with other marketing strategies such as email campaigns so information can be delivered right when it's needed most! Content marketing is an effective inbound strategy that can be used to attract potential customers and leads through free content. Content marketing is an excellent long-term strategy that can form the foundation for your entire lead generation strategy. You can use articles, blogs posts and other online content to build relationships with potential customers over time so they'll come back when they need your services the most! When you're looking for quick wins with content marketing, it's important not to overlook outbound sales conversations. By understanding your customers' common search phrases for products and services they need you can curate specific content that will resonate and provide them marketing content through blog posts, published articles or even whitepapers. Click here for additional tips on how to improve your content marketing to generate B2B leads. Outbound Marketing Increases Organic Web Traffic and B2B Lead Generation Outbound marketing is a great way to increase organic traffic back to your site and increase brand awareness. You're probably placing a link back to your site in each marketing email you send, well, each time your link is clicked your search engine rankings improve with Google, because Google registers the click as an organic click back to your site. We often see customers interact with a brand on average seven times before taking an action. However, it's important to note the ""rule of seven"" also says outbound sales efforts are effective at converting prospects who have engaged with your company in some way--perhaps even just through links in email or social media posts! Outbound Marketing Helps Specify Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) for Successful Account Based Marketing (ABM) and B2B Lead Generation The ideal customer profile (ICP) specifies the types of companies you want to sell to, and the benefit of speaking directly with the potential customer is that you can learn about their needs and desires.You can use this opportunity to learn about the products and services they are most interested in. Defining your ICP will give you a better idea of who the ideal customer is for each product or service. Use the following metrics to better help you outline details of your target company: Years in business Revenue Location Industry Number of Employees Target Customers (B2B or B2C) Once you’ve specified your target ICP, use this information to steer your inbound marketing strategy. Outbound Marketing Helps Structure The Customer’s Buyers Journey You can also learn more about your buyer's persona by looking at their outbound interactions. While your ICP are the companies you want to sell to, your buyer’s persona specifies individuals in each company responsible for purchasing your SaaS product or service. Outbound marketing resources (BDR) can ask questions to ascertain who within an organization makes buying decisions and what that process looks like. The sales team benefits by knowing details about the buyer’s journey before they even start the sales dialog, so make sure to collect and share the following information: Where they have looked for SaaS services or products like yours. The key terms they searched when discovering your SaaS services or products. What information they require before making a buying decision. Outbound Marketing Helps Identifying Information Gaps When businesses are able to identify their Ideal Customer Profile and understand the buyer's journey, they often experience resistance with their lead generation efforts. The outbound marketing team BDRs can help by asking current or potential customers specific questions that identify the exact parts of the sales process that are not resonating with them and this should provide the insights required to make positive changes to the sales process. Inbound marketing does not always allow two-way communication between the sales team and prospects, and therefore you may not discover the reasons why a potential customer did not purchase your product or service. The outbound marketing team an alleviate this problem by filling in the necessary information gap that the inbound marketing team was not able to collect. Outbound Marketing Increases Retargeting Ads For Increased B2B Leads Retargeting ads enables your company to display targeted ads to users who visited your website or app, but did not convert into a signup, customer, or lead. Your outbound marketing efforts will drive users who have a need for your product or service to your website, in most cases this will be their first interaction with your website and discovering your company. If a user does not convert into a customer or lead the first time they visit your site, then retargeting ads will keep your brand and products at the forefront. It has been proven that retargeting ads are 10+% more successful at driving clicks back to your site then traditional PPC ads. The efforts you put into email marketing should drive the majority  of your website's traffic, so setting up retargeting ads will increase your brands awareness, traffic back to your website and improve your overall lead conversions.

3,What is freedom to you?,business," Hello and welcome friends!  I want to talk about something that I feel very passionate about. So, let me pose you this very simple question. What is freedom?  Specifically I want to ask you what freedom is to you?  I ask you to please have an open mind and read this for a few minutes. I promise I’m not just rambling for nothing. I have a very definite, thought provoking thought that I need to share with you that absolutely describes who I am and what I believe in. So get your favorite cup of drink, relax and read what I have to say. My Greatest Fear:  A life of bondage to pressure If you're not living a life you're proud of, if you are at risk of coming to the end of your life and realizing you’ve never lived. I’ve been there people and I have scars to prove it. A life full of regret, despair and hopelessness. A life of enormous pressure of living paycheck to paycheck and not seeing an end to your life. I too, have worked that job with a horrible boss who micro-managed me to the point of timing my bathroom breaks. This boss regularly cursed at me for something that I had very little control over. My self esteem took a monstrous tumble. I can’t remember when I was starting to get cussed out. I didn’t even have the self respect to defend myself and had turned into a human punching bag. The worse part was I was living paycheck to paycheck and I couldn’t afford to quit this job. I was living a life of bondage from debt. If you want to follow your dreams and passions to set your soul on fire, this is how you do it. So this is an important idea today that we're going to look at. It's, it's not just what you're moving away from. It's what you're moving toward. So you need to know what you're moving away from. But it's just as important that you know what you're moving towards, if you know what you're moving towards, then you can gladly and happily move towards us. What is freedom to me? This quote is from a man named Ryan Nicodemus, one of the famous minimalists of our time. And he said, Imagine a life with less, less stuff, less clutter, less stress, and debt, and discontent. So what he's what he suggested we do, and I really, really, really agree with this, is to once you know, you want to make a change, you'd like to make changes in your life. And if you're reading this, then you have an idea of the life you want to move towards, what you want to move away from. And what he suggests you do is imagine a life with less because you can't live a  simple life with a lot of stuff.  I’m talking materialism. So imagine the life of your dreams. Imagine a life with less stuff. But with more travel. Imagine fitting everything you own into a suitcase and just getting going. Imagine a life that is so frugal, that you rarely need to work, you can work 23-46 months out of the year, maybe you can work a year, and then take two years off. Imagine a life lived under your conditions, a life of freedom and a life of your choice.  This is my dream. I’m talking minimalism. Picture a life of freedom:  Living your dreams So changing is hard, it's fearful. All your fear wants to paralyze you into your comfort zone. And so part of breaking out of the comfort zone is to create a mental image in your mind of what you're moving towards. And by reading this right now, I'm sure you're creating this image in your mind of what your life could be. And once you have started to solidify what you want your life to me, and and the life of your dreams, the life of your passions, what makes your heart sing and set your soul on fire. Keep it in the front of your mind and say I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Today I'm going to take a small step that moves me towards that life, that life of my dreams. The life of such a frugal life. I'm not a slave a wage anymore. I'm not a slave to money. I’m not a slave to a job and to a demanding boss. I no longer have to use my lunch hour to squeeze in a time for job interviews. No more garbage boss for me. Take back your self respect and dignity you once had Imagine going to a job interview, to interview your employer for their fitness to work with you!  If you sense any arrogance, competitiveness or paranoia during the interview, YOU have the option to terminate the interview because they are not good enough for you and your time!  You choose who you work for, regardless of the pay because your life is frugal and need very little money to live and you have emergency money in the bank. Yes, cash is king and you have it. If my boss is awful to me, I go to him and say I'm done here. You're awful to me, I'm not going to work for you, I'm going to go find another job, you can do that. You can have your money because you don't need any money. You know, you can either need so much money that you have to put up with a high paying but very demanding, even demeaning boss, who just treats you so badly; OR you can need so little to live and be happy that you can break his control over your life. So imagine a life so frugal that you need so little money that you own and control your life. You can go where you want to go, you can be what you want to be. You can live simply and just have the life of adventure and travel that you long for. But it all begins with recognizing I don't like where I am and I want my own life. I want this life and imagining that new life in your mind. A new life with less stress with less discontent with less stuff with less money with less need for money, and more and more and more. I'm talking Freedom! You break the chains of materialism. Because that's what makes you a slave. That dollar makes you a slave and you got to break it. So create this new image of what you're moving towards, be aware of what you're moving from, and take daily steps, daily, small steps. Take a baby step on a regular basis, to move towards the life of your dreams, living the life that you've created in your mind. And it's out here in front of you. You're driving down the road with the beautiful scenery because there's somewhere else I want to be right now. So I'm going, that can be you. I hope you hold on to the dream and you put it in your mind and you make it happen. Take the actions necessary to make it happen. folks, I hope you got something out of this. Have you noticed that there are more older workers in America?  Life is getting especially hard for those who are in retirement age and this picture is getting a lot worse. What can you do about it so that you can retire and not having to work in your older years. I’ll tell you about it next."
4,5 Great Ways To Foster A Positive Workplace Culture,business," Fostering a positive workplace culture is one of the most important investments you can make in your business. Studies show that companies which are considered to be positive and supportive by their employees are more likely to retain personnel, and less likely to have employees taking sick leave. This means that there are not just emotional consequences to having a positive workplace culture, but tangible results too — such as less disruptions and lower employee turnover. A positive workplace culture is usually defined as one that is relaxed, professional, supportive, and diverse, with clear lines of communication and room for regular growth and improvement. But how do you create and foster this culture? While the answer may be complex, let’s explore five of the key ways that you can make a difference. If you are keen to foster a positive workplace environment, start by letting others know. Whether you are a small or large team, getting others on board with your goals and aspirations is a great way to encourage collaboration. Begin by considering what a positive workplace culture would look like for your business. It may mean, for example, that everyone is working to their own strengths, communicating regularly and positively, and continually improving, for example. Whatever form your positive workplace culture takes, get clear on your goals and involve your other team members in the process. They may also have some excellent ideas of their own! Recent surveys revealed that the most popular companies and employers regularly invest in their teams and their personnel. In practice, this means that employees are encouraged to continually grow, improve, and pursue their interests. In the workplace, this might mean investing in courses or training for your employees so that they can achieve promotions or take on additional responsibilities. It may also be less tangible, such as investing in their health and wellbeing with increased holiday allowances, exercise incentives, or anything that helps to support them physically and emotionally. It can also be helpful to consult your team on what kinds of things they feel would most benefit them — whether that’s investing in equipment and expertise, through to training, time off, and more. It is often overlooked, but seeking expert advice can be a key component of fostering and maintaining a supportive workplace culture. This may mean getting professional advice to know what guidelines and policies to have in place regarding serious issues such as bullying and discrimination in the workplace, as well as more daily considerations such as fair wages and health cover. Industry experts will be able to advise on common, complex issues - such as how to fairly terminate an employment contract, or why coming to a settlement agreement with an employee might be better than facing a tribunal claim, for example. Hiring an expert will involve an initial financial outlay, but it can easily prove to be an investment that pays off enormously. This is because experts can prevent costly mistakes from ever developing, while helping to ensure that a positive culture is embedded in your organisation at all levels. A key part of a positive workplace culture is fun! Along with fair wages, adequate work-life balance, and sick leave, the ability to have fun while working features very highly on the list of employment satisfaction criteria. A great way to encourage fun in the workplace is to celebrate specific milestones achieved by your team. You could celebrate with a party or team-building event, a special meal, bonuses, or even something light-hearted in the office itself. You can even consult your team on the celebration or reward that they would like the best! However you choose to celebrate, try to encourage and incentivise your employees while ensuring that the process is positive too. And remember - employees who feel valued, respected, and heard are far more likely to deliver their best work. Open dialogue and good communication are key aspects of positive workplace culture, so try to ensure that managers - or others in positions of authority - are available at specific times to discuss issues. To help facilitate this, some employers organise regular opportunities for employees to share honest feedback, review policies and projects, and collaborate on solutions. The Key Takeaways By making your goals known, ensuring that the process (and not just the outcome) is fun, and encouraging open communication and collaboration, you can build the foundations for a positive workplace culture, and give yourself the best chance of attracting and retaining the most talented employees!"
5,What is Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)?,business," (DISCLAIMER: This information is for educational and awareness purposes ONLY.) What type of information about yourself is floating around in the world? It’s no secret that the majority of the world has turned to becoming a technology-reliant world. With that being said, information that used to take time and effort to accumulate, is now readily available at your fingertips. OSINT stands for Open-Source Intelligence. OSINT is the process of obtaining information about a person or group through social media, search engines, and public records. In this article, I’ll go over the types of individuals that use Open-Source Intelligence, why they use this, types of information that can be found, and how to mitigate risks. WHO USES OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE? There are many reasons to conduct Open-Source Intelligence searches, unfortunately, I would estimate that only 30% of those searches are ethical or in good faith. Social Engineers/Hackers – Prior to 90% of cyber-attacks, hackers obtain identifiable information through search engines, social media, and public records. The more information they have, the easier it comes to perfecting a direct attack on an individual. Future Employers – It should be no surprise that almost all mid-to-large size companies perform basic OSINT searches on their applicants. It’s an easy method to understand a background or personality of their potential employee (per se). Investigators – Whether you’re currently in a civil suit, under criminal investigation, or simply a party to either, you should be expecting a Private Investigator or government agency to pull as many of your details as possible. This includes; whereabouts, family members, friends, frequent hangouts, photos, vehicles, and so on, and so forth. Competitors – Competitive Intelligence research is conducted by Investigators or third parties on behalf of a competing business to understand the ins-and-outs of their competition. Something as simple as a Google Review can provide great information to a competing business. EX Spouse/Significant Other – Everyone knows at least ONE person that has dealt with an unhinged and unhappy ex. Whether it’s part of a divorce/custody trial, or simply a previous significant other than can’t seem to move on, the amount of information a person throws around on the internet can seriously affect a their future. TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE FOUND Unfortunately, most people believe that just because they can open up a Google search page, they’re automatically an “Investigator”. Aside from how valuable search engines may be, this is far from the truth. Furthermore, the basic internet that we use from day-to-day if roughly only about 5-10% of the ACTUAL internet. The Deep Web consists of over 90% of online information. However, this information isn’t “indexed” like Google and other search platforms. With that being said, there are far easier ways that individuals can locate information about you; Social Media • Relationship status • Children • Workplace • College/School • Friends/Acquaintances • Location Tags • Hashtags • Photos of your home address • Online Questionnaires that provide sensitive information • Date of Birth • Most Visited shopping places Online Databases (Used by Investigators, Law Enforcement, and Attorneys) • SSN • Date of Birth • Phone numbers • Email addresses • Current and previous home addresses • Family tree • Vehicle tag information • Criminal cases • Civil cases • Much, much more Search Engines • Reverse image searches • Google reviews • Links to previous accounts/photos Business License Search • Business name • Company addresses • Company Officers/Owners • Contact information Tax Assessors • Home address • Owner name • Contact information • Blueprint of home Courts • Criminal cases • Civil cases • Traffic citations • DOB • SSN • Associated parties • Attorney office name • Vehicle description • Phone number • Home addresses • Names of children • Financial affidavits • Much, much more ARE OSINT SEARCHES LEGAL? Are Open-Source Intelligence searches legal? Well, yes and no. The legalities surrounding OSINT are a bit vague. OSINT searches are legal if a person, with no malicious intent or breach of privacy, obtains information that a “reasonable person” could locate. In other words, if it seems wrong, it is wrong. PREVENTATIVE MEASURES Unfortunately, there is no full-proof way of protecting yourself on the internet. As most Investigators know, “if there’s a will, there’s a way”. However, there are a few steps you can take to reduce potential risks. Keep all of your social media pages private. If you are public with your significant other or spouse, ensure that their pages are also private. This is sometimes used as a backdoor. Remove online reviews. Many, many times this has been used to identify the location of a person, their friends, and places they frequently visit. Treat the information you give online or to others as a “need to know basis”. This means absolutely DO NO fill out an online questionnaire asking for your birthplace, pet’s name, school mascot, etc. The best method to understand and prevent OSINT searches is to research yourself from the sources that were previously listed. You will discover how much of your personal information is readily accessible to the average stranger."
6,Things to consider when applying for a Gold Loan,business," Getting a gold loan is a great option these days. But before you decide to get one, there are some things that you should keep in mind. This blog will look at some of those things and want you to be aware of. But, there are a few things to bear in mind when applying for a loan: 1.) The gold’s value determines the amount of the loan The amount of loan eventually approved will be contingent on the gold’s worth. That means that the greater the purity of the gold, the more valuable its value and the amount of the loan will be. Suppose you are pledging gold jewellery containing valuable or semi-precious stones or other metals. In that case, these elements will be removed for assessment. The amount you are granted is only compared to the actual gold present in the asset. 2.) Make sure it’s a reputable lender As you will be using your precious gold as collateral, you must make sure the lender you choose is reliable. Please do not take a loan from small shops or jewellers because they are not regulated and could have unfavourable terms of their contracts. There is also the chance of fraud. Therefore, it is best to look for a certified financial institution that you can be confident in. For example, with Basant Finance your gold is insured and kept with full security and is stored in our fire and burglary proof vaults. 3.) Examine the options for repaying Another factor to consider is the option to repay, which is why there are several options you can think about: Bullet payment: In this case, the loan amount is calculated following normal rules for monthly repayments, but you have to pay the full amount, including the interest, after your loan. This is a good option when cash flow is low initially, but you’re certain that things will improve and will be in line with the conclusion of the loan term. In this case, you are able to pay the full interest at the start of the tenure and the principal at the conclusion. Regular EMI: The regular EMI gives you the option of repaying your loan monthly basis, along with interest. This is ideal for salaried people who can be sure to receive monthly payments. Overdraft facility: Here an overdraft facility is offered against gold to the borrowers. The borrower is required to pay only the interest on the amount that is used. This is a great option for salaried and self-employed individuals. Factors to be considered prior to make an application for the gold loan Most people living in India have gold jewellery inside their homes or bank lockers. It has always been viewed as an investment option in India.

14,10 Big Branding Mistakes,business," Every now and then, we might do an online search about branding just to check on its current trends. Branding is a powerful tool that marketers should not take for granted. It can either make or break your company's success, which is why you need to be extra careful when it comes to developing your brand image. Below are some of the biggest mistakes that can put your work in jeopardy. Define your brand strategy first Start with your brand strategy first before anything else. A good brand strategy will set the tone of your entire marketing campaign and serve as a guide for future refinements. Branding is not just about coming up with catchy taglines and logos; it's about identifying your products, services, markets, and audiences first before communicating what makes you stand out from the rest. Branding is a long-term process that companies should embrace rather than run away from because it is going to play a significant role in their success or failure in the industry. Not investing in a quality brand Identity Your brand identity is one of the first things your customers will see and it sets the tone for what they can expect from your company. The brand identity, although it includes your logo, goes beyond this; it includes every single detail that highlights your company's unique identity. Building a brand identity is a long-term process that companies should embrace rather than run away from because it is going to play a significant role in their success or failure in connecting with customers. Creating a brand that isn't differentiated from its competition A mistake that is made by many companies when they are building their brand is not differentiating themselves from the competition. It's very important to make sure you build a brand that stands out from all others in your industry because if it doesn't, there's a good chance you'll be seen as just another company who offers similar products or services as everyone else. You can't afford to blend into this crowd and must stand out in some way, whether it is through the quality of your product/service or by using an effective marketing strategy. Not knowing your audience intimately Truly knowing your audience is the key to getting people to buy your product. You can't expect people to follow something or even pay attention if you don't know what they want. Brent Nolan of Brand Agency, Blunt Agency says ""The brand that knows their audience better than their competition ultimately wins"" Not connecting with the right audience It isn't enough to make a product or service and assume people will find it. You must be proactive about connecting with the audience, even if means going outside your comfort zone. Making assumptions about who your audience is can be damaging to your business. It risks wasting time trying to connect with the wrong people, or worse yet, not connecting at all. Make sure you have taken time to learn about your customers before you start making assumptions about who might fit into that audience. Losing focus Find your niche and remaining focused is powerful for brands. Too often we see brands diversify and expand into new markets or create new unrelated products to keep up with trends that may or may not be beneficial to the brand. Every business wants more sales, but quality of the overall brand experience should never suffer as a result. Brand experience is not what it should be. Ensure your brand experience is always a priority and you are conscious of the customer journey. If your brand experience does not align with customer expectations it's the quickest way to fail. Not defending and safeguarding oneself Once your brand has established a marketing position defend and safeguard it. You are going to invest considerable time and money in building your brand, ensure you have the appropriate IP protection and trademarks in place. Brand infringement can have a devastating impact on businesses. Nobody wants to head down the path of legal action, but not having any IP protection at all is always going to be detrimental to your brand. Being inconsistent with your branding Once you have developed your brand, ensure the marketing material is consistent across all platforms. Your print collateral should look similar to your website and social media pages. Branding elements that are inconsistent will confuse customers and they will be unsure of who you are or what you represent. Ignoring the signs it's time to evolve, refresh or rebrand Brands grow, age, and sometimes die. To remain relevant to your customers, you may need to refresh or rebrand your business. Knowing when it's time to evolve is sometimes difficult,  which is why you need to stay up-to-date on emerging trends and changing customer preferences. So remember: just because it's always been that way doesn't mean it has to stay that way. If you've identified areas of your branding that no longer meet your business objectives, or if your brand is feeling tired and dated, then now is probably the time to explore a new branding direction. Branding should be about bringing customers closer to the heart of your business. Your brand promise isn't worth the paper it's written on At the heart of your business is your brand promise. It's critical brands understand and remember this. Your Brand Promise should be evident in everything you do related to your branding efforts. That means every advertisement, brochure, business card and website should communicate what you are promising your brand's audience. But it doesn't stop there … your brand promise must also extend into the way employees are trained so they understand how their day-to-day activities contribute to the brand promise. Conclusion We hope this guide has given you some ideas on the key brand mistakes to avoid. A Brand Agency that assists marketers and companies is Blunt Agency.

Take into account the garage, sliding doors, side, and back doors. Brand of locks – It's essential to know which type of locks are installed at present in your place. It may be a deadbolt or a lock that is built into the knob. Consider your budget – Some new homeowners may search for an inexpensive solution. If the keys changed only briefly, you might want to only rekey the same locks instead of replacing them.

So, never trust the assertion that every front door key has been given over to you. Even if the person who sold you the property did the correct thing, it's likely that the builders or cleaners he worked with may have kept a copy of the key intentionally or unintentionally."
16,Tempered Glass Vs Ceramic Glass For Fireplaces,business," Interested in customizing your fireplace with gorgeous materials and finishes? The two most common material choices you can use are tempered glass and ceramic glass. But which is the best choice for use in a fireplace? Here's an overview of everything you should know about choosing tempered or ceramic glass for your fireplace. Ask your custom glass contractor for more information or recommendations specific to your home. Tempered Glass In fact, most buildings built on glass and steel use tempered glass. Glass is manufactured with safety in mind. It is produced by a heating and chemical process that allows it to be compressed and stretched in the glass. Tempered Glass Tempered Glass Fireplace glass doors are also made of tempered glass. They handle the heat better and allow the firewood to burn more efficiently. You also don't have to worry about the glass breaking from the heat. In fact, it can help improve energy efficiency and save you thousands of dollars in energy costs in the long run. Ceramic Glass Making ceramic glass involves two steps. The first process involves PyroCeram or NeoCeram, which promotes the growth of crystals in the second production. Then, when the growth of the crystals is controlled, there is uniform growth inside the glass. You will get the advantages of both glass and ceramic. It is softer than tempered glass and may not be the most durable choice for interior glass walls or table tops, but you can use ceramic glass as a fireplace insert because it can withstand sustained heat of no more than 1292F or a limited time of 1472 degrees. Ceramic or Tempered Glass for Fireplaces Most fireplaces and wood burning stoves have glass doors on the front that can be a beautiful decorative element. In most cases, these doors will be made of ceramic or tempered glass. The best glass for a fireplace or stove door depends on several factors. Ceramic Glass Ceramic Glass Tempered glass is designed to withstand higher levels of heat and pressure than standard glass. It is formed in the same way as regular glass, but with some additional heating or chemical processes. You will often find fireplace doors made of tempered glass because fireplaces are most often used with the doors open. Indoor stoves that burn wood, pellets or coal are often made with ceramic glass rather than tempered glass because the stove is supposed to burn with the door closed. This means there is a higher constant heat, which usually exceeds what tempered glass can withstand. Ceramic glass is also designed to have a lower resistance, which means that the heat escaping through the glass is much higher (which makes sense given the purpose of these indoor furnaces). A comparison of the two shows that there really is no comparison when it comes to the amount of heat various kinds of glass can withstand. Tempered glass can withstand temperatures of about 260 degrees Celsius (500 degrees Fahrenheit), while ceramic glass can withstand temperatures of 648 degrees Celsius (1,200 degrees Fahrenheit). Which glass you choose ultimately depends on what you want and how you will use it. However, to avoid any damage to your property or wasted money, it is best to know the type of glass and what it is designed for. Not only will you save money in the long run, but you'll also avoid the stress of cleaning and replacing broken glass. Northglass is one of China's leading suppliers of glass products.

17,How To Have A Profitable Membership Site,business," ""A Complete Guide To Creating A Profitable Recurring Income Through Membership Site"" By bringing in more and more customers who pay a monthly fee for your content, your income stream will grow FAST. A membership site involves people paying a monthly fee to have access to private content.  This content is usually released at regular intervals, often weekly. Not only are membership sites EXTREMELY profitable, but by having a membership site, it puts you on the path of becoming an authority figure within your chosen niche. Starting a membership site is not nearly as difficult as you might think.  A lot of marketers get intimidated by the idea, thinking it is too big of an undertaking.  The truth is that there are a lot of great services and software options that make the task quite easy.  After the initial, often painless setup, all you really need to worry about is providing content and signing up new members. You don’t even have to worry about having six or more months of content ready for your members.  Technically, you could start out with only the first week or two of content available on the site.  Just make sure you can add future content before they get done with what is currently there.  You don’t want members to get to a point where no content is available.  That’s the fastest way to start losing all your paying customers. One thing to keep in mind is that the whole point of a membership site is that you can automate almost everything.  When people sign up for your list and set up their payment, they will automatically be directed on how to get started.  You won’t need to create their account, or handle any of that.  All you will need to focus on is getting new members, and making sure your members have content on a weekly basis. When I say your members get content on a weekly basis, remember you only need to be making content for your oldest members.  You already have content ready for all of your other newer members, and it will automatically be delivered to them within the normal time frame. Pick A Niche First- Many of you reading this might already know what niche you are making your site for.  If you’ve already released products, built a list, or have a certain area of expertise, then this choice is easy for you. If you don’t know what niche you want to create a membership site for, that’s okay.  You can really make a membership site about anything that interests you.  There is money to be made in just about every niche, no matter how small.  Sometimes, it’s easier to start in a smaller niche, simply because there is much less competition. However, before choosing a niche, there are a few things to consider that can make a difference when it comes to profitability.  Niches where the customers have a bigger problem that they desperately need a solution to, tend to be more profitable than a simple hobby site.  This isn’t saying that a hobby site can’t be profitable, enthusiasts are known for spending a lot of money on their passion, but in my personal experience, bigger problems means people are more willing to spend larger amounts of money. For instance, there are niches like losing weight, dog training, making money, attracting the opposite sex, getting out of debt, quitting smoking, etc.  These types of niches will always be profitable, as they are big problems that people are commonly faced with, and more importantly, they are problems that people are desperate to solve. On the flip side, some kind of hobby site, like building model trains in your basement, can be very profitable, but the potential members will most likely not be as desperate for the content that you can provide.  This can make getting new members a little harder.  Don’t let me sway you though.  If you have a passion for a hobby and want to make money by regularly giving help to others interested in that hobby, then go for it!  Passion is a tool that, when directed properly, can make your business extremely successful. Just make sure that if you are going to create a hobby-based membership site, that it’s something that is profitable.  Otherwise, you could be wasting a lot of time and effort.  Think about the hobby, and whether or not that typical hobbyist has money, and more importantly, spend a lot of money on their hobby.  Any easy way to find this out is to just go to a forum based around that hobby.  See what people are talking about.  Are they spending money?  Go to a site that sells stuff that involves that hobby.  What’s the average price of the main products? Sub-Niche- Now, sub-niching is also something to consider.  Because most of the larger markets have so much competition, it’s a good idea to pick a niche within a niche.  For instance, if you want to create a dog training membership site, it might be hard to break into that market, even harder to dominate it.  But, what if you created a membership site to train a specific kind of dog, or a site about how to train a dog for apartment living?  By sub-niching like this, you are much less likely to have any strong competition.  You’ll be in a smaller market, but you can completely dominate that market. Think about how long you will be able to keep members.  Are they just looking for a quick fix to something?  You might be better off just creating a single product.  Will they benefit from ongoing training, and cutting edge discoveries?  Then that niche is perfect for long term memberships.  Also, keep in mind, some sites might only be profitable certain times of the year because of the specific nature of the niche.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it’s something you need to consider and be aware of. It tends to be easier if your site works year round, and is set up for long term membership.  Not only is it easier, but will often make you the most money. Lastly, is this a niche that will still be around in a couple years?  What about five years?  It’s better to focus on an evergreen market, or a market that will always be around.  The niches I mentioned at the beginning of this section are good examples of evergreen markets: weight loss, making money, attraction/seduction, etc. If you’re still having trouble trying to choose a niche, here’s a good tip.  Head over to ClickBank.com and browse their marketplace.  You will see they have a lot of categories and subcategories.  These are all proven niches that make money.  Take a look and see if any of them would interest you. Take your time researching and picking your niche.  Follow the advice in this section and choose wisely.  You don’t want to randomly just pick something and start working on your site.  This research phase is one of the most important steps.  Once you’ve figured out what niche you are going to work in, it’s time to move on with the next section. Membership Site Models- So, you have chosen a niche.  You now need to figure out what kind of model your membership site is going to follow.  There are generally two different kinds of models.  A limited time membership, and an ongoing membership. With a limited time membership, you’re members are signing up for only so many weeks or months of material and then the recurring payments stop.  They are usually paying per month, but you can also set it up as weekly or bi-weekly.  The reason to use a limited time membership structure is if you’re presenting a complete course for the member to follow.  The advantage of a limited time membership is that they can often be easier to get prospective members to sign up for. The other option is the ongoing membership site.  With this kind of site the members are signing up to always have fresh content delivered to them on an ongoing basis.  A good example of this is a membership site that is for people interested in making money by trading stocks.  They would sign up to your site so they can always be on the cutting edge of trading techniques as well as being up to date with the market.  The obvious advantage to an ongoing membership site is that you can have that recurring income indefinitely, as long as they still see value in your new content. Even if you do choose to do a limited time membership site.  It might be a good idea to have an option at the end if they want to continue to pay you.  This could be in the form of a monthly newsletter, or them paying to be part of a private community.  Of course it really depend on the niche when figuring out if this is an option for you. When trying to figure out if you should do a limited time membership site or an ongoing membership site, there are a few questions you should ask yourself.  Will your niche benefit from learning about new market developments?  Will you be able to keep coming up with new ideas and content that is valuable to your niche?  Do your members only need a quick solution to their problem and nothing further? Pricing For Your Membership Site- This is another important question that you need to answer.  Take your time and do your research.  Don’t just randomly pick a price that sounds good.  Ask too little, and you’re leaving a lot of money on the table.  Ask too much, and you won’t have enough customers.  The trick is to find that sweet spot that’s just right for your site.  How do you do that?  A little research. Open up google, and do a search for membership sites based around your market.  Check the top two or three sites in your niche.  What are they charging?  This will give you an idea of what you can charge.  From there it is up to you to decide if you want to charge the same as them, charge less, or charge more.  Don’t think you need to be cheaper than your competition to be successful.  By charging more than a competitor, you are demonstrating a higher perceived value than they are.  Potential customers will see this and assume that because you charge more, your content must be better. If you charge more than the competition, just make sure to DELIVER on the content.  Perceived value only works until they actually have the content in front of them.  The quality of the content must match or exceed the perceived value. If you are lucky enough to be in a profitable niche and there doesn’t seem to be any other membership sites, FANTASTIC!  The only downside is this will make pricing slightly more difficult.  Since there are no membership sites to compare to, google products related to your niche.  Or, head back to clickbank and see if there are products listed within your niche.  By research the products, you can get a feel for what customers in that niche tend to spend.  That should lead you to a good idea of what a monthly charge should look like for your site. Although it’s important to have an idea what you’re going to charge, don’t worry if it’s not perfect.  You can easily run a split test to see what the optimal price is.  Essentially, a split test is splitting your traffic between different sales pages.  For our pricing purposes, you simply have different prices on the different sales pages and track it with analytics software. The sales page that gets more members to sign up, is the price that you should set your membership site at.  This guide isn’t going to cover how to set up a split test.  If you haven’t done one before, just google it.  It’s actually really simple to set up.  Google has free services that you can set up.  Just google “Google website optimizer” and follow the instructions when you’re ready to run a split test. Delivery Of Your Membership Site- This is the point where you want to think about the delivery method of your membership site.  There are a few different ways you can set it up.  I’ll cover them here and you can figure out which would work best for your membership program. Traditionally, the members are simply given access to a private website after setting up payments.  The content is then released to the member on a weekly or daily basis. A twist on this format is the coaching program.  Your membership site is set up to coach the members by releasing modules of the program at given intervals.  A coaching program will usually be limited time membership, not an ongoing site.  A lot of owners of these sites do coaching events, where members all join at the same time and are all released content at the same time. The nice thing about this is that the students can discuss their progress with other students within private forums.  Also, at the end of each week, the site owner will usually do a live question and answer session to answer any questions that may have come up with that week’s material. Email Autoresponder- A much simpler delivery method is through an email autoresponder.  Using a service like aweber, you simply have your members opt-in to a specific email list after they have paid.  With an autoresponder you can set up a sequence of emails to be delivered at specific intervals from when they first opted-in to your list.  There really is no easier way than running your entire membership program than doing it by email.  It’s super easy to set up, it runs automatically, and it is incredibly cheap compared to other membership site services and software. The downside of doing it all through an email autoresponder is that there is no community interaction between your members, and they won’t get any of the other useful tools and features that come with quality membership software. More Profits- Having a membership site with recurring payments can be very profitable.  But, there are so many more ways to make money with your membership site.  You have to remember, you now have an audience of customers in front of you, and more importantly they have already proven that they are willing to spend money!  It’s important to maximize your profits with them.  Here are some ideas that you can use to get the most out of your niche membership site: Premium Memberships You don’t need to have one flat rate for all of your members.  By having different levels of membership, you can offer different levels of content at appropriate prices for each level.  The base level of content will be your cheapest subscription price, while your VIP premium content would go above and beyond the lower levels, and be a much higher monthly price.  Commonly, membership sites have levels of bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.  The higher the level, the more access that member has to premium content, as well as more site features. Start Advertising You can easily make money by placing ads on your site that are appropriate for your niche market.  Just make sure you don’t go overboard with ads and turn off your  members.  Personally, I have a rule to never have more than one or two ads per page of content.  You can even have a feature for premium members to not see ads if your software supports that. Affiliate Program By setting up an affiliate program, you are essentially giving commissions to whoever helps you sign up new members.  You should make your affiliate program available to other marketers and existing members.  Make sure to offer a very competitive commission.  I recommend 50-75% of monthly payments for each member they sign up.  This may sound steep, but you need to keep in mind that these are memberships that you might otherwise not get.  By offering a high commission, you attract more affiliates and bigger affiliates.  What you lose in profit margin, you easily make up for in volume.  Take care of your affiliates, and they will take care of you. Send Offers To Your List Everyone who signs up to your membership site, should be on a members email list.  You can then send this list offers promoting different products or services.  You can send offers of new products you’ve created, or even send them to affiliate offers where you make a commission.  There is also the option of letting others advertise to your list.  This is entirely up to you.  Just make sure whatever you are sending is of high quality, and that your members can actually benefit from the offer. Newsletter Members can have the option of signing up to a special newsletter for a monthly fee.  This newsletter will give exclusive content that is not available on the site.  Newsletters are especially good with coaching programs or any other membership program that might only last for a limited time.  When they are done with the coaching program (lets say it lasts three months) they now can sign up to be delivered new, up-to-date content, and you get to keep getting paid by them for an indefinite amount of time. One final thought about maximizing your earning potential with your membership site.  Most of your revenue will come from subscriptions.  You need to make sure that you are retaining customers as long as possible, and renewing memberships of customers who may have canceled.  To retain members, make sure your content is always at the highest possible quality.  Over-deliver on everything.  Be extremely active within the member’s community.  If you set up a private forum for your members, be active on discussions within it.  Listen to your members concerns, and see what you can do to help them.  If a member does cancel, have an automated message go out letting them know how much their membership means to them.  Offer them a discount to rejoin.  Try to find out why they canceled, and see if there is something you can do to make sure it doesn’t happen in the future. Getting Traffic To Your Membership Site You can have the greatest membership in the world, but it is all for nothing if you can’t get people to sign up.  You already have an offer, now you need to put that offer in front of people. Entire books can be, and have been, written about getting traffic to your site.  It’s one of the single most important aspects of doing business online. There are a few main ways people tend to get traffic to their website.  I’ll give descriptions of them all here, and let you know which ones I think are best. SEO- Or “search engine optimization.”  This simply means that you are getting traffic from search engines when people are searching for keywords that have to do with your niche site.  If you can manage to get to the number one spot on google for highly searched keywords, this can mean wonders for your business.  Unfortunately, this is one of the most time consuming ways of getting traffic.  The endless backlinking can always be undone by a simple Google update.  Also, there are no guarantees that you will make it to even the front page of Google, even if you think you are doing everything right.  Although SEO can be very effective, I think there are much easier ways to get traffic. Paid Advertising This can be the google/yahoo/msn ads.  This can be banner ads.  This can be email advertisements.  You do need to make sure that you know what you’re doing when you start advertising.  You can lose a lot of money if you don’t have things working optimally.  Make sure to endlessly test your ads and sales funnel.  Advertising can bring in a lot of traffic very quickly, just make sure you’re making more than you’re spending.  Not a bad way to get traffic, but still not the best in my opinion. Affiliate Program Now this is where things get fun.  Why bother with SEO and advertising when you can just get others to do all the hard work for you?  The trick is to have affiliates send you traffic on a regular basis.  Unlike advertising, you only pay when someone signs up, so there is not a high upfront cost.  Not only can you have your membership site set up with an affiliate program, but here is another trick. Create a product that has to do with your niche, a pdf or a video.  Take that product and sell it with 100% commission paid to affiliates.  Affiliates love to jump at 100% commission, who wouldn’t?  Now to get the product they must opt-in to your list.  As an upsell, you can send them the offer to your membership site.  You can even wait a week to send your offer, so that they have had a chance to enjoy your product.  If you deliver on the initial product, they will be excited at the chance to join your membership site. Wrapping Up- So there you have a complete step-by-step guide to starting your own membership site.  The earning power of a recurring income can be staggering.  I’ll leave you with one last tip.  When starting a membership site, it will be most effective as part of a larger sales funnel that includes other products and offers.  Strategic place your membership site offer within your sales funnel, and you will be well on your way to maximizing your revenue from each customer.

He made the proposal to turn MIKROS technology into a public service. This is why MIKROS is available to you today. By using MIKROS, now all game developers can benefit from superior data analytics and deeper insights that can only be achieved through the connection of multiple mobile products and their gathered data. Leonard Tatum has 20+ years of programming and software development experience. He is a mobile app specialist and prides himself as a mentor to at-risk and underprivileged kids. In his tenure as a software developer, he used to develop tablet operating systems for kids and teens. He understands in-depth how mobile operating systems work. Using his background, he created MIKROS with data privacy, safety and low-cost to the end user in mind.. The connection of mobile products is very significant. This is deemed relatively impossible, since mobile applications are all isolated instances. Isolation prevents one app from knowing whether any other app is present on the operating system or whether apps can access the operating system kernel. This is how mobile technology works, purposefully, to ensure a high degree of separation between the app and the operating system. The problem Tatum Games wanted to solve was how to get around the sandboxes, and in doing so to determine what benefits would be afforded to the end users. They wanted to know if there could be a solution where privacy and security was upheld while information was shared freely between developers to allow them to better enhance their product. Tatum Games started off as an entertainment company, but has since transitioned to being pioneers of data service and management. Their mission is to save costs for game developers, and help them better understand their user needs. They developed MIKROS to be easy to use and  work with major game engines such as Unity. Once integrated, you can understand user spending habits, interests and compare all of your insights with your competitors. This is huge! The result of tracking all user behaviors--not just those confined on an app-by-app basis--is that the conclusions MIKROS provides are more accurate and in-depth. Objectively, Tatum Games wants developers to understand their user behaviors, not only in their product(s), but across all products related to their products. MIKROS is the only analytic service in the world that can provide holistic insights about user behaviors, tendencies and actions. It is not sufficient enough to analyze what users are doing in your products alone. You have to also understand how your users act outside of your product. Only then are you truly able to create meaningful conclusions and action plans that directly affect your business bottom-line. And Tatum Games provides this service all at a fractional cost compared to competing services."
19,Zoom Fatigue is BS,business," As folks return to commuting to an office outside the home, I’ve noticed something curious… some people seem to continue having the same amount of zoom meetings as they did while working from home. But now, they're in the office. And the rest of their workday is spent staring at a laptop screen, with not a whole lot of person-to-person interaction. Hmmm. 🤔 I wonder how widespread this is. Let's move on. Since Zoom meetings appear to be here to stay, let's talk about why zoom fatigue is BS... Zoom Fatigue and Engagement One could argue that in a healthy company culture, the level of Zoom Fatigue in your typical zoom work meeting should be quite low if you are truly engaged and adding value to the process. If you’re not engaged and adding value, you probably don’t belong in the meeting and any important relevant outcome can just be sent to you after the fact. My wife, a Project Manager, has a ton of zoom meetings. When she works from home, I sometimes can’t resist the urge to peek in her meetings. I have never seen her complain about zoom fatigue. Stress yes. But not zoom fatigue. The same for all those little boxes of people on her laptop screen. They always seem quite engaged on whatever they're dealing with at the moment. Ahh, the joys of a group of people moving the corporate needle by meaningful collaboration Now I’m only talking about interactive work meetings, not one-way messages like Town Hall Meetings, Company Announcements, etc. If I have to stare at a screen for 20 minutes watching a C-Level Executive speak, there is a high probability my attention will drift a few times during the meeting, especially if the guy or gal is just standing in the same room for 20 minutes straight with no dancing monkeys in the background. For these type meetings, Rocketeer Productions offers a solution that is beneficial to many organizations. It entails engaging your audience by placing presenters within a realistic 3D virtual environment. This can be a simulated Newsroom, Stage Auditorium or a more intimate ""talk show"" couch setting. And virtual conferences can be produced at a fraction of the cost of live ones while maintaining engagement at higher levels than, say, a zoom convention. These sessions can be live and interactive. In Summary The world has definitely changed amidst the great global pandemic of 2020. It's safe to say that Zoom meetings, virtual conferences, online work sessions are here to stay. Many employees got a taste of working from home and they like it! And many of their employers have noticed an increase in workforce productivity from a workforce freed from the stresses of commuting to and from an offsite workplace, amongst other benefits like actually seeing their kids grow up before their eyes (and shooing them away from their zoom meeting backgrounds). If you have a story to tell, why not be different?"
20,First Time Moving House? A Checklist of 7 Things to Remember,business," Moving house is a stressful experience, especially if you haven’t done it before. First-timers often forget about things that seem obvious once you've done it a few times — like putting away breakable items or calling your new utility provider to set up an account, so you don't have to live without gas or water for a day or two. However, if you stay organised and take some pressure off by planning ahead, then moving house doesn't have to be as daunting or difficult. You can use this moving house checklist to ensure that you make the most of your time and don't forget anything important. Before the removalists arrive, make sure everything is where it will be in its final position. This will make unpacking much easier — especially when you've got boxes everywhere! When you already have a floor plan for your new home, you can decide where every piece of furniture and appliance should be placed. This will save you much time from rearranging the heavy items by yourself later. Also, label each box with a note of what room it should go in so that it's easy for your household staff to put things back in their correct places after delivery. Fragile items, like photos, vases, glassware, ceramics and lamps, should be boxed separately as they require special handling during moving day. Make sure that you pack all of such delicate items carefully with proper packing materials to avoid getting damaged in transit. If you’re leaving the fragile items around as you’re packing other stuff, you’re bound to walk over one thing or another. So as you start packing, start with the fragile stuff before moving on to the rest. Gas, electricity and water companies need to know your new address and telephone number before you move in. If you're renting from a private landlord or letting agent, they'll normally take care of paying the utility bills for you – but check this is the case before moving in. If it isn't, make sure you pay your bills promptly so that you don't get hit with late payment fees and your utilities are kept on during the move. This is one of the important points you should never ignore from your moving house checklist. Check whether or not you need to notify any organisations officially of your change of address — for example, council tax or vehicle registration. You will usually need to fill out notification forms or change details online. Failure to notify may result in fines or receiving letters at an old address after moving. Ask the council about registering for council tax. It pays to register as soon as possible to get complete details of the council tax when you take up residency in your new property. Also, call your bank and ask them to send any bills to your new address – that way, you don't miss paying any monthly bills. You also need to organise insurance for your belongings, especially if they are valuable. It might be tempting to put all their toys, food dishes and bedding into boxes with the rest of your stuff, but this can cause problems when they get to their new home. Keep the pet’s stuff separately, especially those you’ll need immediately at your new home, like food bowls, favourite toys and medications. Also, ensure they have their vaccinations up to date to avoid problems when going through customs. There are bound to be teething problems when settling in somewhere new. This can be anything from electrical faults in the home (particularly if you're renting) or difficulties with getting gas or electricity connected up in time for when you first want to use them. You can comfortably pay out of your pocket and get things resolved quickly by putting aside some money. Insurance can help protect your goods against damage or loss during the move. You might opt for full replacement value insurance or third party only insurance — it depends on your level of comfort with risk and how much you're willing to spend on insurance. Conclusion When moving home for the first time, it can be hard to keep track of all the things you have to remember. A checklist like this can help you remember everything that needs to be done and make sure you are ready to move on time."

1,3 Common Mistakes When Planning Corporate Sales Training,business," Your company has a great offering and has invested in a sales team — how do you ensure their success? Most organizations invest in sales training — which is wise to invest in your revenue engine. Like most investments — there is no guarantee on return — which is understandable. Regardless — how can we control, to the best of our ability, making the right investment in our corporate sales training? From our experience in the industry, allow us to share a few tips to help you take the right steps in developing your sales force: Mistake #1 — “The sales trainer should be the top sales person” Let’s face it — if there was such a definition as a ‘best sales person’ — that person would be out selling, and not in the training room teaching you! Similar to seeking an art teacher — you would not need Da Vinci to be your instructor. The best trainer for your sales team is the one that has a combination of: [ Sales Experience + Training Skills ]  x  [ Intention to help ] Seek facilitators who have sales experience in industries similar to yours, because they would understand the challenges sales professionals face on the field. Look into the amount of experience the facilitator has in front of the training room, as an indication of how much exposure the facilitator has working with sales professionals. Most importantly, why would the sales trainer want your sales team to succeed post the training session? If the sales trainer can help your sales team sustain a lift in performance, that is your best sales trainer. Mistake #2 — “Sales training should have processes and flowcharts” If-then diagrams and complicated decision-making matrixes are great to analyze from and processed quickly by computers. During a sales meeting, sales executives need to be human and be present. Focusing on the client’s responses and inputs will give you a better indication of what to do next, compared to referring to a flowchart. In this world, the sales cycle is universal across the world — there is a beginning, middle and an ending — which then loops back into “a new beginning”, also known as growing the client account. While there are cultural differences everywhere, the sales cycle is the same wherever you are. The biggest difference is how much time is spent on each part of the sales cycle. Some countries have cultures that take more time in the (sales cycle) beginning to get to know the other party and build relationship. While some other country cultures may require more effort to understand the client situation. Regardless, there is not going to be a flowchart that can tell you exactly what to say and do to build relationship quicker, etc. Sales training should provide techniques for individuals to attempt to apply. More importantly, these sessions are a great time for people to discuss where and how they can improve. As a sales trainer for over a decade, I have found that providing simple, practical techniques make it easy to apply. Sharing a story on top of the technique makes it easy to remember. Mistake #3 — “Sales training should be a HR initiative” As a sales person, you should be familiar with the term “what’s in it for me?” So, let me ask you — if a sales training goes well, who does it benefit the most? Who’s KPIs would it impact the most in an organization? Leaders of sales organizations should have the clearest idea about their sales team’s performance. Moreover, sales leaders should have enough sales experience to point out where the team needs development in. Through the process of selecting your sales trainer, allow the head of sales to be involved. Let the sales leader and the sales trainer discuss their aspirations and ideas for reaching that. Another reason for allowing the sales leader to drive the sales training initiative — Being in sales for many years, I can easily tell how much sales experience a person has, within a few minutes of them speaking. Chances are, the people attending the workshop can also easily tell if the sales trainer is qualified enough to be leading their training. Involving the sales leader before the training begins gets a clearer understanding of the chemistry expected in the training room. Sales learning and development should be inspiring. Give them the techniques and energy to apply their learnings in the sales field — that is what sticks in sales executive’s minds and success."

3,An introduction to flow meters,business," If you have an application that requires you to understand the volume or mass of gases and liquids, you might need to invest in a flow meter. These devices are used to measure the volume of gases and liquids in a variety of industrial applications, including pharmaceuticals, natural gas, compressed air and so much more. Other flow measurement devices do exist, however, a flow meter delivers much more precise and accurate measurements of the flow of liquids, gases and vapour. Read on to learn more about flow meters and how adding one to your application can help you to precisely measure the rate of flow for your media. What is a flow meter? Put simply, a flow meter is used to measure the amount of liquid, gas or vapour that passes through a pipeline. Whilst some flow meters are designed to measure the flow based on the amount of fluid, gas or vapour passing through the device in a particular timescale, others are used to measure the total amount of fluid that has passed through the flow meter overall. Different flow meter types are used to measure different things, depending on the needs of your application. A flow meter is generally made up of three main parts. These are a primary device, a transducer and a transmitter. The transducer works to sense the fluid, gas or vapour that passes through the primary device, whilst the transmitter converts this raw transducer signal into a usable flow signal. From here this data is often sent to a flow computer, which is used in conjunction with a flow meter to compensate for common operational process conditions, such as temperature, pressure, viscosity and composition. Which applications do flow meters suit? Flow meters are very versatile, which is why they can suit a range of industrial applications in the measurement of liquid, gas and vapour. The most common applications that make sure of flow meters are: Natural gas Compressed air management Gas mixing and blending applications Burner control Liquid measurement Steam flow measurement. Where should a flow meter be placed in a pipeline? To maximise performance and accuracy, it is important to abide by general installation rules. These include placing the flow meter in a position that ensures that it is completely filled with fluid, gas or vapour at all times. Additionally, it is important to install a flow control or flow limiter downstream of the flow meter to be able to accurately control the flow of a liquid, gas or vapour once it has gone through the flow meter. Another important factor to consider is where the flow meter is placed, and how accessible this area is. If you need to complete any maintenance on the flow measurement system, it is vital that you have the space for work and maintenance to take place. What types of flow meters are there? There are a number of popular flow meters on the market today. The following are the most popular choices. Inferential flow meter Inferential flow meters measure the flow of a media by inferring its value from other parameters. Differential pressure, target and variable area flowmeters all return inferential flow measurements. Mass flow meters This type of flow meter measures the mass flow of a fluid. One common example of this is the Coriolis flow meter, which measures real mass flow and thermal mass flow. These rely on the physical properties of the media to provide a flow measurement. Velocity flow meters These flow meters measure the velocity of a fluid’s flow to determine the volumetric flow. There are a number of popular velocity flow meters available including turbine, ultrasonic, magnetic and vortex flowmeters. Volumetric flow meters Volumetric flow meters measure the volume of the media as it passes through the flow meter. Positive Displacement flow meters, also known as PD flow meters, are the only variety of volumetric flow meter that directly measures the volume of a fluid as it passes through the flow meter itself. Industry leaders in flow meters There are a range of flow meters available from a wide array of brands. Perhaps the biggest of note is Malema. Amongst their impressive range is flow meters for high purity, chemical, biomedical and industrial applications. Plus, Malema was the first manufacturer to introduce all PFA and all PEEK mass flow meters, straight tube PFA ultrasonic flow meters and PFA Paddlewheel flow meters. This is what makes them one of the most instantly recognisable flow meter brands. Malema offers advanced flow meters, designed to suit the requirements of high purity, chemical, bio-medical and industrial applications. Plus, their patented Malema Coriolis flow meter is generally immune to environmental changes in fluid conditions. This includes things such as density, viscosity and the presence of entrained gases in liquids or slurry applications. With a unique sensor design, Malema flow meters are designed to ensure extremely precise flow measurement, even in the most challenging of conditions. The Malema ultrasonic flow meter range is designed to offer high levels of accuracy and repeatability in its performance. This is supported by advanced filtering and digital signalling techniques, regardless of flow meter type, including; Inline straight tube U style ultrasonic flow sensors Z style ultrasonic flow sensors.

4,Different Types of Mylar Bags for Your Products Packaging,business," Mylar bags are one of the most popular packaging options on the market for food storage and organizing household items. Since its introduction to the market, Mylar bags have become a must-have in the food packaging industry and a staple food preserver in many homes for their ability to effectively insulate against light, moisture, oxygen and odors.

Here are a few of the different types of mylar bags you can find on the market. Sealed mylar bags Sealed mylar bags are the oldest and most widely used form of mylar bags. These bags have a medium appearance and usually have a clear or faint contrast. What makes them distinctive is the additional textured surface on the inside. This layer helps remove air and allows you to create space inside the bag. They require vacuuming and sometimes oxygen bags inside these bags. However, they provide a long-term solution and have excellent maintainability. Food-grade polyester film bags Custom food storage mylar bags are typically square in shape and provide secure storage for food products.

The only difference between these pouches is the shape of these pouches. Unlike the bottom square pouch, vertical Mylar pouches have unlimited uses. Their bases can be made in any shape, such as round, oval, square or rectangular. Child-resistant Mylar bags Child-resistant Mylar bags are nothing more than a modified design of the standard Mylar bag. These bags usually come with a zipper lock, vacuum seal or many other types of Mylar bags, the only difference we can observe is the addition of a locking mechanism to ensure that there is no spillage, or that children can access the contents. The new mechanism of the lock also ensures that your child will not be able to open the mylar bag. We at Kush Packaging cater to your packaging needs but provide you with the best packaging solutions. You can get mylar bags in any design, shape and size."
5,I Have Been Made Redundant! Do I need a Settlement Agreement?,business," Facing redundancy can seem very daunting, with many things to consider both financially and for the future. You may have heard of something called a 'Settlement Agreement', but what is a Settlement Agreement? Does everyone need one? And how do you get one? Not all employers will offer the option of a Settlement Agreement at the time of issuing their employees with notice. It is not a legal requirement or an obligation. However, obtaining a legally binding Settlement Agreement can be highly beneficial for both employers and employees. So what is a Settlement Agreement? A Settlement Agreement (previously known as a compromise agreement) is a legal document drawn up between employee and employer, usually specifying a sum of money to be paid to the employee when their employment comes to an end. (Whether this is through redundancy or job termination.) Once this document has been signed, the employee effectively gives up their statutory employment rights and will not then be able to enter into any kind of tribunal or legal claims. The sum of money will cover any type of notice period or holiday pay accrued and owed. Do I need a lawyer for a Settlement Agreement? In order to make a Settlement Agreement legally binding, it is important to seek advice from a trustworthy Settlement Agreement Solicitor. This means that the employer is legally obliged to pay the figure agreed upon, and the employee has no way to come back and claim unfair dismissal. The significant benefit of using a Settlement Agreement Solicitor is that they will offer their expert advice on the amount you have been offered and negotiate on your behalf to get the very best deal for you. Who Pays for a Settlement Agreement? Although they are not legally obliged to do so, it is usually the case that the employer pays for the legal fees involved in obtaining a Settlement Agreement as part of the termination package. There is no set figure for a Settlement Agreement, but a typical fee starts at around £200. This amount will vary on a case-to-case basis, and the more complex a situation becomes, the higher the legal fees. During the negotiation process, the Solicitor will also be negotiating to cover the legal fees on behalf of the client. In far more cases than not, the sum of the exit fee will considerably outweigh the cost of the Settlement Agreement. What If I don't want to accept the Settlement Agreement? If you or your Solicitor don't feel that the fee or the terms outlined in your settlement agreement aren't adequate, then you are within your rights to reject the offer and enter into negotiations. This is where a specialist Settlement Agreement solicitor will be able to support you, negotiate on your behalf and help to get the very best outcome from the end of your employment. You should never feel pressured into agreeing on your exit package or signing anything before you feel ready to do so. Being made redundant is stressful enough. It may not seem like it at the time, but the ball is in your court, take enough time to make an informed decision. How do I find a Settlement Agreement Solicitor? Finding the right legal advice is crucial for anyone who finds themself redundant from work and in need of a Settlement Agreement. Most people will turn to Google and find there are hundreds of people offering this service, but how do you find someone you can trust? Firstly, you may want to ask around friends and family for recommendations. Has anyone found themself in a similar position and speaks highly of their Solicitor? Did the Solicitor manage to negotiate a better deal for them? Secondly, always read the reviews on a potential solicitors website or Google Maps listing. Anyone worth approaching will have had hundreds of happy customers who are willing to leave glowing reviews. Thirdly, joining a local Facebook group and asking for Solicitor recommendations can be a really good way of finding someone you can trust and rely on to support you through the redundancy process. Does there have to be legal jargon in my Settlement Agreement? Well, actually, yes, for a settlement agreement to be legally binding, it needs to quote certain sections of specific employment legislation. The agreement also needs to state, for the record, specific clauses that state you will be waiving your employment rights. This all needs to be worded correctly using the right legal terminology (aka jargon). Many of the terms have a very specific meaning which is needed in order to give the Settlement Agreement the desired effect. Don't worry if you don't understand all the wording, your Solicitor will be able to explain and help put your mind at rest. So a Settlement Agreement is a good idea? In short, yes, for anyone facing the termination of their employment due to redundancy or any other reason, a legally binding Settlement Agreement is a very good idea. It's true that you don't actually need one, but in many cases, you will be far better off financially if you are able to seek the right legal advice. The Settlement Agreement is a great way to gain proper closure when employment comes to an end, and in many cases, after the initial shock of being made redundant, it can actually work out to be financially beneficial and finding a brand new job can come with a whole host of new rewards."

7,5 Tips for Successful Remote Work: The Ultimate Guide To Working Remotely,business," Work-life balance is important for everyone. For many, the idea of an office feels like a prison sentence. It’s just not what they want. Remote work is becoming more and more popular thanks to the internet. With remote work, you have the opportunity to have a successful career while living in the middle of nowhere or on the other side of the world. However, there are many pitfalls that can come with remote work. How do you make sure you stay on top of your game when you’re working from home? These are some tips for people who are considering working remotely for their next job or are currently doing it. From understanding how remote work benefits companies, to putting together an effective team, read on to learn how to be successful at remote work. Why Companies Benefit From Remote Work Remote work offers a lot of benefits for companies. For starters, it's a cost-saving measure. A company doesn't have to pay for a physical office space and they don't have to hire the people who would occupy that space. Additionally, employees are more likely to give their all when they feel like they can work from home. A lot of companies want people who are self-starters and have the drive to go the extra mile for their job. Remote work makes it possible for employees to be more productive and do their best work from home. Working remotely also helps businesses attract talent that they might not otherwise be able to attract with a traditional office environment. We've all heard about millennials wanting more flexibility in their jobs. With remote work, employers have the opportunity to offer just that without having it affect profitability or productivity at their company! The Benefits of Working Remotely Remote work has become a way for people to live their lives and achieve their goals.  The most obvious benefit is that you will be able to live anywhere you want. It’s a dream come true for many people who don't want to be tied down with a 9-5 job, but they also don't want to give up their career. Additionally, remote work eliminates office politics and provides an opportunity for flexible hours. Remote workers often have the ability to set their own hours as long as they meet deadlines and complete projects on time. This gives you control over how much time you spend working each day and where you spend it as well as the ability to make up for lost time (like when something unexpected happens during the week). However, there are some challenges with working remotely that come with it as well. The main challenge is that employees need to be highly motivated individuals who can work independently without close supervision or feedback from management. This means that self-motivation is key in order to stay on top of things like deadlines and productivity levels at all times. How to Get Started with Remote Work Remote work is desirable thanks to flexibility and use of the internet. With remote work, you have the opportunity to have a successful career while living in the middle of nowhere or on the other side of the world. Before you start your next job, you should ask yourself if it’s for you. If your answer is yes, then it’s time to learn how to be successful at remote work. If this is your first remote job, here are some tips for getting started: You need to build trust before you can make an impact on your team Find out what your company values Make sure you are set up with all necessary equipment How to Create an Effective Team No matter if you’re working from home or abroad, one thing is certain: You can’t do it alone. Sometimes work doesn’t get done because you can’t find a way to reach out to people for help. Save yourself the time and stress of trying to do everything yourself by building an effective team of remote workers willing to jump in and help out when needed. Building a great remote team is easier said than done. That's why we put together this post with some practical tips on how you can create an effective remote team. Decide on a process for remote work It's important to have a process in place for remote work. This is so you can stay on top of your work and complete it efficiently.  Some people choose to do their work in the morning, noon, or night. You might decide that one day out of the week you'll be unavailable for meetings or other engagements. These are decisions you should make ahead of time to avoid any confusion later on. Utilize time zone balance and overlap One of the most important reasons why remote work is so successful is because you can balance time zones. Instead of being on a 9-5 schedule, your team can overlap to cover different times of day. This way, only one person has to be available at any point in time. This also makes it easier for people who live somewhere where the time zone is drastically different from that of their coworkers'. By working remotely, they can still participate in work discussions and be a part of the team. If you're going to work remotely, make sure your company or team utilizes this opportunity by setting up a system to share responsibilities across time zones and make sure everyone's input is considered equally. Dealing with Distractions at Home No matter where you decide to work, there will be distractions. This is especially true for people who are working at home.

8,Tips to Select a Suitable Smart Lock for Your Home,business," Homeowners everywhere utilize locks for their premises. Did you know that people have used the conventional pin-tumbler locks since they were invented back in the year 1848 by Linus Yale Sr? These provided sufficient safety and minimized the likelihood of break-ins for many houses. But we have come quite far from 1848. In the 21st century, you need to invest in a smart home security system and shift your focus from traditional locks if you want to boost the security infrastructure of your home. Smart locks provide several features that can streamline daily household management. When you integrate them with a reliable smart home solution, you can get access management capabilities, which you cannot even think about with traditional locks. But the problem is that there are an array of choices in the marketplace today. You should consult with a reputed 24 hours locksmith in Toronto if you want to boost the security of a specific part of your place. This article will outline some of the essential features that you should look for in a smart lock. Remote Access Not every smart lock permits you to access them through a cellular connection or internet. Many models have only Bluetooth connectivity. This short-distance transmission technology reduces the power needed for operating the clock. It enables users to link to the lock from a different Bluetooth device, but Bluetooth devices are not the same as Wi-Fi devices. It implies that some kinds of door locks cannot be connected to the remainder of the home network. There are some other kinds of locks that utilize the Z-Wave technology to link from the lock to the security network of the home. The home network is linked to the internet, facilitating people to access and control their locks irrespective of where they are. With such locks, you can easily unlock your door remotely. Creation of Custom Access Codes It is obvious that remotely managing house access isn’t the only method to handle visitors that have to come in your absence. A lot of smart locks provide custom access codes. It implies that you can set one code for your child and another for the gardener. You can combine certain rules with codes according to the model you choose. For instance, you can make a code for the gardener who only works between 11 AM till noon five days of the week. The code would remain inactive outside of these timings. Thus, you’ll gain a huge level of control to restrict people’s access to your premises. Contactless Access There are still many locks that you can pair with your cell phone. They can also be a part of a more detailed system configured for geofencing. Such locks ‘sense’ when you are near and unlock the door automatically without you needing to do anything at all. It is great for those people who return to the house with their hands full of groceries or have a pet who won’t cooperate. Choosing a Suitable Smart Lock Batteries operate smart locks. So, ensure that you know about the expected battery life of various models. It’s best to choose a model that gives you an indication of how much battery life is left. Locks differ in how their codes are managed and the number of codes they support. Considering your options, find the different codes you’ll require at a particular time. In some systems, you can create codes through an app, while in others, you can use the keypad. Various smart lock models don’t incorporate a keyway, while there are others that allow you to use a traditional key. If you aren’t always careful about changing batteries before they deplete, you should consider a smart lock model you can use with a physical key. Assess if the lock is compatible with other elements of your smart home. Find if they can be added to commands like ‘end of the night’ to lock the garage door, lower the temperature, and switch the lights. Final Words Smart locks are perfect for making your home more secure and minimizing the threat of break-ins. But for selecting a smart lock model, you should consider the various factors given above. There are many technical elements in such a security product. So it is better to consult a locksmith in your area and gain a better understanding."
9,Will 2022 be the year of the LinkedIn business influencer?,business," As we all get back to the office - virtual or physical! - it’s time to think about the calendar year ahead and to consider what’s going to influence business in the next 12 months. 2022 has already been called the “Year of” for many things, including cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, sustainable energy and deep tech. But after two years of uncertainty with the pandemic, as well as growing issues of distribution and logistics around the world, what is needed most is better communication and engagement. So 2022 may just be the Year of the LinkedIn Business Influencer. I’m being quite specific here when I say “business influencer”, too. This isn’t about Kim Kardashian and the myriad of insta-famous millennials with their filtered photographs, or dance-move enabled Tik-tok videos. I’m talking about business and product expertise. I’m talking about people who produce a variety of content, including LinkedIn video, virtual events, blog posts and other paid social media content, specifically to showcase processes, products and ideas that have a specific market or industry fit. Business influencers tend to be people who accumulate a groundswell of support over time, by sharing useful and interesting content, and they have business experience either as high-powered business executives or as self-made entrepreneurs. And they are not mere advertisers. Business influencers are passionate about sharing their expertise and judgement around products and services. Of course they can amplify marketing messaging, but they know how to present ideas in a manner that will engage their audiences. And they can often imagine ways to showcase products and services in a manner that will better communicate value. Because of this, business influencers are likely to be more effective in engaging, and communicating with audiences. Customers and stakeholders are more likely to trust advocacy from business influencers, and they are more likely to act on the messaging they receive.  Forget the conversion metrics of traditional marketing and advertising, where you might get results in months or years. Business influencers with highly engaged networks can get your message in front of the right people and get results in hours or days! It probably should not be such a surprise that 2022 is likely to be the Year of the Business Influencer in any case. It continues a trend that’s been around for a long time. Edelman’s annual Trust Barometer has been demonstrating a clear decline in trust of media, governments and companies for some years. Instead, community confidence is being placed in experts and impartial third parties. Traditional media and public relations used to fulfill this role, but they are now widely perceived to be compromised. Instead, the appraisal of experts and impartial third parties is considered both ethical and reliable. And with the rise of services like LinkedIn video - which could be seen to be a counterattack to a lot of the rubbish shared on 10-15 second video services - there are now easily consumed content channels for business influencers to share content that will help people build and sustain their companies after two very difficult years. The very nature of LinkedIn is that people are looking for business news, and reliable information that will help their business. And it’s certainly likely that business influencers operating on, or with LinkedIn, are going to be given more credence than business influencers operating only on their own platforms. So it makes sense that businesses that want to engage and communicate better, will probably want to work with LinkedIn business influencers. So I’m calling it. I think 2022 will be the Year of the LinkedIn Business Influencer. And I think now is the time to establish connections with such influencers, and help your business to thrive."
10,Peace Home Offers,business," Do you know the process how to sell an inherited house in Las Vegas? Selling a house with multiple heirs involved doesn’t have to be as difficult as it looks. Selling the decedent’s property is difficult and emotional for most of heirs because of losing a close family member, friend, and often a parent, in addition to the memories and attachment to the property itself. While there will be difficulties, working with experts helps make the interaction simpler for all interested parties. It is useful to see how the process functions from the beginning, which implies you will be going through training process. We will cover a few hints on the best way to sell an acquired house in Las Vegas when there are numerous beneficiaries included. Working Together When many heirs want to sell an inherited house in Las Vegas, working together as a group makes things very easy and smooth. Frequently, the heirs are siblings, and the stress and personal dynamics come into play. The result of these interactions can be conflict over the property’s distribution. The process should start with a group discussion, listening to each heir’s wishes and expectations, working together towards the most easy and better solution. Resolving differences of heir’s expectation and demand that may arise is less stressful with a clear understanding of what is or isn’t acceptable to each heir from the start. Virtual Technology This is the better solution now in covid19 pandemic, heirs can meet together in virtual meetings from their own place to handle matters to do with the property much more quickly than having to travel for conferences or gathering signatures on legal documents. They can use the advantage of virtual signature services when working with multiple heirs who may live long distances from the property. Determining the Executor If the heirs have bad relationship each other, it would be better to hire a professional from outside so that the property’s division is as unbiased and fair as possible with the least amount of turmoil. The executor’s key responsibility is to follow the will’s terms when they sell an inherited house when many heirs are involved. Their main goal is to resolve conflicts so that they can avoid decisions that would ultimately devalue the property, to suit one heir’s wishes.

11,What is Social Engineering?,business," WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING? Social Engineering is the exercise of obtaining detailed information of personnel in private and corporate settings by the use of Open-Source Intelligence, Human Intelligence, and psychological methods. Open-source Intelligence is the process of gathering personal information on a subject or individual through internet searches, Social Media, or public records. Human Intelligence is the process of gathering personal information of an individual by observing traits, language, mannerisms, surroundings, clothing and more. This information is then used to exploit and compromise the credentials of organizations and individuals, primarily for financial or personal gain to the attacker. WHY IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING USED? The process of Social Engineering is to gather as much information about a person or organization. Once this information is compiled, an attacker will attempt to emotionally hijack an individual in order to gain sensitive information. Most commonly, personal information will be used to access online accounts, passwords, and entry into secured areas at the workplace. Unfortunately, many companies forget that the first step of “hacking” any organization begins with the human, first. In fact; • Over 60% of businesses are targeted by Social Engineering each year • Approximately only 25% of companies provide Social Engineering Awareness Training • Over 90% of Cyber attacks rely on Social Engineering • Social Engineering attacks cost companies between 3 to 6 trillion dollars each year (worldwide) • The average cost of each attack is roughly $130,000 • 45% of employees open suspicious emails, 60% being new hires MOST COMMON SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS? Pretexting – The act of disguising a name, occupation, or intention in order to gain access or secured information Spear Phising – Attacks, commonly email, that are directed toward specific recipients and include detailed information Vishing – Voice Phishing is a phone-based attack used to obtain sensitive information, or have the victim carry out a specific act. SMS Phishing – Attacks that are initiated via mobile text message in order to gain sensitive information from the recipient. QUID PRO QUO/BAITING – Primarily conducted online, these attacks promise the victim rewards or services in exchange for their personal information. HOW TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST SOCIAL ENGINEERING There are many ways to combat against Social Engineering attacks. Though I would agree that you can never be too “secured”, unfortunately, it can become somewhat of a headache. This is even more true when trying to balance Customer Service skills with potential or existing clients. Therefore, I have listed common, yet effective, measures to practice to ensure the safety of your personal and company information. DON’T BECOME A TARGET – Trust me, if our highest Intelligence Agency can be hacked by individuals across the world, then so can you. Essentially, no one is 100% safe. The significant difference between you and government agencies is that you don’t stick out nearly as much. As they say, “out of sight, out of mind”. This is the best preventative advice you can take when combating against future attackers. You can take small steps by removing identifiable information from your social media accounts; Birthday, place of work, city you live in, etc. Most importantly, be VERY weary of people or accounts that ask for your personal information. As soon as they have just a small piece of your personal information, everything else becomes like “pulling a thread”. SECURITY PROTOCOLS -  Most companies have security policies already in place. However, skilled Social Engineers understand how to breach these “standard security measures”. Understanding that humans are the first line of access for a Social Engineer, it’s important to equip them with basic language analysis training. Secondly, remember that “complacency kills”. Complacency with visitors, conversations, unlocked doors, and unattended computers can all become a very serious issue for a company. Maybe your company chooses not to require ID badges or scanning technology. No worries. Though it can be helpful to employ technology to secure your building, it’s not necessary. You can start by keeping all doors secured at all times, while funneling all traffic in through one entrance. While adding trained reception personnel to this method, you can prevent 90% of all physical, unauthorized access hacks. PENETRATION TESTING – A rare and valuable source to any business is hiring a third-party, Pen-tester. Pen-testers are skilled Social Engineer Consultants that test a company’s security vulnerabilities. This process includes Open-source Intelligence research of the company and their employees, security assessment of the company’s facility, as well as in-person testing of accessing their location with voluntary help of individual employees. Hiring Penetration Testers can prevent future civil suits, enormous monetary loss, and tighten the physical/digital security of an organization. Overall, there is no perfect way to understand or prevent from Social Engineering. Each individual and company are different from the next. In addition, Social Engineering attacks are always evolving to the next best, vulnerable way. Nevertheless, if you stick to the “basics” in terms of security and identifying threats, you’ll always be one step ahead of preventable attacks. Christopher Fields SE Consultant, CBFI"

14,Why I am successful in the male dominated industry of solar,business," Several times a month I receive inquiries on my LinkedIn page asking for recommendations on how I navigated a male dominated industry, such as solar. I have received a variety of questions from women who are trying to advance their careers in a male dominated industry, with this in mind I have compiled some of those questions and my answers into one article. I would like to start off by saying that this is not a man bashing feminist article by any means. Throughout my career I have had several male mentors and have benefited from their knowledge. I would say the majority of the men that have discriminated against me due to my gender did so on an unconscious level. Does that make it right? Of course not but instead of tearing these men down we need to educate them. However at the same time there have been several instances of blatant discrimination and disrespect. I handled those particular individuals in exactly the same way, I educated them. Before I go further, let me explain a little bit of my background. My career started several years ago in telecommunications. While I was pretty successful, I had no passion for the industry. While looking for new opportunities I saw a job posting for a solar project manager and I applied. Surprisingly I got the job with no experience. I quickly learned my responsibilities in the role and was pretty successful. However I soon realized that several people in my industry we’re not taking me seriously when I would gave input on needed changes or problems. I reasoned that this was because I just didn’t know enough. So I thought to myself if I try to learn and educate myself on every single aspect of this industry then I would be taken seriously. That started my journey and I began working my way up the corporate ladder. Today I am an executive in a very large solar company. This leads to the number one question I am asked regularly. How did I do it? How did I go from knowing nothing about solar to being the vice president of a large solar company? My answer is simple, one word, knowledge. I one hundred percent believe that if I did not take the steps I am about to explain to you, there is no way I would be where I am today. In the beginning, I knew that I had what it takes to be in a leadership role, however when I pursued opportunities for growth, I was told I didn't have enough experience or enough knowledge or I hadn't been in the industry long enough. I decided that I was not going to let that stop me. Every free moment I had away from work, I dove headfirst into understanding every single aspect of solar. I took online courses, I watched YouTube videos and I even spent my vacation days out in the field watching and learning the installation process. Eventually I worked in every capacity of my industry's operations side. I worked in design, installation, project management, site auditor and the service department. You name it, I spent some time learning it from the inside out. I made myself the go-to person, you have a question go ask Rachel she’ll know the answer. Ultimately that is how I broke into management. The company that I worked for let go of their operations manager and they had nobody that knew how to do the job except me. because made me acting operations manager until they found a replacement. But as they interviewed for the replacement they realized no one knew what I did and eventually gave me the job full time. The second biggest question I get is how do I get myself taken seriously especially by colleagues that don’t respect me because of my gender? The answer to that is, match the personality but always be respectful. Whether in my professional or personal life, I observe what type of personality an individual has and then match their energy. For instance if I’m talking to somebody who is more sensitive maybe more empathetic, I approach that person in the same fashion.  On the other hand if somebody is direct and outspoken, I also match that but I do so in a respectful manner making sure to not be rude. People often observe your actions to see if you react in a disrespectful way, if they see that you speak up for yourself but do so respectfully, they are going to remember that. They’re going to remember that you didn’t back down but you also didn’t have to stoop to being rude. Even if that individual doesn’t take you seriously or respect you, people pay attention and they will start to talk about you positively among their peers and if you can gain the respect of your peers you can advance more freely into bigger roles within your company. The third question I am asked the most is what is the key to your success? The answer is simple, everybody else’s success. If your only concern is managing your own career and trying to advance regardless of anyone else, you might be successful but you also not be respected. You will be viewed as a dictator and someone who makes life miserable for others. I have worked for those types, everyone knows there is a difference between a boss and a leader, you have to decide which one you want to be a boss or leader. I want to be a leader. I want to help push and drive everyone around me to advance themselves in their careers or in life in anyway that they can if they have the drive to do so. At the end of the day if somebody who works for you falls flat on their face that can be a reflection of your leadership and your leadership style. Just like if they succeed that is also a reflection of your leadership style, so why wouldn’t you want every single person around you to succeed. When an employee is asked where do you see yourself in the future,  they may say I want to be in your position. I do not take that as a threat, I take that as a challenge, a challenge to help them grow to get where I am because  in the future I want to have grown.  So why not help people get to where I am so that I can continue to grow. The other thing that’s important is that we need to meet people where they are, not everybody wants to grow into a leadership role, not everybody wants to be a manager.  Some people are content with being right where they’re at, they’re very good at their job and they enjoy their job. If they have no desire to grow past that job, why push them into something they don't want? Management is not for everyone, and that’s ok. Instead I need to regularly recognize their hard work make sure I increase their pay alongside inflation. I never tell anybody that there is a cap on their earning potential. It makes no sense to me why people will take leadership roles just because they need to make more money and they’ve been capped on what they can make in their previous role and then hate the job that they’re doing. They’re not going to be good for their employees because they’re unhappy.  It’s OK to be comfortable and not want to grow and we need to acknowledge that as leaders. The last question that I am often asked is if you could give one piece of advice to other women trying to find their way in this industry what would it be? My answer is not to be afraid of confrontation but also do not seek it. Be passionate but not overly passionate because it will come off as drama. Whether we like it or not, whether the industry wants to recognize it or not, the reality is if we cry, we’re too sensitive, if we are passionate and outspoken we are looked at as crazy, if we’re mad and vocal we are a bi*#h so the key to a successful woman in this industry is to balance all of it. It’s OK to cry but I will never do it in front of any of my colleagues. I am known as firm but fair. I stand my ground and I am not afraid of confrontation but I don’t raise my voice. I don’t act like a child, I state the facts, I state my reasoning and I wait. I would say about 80% of the time I come out looking better than the other party because I don’t hit below the belt so to speak, as I said it’s a balancing act. It took me years to be able to master this stuff and I’m still working on it every day and I am far from perfect. I make mistakes often, I always say if you’re going to fail, fail fast so that you can learn from it. I have had moments of insecurities, self-doubt and I didn’t always follow this advice, but I have had amazing individuals both men and women lift me up, give me advice, remind me of my value and I am forever grateful to them. I don’t share this information because I think I’m the greatest thing that has ever lived, far from it. I’m just a simple woman with a hard work ethic and drive to be successful in life. I’m no better or worse than anybody else but if my words of encouragement can help another woman stand her ground or grow her career then I’m 100% OK with sharing the information because as I said if you are successful and then I am successful."
15,Make Money On Facebook In 2022,business," Tips And Tricks To Make Money On Facebook When you start talking about “make money on Facebook”, some people may think you are talking about some kind of scam. But, while money-making scams abound on the internet, Facebook does offer legitimate ways to make money. It is a learning process, and no one says it will be an easy road! But that is what differentiates Facebook from a scam – scams are too easy; they promise much for very little. If you want to make money on Facebook, you’ll need to invest some time and probably some money. Here are some tips for beginners who are new to the Facebook scene (or at least the money-making aspect of Facebook). Facebook Itself- Facebook has various groups dedicated to helping others make money online. Search, find, and join these groups and learn as much as you can from them. Take free resources like e-books and other instructional items. Patience Is Key- Sources say it’s really better if you take it fairly slowly in the beginning, If you want to make money on Facebook, you must have patience. As a beginner, you are learning as you go, and it’s far easier to “cut your teeth” on one project and then apply what you’ve learned to other projects once the first one is underway. Otherwise, you will be trying to learn too many things at once and may get overwhelmed. Your Facebook Fan Page- You will need to have a compelling fan page or “landing page” for visitors. This is where you can post pictures, graphics, and other interesting images that are relevant to your business. This page is also where you can host giveaways, contests, and other promotional events. Make Money On Facebook Advertising- Once you have your fan page set up, you can begin make money on Facebook with ads. You will need to research your market – the type of people you’re selling to – by searching Facebook users’ profiles. (There are various ways to do this – by keywords, common interests, and so forth.) Then you can develop an advertisement that can be posted on the side of their Facebook page. This is why single people end up with “Meet Singles” ads on their Facebook pages, and why people who like to cook may see chef supply companies ads on their pages. Apps- Apps, or applications, are bits of software you can utilize on Facebook. They can be purchased, or you can develop your own. Sometimes a unique app can be a good selling point. Sources say you don’t have to be techno-savvy to create apps; it’s apparently a relatively user-friendly process. There are many tools and resources on the internet to help you in this area. Promoting Your Business on Facebook- Facebook is an increasingly popular social networking site that you can use to promote your business. If you choose to set up a professional page on Facebook, you might consider some of these tips to promote your business. Networking- Presumably, your business has an online presence elsewhere – a website, blog, or some such. On your site, it’s a good idea to set up a link to your Facebook page and vice versa. That way, visitors to your site can click on the link to your Facebook page, and Facebook friends can click over to your website. Giving clients and prospects the option of finding you on Facebook gives your business a personal touch. Facebook is known as a familiar network where people can interact one on one. Another key to making connections is to offer your clients the ability to share your information. You can provide the ability to use Buzz, Tweet, or another social platform to your information quickly and easily. Content- It’s a good idea to have a plan as to what you are going to say on your Facebook page. This is your page’s content – the information you present to your clients and prospects. Make it interesting, relevant and fresh so that people will stay when they visit and return for more content. Interaction- It’s up to you as to how much interaction you want between yourself and your clients; but regardless, it’s a good idea to be consistent. If you want a lot of interaction, you’ll need to have interactive applications on your page (apps). These include things like contests, games, and special offers. Consider creating apps for your page, and your information has the potential to “go viral” and reach many people quickly. Give Away Freebies- Interactive or not, business professionals generally agree that giving away freebies is a great way to promote your business. If you give away a few high-quality freebies, then your fans will be likely to purchase your higher-quality items or products you’re selling. Advertising Your Business On Facebook- There is more to Facebook than friends and contacts! Advertising with Facebook is an up-and-coming way to enhance your business. If you’d like to consider advertising with Facebook, here are some secrets and top tips on how to make it work for you. Demographic- Known variously as your “target market,” “target audience,” “demographic,” and so forth, determining just who it is you’re selling to is a step that shouldn’t be skipped. Facebook actually offers tools for you to research your demographics’ Facebook presence – find out the groups, events, and individual profiles that are relevant to your business. Build Your Own Business Community- Facebook is about making connections. Building communities via Facebook is a good way to conglomerate members of your demographic and find new ones. For example, your clients and fans may join one of your groups and invite their friends to join as well. Keep it interesting and lively by holding discussions, virtual events, providing exciting information, and so forth. Another note on community building – remember that this is a feature at the heart of Facebook, so direct sales ads tend not to do as well. The majority of Facebook users are on the site because they want to form relationships, not necessarily because they want to buy something. Facebook Tools And Resources- Facebook offers guidelines and tools for advertising. Check out www.facebook.com/FacebookAds for details on how Facebook recommends you advertise through them. You can develop your ad through a tool offered at www.facebook.com/advertising, too. You can just begin with an image and a brief tagline or description. Your ad will appear on the right side of those Facebook pages you have targeted. Key words- It’s a good idea to learn to integrate key words into your ads. These are words that are gleaned from people’s profile information, and you can use these key words in your ad to customize it to a particular demographic. In fact, what you find in people’s profiles is key to filtering out who is in your target market and who is not. Set A Budget- Setting a budget will help prevent you from experimenting with a lot of different ad techniques, thereby wasting money and time. Your advertising campaign should have a definite budget limit, and your goals need to be clearly defined alongside it. In other words, you need to know just what it is you expect for your advertising dollar. Research Other Ads- Consider doing some research – click on the ads you see on your Facebook page, and see what they are up to. What kind of ads seem effective? Which ones have an approach that appeals to you? Which ads keep appearing over and over, indicating they have something that’s working for them? So I hope you can now see all the different ways that you can start to make money on Facebook. Facebook is one of the best ways to grow your business fast. If you do not have your very own online business set up, and you are interested in learning all that you can about online marketing, and how you can set up and grow your very own online business, please feel free to come visit Digital Business Lessons.

16,The Best YouTube SEO Tips to Implement,business," Everyone is aware of the fact that it’s easier to watch a video than go through a long blog post.

17,Work From Home – Can Anyone Really Make Money Online From Home?,business," Many people think that the whole problem of making money online from home is either too complicated or an unreliable way to make money. The main reason many people fail on the internet is that they think the way to get rich quick and effortless is the main reason. When they realize they need work, sacrifice, and resources, they give up. But there are people who make money online from home every day. That's how it's done.

This unpaid traffic can take some time to absorb, but once it arrives it can bring a steady stream of leads to your website. Buy website visitors You will get results when you pay for your website traffic, but once you stop paying, the traffic stops. So you need to invest your money wisely.

If you don't know where to start or are not getting the success you want online,"
18,Poppy - latest mobile bazaar with different gear for shopping,business," People always wonder what the antidote is to Amazon, an eCommerce empire that takes pride in ever-improving efficiency and using robots to replace humans. Maybe Poppy is our latest answer. Poppy is a fashion and lifestyle-focused marketplace. When you open the Poppy mobile app, which is the primary form of the user interface, you can explore thousands of unique brands with distinctive identities and various aesthetic choices. From indie yoga apparel brands to succulent gift boxes for birthdays, you can easily discover goodies to light up your day. There is no other inspirational marketplace quite like this. Poppy has nearly 100 million products curated from all indie brands all over the internet. It is more like a ""Shoppable Pinterest"" or mobile-friendly ""Google Shopping"". And it is an ever-growing platform with daily updates of 15,000 products.  So you may ask why we need another shopping platform like this? Why don't we just all stick to Amazon? Poppy is very different from Amazon in many ways. It is way more mobile-friendly (aka Gen Z friendly) than Amazon and its algorithm resembles a Tiktok like personal shopping experience. While Amazon takes pride in shopping efficiency and speedy check-out, Poppy wants you to stay as long as possible on this platform to pick a summer dress, to compare a candle, to bargain for a painting or maybe at last to buy a pair of black pearl earrings. Bezos mentioned Amazon's contribution to society was the amount of time saved from offline shopping chores. Poppy's ambition is to replicate the offline bazaar feeling of endless browsing and inspirational shopping of things you have never seen. It is just very different from Amazon. Amazon is a behemoth pushing products to their lowest price but Poppy highlights the brand personality. Different from vintage-driven eBay and craft-only Etsy, you can find thousands of brands at your fingertip on Poppy. You can easily follow these brands and receive the latest updates. You can check their new arrivals, latest sales, social media footprint, and influencer reviews (sometimes it can be a warning sign against buying). It highlights brands' unique personality as it features Allbirds, Cupshe, Alo Yoga among many others. It is also a marketplace that sides with consumers. Different from other platforms that have huge fake review problems, Poppy just voluntarily exposed bad reviews to all. Nothing beats an authentic user review. Poppy meticulously compiled thousands of user reviews to make sure you have a comprehensive review of the product before you make the final purchase decision. You can see products worn by real people or placed in real homes. We understand it may in the short term damage Poppy's profitability but it does not matter because consumers will eventually side with Poppy. It is Christmas time now and Poppy just comes in very handy. You can easily compile a wishlist on Poppy and share it with friends on your social network. You can also discover wishlists prepared by fellow poppies, from ""Squid Game Toys"" to ""Christmas Gift Inspiration"". You can easily find great minds that think alike and enjoy their finds on Poppy. Poppy wishlist is your practical and affordable cheatsheet to make life better. We talk too much about efficiency in our day-to-day life. I can assure you that we will talk even more in the metaverse to come. Poppy's wishlist may be a good reminder of the ""social element"" of our shopping experience, especially in the post-pandemic era. If you agreed with their approach and wanted to build up your own online store, maybe now is the time to join the rebels of brands and sign up for the marketplace."
19,How to fill your PMP application form like a pro? (with examples),business," Filling out the PMP application form and getting approval from PMI is one of the first accomplishments on the road to becoming a PMP. Hence, it's imperative to understand how to fill out the PMP application correctly to enhance your chances of application approval. In the article below, I'll explain using examples all the steps you must take to fill your PMP exam correctly. So, let's get started!! Getting to the application form To get to the application form, first, visit pmi.org and register on their website. The registration process is pretty simple and is similar to registering with an email address and password on any other website. Once you have completed registration and logged into your dashboard under the section 'my PMI', you must navigate to the 'PMP application' home page and click on ""Apply now for your PMP"". Once you do this, you will be directed to the page where you must start documenting your details. How many sections does the PMP application have? The PMP application primarily has four sections that should be completed: Academic Education, Professional Education, Experience, and Exam details. #1 Completing the Academic Education Information section The first section to complete is the academic education information section. This is the first section where your PMP exam eligibility is reviewed. Hence, you must review the criteria for your eligibility for the PMP exam. You must enter the highest level of education you have attained (e.g., Master's or Bachelor's degree), the starting and ending years of your education, the country, and the institution's name in which you received your education. #2 Completing the Professional Education section The Professional education section is where you need to demonstrate your Project Management education, i.e., provide evidence of 35 contact hours you would've acquired from your PMP training provider. Here are all the different ways you can earn the 35 contact hours required for your PMP exam application: A. Physical/Virtual or self-paced courses from training companies offering project management courses. B. PMI Authorized training partners (ATPs) C. PMI Chapters D. Employer-sponsored programs. E. University or college programs related to project management/PMP. To fill this section, you must document the course title, the name of the training provider, the start and end dates of the course, and the qualifying hours (typically, this will be 35 hours). Make sure you have these details with you when you get to this section. When you complete a course with a training provider, they will provide you with a contact hours certificate. However, you don't have to upload your training certificates in this section but will need them should your application be selected for an audit. #3 Completing the Experience section The experience section of the PMP application is the hardest to fill for the majority of the candidates. Therefore, you must expect to spend the maximum time filling out this section since getting this right is your doorway to application approval. Here are the sections you need to fill out in the PMP application: Project Title Organization where the project was carried out Job Title Functional Reporting Area; the organizational department where the project was carried out The primary focus area of the organization The project approach used (Traditional, Agile, or Hybrid) Project Team size Project Budget Project Start and End dates Project Description; A high-level summary of your experience includes the project objective, outcome, role on the project, and responsibilities and deliverables. The standard response according to PMI is between 200 to 500 words, although people have written more than 500 words of description. Be as concise as you can since someone is going to read your application. While filling out the application, you cannot have overlapping months of experience. This means that if you've been working on two projects simultaneously, you can only count experience towards one project for the months they were overlapping. For example, if Project 1 lasted from Jan 2020 to April 2020 and Project 2 from Feb 2020 to June 2020, you can count Project 1 experience from January–April, a total of 4 months, and Project 2 experience only for May and June, a total of 2 months. Adding the experience of Project 1 and 2 sums up to 6 months of total experience. Here are some tips to consider while documenting your project management work experience: Use project management terminology as provided in the PMBOK while describing your projects. Include projects where you've played the role of a Project or Program Manager or led and directed. Focus more on what you did on the project. Make sure to bring out what you did on the project from a leading and directing perspective. Start from the current project and work backward until you've reached the total months required. Demonstrate your experience and skills across a wide range of domains and activities from the PMBOK. For example, you can write specific actions that you performed across the five process groups: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing a project. Note that project management experience is required in each process area when all projects are totaled, but not necessarily on each project. Check spellings and grammar using an app like grammarly.com. Stick to the PMI suggested word limit. Let's try to see an example of a PMP application written by one of the candidates. This example contains elements of agile. Project Objective: To research, design, and deliver a new IT training course to the marketing and sales teams for a global launch. Project Outcome: An IT training product ready for global launch by the company. Role on the Project: My role on the project was that of a Project Manager. Responsibilities: I evaluated the feasibility of the new course and, based on the results, created a Project charter along with the sponsor. I identified major stakeholders whose involvement would have an impact on the project and vice versa. Since the project used an agile approach for product development, I gathered high-level requirements from the stakeholders, determined the 'must have' and 'should have' user stories that the IT training product must contain, and created a release schedule and project budget. I set up a risk register, identified high-level risks that we might encounter during the iterations, and a risk management plan to deal with them. I acquired the team and the resources to execute the project, facilitated the various agile meetings for the teams, removed impediments that obstructed the team, and resolved team conflicts. I closely monitored the project's progress to keep it within project timelines and budget. I also worked with stakeholders and the team to incorporate any changes required to the product during the project. I worked with the sponsor and the subject matter experts to get formal acceptance of the IT training product and handed over the product to the sales and marketing teams for the global launch. Here's another example of a PMP application of a candidate who worked on a Predictive Project. Project Objective: Design, Deployment, and deliver a Learning Management System (LMS) across various internal organizational departments. Project Outcome: Provide a more user-centric and engaging learning experience for the employees of the organization. Role on the Project: I led the successful creation and delivery of the Learning Management System (LMS) Responsibilities: Created a business case to justify the investment in developing a Learning Management System (LMS) for the organization. Created measurable success criteria for the project and a benefits measurement plan. Identified vital project stakeholders and documented their expectations in a stakeholder register. Determined the scope, time, cost, quality, and risks affecting the project and created the project management plan with its components plans. Got the plan formally approved by the project sponsor and held a kick-off meeting before project execution. During execution, delegated work packages to various teams, evaluated individual and team performance, and led team-building activities. Evaluated and mitigated the risks affecting the project. Provided regular project progress reports to sponsor and senior stakeholders and facilitated product approval meetings with reviewers and customer representatives. Continuously monitored the project against its performance baselines and managed the change control process in collaboration with teams and stakeholders. Gained final acceptance of the end product from the customers and solicited feedback about project quality and performance. Consolidated lessons learned into an organizational knowledge base. Archived project documents and records. Completing the exam section The final section of the PMP application online form is the exam details section. In this section, you'll need to complete all the information related to the PMP exam and provide your contact information. You'll need to enter the following information: Your address Your name in the form as it appears on your ID Your name, exactly as you want it to appear on your certificate. Your email address Your phone number The country where you want to take the exam. You'll also be asked to state if you wish to request any exam accommodations, for example, due to disability and/or other conditions that may impair your ability to take the exam. Here are some commonly asked questions we encounter by candidates working on their PMP applications. Some of these might even answer the questions that you probably have. Within how many days must I finish my application once started? Once you start the PMP application, you have 90 days to complete the online application form. Also, you cannot cancel the application once begun. You can save the incomplete application and edit the information later. What are the PMP application processing times? PMI needs five business days to review the contents of your application and process it. Must your application be picked up for an audit, you will have 90 days within which you must respond to PMI with the requested documents. What happens during a PMP applicant audit? Amongst the plethora of PMP applications received by PMI, only a few of them get selected for audit. PMI does not disclose how it selects applications for audit, and the application selections are primarily random. Applications selected for audit are informed via email within minutes of application submission. Since anyone's PMP application can be selected for audit, it's best to know what you should be doing if your application gets selected for an audit. You will need to submit the following documents to complete the audit process: Copies of your education qualifications (e.g., degree/diploma certificates). Signatures from your supervisor(s)/references for the project(s) are recorded in the experience section. A copy of your contact hours certificate from the training institute. You have 90 days to provide all the documentation to PMI. The audit itself takes only 5-7 business days to complete. Ask your references to send you their signed copies of the project management experience verification, and you can pack all the documents in a single envelope and send it to PMI at this address: PMI Attn: Certification Audit 14 Campus Blvd. Newtown Square, PA 19073-3299 USA Now that you understand how to fill the major sections of the PMP application in 2021, gather all the information you need and get started."
20,Automated Email Marketing Logic,business," Email has become the new Pony Express. But, instead of the sound of pounding hooves across the prairies and deserts, it’s now the sound of pounding fingers on billions of keyboards and mobile devices. There is no doubt, that for some time now, email has become a new way of life that has changed our society in ways we could never have conceived. Whether you have a little business you run from your kitchen table, or living room or even your garage, email has probably helped you in your business many times more than you could even think about. If you have a small business on Main Street America or if you’re a larger retail or chain store, or especially if you’re one of the main brand mega-stores, email is a significant part of your business success. We all know by now that as much as direct mail and brochures and other paper forms of advertising go, email is right in the thick of it all, and more than likely at the top of the heap. To the point, if you want to succeed in this new world, you have got to latch on to email because it will take you on a wild ride to success and profits. Not to mention email is a great tool for customer service and just for keeping in touch with one another. This now brings me to mention an invaluable marketing tool called Automated Email Marketing.  Automated Email Marketing has been around for some time and many people, especially your mom and pop and many small and large retailers and big box stores have been raking in the big bucks for years as a result of implementing email as a major marketing tool for their businesses. There are many ways to purchase these tools and the prices can vary. There are some that are free. Just remember that well-known refrain, “you get what you pay for.” Now that’s not to say you can’t get some services for free that are actually pretty great. We can use Gmail as a good example. It’s not a completely automated email marketing tool, but I have to say it does provide a more than excellent email service for everyone, individuals and businesses alike. Then you have services like Get Response and A Weber. You have Mailchimp and Constant Contact. These are all excellent automated email marketing services.

1,How to Rank Better for Local Searches on Google,business," Local SEO is of much significance for any business. Almost 50 percent of overall Google searches look for local information. It means if you have not optimized your website for local searches, you are majorly missing out on a vast chunk of your prospective customers. Put simply, local SEO is paramount if you desire your business to keep itself relevant. Local SEO enhances the visibility of businesses online. It quite resembles organic SEO but has an extra geographical aspect to it. Optimizing your site for it helps you to gain a better rank in the search engine results pages for local searches. Have you ever observed how, when you type the name of a service in your local area, the first three blocks above the maps appear distinctly? It is also called the 'Google 3-Pack.' It's a method by which Google showcases the top three results for the local search. These three results are bound to get a huge amount of local traffic. So how do you optimize your website to get into this coveted pack? Given below are five critical techniques you can use to boost your local SEO. As a business owner, you should waste no time implementing these techniques to your advantage. Set up and Optimize Your Google My Business For ranking locally, the first step you should take is creating a Google My Business (GMB). Do you know that it exerts the number one influence when it comes to ranking locally? After you set it up, Google showcases your services quicker in local search results. You also gain more chances of being showcased in the Google 3-Pack. Apart from the search results, the search engine also utilizes your data from GMB from Maps and Google Assistant. Setting up a GMB page isn't difficult. You might even have one. But is it complete? View the visual that signals how complete your profile is. It is best to complete it 100 percent and fill out all the necessary fields. While you are at it, pay close attention to your business address and contact information. They are critical for your GMB page. Now optimize it as follows: Utilize keywords in your text. Type in the opening hours of your services. Add a lot of high-quality pictures. Respond to customer reviews. Track the GMB results. Put Your Organization Name, Contact Address, and Number in Your Website Footer It is an easy yet overlooked thing by many business owners. You can enhance your chances of being found locally by placing your company's name, phone number, and address in your website's footer. You should do this in the footer's HTML. However, keep in mind not to use an image. It's because the search engine is not able to see images and will thus not able to include you in its search results pages. If you really want to enhance your local visibility, you can put some more effort on your part by using the Google Markup Helper. It's used for structuring data and enables you to format various components on your website's pages. It helps Google to comprehend better what's written on your webpage. Naturally, it enhances your likelihood of ranking better locally. Optimize Your On-Page Content Spend adequate time optimizing your on-page content. Use local keywords and location names when doing so. Add local keywords on different pages. Use them in text, header tags, and meta titles. But do not go overboard. Be mindful of the keyword density. Your content will never be shown on local search if it becomes high. Create Distinct Destination Pages Making unique destination webpages for local businesses can give you the online visibility you need. But you need to ensure that every landing page consists of unique content and relevant keywords according to the location. Duplicate content will not help you to improve your ranking. When you are making destination pages for varied locations, remember to put the location name in the URL. Final Words When you start optimizing your business website for local searches, you'll be surprised to discover a significant increase in local traffic. Start implementing the simple tips given above to improve your ranking online. Consistent efforts at optimizing for local searches is what will yield you the desired outcome."
2,Do Personal Injury Calculators Work?,business," If you’ve been injured in an accident, you’re probably curious about what kind of insurance compensation you could win to help you with your medical bills, lost wages, and the list goes on. You may have even found like I did, websites on the internet with personal injury calculators. Naturally curious, I set out to find out whether these personal injury settlement calculators work. Here’s what I found out. They do and they don’t. Not a very satisfying answer, I know, but let me explain. I spoke with two attorneys on this subject, Bob and Andrew Helland (in full disclosure, they’re clients of mine). They explained to me that personal injury calculators aren’t usually fine-tuned enough to account for the nuances involved in personal injury cases. Personal injury calculators are not detailed enough to be accurate, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not useful on some level. To understand what they were getting at, they first had to explain to me how most personal injury calculators work. The typical personal injury calculator prompts you to enter what lawyers call your “special damages,” which are then automatically added up by the calculator. Special damages are the costs caused by your injury that are easy to track and add up, things like medical bills, lost income, property damage, etc. Then, the personal injury calculator will usually have you provide a multiplier — a number from 1 to 5 — to estimate your “general damages.” In other words, they multiply your special damages by whatever number, 1 through 5, you give as your general-damages multiplier. If I’ve lost you, your general damages represent the harder-to-add-up ways in which your life has been impacted by your injury, your pain and suffering, lost quality of life, etc. “What number should I enter for my general damages,” you ask? Chances are, that I, with no knowledge of your case, would apply just as accurate a multiplier as you, unless you’re a trained legal professional. Bob and Andrew inform me that there’s no hard-and-fast rule that tells you what number to assign for your pain and suffering, etc. It’s the job of the attorney to paint a picture of the loss suffered by the client and ask for what he or she deems logically and legally appropriate. So, if you’re feeling really down about your injury and you give yourself a 5 for general damages, chances are that the personal injury calculator will generate a total payout estimate that brings a smile back to your face. But was your 5 warranted? Would a jury or insurance expert see it the same way as you do? Maybe. Maybe not. It’s true that these calculators are based on a way that lawyers have calculated the value of personal injury claims through the years. Insurance companies even use sophisticated tools that are similar in theory to many personal injury calculators. However, there is a vast difference between the average person crunching the numbers on his or her case versus a trained and educated lawyer. It’s also well known among attorneys that this formula, special damages x general damages, doesn’t completely add up in many cases. What if someone got too much medical treatment for his injury or not enough? Either error would throw off the math of his payout completely. This is why personal injury calculators shouldn’t be seen as precise instruments but as ballparking devices that can show you a range of possible payout scenarios. Seen in that light, they can do some good. If a personal injury settlement calculator helps you get your mind around an idea of what you might be owed, it might motivate you to seek out a lawyer, which could substantially increase the amount of your settlement and improve your quality of life. However, my attorney friends would caution you not to let legal websites fill you with false assurances of guaranteed payouts. Your best bet is always to talk about the specifics of your case with an attorney."

4,How To Avoid Running Into Mortgage Paying Trouble for Calgary Homeowners,business," You may think it’s only the tenant who has a hard time paying the mortgage, but as a real estate investor or landlord, there may be times when it’s hard to pay the mortgage on your end as well. Here are some things you can do to avoid facing difficulty in paying your mortgage each month. Keep your properties full. While it may sound overly simplified, this is the most obvious method for ensuring you’ve got rent money coming in each month to cover your property mortgage payments. Don’t allow yourself to get slack on advertising for new tenants. And don’t put off screening applicants or filling your properties because you get busy or overworked. Recognize filling your vacancies as a major aspect of your REI business success and deal with it quickly and efficiently every time. Do your best to find quality tenants. While you want to keep your properties full, finding good quality tenants is key. By “good” it means they pay their rent on time, keep the property maintained and don’t abuse the lease. By using background and credit checks, you can find the best tenants available and thereby do what’s possible to keep your rental fees coming in regularly, which will help you pay the mortgage when it comes due. Look for longterm tenants. Don’t assume that quality tenants will necessarily be longterm ones. Some good renters may know they can’t stay over a few months at most. They may be students or working a temporary job. They may just be living in an area waiting to move or retire somewhere else. Whatever the situation, opt for longterm renters when the choice is available. Doing so will make filling a vacancy at least a more infrequent possibility. Keep the property well maintained. If you want good tenants, longterm tenants and tenants who pay their rent on time, do your part to keep them. Deal with maintenance issues quickly. Make repairs as necessary. Upgrade appliances or at least ensure the ones you provide are in good working order. Respond to your tenants’ calls quickly, or if you can’t be sure they know you’ll be unavailable for awhile. Being a good landlord will go a long in way in developing lasting relationships with your tenants, which will in turn, help you keep them in your property longer. Often a tenant and landlord relationship can turn an average tenant into a great one simply because they want to keep that relationship intact. In a tough economy, it’s important to do all you can to avoid facing the difficulty of paying the mortgage. That applies just as much to an REI professional as it does to the average renter. These simple tips can help as you work to develop lasting, longterm, rent paying tenants to keep your properties bringing in the income you need every month."
5,3 Marketing Strategies Your Retail Business Needs,business," When it comes to finding the right marketing strategy for your retail business you may find it difficult to know where to start. So, whether you have been in the business for years, or you are still trying to find your feet with a new venture, you will need to seriously consider the marketing strategies that will be most effective for your business. What can often make the thought of finding the right marketing campaign for your business so daunting is that there are many different types of marketing strategies for you to choose from. The right one for you mostly depends on the size of your business, and the industry you operate in, as well as what you want it to achieve. Whether you want to boost your sales or grow your customer reach, the right marketing strategy is out there waiting for you. Here you will find 3 marketing strategies that your retail business just can’t live without, and our top tips on how to implement them. Digital marketing In the past few years, many retail businesses have had to reconsider their marketing strategies and increasingly divert their time and resources towards more digital forms of marketing. This is because of how much of our everyday lives are now digital. There are two different approaches that you can take when it comes to digital marketing, but these two branches also work great together. Paid advertising is arguably one of the most well-known forms of digital marketing and refers to an online model whereby businesses pay for their advertisements to be shown to users.  For this reason, paid advertising is often referred to as pay-per-click (PPC) which means that every time someone clicks on your ad you are charged a fee. Another digital marketing strategy that any business needs is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), which refers to the process of improving your site visibility when potential customers search online for the services or products that you provide. You may also hear this marketing strategy referred to as organic, as while it can take time and money to develop your SEO strategy, you aren’t charged every time someone clicks like a paid advertising campaign. Search websites, such as Google will crawl through your website and assign it a value. This includes how easy to navigate your website is, but also how fresh and helpful the content you have is. If your website is deemed beneficial to the user by Google then you can expect to rank higher in the search listings. Most people click on one or more of the top few links on their Google search, the higher up your business is in a search result the more potential customers will visit your website. Point of sale marketing This marketing strategy is a form of marketing that most of us have experienced at some time in our lives as a consumer. Point of sale marketing refers to any efforts that are made by a business to boost sales at the moment a purchase is being made. While for some businesses their point of sale could be sitting around the table of a business meeting, or on their internet checkout page, for many businesses it largely refers to the area around their cash registers. Many retail businesses use point of sale marketing by using signage to advertise their services or discounts, as well as strategically placing discounted items where customers queue to pay for their purchases. Point of sale marketing is so effective as it captures customer interest while they are waiting to pay and can encourage them to not only spend more via impulse purchases but also encourage them to return to your retail business again in the future. Social media marketing Most businesses now accept that they need a social media presence if they want to be successful in today’s economy, and this is no different for retail businesses. Therefore, if you have not yet set up a social media account for your business, then we recommend that you do that today. Potential customers often go straight to social media to find out information about shops or products, so you could be missing out on revenue by not having one. However, it isn’t enough to just have a social media account, you also need to include it in marketing strategies by keeping it active and valuable to visitors. Our top tip when it comes to social media marketing is to remember that your social media account is a gateway to the rest of your business as it can encourage users to visit your website or even your physical store in the future. By trying out each or a combination of the marketing strategies discussed above, you can help your business grow and develop, while also increasing potential revenue."
6,Tiger Locksmith and Security Lays Down the Major Aspects of Fire-Rated Doors,business," Fire-rated doors are also called fire doors. These are the doors that are designed to withstand fires. In the event of a fire, the fire-rated doors survive way longer than your ordinary ones. The doors contain the fire and keep it far away from the property's escape route. Fire door requirements for the different countries and regions vary considerably. But if you want effective ones, they should follow three major points. They must be constructed of the right material, placed strategically as per the region's needs, and installed properly. Below is everything you should know about these kinds of doors if you plan to install them at your premises. The label of fire rating – When planning to install such a door, you need to examine the fire rating label. The label is indicative of the door's fire rating and tells you about the body that assigned it that rating. You can find this label on the door and door frame's hinge side. It's usually hidden from your view. A door that's fire-resistant – A door that has fire-resistant properties are made out of materials like steel and wood. Between both of them, steel doors have greater fire ratings because they are non-combustible and don't feed the fire. Wooden fire-rated doors come with a gypsum core. It's a soft mineral that can resist heat. But gypsum board can also be combined with hollow steel doors. Besides gypsum, vermiculite boards can also be utilized in designing fire-rated doors as vermiculite is a good fire retardant. Glass and seals that are resistant to fire – Some doors consist of vision panels along with fire-rated glass. But you generally cannot find them in doors with greater fire ratings. A fire door's edges should have threshold seals made out of intumescent strips. It's because they are able to contain smoke in the event of fire effectively. Fire-resistant hardware – When a fire breaks, its critical for the fire-rated door to be closed. Otherwise, it will not be able to control the spread of fire as well as smoke. It's why the best fire-rated doors come fitted with self-closing and latching hardware that is fire-resistant. Apart from this self-closing mechanism, these doors also require steel ball-bearing hinges. It's because these types of hinges have greater durability than the standard ones. Role of fire-rated doors in the event of a fire – There's no door that is 100 percent fire-proof. In various incidences of fire inside an area, the temperatures can increase to the extent that even steel starts melting. But as mentioned before, the major function of a fire door is not only to survive a fire but also to slow it down and contain its spread. This results in less damage to people and property. Fire-resistant doors provide a chance to put away fire before it starts spreading. In minor cases, the doors contain the fire so that it can be dealt with properly. Thus, the doors, apart from saving the lives of people, also reduce damage to the rest of the property. They also protect the belongings kept there. Fire doors provide a safe exit – In most instances, the fire door will effectively contain the fire until all the people inside the building have abandoned it safely. Apart from keeping the fire contained, a fire door that's correctly sealed will also allow the smoke also to be contained effectively. It enables people to exit the building with a lesser chance of suffocating themselves by smoke. So, as long as fire doors remain intact, they act as a good medium of escape. Does your property require a fire-rated door – In Canada, only commercial or residential buildings require such kinds of doors. But it doesn't mean that they are completely useless for a house. Although they are not usually needed in a house, such types of doors can effectively contain the fire in those areas that are vulnerable to being a house fire source. You have the choice of having a fire door for rooms like the kitchen or basement, where there are several electrical devices. Fire-rated exterior doors provide a layer of safety to ensure that there will be points of exit in the event of a house fire. Fire-resistant doors for a building – These doors are usually needed for properties that function as public buildings, office areas, multi-family homes, apartments, and the like. Ontario's building code and fire code need suitable fire-rated doors for fire exits, corridor doors, garbage room doors, and laundry room doors. It is important to place your trust in a renowned manufacturer whenever you are looking for fire-rated doors. You can also get in touch with a reliable 24-hour locksmith in Toronto in your area to know more about the specifics of such doors and the available options for you. The experts are highly experienced in this area, and you can gain much from their insights."
7,The media as a tool in successful agribusiness education in Zambia,business," Abstract Agribusiness may be broadly viewed as agricultural extension. Agribusiness education is an essential component of agricultural development and it has, in many cases, enhanced agricultural development and economic emancipation of many countries world over. The role of agribusiness education is to ensure that the body of knowledge generated by academicians and scientists reaches the end-users, the farmers. With good access to this knowledge, farmers are able to make informed decisions regarding their production timing and choices. The dissemination of agribusiness knowledge to the farmers has not fully been exploited in Zambia. Following the findings of the paper, the quality of agribusiness advocacy by the media is very poor and leaves much to be desired. The media has neglected agricultural information in preference to politics and life-style, the areas that seemingly have more challenges and high risk. Keywords: Agricultural education; Agribusiness education;		Advocacy;  Media; Tool Introduction Background Agriculture is the backbone of our country and we all need to know a lot about it. There is no doubt that without agriculture we cannot survive in the world because this would entail total lack of food. Agricultural education is an academic field that teaches students about agriculture, food and natural resources. Through these subject areas, agricultural educators teach students a wide variety of skills, including science, math, communications, leadership, management and technology. As an applied subject, agribusiness education teaches farmers about agricultural opportunities, choices and value associated with particular agricultural products, agro-processing, value addition and marketing and delivery of products. The role of disseminating agricultural education and agribusiness advocacy has been entirely shouldered by the agricultural extension officers in the practical field and the agricultural education teachers in the classroom in the academic circles. This is, however, a preserve of the minority schools and farmers because very few schools offer agricultural education and very few farmers have full interaction with extension officers. The ratio of agricultural extension officers to the farmers is very high thus rendering the whole system ineffective and inefficient. Agricultural education should be in every school, but it isn’t. The importance of our curricula spreads further than the classroom because we all need agriculture to survive. The food we eat, the clothes we wear and the raw materials used by various industries all come from agriculture (Wallace et al, 1996). Agricultural education is the connection point, along with the cooperative extension, between cutting edge agriculture research in our universities and our high school students. These students are the farmers, ranchers, researchers, marketing specialists and food scientists of tomorrow. The key to creating sustainable productive systems is education and research passed down to the next generation of leaders. Agriculture remains a major contributor to the economies of most developing countries. In some countries, however, its share of gross domestic product (GDP) has drastically fallen or stagnated of late, and Zambia is no exception. The agricultural sector in developing countries is undergoing rapid changes as a consequence of both technological progress and economic forces which call for improved knowledge delivery, increased market focus, competitiveness and higher productivity (Wallace & Nilsson, 1997). Agricultural information centres like colleges, universities and research stations need to determine their unique functions and the special attributes that they can offer students and the agricultural community. The media takes up the role of linking information centres to information users, the farmers. Agricultural institutions need to do a better job of carrying through with their unique ability to solve the agricultural problems of the communities they serve. The media, on the other hand, will need to do a better job of communicating the generated knowledge for its application and exploitation (Davies et al 2009). A commitment to developing communication infrastructure, especially with regard to the new computer-based communication technologies, should be a priority because of the potential to reduce the information gap. The media too, with regard to audio-video broadcasting can be an essential element in the delivery of agribusiness education to the farming communities. New options for agribusiness media programs should be based on enabling farmers to access valid information and meet the expectations of agricultural productivity, processing, value addition and marketing so as to meet the needs of the private sector and the ability to stand functional in the agricultural community (FAO, 1996). Statement of the problem The problem at hand is the lack of substantial agribusiness advocacy by the media in Zambia. The media seems to have neglected its agribusiness advocacy role in preference to other areas. There is insufficient agribusiness advocacy by the media in the country. General objective The general objective of this paper was to outline the functional roles of the media in advocating agribusiness education. Specific objectives Research questions How is the quality of agribusiness education delivered by the media in Zambia? Is the media doing enough in advocating agribusiness? Are there any challenges faced by the media in the delivery of agribusiness education? What challenges compromise the delivery of agribusiness education by the media in Zambia? What should be done to improve agribusiness advocacy by the media in Zambia? Literature review Definition and scope of agribusiness education Agribusiness education is simply another refined term for diversified agricultural extension. It is the application of scientific research and knowledge to agricultural practices through farmer education. Generally, agricultural extension can be defined as the delivery of information inputs to farmers (Anderson JR & Gershon, F, 2007). The role of extension services is invaluable in teaching farmers how to improve their productivity and supply of produce. Extension is also critical to move research from the lab to the field for application and to ensure a return on investment in research by translating new knowledge into innovative practices (Davies et al., 2009). With massive research and rich findings, agricultural development can remain a mere dream if the knowledge is not delivered to the farmers who transform it into practice. Extension services are classified into 3 types. The first being technology transfer. This encompasses the traditional model of the transfer of advice, knowledge and information in a linear manner. The second type is the advisory and it involves the use of farmers of a cadre of experts as a source of advice in relation to specific problems faced by them. The third type of extension service is facilitation. The aim of this model is to help farmers to define their own problems and develop their own solutions to the problems or challenges they face (Beynon et al, 1998). The role of the media in agribusiness education The media acts as a link between the scientific centres and the farming community. The media disseminates agribusiness education to ensure that it reaches the end-users, the farmers. With a broad look at extension, the media bridges the gap. Traditional extension systems focus on increasing agricultural productivity, use a top-down approach and often emphasize the transfer of technology. This model for extension, however, is becoming outdated in the more competitive, market-oriented climate of today’s agriculture. Alternative models have emerged that recognize other actors than traditional public extension services. The new focus includes agribusiness companies, NGOs, agro-dealers, producer organisations and farmer to farmer exchanges. Many countries, especially in Latin America, have privatized and contracted out (outsourced) advisory services. Uganda’s National Agricultural Advisory Services have also contracted out extension services to the private sector and NGOs employing various means of information dissemination (World Bank, 2007). After years of neglect and disinvestment, there has been renewed emphasis and new approaches to demand-led extension. Within the donor community, a revitalized and expanded role for advisory and information services is seen as central to pro-poor agricultural growth. Apart from their conventional role of providing and transferring knowledge in order to increase productivity, new functions include linking smallholder farmers to high value and export markets, promoting environmental outcomes and coping with public health challenges as cross-cutting issues in the agribusiness arena. Disseminating agribusiness education through the media is ideal in that more clients may be reached more easily than any other method (World Bank, 2007). Information on the direct costs and cost-effectiveness of agricultural extension services across Africa is sparse, in part because this is not often evaluated. In the case of Malawi in the early 1980’s, direct agent-to-farmer extension services cost US$21 per contact and US$4 to US$5 per participant for a one-day ‎‎training course. By comparison, a mobile film show cost US$0.17 per farmer per hour and a radio programme cost US$0.004 per listener per hour showing that even early information communication technologies helped to reduce the costs of delivery (World Bank, 2005). The state of agribusiness education in Zambia In Africa there is an estimated 1 extension worker per 4,000 farmers, compared with 1 per 200 hundred farmers in developed countries. This ratio falls far below the Food and Agriculture Organization recommendation of 1 officer for every 400 farmers (Waruru, 2011). Evidence from Nigeria shows that the higher the extension agent to farmer ratio, the more successful the extension delivery (Action Aid, 2013). According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation, investment in agriculture extension services needs to increase to 3.5% of the agriculture GDP in order to achieve the necessary coverage. However, no African government is currently spending even a tenth of that amount (Waruru, 2011). A more recent analysis of farmer field schools (FFS), a participatory approach to farmer education and empowerment featuring discovery learning, experimentation, and group action, found the cost per participant to range between US$20 and US$40. These estimates however, do not take into account the costs to beneficiaries which can make the approach relatively costly compared to other types of programme approaches (Waddington & White, 2014). Although government expenditure on extension services has typically been low, evidence from several countries shows that agricultural extension is a pro-poor public investment with high returns to poverty reduction. The obstacles and solutions to successful agribusiness education in Zambia It is generally costly for rural farmers to access agribusiness education. There are several factors at play. The high cost many farmers face in accessing extension services, such as travelling to a regional town or city, can act as a strong disincentive to seek out advice and support. To resolve this challenge, mobile phone networks can help to disseminate knowledge given the dramatic increase in access to such networks, even in rural areas, and affordability even for the poor (ASFG, not dated). Today 75% of Africans own a mobile phone, making it increasingly easier to reach those located in remote rural areas with timely weather forecasts (UNDP, 2014). The Ghana Ministry of Agriculture Extension Service Portal or the crowd-sourcing model, of ‘WeFarm’, communicates a variety of information with farmers exclusively by SMS. For Sustainable Intensification to succeed, smallholders need to build up their understanding of farming systems and capacity to innovate within their own particular ecosystems. The use of videos in West African countries such as Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, Gambia and Guinea has been successful in raising awareness about potentially beneficial technologies and practices among farmers (Bentley et al, 2014). However, agricultural knowledge is very contextual and requires a deep understanding of the entire farming system. Therefore, it can be difficult to communicate or assimilate advice for widespread use. Most producers live in a world of imperfect information, and are subject to considerable uncertainty with regard to weather conditions, pest attacks, and market options. Some of these uncertainties could be mitigated by better access to information and communication technologies (ICT). The media such as television and radio programs can present a meaningful and beneficial access to agribusiness education information. Better, reliable and timely information will help farmers become more responsive to price signals and help to expand the reach and impact of extension and advisory services. The means of communication include radio, television, telephone, telex, fax etc. communication is essential for agricultural development. They are needed to pass useful information about agriculture and other related matters to farmers. Our communication system in Zambia is still very poor. Television and telephone services are not available in some of the villages and where available most farmers cannot afford them. Most farmers in Zambia can neither read nor write. Most of the farmers in Zambia are not educated enough in the technicalities relating to agricultural production and marketing. Many people do not know of new developments in agriculture. It is only when a person knows of the existence of something that he can think of its use. If a farmer knows of the existence of fertiliser and does not know how to use it, he is not much better than those who do not know about it. Extension services mean the process and means through which farmers receive information in modern farming from the relevant government agencies. This is necessary to keep the farmers informed of the latest development in the field of agriculture. The extension services delivery system in Zambia is very poor. The numbers of extension workers in Zambia are very few compared to the number of farmers. The few available ones have no mobility to visit the farmers. Many of them are not prepared to live in rural areas where farmers reside. Those that are ready to stay in the rural areas are not adequately remunerated. All these factors combine to bring about poor extension activities in Zambia. Government should establish a well organised and functional agricultural extension service to carry the result of agricultural researches to our farmers. A functional extension service will ensure that farmers are organised and occasionally films and slides on different aspects of modernised agriculture are shown to them. Through extension services farmers are taught to adopt better cultural practices and minimise loss of soil fertility through erosion and leaching. We have already discussed the importance of communication on the development of agriculture. Efficient communication systems will combine with extension service in the dissemination of modern agricultural information to farmers. In this regard government can establish radio stations and television stations. In addition substantial time should be allocated to agricultural programmes. Newspapers and magazines should be established by the ministries of agriculture and Agricultural Development Projects, a thing that is rare in the modern Zambian agricultural face. All these measures will ensure efficient dissemination of agricultural information to the grassroots. Challenges to successful delivery of agribusiness education Poor training of agricultural extension staff has been identified as part of the problem of the relative ineffectiveness of much of extension in the field. This applies not only to extension staff, but to agricultural professionals in general. Unfortunately, the training of human resources in agriculture is often not a high priority in the development plans of our country. As a result, curricula and teaching programmes are not particularly relevant to the production needs and employment demands of the agricultural sector. Where policies have been formulated, no adequate financial support has accompanied policy formulation and worse off policy implementation. The situation has become more serious in recent years due to the economic crises in the public sector in many developing countries. In the past, the public sector absorbed nearly all agriculture graduates. This is no longer the case, and agriculture graduates are finding it increasingly difficult to find employment. Governments can no longer afford to hire every graduate. Over and above, education in agriculture has not kept up with the increasingly sophisticated labour demands of the private sector. Qualified and competent teachers and educators are a rare commodity. Methodology The methodology employed in this paper is review of existing related literature. Research findings The paper brought out the following key findings: The media has a role of disseminating agribusiness education to the end-users of the generated knowledge. The media link the agricultural education centres, the research centres and the farmers to ensure that there is a functional interaction, delivering the needs of farmers to the information centres and delivering the generated knowledge, skills and technology to the farmers. The media in Zambia is not doing enough with regard to the dissemination of agribusiness information. The quality of agribusiness advocacy is very poor. There are very few and generally poorly funded and organised agribusiness programs in the media. The media seems to be preoccupied with political information at the expense of agriculture related information. Agribusiness education and extension training have a role of producing and enhancing skilled craftsmen and operators, the livestock manager, the farmer able to manage his crops, stock and accounts. The development of the various industries within the agricultural value chain can be enhanced by successfully coordinated and communicated extension service. The media has a hand in fostering the dissemination of such important information. Agribusiness education, through the media, plays a major role in equipping the farming communities with information, skills and competencies needed for successful agro-productivity and marketing, in the face of environmentally friendly and non-degrading practices, which enhance food security and sustainable rural development. Agribusiness education is not successfully delivered by the media because of lack of   financial and technical support to various media houses to foster quality and timely dissemination of agribusiness education to the farmers. education system has great potential to inform the farming populace and information centres, to uplift living standards of the rural masses, foster agro-processing, storage and marketing, which enhance sustainable rural development and drastically reduced socio-economic marginalisation among the rural people. Conclusions The media is a key element in the dissemination of agribusiness education information which can substantially enhance agro-productivity and value addition. It is through well supported and coordinated agricultural media programs that agribusiness education can be successfully delivered to the farmers who put the conceptual knowledge into practice for the realisation of great returns. As things stand in Zambia, the media is not an essential tool in the enhancement of agribusiness advocacy because of lack of funding for agribusiness programming. The technical aspects of agribusiness development can only be achieved through access to valid information and knowledge, a role supposedly played by the media. Recommendations The government and other key stakeholders in the media industry should begin to attach great importance to the role of the media in delivering agribusiness education by funding and creating meaningful airspace for agribusiness programs. There is need to invest in ICTs because they can play a significant role in delivering agribusiness education. Donor support in this sector might yield great benefits, provided that a proper framework for an integrated learning system has been put in place. Zambia should focus on the delivering of agribusiness education to the farmers. The use of the media in meeting this goal is one of the cheapest means and wide-reaching as many people can be reached at the same time. Communication between agricultural centres, extension personnel and the farmers through the media can provide a base for exchange of ideas and should be encouraged. Development of agribusiness media programmes from training institutions, research centres and the extension offices could be strengthened by the creation of networks where schools, local NGOs and community-based organisations are involved as participants.

8,Effective Tips to Secure Your Home from Intruders,business," Moving into a new place can sure be an exciting process. However, installing safety measures to safeguard it can seem like an overwhelming task. But at the end of the day, you have to admit that the installation of home security devices is crucial to your safety. Cases of burglary continue to rise and dip in Toronto. So you need to always be on an alert. It's best to contact a trusted locksmith in Toronto as soon as you decide to boost your home's security infrastructure. Given below are some of the most effective measures that every new homeowner should take. Door and Window Security Locking your windows and doors is hands down the easiest ways to safeguard your house against thieves and vandals. Remember that burglars are always searching for easy targets. You forgetting to unlock a window or door may just provide them what they wish. It's a great practice to keep your doors and windows locked, both when you're inside and outside your home. You can also consider door and window sensors. These smart sensors can detect if a window or door has been left open. There are also smart locks that you can schedule to lock your premises at specific times automatically. Invest in High-Quality Door Locks Just locking your premises is not enough today. You also need to ensure that the locks on your door are not average ones. They should be high-quality locks having a deadbolt. Such locks make it incredibly challenging for intruders or burglars to break in. Apart from that, take a close look at your door frames and hinges. Are they old? Strong frames and hinges can easily endure a break-in. But doors that are old and creaking only become a security risk. It's always a wise idea to look for smart locks. You don't need to operate them manually. Everything happens according to how you want it remotely. Have Your Packages Delivered to a Locker As the festive season arrives, you might be busy visiting your friends and family members and purchasing gifts for them. Many people tend to purchase gifts online. In that case, deliver your parcels to a locker. It's a great step to ward off thieves from your places. Apart from purchases, you shouldn't also forget to give your friends and family the address of the locker who will get your parcels. It will allow them to ship the gifts they want to gift to you there. Package lockers also provide homeowners with safe storage space. Alternatively, you can also request your post office to keep the mail addressed to you on hold so that they don't fall into the hands of unknown people. Invest in a Home Security System One of the most efficacious methods to keep criminals from breaking in is installing a home security system. Through it, you can get alerted whenever there's been any instance of a break-in. It has been shown that a premise that doesn't have a security system is thrice more likely to experience break-ins. If a burglar happens to see any sign of a security system at your house, they'll likely won't make it their target. Security cameras designed for home use add a new layer of protection to your premises. You can get alerted of any movement on areas like your yard through them. Window and door sensors will signal you if a person is trying to enter your premises. There's no need to think that you can only install these kinds of systems at an exorbitant price. Today, there are numerous options for you to explore. Many of them are affordable and can easily fit into a standard budget. Use Smart Lighting Thieves and intruders like to work in the dark so that they can do their job conveniently. But outdoor lights prevent them from doing precisely that. These lights prevent them from moving towards a specific area. You might be one of those who leave lights in their home open when going on any trip or occasion. But the problem with it is that intruders are highly skilled in detecting if a house is empty in reality or not. It's why smart lighting is so beneficial. They have sensors in them that make the light illuminate the moment any movement is detected. They thus catch the thief off-guard and scare them off. You can also adjust the brightness based on the time of the day via a timer. Apart from smart lights, you can also invest in outdoor security cameras. It's an extra step in the direction of making your home fully safe. Final Words No homeowner desires to fall prey to a home invasion. Keep the tips given in this post in mind to keep your house and your loved ones well-protected and safe. You can start small and build on your knowledge of the various security products and their functionalities. It will help you make an informed decision regarding the kind of security system your house needs."
9,About Choosing The Best Bed Linen For Your Home,business," Few things in life are as lovely as getting up in the morning after a good night’s rest. Sleeping properly can be traced back to different factors, one of which is undoubtedly the atmosphere in the bedroom, which includes the type of bedlinen. If you use the wrong bed sheets, pillowcases and covers, you may be irritable as you may feel you are cold, or, on the other hand, too hot and sweaty – as a result of having chosen the wrong linen. Individuals and families that use bed linen made from natural fabric such as linen made from flax, often report a feeling of luxury, also because the fabric seems to offer features such as breathability which may help to keep one’s body cool in warm weather and warm in cool conditions. On top of that bed linen and other items made from flax linen are easy to wash and clean. Because of its natural, almost informal look, the linen fabric has ensured that a certain style has been created around its appearance. For many, it is specifically about this look – in addition to great qualities such as that it outlasts many other fabrics. It is thicker than many and will, therefore, offer additional strength and remain good for use for many years – after numerous washes. After some time it may lose its initial crispness, but that happens only later on – after having washed the items many, many times. Linen in the home environment is seen in many homes today, notably the bedrooms. Some people buy linen by the meter and make their curtains or bed linen, but most would try and find a good retailer to buy from. There are many choices. In terms of sheets, you may decide on one type only, such as the flat sheet, or you may want to add fitted sheets to that. You may decide on a plain, standard choice, or one with extra detail such as, say, ruffles, added to your flat sheet. You may do the same with the pillowcases – either plain or with ruffles, bows and other additions to help you individualize your preferences. There are many options, especially if you come across a good designer and manufacturer to buy from. You want to know you approach a retailer that offers quality, many choices and a good reputation as a trusted service. Because linen is considered for its special qualities and features, it makes sense for many to deal with a recommended service – often an exclusive company that listens to the requirements of their customers. Therefore they will, as opposed to a factory where thousands of pieces are manufactured, be more agreeable to produce items made to order, in a style that the customer likes, in a specific size that is not standard, and in the colour that is requested. This is true, too, for other bed linen items. Think beyond sheets and pillow slips. Think of linen duvet covers, with or without ruffles, borders and other features, bedspreads quilted or not, a choice of bed skirts. Also, because there are many more followers of pure linen fabrics now than in the past, there are more options, in different sizes whether you are looking for sheets for a single bed, a double or queen size for that matter. The list goes on. What sets linen apart from other fabrics, is a combination of aesthetic appeal and practical use. It is easy to clean and cover your beds without having to take out the iron, it looks beautiful and cannot be mistaken for another fabric. Linen is not new, but only in recent times has it started to make headlines in many more countries than a few decades ago. It is now found in homes all over the world.

11,What Makes Successful Mergers And Acquisitions?,business," Over the years, we have all seen so many mergers and acquisitions fail to yield the expected result in terms of profit longevity and overall success. Also, we have seen so many others end up successful and resulting in the birthing of a successful organization. The success or failure of a merger depends on some factors, and in this article, I will be sharing five simple tips for successful mergers and acquisitions. No matter how much you try to understudy a company you want to acquire, no matter how much information the transition team hands over to you during the closing of the deal, there’ll always be a time when you’ll need to reach out to the former principal for a company to make inquiries. Sometimes, these inquiries may be necessary to make critical decisions that affect the company. At this point, if the former principal feels shortchanged or they’re not satisfied with the transaction, they will not be responsive to your needs and questions. To avoid this kind of hitch that can negatively affect the acquisition or partnership, it is necessary to ensure fairness for all parties involved in the deal. A good reputation is a currency that you shouldn’t hesitate to cash out on whenever you want to close a new deal. When you have a new acquiree with whom you’re looking to close a deal, set up a meeting with them and one or more of your previous merged groups. Your new acquiree will feel more confident to hear what the other people you’ve dealt with have to say about you than what you have to say about yourself. Those people’s opinion holds a stronger influence on new prospects and could be the gateway to closing a deal faster and easier. This is another reason why you must ensure honesty and fairness in your deal so that your previous acquirees will have positive reviews to give about you. One mistake that has negatively affected many mergers and acquisitions is sacking old staff and management teams and replacing them with new ones. Most times, this approach is always counterproductive and throws the merger towards a downward spiral that takes a long time to recover. To avoid this, make sure that the interactions between your team and that of the acquiree don’t swing in the “us. Vs. Them” direction. Instead, use inclusive language like “our” and “we.” Say things like “our clients,” or “we are all together.” Assure the existing staff of the company that their jobs are safe, the organizational structure remains the same, and that you’d like to see them give in their 100% dedication to service as always. One of the key secrets of earning trust and being able to close a deal effectively is to have an insider who supports your vision for the company. As an outsider, it may take you too much time to convince the principals to agree to the merger or acquisition. They may take an exhausting amount of time doing their due diligence, and this may slow down the transaction. Having a trusted insider, on the other hand, makes the path smooth and easy for you. By recommending this point, I do not in any way intend to promote manipulation of deals and dishonest lobbying. Instead, acquirers should build trust and relationships with some staff and managers of a prospective company before they approach them with a deal. If you have proven your reputation and integrity to these people, they won’t mind chipping in a word for you that’ll help you close the deal faster. It is true that most of us have a winner mentality and we would always want to close every deal we started, but it is important to know when to walk away. A deal doesn’t necessarily need to be bad before you walk away from it. In fact, sometimes, you need to walk away from a good deal. If you realize that you can’t really bring any value to a company you’re trying to acquire, there is nothing wrong with walking away because you wouldn’t want the business to end up being worse than its current state. You can also walk away from a deal if you realize that the organization doesn’t fit into your business principles or that your ethics, principles, and corporate culture don’t align with what’s obtainable in the company. Final Thoughts The success of mergers depends a lot on the level of cooperation between the partners. The partners need to keep this relationship flourishing forever if they want to achieve success in their business. For mergers, on the other hand, it is necessary to have a great relationship with the former principal, especially during the transition process. It is also essential to close the deal in a favorable state that leaves all parties satisfied. This is because you may need to refer back to your acquiree when you run into some challenges that would require their wealth of experience with the business.

12,A Patent Is a Set of Exclusive Rights,business," I'm sure you've heard of the terms ""intellectual property"" and ""patent law"" but do you really know what they mean? In this blog post, I'll be giving a brief overview of intellectual property and patent law as well as some common misconceptions about patents. The first word that comes to mind when someone mentions intellectual property is probably copyright. Copyright protects original works such as books, music, movies, etc., from being copied or distributed without permission from the author. A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a government to an inventor or their assignee for a limited period of time in order to allow them to commercially exploit their invention. Inventions can be protected through patents in most countries around the world. While there are some requirements and formalities that need to be complied with in order to apply for and obtain a patent, it is generally a straightforward process. The protection afforded by patents is also very strong and can be lucrative for businesses that make use of them. There are several types of patents available, which are split into two main categories: utility patents and design patents. Within these categories, there are different types of patent applications that can be filed depending on the invention in question. UTILITY PATENT Utility patents last for 20 years and give inventors the right to stop others from using their inventions without permission. The first thing you should know about utility patents is that it does not matter who came up with the idea, as long as it was created within the past year. If someone else has already done this invention before you can still get a patent on your own version or design modification of theirs. A good example would be when Apple patented their iPhone design in 2009 after Steve Jobs introduced it at Macworld in 2007. Utility patents are different from design patents because they protect functional aspects rather than aesthetic features. Utility patents grant inventors exclusive rights over their inventions for two decades and provide a wide range of legal protections including injunctive relief against infringement by others. In contrast with many other types of intellectual property protection such as trademarks and copyrights which last only as long as you continue using them actively DESIGN PATENT Utility patents are a form of intellectual property that protects the invention or design of something. It's an exclusive right granted for 20 years to the person who invents, discovers, or creates it. They're used for inventions in areas such as business methods, machines or devices, and chemical compositions. The patent holder can exclude others from making use of his patented invention by selling it himself or licensing someone else to do so on its behalf. But if he wants to stop others from using his invention without permission. The process of getting a design patent can be complex, so it is important to work with an experienced lawyer. An attorney can help you understand the requirements and make sure you file your application correctly. A design patent can provide peace of mind that your invention is protected and give you a competitive edge in the marketplace. CONCLUSION Conclusion paragraph: If you have an idea that could be commercialized into a product, then it's important to start thinking about intellectual property and patent law. The most common misconception is that your invention is protected if you keep it a secret from the world. In reality, patents are only granted for new inventions when they're shared with the public in order to stimulate innovation and progress of society as a whole."
13,Mistakes Remote Leaders Must Avoid,business," As a leader of a team that is newly remote as a result of the pandemic, there are a few key things I've learned that have helped our company, Wildebeest, thrive. I've also found many remote leaders keep making the same mistakes like assuming their teams aren't looking for employment elsewhere, hiring too many junior employees, and not putting enough emphasis on documentation. Let me explain: Assuming your team isn’t looking elsewhere – prioritizing quality-of-life is on an astronomical trajectory for everyone working from home. Remote leaders should keep in mind that everyone is either looking for an upgrade or being prospected by recruiters or the competition. While employer empathy is on the rise, so are employee migrations to greener pastures. Be sure to show gratitude, but also have a plan for when any seat might open up. Going too junior – working remotely requires focus, experience, and the proper guidance. If your in-person team was bottom-heavy like ours was, going remote where guardrails are farther apart could prove devastating. We found when going remote that was critical to flip our seniority model upside-down and focus on the hiring of senior-level contributors who required less guidance to succeed. Not going ham on documentation – when you’re in an office, you overhear conversations, you have lunch with a colleague, and a shout over the cube wall may have filled in some of the gaps. We found when going remote, that an excess of process documentation was critical for our team to be able to repeat the steps necessary to deliver projects at the same high level we grew accustomed to. Not factoring in cost of living – as the great resignation and Millennial migration spread talent across the country, employers are scrambling to pick up reduced salaries for remote workers in low-cost living situations. While this may work in 2021, the future may not be so kind to employers paying the same role differently in Los Angeles and Topeka. Instead, remote workers will likely begin to be paid based on ability, experience, and access, regardless rather than geography. Fear-based leadership has been naturally working itself out of corporate America for decades. The stragglers still bullying their way through presentations and deadlines may be pushed to extinction in the new remote era. The new virtual workforce knows its value and has no tolerance for leaders who don’t evolve. Some leaders clear the way for their teams and lead by example while others get deep in the weeds, immersing in the day-to-day. Pushing your team from behind rather than leading from ahead may work for small teams starting out, but as your remote business matures, effective remote leaders are visionaries."

15,Should You Choose Cloud Or An In House Server?,business," When a business decides they need a server, there are some important factors to take into consideration from whether you choose a cloud or an in house server, also known as a dedicated server. If you are thinking of an in house server, do you use a hire service or purchase it outright? Before making any decisions, you need to gather all the facts. You want to know the pros and cons of the cloud and house server and how each can benefit your business. Traditionally small and medium-sized companies have chosen dedicated servers rather than the cloud for their file sharing and hosting their applications. The cloud has now become a more affordable and viable option, though there are still numerous companies that prefer an in house server that they have complete control over. Bear in mind that if you are thinking of using an in house server or your current server needs an upgrade, they do require a large initial investment for the hardware and software. In the house, servers can be customized based on your business needs. Remember you will need an IT manager to maintain the server and ensure it continues to run at optimum. The benefits of an in house server includes having physical control of your backups and being able to keep your data and valuable information in the house without the risk of any third party access. You also don’t have to have a reliable internet connection to access the data or files you need. Further, an in house server can be more cost-effective for some businesses with rental options available, enabling you to spread the cost over an agreed period. The downsides associated with in house servers include the initial capital outlay you will need for hardware and software, along with the cost of having a dedicated IT support team to ensure the server continues running properly. In the event of a disaster, the risk of losing data is high, as the data is stored on-site and not in a separate location. Server hire is very popular with companies that need a server and want to spread Th costs or require server space for a short period, such as when their systems are being upgraded or changed and they want to ensure they don't le any valuable information in the process. Cloud servers have grown exponentially in recent years, offering many great advantages when compared to in house servers, but then again, they also have their downsides. Cloud serves have become great assets these days as more employees work remotely. Cloud servers are scalable and provide flexibility in meeting business demands with ease. There is a monthly fee payable, which can easily be incorporated into your operational budget without the cost of security for your data and information. The pros associated with cloud servers include the fact that there are no capital expenses and no hardware on-site. As your business grows, you increase your storage space. Storage can be added easily as you need it with providers only charging the amount of storage you need. Cloud servers offer easy and efficient backup and restoration from anywhere and can be used on tablets, smartphones and computers. The risk of data loss due to disaster is eliminated, as your data is regularly backed up to the cloud in fifteen-minute intervals or shorter periods depending on your preferences. The cloud does limit how much you can store, usually dependent on availability and cost. You do not have access to the data you need if there is an internet issue. There are times when the provider may go down, making access difficult.

16,Understanding The Importance Of EBITDA When Selling A Business,business," Ever heard of EBITDA? You’re not alone. I've found that most entrepreneurs and small business owners haven’t. But that word you’ve never heard of represents a vital concept when it comes to selling your business. If you want top dollar for your company, you must understand your EBITDA, why buyers care about it, and how you can maximize it. Because I promise you, buyers are going to review your EBITDA as they value your business and make an offer. The Value Of EBITDA Before we go any further, let’s define EBITDA. EBITDA, which is a line on your company’s financial statement, is an acronym for ""earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization."" Buyers focus on it because it can show a more accurate measure of a business's financial health and overall value than cash profits alone. Think about it: Multiple businesses in any given industry could have very different cash profits, and those profits don’t always reflect how a business is doing. One business might be actively growing and investing in the future — opening new offices, buying new vehicles, adding new capabilities. These investments drive a high growth rate, but at the same time, they skew the cash profit down significantly. Most of those investments would impact cash profit, but not EBITDA because they are below that point on the financial statement. A different business in the same sector, on the other hand, might not be making these investments. In that case, their cash profit will be higher, but that’s because they aren’t actively investing in their growth. That’s not always very appealing to a buyer. Whoever buys the business may have significant deferred maintenance expenses down the road because the company hasn’t made necessary repairs to facilities or equipment. If buyers valued a business solely on cash profit, the business that was actively investing in growth would have a lower valuation than the one that was not investing at all. However, by focusing on EBITDA, buyers can get some insight into another accurate and normalized indicator of what the business is worth on a comparable basis. The Three Types Of EBITDA There are three types of EBITDA: normal (or definitional) EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and Pro-forma EBITDA. As a seller, you should understand each type so you know how to maximize your business’ value to the universe of buyers. Normal EBITDA is relatively straightforward. It simply considers the numbers as they’re reported without making any adjustments to those numbers. Adjusted EBITDA, on the other hand, adjusts for expenses that were incurred that won’t occur again or are stated in the wrong period. For example, let’s say you implemented a software program to automate processes that used to be done manually. As a result of this automation, you laid off some employees, but you also gave each of them a year’s salary as severance. That severance is a huge expense, and it lowers your EBITDA for the given period. However, you can raise your EBITDA to a normalized level by adding back those one-time severance expenses to your earnings. Pro-forma EBITDA is another way to adjust EBITDA, but it’s unique in that it adjusts for things that will happen in the future. For example, perhaps you own a service company, and halfway through the year, you sign a large contract. While you only receive revenue from that project for six months this year, next year, you anticipate a full 12 months of revenue from it. You can adjust your EBITDA up accordingly and get buyer consideration for it as a result. What Buyers Are Looking For Generally speaking, in a healthy, growing business, adjusted EBITDA is higher than regular EBITDA, and Pro-forma EBITDA is higher than both. When selling your business, aim to achieve a valuation based on the highest EBITDA possible. However, it can be complicated to capture every adjustment. Because every situation is unique, it may be a good idea to work with an accounting firm to determine your EBITDA. While EBITDA is important to valuation when selling, it isn't the only metric people will use. As a buyer of more than 50 companies over the past 20 years, I can attest that EBITDA is one of many considerations. Buyers also look at revenue streams, customer concentration, how businesses are likely to perform during recessions and pandemics, etc. Certain sectors are impacted differently by economic cycles. Financial metrics aside, the universe of buyers also looks at leadership, culture, growth rates of the industry in which you operate, and more. Suffice it to say that there are a multitude of factors that drive overall valuation, but EBITDA is as important as all the others — so it's important to be tuned in to what it is, how it works and, like the other factors, present it in the best light. By understanding EBITDA and working to maximize it before you sell your business, you show the universe of buyers that you are a sophisticated seller who understands the true value of your business. That is how you get the highest valuation and, ultimately, the largest sale price. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

17,When Do You Need To Start Treating Your Side Gig Like A Real Business?,business," Even before the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many people used their free time to engage in their passions. Whether knitting scarves and selling them on Etsy or doing home repair work for neighbors, side gigs are becoming more common for people with standard, 9-to-5 day jobs. Due - Due Side hustles are great options for many people for a few reasons — they serve as an extra source of income, help you make ends meet, or build savings for retirement. The money you bring in from a side gig can be used for various purposes, depending on your financial situation and future goals. Aside from financial gains, side hustles allow you to do what you enjoy and are passionate about, something your day job might lack. It’s common for professionals in the corporate world to switch paths and take on a new business endeavor that’s more tailored to their passions. Why Are Side Hustles Booming Right Now? The pandemic has prompted many professionals to reflect on their careers. Some decided to leave their jobs entirely and fully invest time and money into their side hustle. This contributes to what’s being coined as “The Great Resignation.” It’s a period where an unprecedented amount of the American workforce is resigning for many reasons. According to U.S. Census data, U.S. Business formations rose by 47% in 2020. This highlights the slew of professionals taking advantage of the opportunity to create companies. However, it can be challenging to know if your side hustle is capable of scaling. You’re likely flooded with questions: Will this work? When do I quit my day job? Is this realistic for my financial situation? Signs Your Side Hustle Could Be a Viable Business Here are some telltale signs that your side hustle is ready to be taken to the next level: •  You’ve identified a need in the marketplace, and you can meet customer demands •  Your side hustle has taken on a life of its own •  You are already profiting from your side hustle •  You need a change from your day-to-day routine •  You’re an authoritative force in your industry •  You’ve built a reputation among your competitors Of course, you could spend hours contemplating every small detail when deciding if your side hustle could be transformed into a real business. It’s also worth noting that how you speak about your gig can impact your perception of if it will be successful or not. For example, if you continue to call it a side gig, that’s what it will be. If you truly believe in the products or services you offer, you should consider calling it what it is: a business. Dreams only work if you do. Here are some signs that your side project may not be viable as a business: •  It cuts time into your day job without being profitable •  You create emotional reasons to justify why you have this side hustle •  You lack consistency when working on your side gig •  You’re not ready to put yourself out there •  You’re not meeting an existing customer demand The decision ultimately comes down to you and your financial situation. It’s best to have six to 12 months of saved income before you decide to take your side hustle to the next level. It may take that amount of time to earn profits from your business, and the last thing you want is to drain your savings. Financial security should always be a top priority for anyone entering the entrepreneurial landscape. Entrepreneurs need to be wise in their saving strategies to stay afloat if they experience any emergencies. How to Transform a Side Gig Into a Business If you’ve decided to elevate your side hustle, you must take steps to ensure you set your business up for success. This way, your company is more likely to survive and thrive in a competitive market. Without putting your business ideas onto paper, it’ll be challenging to know if this is something worth fighting for. If you do not already have a drafted business plan, make sure you write down all the details you’ll need to know in advance. For example, you should start with your mission statement and the overall goal you want to achieve. It should be followed by an executive summary, company description, organizational structure, and a breakdown of finances. Planning is crucial when launching your business, so taking extra time out of your day to draft a thorough business plan will give you the best start. Market research will play a significant role in determining your target market and help you operate your business as it scales. It also enables you to determine how viable your business plan is. Suppose your side hustle is selling handmade jewelry to local friends or family members. While this is certainly a good side gig, you may not be tuned into customer needs. Your ultimate goal in market research is to see what your customers do or do not like about your products or services. This will minimize the risks associated with launching a new business. It’s critical to take the right steps to separate your business and personal finances. Your side hustle may have given you some disposable income, maybe through a payment app like Venmo, CashApp or Zelle. This won’t be sustainable if you’re ready to take your side gig to the next level. Choose how you want to incorporate your business and whether you want to establish a sole proprietorship, limited liability company (LLC), or partnership. Incorporation may seem daunting, but it’s quite easy as long as you have a couple of hundred dollars to cover fees. You’ll also need to register your business with the state and receive an employer identification number (EIN). Business insurance is a necessity. It would offer protection if your company were to experience an emergency, such as fires, floods, or property damage. While the state you’re in will determine what type of coverage you need, it’s worth investigating and investing in. There are many benefits to having small business insurance: •  It attracts new clients to your business •  It enables you to find and keep new employees •  It protects your business from lawsuits and claims •  It keeps your company profitable year-over-year •  It helps you conform to legal requirements5. Invest in Marketing and Advertising Every business needs to have a hand in the marketing and advertising landscape. Without these crucial components, how would you attract potential customers? You need to have a viable strategy and choose an appropriate advertising approach when launching your business. Consider placing ads in your local newspaper or online news source. As your business scales, you may want to think about hiring dedicated advertising or marketing professionals to help you with this part of your business. There are plenty of ways you can use marketing to your advantage, so be sure to prioritize this as you get ready to launch. Now that you’ve taken some crucial steps in forming your business, it’s time to think about when your day job is no longer needed. It may be a couple of months before you can quit, and much of it will come down to how profitable your new operation is. Remember that earning enough profit to quit may take longer than you expect. Some say to ballpark how much you’ll need to make before you leave and then triple that number because it’s better to be safe and financially stable before you resign. This decision will boil down to your specific circumstances, and if you need to consult a financial adviser, then be sure to do so. Your future self will thank you for taking into account your long-term financial stability. As you prepare to bring your side gig to the forefront, you’ll need to remember these steps. Launching a business should be a fun, enjoyable experience, but it will come with obstacles you’ll need to overcome. Many entrepreneurs will use new technologies to streamline their operations, so be willing to adopt new tech to make starting your new company a breeze. Own Your Side Hustle and Call It What It Is: A Business business plan Dubai, feasibility study Dubai Side hustles are becoming more common in today’s economy. They come with pros and cons, and it’s critical to remember that not everyone will work as an established business. However, many new companies can be viable if you follow the right steps before launching. Becoming an entrepreneur is not for everyone, but if you have enough drive, determination, and passion for the products or services you provide, you can make it happen. Start calling your side gig a business and take the required steps to set yourself up for success. If you follow your heart and keep a cool head, you’ll be ready to start earning a profit doing something you love.

Perfectly. Many have successfully brought in revenue from all of the income sources I named above, and continue to bring in ongoing passive revenue every single day, whether they work or not. That isn’t to state that you’ll ever earn anything at all without first placing work into whatever business example you select to go after. Most net businesses are either free or really cheap to begin, but they’ll demand that you to invest your time and energy. However soon the powerful revenue streams will take over and start working for you, rather than you working for it. Active Income is Not Always The Best- Consider it – Do you wish to work forty plus hours a week for the remainder of your working life? Chances are you’ve exhausted most of your working life working for the improper sort of revenue. Active Income is the sort of income most individuals are working for, unless they were born into riches or acquired the lottery. This is the revenue you gain as tips and salaries from your occupation. It might be in the form of merchandise sales on eBay or supplying a service as a dog walker or becoming engaged in a more traditional career. It’s probably your salary or your hourly pay in the form of a payroll check. If you’ve any doubts as to whether revenue is active, simply ask yourself: If I do not do the work, will I get compensated? If the answer is nope, it’s active revenue. Passive revenue is gained from a source that calls for no work to return the payment. This sort of income has historically come from investitures in dividend paying stocks, interest in savings or bonds, or renting real property. The key is that it takes no work to return the revenue – once revenue is being returned. It still takes much effort to get the ball rolling. Both sorts of revenue call for hard work, and both sorts are crucial for many of us. The difference is that when the work is complete for the passive revenue, one need not do the work over again to get the revenue. That’s why discovering a passive income ought to be a goal, and your active revenue ought to be the means by which you accomplish that goal. Consider it as the gas to power your travel to a passive life-style. Anybody may attain passive revenue; the question is how soon do you require it? Commonly the huge pays back come from the hardest work and the greatest risk of failure. Consider the starving artist or musician before he becomes big. He sacrifices a great deal early on, but may frequently retire ahead of time. If you don’t wish to, or can’t, assume the risk then you are able to take the time-tested retirement savings path. Pension accounts like 401(k)’s and IRA’s are all about constructing an investment portfolio that will one day supply adequate passive income to replace your payroll check totally. That’s retirement, and it takes a lifespan of active income to accomplish it. “Secrets Behind Passive Income Opportunities” The sooner you are able to cultivate a successful passive revenue stream, the better off you’ll be. To this end, you ought to be utilizing as much of your active revenue as you are able to produce these passive revenue streams. If you’re in debt or wish to accelerate your path towards passive income, think about taking a 2nd job and utilizing that income to pay down your debt, or develop your revenue streams faster. The data age has opened additional avenues to the ordinary individual that were previously available to only a choice few. Royalties are a great illustration of this. Before the net, you had to work exceedingly hard on a book or record or some like product, and then you had to be fortunate enough to discover a publisher or distributor. Then you had to wait for merchandising to accomplish its thing and hope it was successful enough to yield substantial revenue for you after paying all the in-between men. The net has opened the royalties‟ piece of the passive revenue pie like never before. E-books only call for personal publishing software, a PC and a blog. Inject some marketing or affiliate plans and you are able to yield some hefty revenue. Investing is a different great example. There’s a mountain of gratis info on the net about investing, and discount brokers make it possible for the normal individual to establish a portfolio of dividend paying stocks and bonds without ever departing their house. If you’re a techy who’s got a little programming skill and a theme for a killer app, then software packages may easily become a passive revenue stream. Once you’ve acquired the product, it costs roughly nothing to assemble a PayPal system and a download link. Passive revenue doesn’t have to be from the stuffy old school of investitures, or the industrious fresh technology. A few sources of passive revenue are strikingly bland and un-stimulating. ATM‟s and vending machines may fit this category. While they do call for a little upkeep, it’s not as much work for the revenue as your standard forty hour job. Ultimately, you’re looking at 2 primary methods to passive revenue: An entrepreneurial attack, or an investment attack. Which one is correct for you depends upon your interest, desire and disposition. The crucial thing is to begin thinking of being more passive in your revenue, and more active in your life history. Anyone Can Achieve Financial Freedom- Financial freedom is living where there’s adequate revenue coming in to pay for your wanted life-style, all without being forced to work. When you’ve adequate passive revenue to cover your cost of living, you’re totally financially free. How much passive revenue would it call for to set you free? How much revenue would you ultimately love having monthly to spend? Goals provide power to our actions, and recognizing your goal for automatic revenue will provide you the power to produce the life you wish. There are countless possibilities when it comes to acquiring passive revenue, but they all fall under one of two categories, Business and Investing revenue. Which is better for you? Well, it depends upon a list of things including your skills, experiences, powers, your unparalleled interests, as well as your beginning capital. Investing may call for much upfront capital before hearty profits may be made, which makes the business path more approachable to a wider range of individuals. When you choose to tackle one of the primary areas of passive revenue, you have to choose individual revenue vehicles. Again, you’ll wish to evaluate yourself and pick the revenue opportunities that are better suited for your goals and potentialities, as well as your interests and loves. Take time to look into possible opportunities before leaping in headlong. Depending upon the techniques that you pick out to acquire passive revenue, you might or might not need to invest revenue. All the same, in either case you ought to plan on spending time to master the revenue streams that you’ve picked out. If you’re going to establish a free passive revenue business from scratch, you’ll plainly have to invest a lot of time establishing and growing your business revenue. And if you select to invest for automatic revenue, you’ll wish to take time to invest in your knowledge and use of proven investment rules.

It requires time, frequently many months or even years before true earnings will be seen on a steady basis. Take your financial goals earnestly, and make a habit of working towards them. People who commit to spending time daily to formulate passive revenue produce a lifespan of limitless wealth. Controlling a single income vehicle may provide you everything you require for freedom, but as you might discover for yourself, constructing wealth may be a fun and energizing journey, and you might discover yourself reassessing your goals and adjusting them even higher. The excellent thing about automatic revenue is that it runs in its own, so you’ll be able to produce multiple revenue streams without having to exhaust all of your time. Branch out into a number of income streams and produce a powerful, long term income. Over the past couple of years I’ve utilized a lot of avenues to formulate passive revenue, but now I look nearly solely to the net for fresh and energizing ways to make revenue on automatic pilot. I hope you’ve enjoyed this look at building wealth. You are able to successfully formulate passive revenue; it just calls for a little hard work, patience, and care. And while I’ll be the first one to tell you that much work might be demanded, particularly if you don’t already have a lot of revenue to invest and therefore have to invest your time and energy. But I’ll likewise be the first to tell you simply how energizing and rewarding it may be to start producing multiple streams of revenue that earn you income day-and-night. Start now to plant seeds of automatic revenue and watch as your financial freedom starts to fly. To your great success on your financial freedom journey, Bob Edwards @ Digital Business Lessons"

1,Affiliate Marketing – How To Get Started In 6 Easy Steps,business," Affiliate marketing is probably the simplest business model you can choose to build a business. Of course the devil is in the details, as they say, but the overall model can really be broken down into six steps. Before we get to the steps, I want you to ask yourself a question. What do you hope to accomplish with affiliate marketing? This is an easier question to answer than it might seem. There are really only two basic choices here. The first is what I call the quick buck choice. In other words, you want to make a few dollars quickly, and you are not interested in building a business. If this is you, all you need to do is learn how to write exceptionally good ads, and then use them to promote your affiliate product. Many people will say I am wrong, but there is nothing wrong with doing this, as long as you are honestly not trying to build a long term business this way. On the other hand, if you are looking to build a business with income potential for the long term, then you will have a longer road ahead of you. It will take you longer before you see any profit from your efforts, but it will be worth it when you are able to take a day off, or even a week off, and still have sales in your absence. These steps should be followed in order. If you try to go out of sequence, you will not get the results you are after. Why pick a market and not pick a product? Because you will eventually want to add additional products into your pipeline. You should pick a market that interests you, and maybe something you already know something about. Don’t forget that you are building for the long term. Once you have your market chosen, you should pick just one product to begin with. It will be very tempting to try to add all kinds of related products at first, but don’t. Having just one product will help you focus on the important tasks. You will want to pick a product that converts well. What this means is that the product sells to a high percentage of visitors. This will help keep your cost per visitor down and increase your profits. Also called an autoresponder series, you should build one based on the topic and the contents of the product you are promoting. If it is a physical product you are promoting, you will have to create or locate content that is directly related to the product. As an example, if you are selling golf clubs, you could create a series about how to buy golf clubs that fit, or the benefits of custom clubs, or even something about the club preferences of famous professional golfers. Be as creative as you can, and do not stray off topic. It has been said that most sales are not made in the initial contact, they are made on the seventh. If you are not following up with your prospects, the bottom line is you are losing sales. This is where you will capture information about your prospects so you can send your follow-up series. If you are building a business, having your own web site is a necessity, if only because you will control the content, and be able to capture email addresses for yourself. You might be able to get by for a while without this, but it just isn’t worth it. Until you are finished with step four, you shouldn’t even think about traffic techniques. If you don’t have anywhere to send the traffic, why worry about how to generate it in the first place. Depending on the traffic generation techniques you choose, it may take some time for you to start seeing sales in your program. You should spend this time developing one or two streams of traffic, and refining these techniques to help you drive more traffic with less effort. Once your business is making some money, it is time to start adding to your list of products. I don’t mean you should go out and sign up for every affiliate program that is even remotely related. What I do mean is that you should carefully choose an additional product or two, and add them into your pipeline. Because you have been building a list of qualified prospects, you will be able to market these new products to them. This is the really long term money maker for your business. As long as you continue to recommend good products to your customer list, you can continue to make money off of them, even the ones who have already bought your last product recommendation. So these six steps are all you need to go from nothing to having a profitable business selling other peoples products. It can be easy to loose focus if you are not seeing immediate results, so keep your sights on the end goal of having a profitable business. You may also find it hard finding your initial market and product. Take your time and choose the best product you can. If the product you choose to promote is not good, your prospects will not continue to listen to your recommendations."
2,Cables that Should Be Used In Solar Panels,business," The popularity of solar panels is on the rise, and choosing a suitable cable and wire for the job is very important for solar panel installation. Due to the unique construction and premise of the solar panels, only a particular type of cabling should be used in solar panels. These are photovoltaic or PV cables. These specific cables are designed for photovoltaic power generation and are used for photovoltaic power cells. The wires are well-adapted to all types of outdoor conditions, including hot and cold weather, rain, UV lights, and many more. The technology behind the photovoltaic cables entered the market in the mid-2000s. It is relatively new; however, the solar-energy market is growing, and new technologies arrive every day. So, which cables should you choose for solar panels? Here are a few points to consider: One natural choice you have to make is buying solar cables with copper or aluminum conductors. Copper PV wires are considered superior, but they are also significantly more expensive if you also consider the high initial price of the solar panel installation. Aluminum will bring you excellent performance at a lower price unless it is used in damp, wet environments. Do not use aluminum photovoltaic wire near the sea, rivers, or areas where rain is common. Aluminum wiring also requires a bit more meticulous installation. The typical temperature rating of the photovoltaic wire is 90°C in both wet and dry locations. However, the voltage rating greatly varies. There are versions available in 600 V, 1000 V, and 2000 V. Naturally, the voltage that you are going to need depends on the specifics of your photovoltaic panel. Both solid and stranded photovoltaic wire are available for PV, and stranded is usually a better choice because it gives superior performance in windy weather. XLPE is the most common insulation in photovoltaic wires. This insulation is perfect because of its excellent resistance to UV lights, hot temperatures, weather, and corrosion. Have been wondering whether you can use non-photo voltaic cables in your solar panels? Aside from the photovoltaic wires, the only other cable that may sometimes be used in solar installations is USE-2. It can be used only in grounded installations, and its goal is to connect the solar terminal to the service equipment. While some cables can be sparingly used in solar connectors, no other cables aside from PV and USE-2 are ever used in solar panels. This includes THHN, Romex, and other types of cable that may be suggested by mistake. Some of these cables may be used in miscellaneous elements related to solar panels, such as solar power connectors, but never in solar panels. In fact, it is best to use photovoltaic cables in solar panel connectors as well. Wondering about where to get the best deals on photovoltaic cables? Visit our website for the best deal on the latest models of photovoltaic wire and cable. Our vast network of suppliers allows us to keep the prices at the below-market level while delivering excellent quality."

5,Expanding Outdoor Dining by the National Restaurant Association,business," Due to the pandemic, many people had to stay at home without going to the cafe or a restaurant, but now, many people want to eat at restaurants indoors. However, some people prefer restaurants that offer outdoor dining. Why does it happen? Some people still have fears, so they prefer outdoor dining because they feel more save Many people prefer outdoor dining to leverage natural airflow And apart from this, there are even more reasons to recommend outdoor dining for restaurants. The National Restaurant Association sent a letter in October to mayors in the US where it asked all the local leaders for help in expanding outdoor dining. Here are the recommendations listed in this letter: Expanding the allowance for outdoor dining Reducing the requirements to permit the expanding Funds for promotion of outdoor dining Winter is coming soon, and most restaurants are getting about 20% of their incomes thanks to outdoor dining. But colder weather will force restaurants to stop outdoor dining, so as a result, their sales will be lowered during the winter. Following the regulations, about 68% of restaurants will have to stop outdoor dining by the end of October. Around 30% of restaurants will keep outdoor dining available all season because, during the last 2 years, many of them lost a lot in profits. Outdoor Dining Closing: The Possible Impact Many restaurants have created their patio dining due to the growing demand of customers. For example, New York is a city where outdoor dining is very popular these days. But due to many complaints, some of the spaces were removed by officials. According to polls, about 60% of adult people had to change their dining plans. Plus, rising COVID cases keep more people searching for outdoor dining to eat outside. These people were polled during the warmer season, so due to cold weather, some adults may change their preferences, so the whole percentage can be decreased. Sadly, maintaining outdoor dining in the winter and summer is quite different. In winter, cold weather requires additional funds from restaurant owners to keep outdoor patios open for clients. The Association recommends increasing this funding and simplifying the permitting process to keep outdoor dining open in the winter. The Main Recommendations for Outdoor Patios If you own a restaurant and want to survive in the winter, it's recommended to ask your city council to check out what sort of help is available in your place. Requirements in outdoor dining are changing often, so it's a good idea to understand what kind of help you can or cannot get. If the scenario goes its best way, you will have the next opportunities: Secure and fast permitting Apply for assistance or grants If you have got permission for open outdoor space, invest money wisely. Do not try to expand the area – it's better to keep it to a reasonable size and see if the amount of space is enough for clients. How to encourage people to eat in your outdoor space? Here are some good ideas to make your place more attractive: Place your outdoor sittings near trees Invest a bit to create a romantic and cozy atmosphere Add more lightings to make the place attractive When you are improving your restaurant's outdoor space, mind the requirements set in your city, especially pay attention to distancing and spacing guidelines. Make your place inviting and encourage people to visit your restaurant: always remind clients they can eat outdoors because you offer this option."
6,Intentional Discomfort and its Benefits for Entrepreneurs,business," Not many people like to experience discomfort, especially intentionally. When you have grown so used to the comfortable space in your life, it can take a toll on your mental health when things go awry. But intentional discomfort can help prepare you a little more for this change and might result in some incredible opportunities, especially for entrepreneurs. How Can Intentional Discomfort Benefit an Entrepreneur? Putting yourself out of your comfort zone is challenging in many ways, but it can reap some great rewards. One of the greatest benefits is when your discomfort actually pays off. This might look different depending on the type of discomfort you put yourself through and the risks you’ve been taking. Let’s say you took on a new marketing project that you weren’t sure would gain traction. You may have felt uncomfortable or disqualified throughout it, but when your hard work pays off, it makes it worth all of the discomfort you felt. Intentional discomfort can also result in new business connections. Networking is a discomfort for many, as it requires being outgoing and reaching out to people you’ve never met before. However, intentional networking is more focused on creating meaningful relationships than simply creating a sale or new client. As an entrepreneur, networking is one of the most important things you can do. By embracing intentional discomfort, you’ll also open yourself up to new connections that could emerge. Although you might feel a bit uncomfortable and insecure at the time, intentional discomfort usually results in a more confident entrepreneur. After being able to face this feeling and prove to yourself that you are able to be successful under these conditions, you’ll come out on the other side feeling rather proud of how you handled the discomfort and embraced change. In many ways, this discomfort prepares you for any future struggles you might face. Although you most likely planned for the intentional discomfort you pushed yourself to embrace, not much can prepare you for unexpected discomfort or unforeseen circumstances. However, having put yourself in such a position in the past, you’ll most likely have developed the confidence and resilience needed to push through any unexpected circumstances you encounter in your business. The further your progress in your career, the more comfortable you will grow in your position. To stay in touch with your entrepreneurial skills, it is recommended that you put yourself in uncomfortable situations meant to grow you and your business."
7,Learn More About Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products And Why It Is Important To Use Products,business," Today, we are plagued with a slew of ailments caused by harmful chemicals. Hormones in the food we eat are extremely damaging to our health, and cleaning products containing toxic chemicals wind up in nature and our water resources. Nature is the only area where we can live and co-exist with other living creatures. The planet is our homeland, which has welcomed us for millennia. Since its inception on the stage of history, humanity has progressed at a breakneck pace. In the early days, mankind could make a livelihood by collecting and making things. However, as time passed, man's discoveries revealed that he was capable of producing something toxic and dangerous, not only to himself but also to the environment in which he lives. People that create products and technologies often ignore the nature of what they create over time to further their interests. Individuals who built industries dumped their trash into the environment, and people who employed agriculture used chemicals to generate more items and enhance earnings, and the same is true for cleaning products. Beautiful nature, which has been assigned to us as time passes by individuals who are concerned with personal gain and wealth, is on the verge of extinction. This nature, inhabited by us and hundreds of other living creatures, has become unsuitable for most living things, and if we do not take immediate action to minimize our carbon footprint, there will be little left for our descendants to inherit. Some individuals and companies thrash mother nature and have little respect for the environment, while others create naturally and environmentally conscious without thrashing nature. These businesses understand that we must prioritise nature over profits since we rely on it. Companies that handle these beliefs work for the limitless perfect nature that has been given to us and seek for its continuity by making environmentally friendly cleaning solutions. They are not destroying this paradise for own profit. Eco-friendly cleaning products in the UK are tested by organizations such as The Soil Association and once the products pass, they are certified accordingly. These products are considered the most important criterion not to harm the earth, or any humans and animals, both in the materials used in the manufacturing process, as well as on their packaging. Eco-friendly cleaning products supplied across the UK are thus viewed as a recipe for our continued survival. Our lifestyles are rapidly reaching the ecological, biological world and due to increasing populations, consumption and living things will also rise with each passing year. Organic cleaning products were once utilised by our grandmothers but over the last half a century, chemicals have been infiltrating our homes through cleaning products and other things. Every house is cleaned and, the washing machine is constantly running, dishwashing liquids are used to wash dirty dishes, bleach are added to our laundry, and we have taken to bath and wood cleaning chemicals. We use a lot of cleaning products in our homes that contain chemicals, but the time has come to phase them out and the only way we can do that, is by opting to buy eco-friendly cleaning products in the UK. While we believe that these chemical cleaning techniques have made our lives healthier and more comfortable, we are blissfully unaware that our chemicals attack on the planet cannot be recovered later, as it causes irreversible damage to our health as well as other living beings and the environment. In this context, the use of organic or eco-friendly cleaning products will prevent permanent damage to the natural environment and living things. The surfactant used in organic cleaning products is natural and degradable, and as a result, not harmful to nature or living beings.

8,5 content writing tools that everyone should know in 2022,business," As the world recovers and enters into a post-pandemic state, there’s no denying that everything has shifted to the digital realm. When it comes to digital marketing, content writing has become essential for many businesses looking to scale up. We're seeing a surge in requests to help brands bring their content up to date and have them catch up to the rest of the industry. The pandemic forced businesses to shift online, and they had to utilize online platforms to reach and engage new audiences. In order to establish their presence, they had to showcase meaningful content. Most businesses resorted to hiring content marketing agencies (like us) to save them the hassle and guarantee the quality, but that's not always possible for everyone. Now, content has become a valuable asset for businesses. Aside from reaching new customers, content has the power to improve customer retention. Useful information ensures that people will patronize services. The power of content writing We focus on Southeast Asia, which is where we're seeing a lot of demand. Partly because it is happening all over the world, but also because the region was far behind the rest of the developed world when it came to digitalisation. According to a 2020 report from Google, Temasek Holdings, and Bain & Company, there were 40 million people in six countries across Southeast Asia—Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand—who went online for the first time in 2020. That brought the total number of internet users in Southeast Asia to 400 million people. Numerous research findings and surveys have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the shift to online is going to be permanent and even more competitive. However, the issue is that producing good content that people want to read is not easy. If you do not have the budget to hire experts or internal teams, then you're already on the backfoot. Well, luckily for you, the internet provides an arsenal of writing tools that businesses can leverage in order to help them with their content needs. From checking the grammar to generating key ideas for content marketing strategies, here are 5 tools that we believe businesses should be using: Plagiarism is a problem that plagues the content industry and even accidental plagiarism can have negative effects. Your credibility is in question, and people may question whether your business is legitimate or not. We suggest using Copyscape to detect plagiarism and it is pretty easy to use. The digital tool allows you to upload or paste your copy for free, to analyze if it is unique enough to stand out. This is extremely useful if you're using freelance writers to save some time - it takes a few minutes and guarantees they are not just copying content from elsewhere and passing it off as their own. At first glance, grammatical mistakes and spelling errors look harmless on the website’s copy. However, research suggests mistakes can affect the credibility of a business. There are trust and quality concerns should your content be riddled with mistakes. I have to admit that we're massive fans of Grammarly and have written about this tech tool numerous times. Using Grammarly to detect grammar errors and conduct spell checks is an easy, free (or affordable depending on what you need) and quick way to drastically reduce the number of errors that you make. The free version checks plagiarism, suggests writing styles and scans readability. Grammarly does offer premium (for individuals) and business (for teams) plans. Both are upgrades and can improve the clarity, engagement, and delivery of the content. Keyword research is often overlooked in content marketing because most people don't know what it is. If we were to summarize it, it is the process of researching popular terms that people type in search engines like Google. You need to know this because, by understanding what people are searching for, you can actually create content that is relevant to them and makes them want to visit your website. A great example of how we used this recently, was focusing our efforts on reaching out to Southeast Asian audiences who love fashion. Through basic keyword research, we identified what our specific target audience was searching for and developed relevant content around Southeast Asian fashion that was helpful to readers, as well as relevant to our customer. UberSuggest has a free version. It also offers three premium plans for deeper analysis. If this isn't to your fancy, we also suggest using an alternative to UberSuggest, which is Google Keyword Planner. Following up on using keywords, we should make it very clear that you shouldn't be stuck on trying to create content just to stuff keywords in it. A big part of ranking high in search engine listings is based on the readability or quality of your content. So, what we've seen is that good content that is deemed to be helpful and useful to readers is rewarded by search engines. This is where tools like Hemingway Editor can help you by improving your writing. It works by analyzing your content and checking for issues that include passive voice, weak words, and long sentences. It is an easy way to make sure your writing is clear and concise, which really does have an impact on your ranking. It is free to use and we find it extremely valuable in our work. So did you know that the average reader’s attention span is 7 seconds. So that's why we use Readable to analyze the readability of your content. It gives you a score based on if you've grabbed the readers' attention. This helps you to make sure your writing is appropriate and engaging to your audience. We find it helps us reduce the use of avoidable jargon, while we can also benefit from its keyword tracking feature. Just so you know, Readable gave this section a solid B, which means there needs to be some improvement, but it is easy to understand. This is a paid tool that we use, but we think it is worth the investment. There, we hope you enjoyed our list of 5 content writing tools that you should know. If we missed anything out or you feel like you just want to say hi, drop us a message in the comments."
9,Are you prepared for multinational risks? A test for your organisational resilience programme.,business," In recent years, many more organizations have established Business Continuity Management Plans (BCP’s) which define the different processes of avoiding and recovering from potential disasters to their business. With the number one goal of a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) serving to allow for continuation of operations while recovering from a disaster, the key component of the success of BCP’s relies on the organization’s resilience programme. Resilience Defined: The Business Continuity Institute defines Resilience as the adaptive capacity of an organization in a complex changing environment. Resilience is the more mature aspect of recovering from disaster which is the ability of an organization to uphold its functions regardless of drastic changes in the internal and external environment. Therefore, in their quest to achieve greater maturity in response to and recovering from disasters, an organization must consider a tailor-made resilience program to enable continuation of business under adverse circumstances. Resilience Statistics: In their annual Africa Resilience Survey, Ernst and Young (EY) discovered that although the majority of African organizations have good BCPs; they in addition require a matured resilience programme to reduce the likelihood of  exposure and  recover from disruptive events when they happen. The conclusions from the survey indicate that approximately 72% [Level 2 – Level 5] of the respondents reported that their resilience programme can assist in recovering business operations after a disaster. Of that number, 5% is certifiable and 28% can recover all critical functions within approved Recovery Time Objectives. Only 28% either cannot recover operations or the respondents do not know the maturity level of the programme. Over 64% of the aggregated participants have indicated an alignment of their companies BCM resilience solutions, to international best practices, i.e. ISO 22301, ISO 22316, BS 65000, ISO 27031, the Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines 2013 and/or COBIT. Of the 64%, approximately 10% have specified that their companies are aligned to BS 65000  i.e. a Guidance document on organisational resilience. The EY Survey further rated the resilience maturity of the sampled organizations in line with international standards on a five-point scale, with five being the most mature level: Maturity Level: Organization Activity Level 5	Certifiable Programme Level 4	Can recover all critical functions with approved recovery time objective Level 3	Can recover some critical functions with approved recovery time objective Level 2	Can recover limited business processes via information and undocumented processes Level 1	Cannot recover from or survive a disruption (programme does not exist) With the survey having revealed that 5% of the sampled organizations have reached level 5, 28% level 4, 24% level 3, 15% level 2 and 10% level 1 maturity of business resilience. The remaining 18% of the respondents indicated the level of resilience as unknown. What this indicates is that although 72% of the respondents reported that their resilience programme can assist in recovering business after a disaster, only 5% have their risk management sources spread beyond the scope of traditional risk methods. The need to be multinationally resilient: The complication with any organization operating multinationally is that the nature of disasters become foreign, away from the home country. The best assurance any organization can get against unknown material disruptive events is to align with international standards both at policy level and implementation. A multinationally resilient organization can reduce their vulnerability through adopting a resilience programme which gives them the opportunity to recover all critical functions within the approved Recovery Time Objectives. As a risk professional have you considered that: •	Business Continuity Management and Resilience are a subset of Risk Management, both disciplines are a critical part of mitigation of certain risks, is the value of risk management tested whenever any of these risks materialize? •	Sooner or later your business could grow multinationally. At some point in your business there’s contact with global customers or business partners. Have you considered your organization’s exposures as a result of these relationships? •	Your employees might travel outside your home country exposing them to multinational risks. Have you added an emergency repatriation plan in your resilience programme? •	Some of your business recovery sites are sitting elsewhere in the world. Have you considered resilience backup if a disaster hits your recovery site? •	For a multinational business, what infrastructure challenges in the other country, similar to the local water and electricity challenges experienced in South Africa, could impact on overall business continuity? •	For a multinational business, given the rise of cyber risk which holds no political boundaries, has the business considered the impact of system failure (DRP) and the link to their cyber risk management controls? •	Is your business focusing on generic disaster scenarios or specific scenarios which may have a higher probability of occurrence such as power outages (local), political unrest depending on the economic state of the foreign country? Take the organisational resilience programme test below: Rate your Organization: Yes/No Level 1	Cannot recover from or survive a disruption (resilience programme does not exist) Level 2	Can recover limited business processes via information and undocumented processes Level 3	Can recover some functions with approved recovery time objective Level 4	Can recover all critical function with approved recovery time objective Level 5	Has a Certifiable Programme Organisational Resilience Programme (in line with BS 65000) The most responsible decision of any organization would be to be aligned with international business resilience standards and formally adopt these as part of the risk management and business continuity program, because in spite of everything we are all part of the global world.

10,How to suppress dust by high-pressure misting systems？,business," Do you know that PM 10 dust in the workplace is a great hazard to most industries? The large amount of dust generated during handling and manufacturing operations can cause serious health hazards to your workers. If left untreated and dispersed in the air, dust can cause serious health risks, such as respiratory diseases. In addition, your industrial facility may also be subject to subpoenas and fines. Here are how various industries produce dust: ●Coal Mining Coal dust is the main cause of corrosion in all underground mines. It is produced by breaking and crushing coal which initiates chemical reaction with air creating its oxidizing atmosphere, where iron (steel) oxidation occurs, leading to rusting of structures like conveyors, gantries, chutes, etc. ●Construction Industry The use of dry powder blaster for removal of paint from steel structures causes the emission of high concentrations of irrespirable dust, which contains extremely hazardous particles like iron oxide (rust). These particles can easily pass into the lungs, initiating respiratory diseases like Silicosis, emphysema, bronchitis, etc. Lead paint should be removed mechanically first before blasting as lead fumes/dust are hazardous. ●Cement Industries The cement industry gives out harmful dust because of various activities like blasting, cutting, grinding, crushing, and drilling. These activities result in the emission of fine respirable dust (diameter less than 10 microns), which is known to cause cancer and complications like bronchitis and asthma because the particles (dust) bypass the nose-throat filter and reach deep into the lungs where it can do serious damage to one's health. For these reasons, cement industries should be located away from residential areas. ●Glass Making Glassmaking or glassworking produces silica as a by-product which causes Silicosis. This respiratory disease is incurable as they cannot recover once injured by this dust exposure. Protective masks should be used while working on furnaces, polishing, and cutting glass. ●Stone Cutting/Grinding Cutting or Grinding of stones also emits respirable dust particles, which are hazardous, especially when the stone contains crystalline quartz (silica). Respirable dust exposure causes Silicosis, which is incurable as the lungs cannot recover once damaged by this dust exposure. Masks should be worn during stone cutting or grinding. ●Wood Industry Wood industry cause inhalation exposure to wood dust composed of small particles (particles less than 10 microns in diameter) that easily pass through nose-throat filter deep into lungs where they can do serious damage. The most common diseases associated with wood dust exposure include woodworker's pneumoconiosis and asthma. The best way to solve this problem and suppress the large amount of dust generated in industrial activities is to install a high-pressure misting system. Let's understand the science behind the high-pressure misting system first. Working Principle Of Misting Systems The high-pressure main machine purifies and pressurizes the water to above 4-6MPa, and the water is hit by the special nozzle through the tube to change the velocity distribution of the jet cross-section so that the large particle droplets are broken and atomized into small particles. Under the action of aerodynamic force, the particles are further materialized into countless ""fine mist"" with a diameter of 10-20 microns. The ""fine mist"" floats in the air and absorbs the dust in the air, and changing water from liquid to gaseous state, which increases the humidity in the air. Composition Of Misting Systems ●High-pressure main machine ●Special dust suppression nozzle ●Mist Fittings: Including nozzle base, elbow, tee connector, straight connector, valve, etc. ●Pipe: 304 or 316 stainless steel material ●Filtration system: Three-stage filtration or stainless steel fine filtration ●Dosing device: Adding chemicals ●Water tank: Store a large amount of water mist fitting (1)mist fitting (2) Advantages Of The Misting Systems The misting system has established itself as a reliable method in suppressing dust. Its advantages are highlighted below: ●Ease Of Use The droplet size of fog used is about 10 to 20 microns (10-20 thousandths of an inch). That's smaller than most other techniques, such as water blasting or sprinkling that could raise the dust level back into the air again. This will lower labor costs since you can operate it without an extra workforce, unlike conventional methods where two people must manhandle each nozzle to spray water while monitoring the work site simultaneously. ●Safety The water used in a misting system is safe for people and the environment. The droplet size of fog is small, which means less splashing on workers or onto adjacent properties. Compared to common methods like lumbering or power sweeping, there are no eye irritations. There are also no health problems since operators aren't exposed to toxic substances like chlorine bleach, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, boron minerals, and others normally associated with using water to suppress dust. ●Durability And Efficiency The design of our misting systems allows them to operate continuously for several years resulting in lower maintenance costs compared to mechanical-driven systems. The fog system is most efficient since it can cover up to 100,000 SF on flat terrain. The misting nozzles are also durable and made from stainless steel with ball joints for easy maintenance. ●Effectiveness Controlling dust with the misting system has been proven to achieve results that other methods cannot efficiently. It's able to suppress dust while providing an environment conducive to work. After misting, you will notice all the areas covered by the fog will have less visible dust. Depending upon atmospheric conditions, this could be within minutes or hours after implementation. ●Low Water Use The fogging system is designed so optimum pressure can be achieved throughout the entire height range. It can control a 500-4000 square space for spraying. According to the requirements of different areas, the water flow rate can be adjusted from 100-1600 Kg/H according to the needs. Considering the flow rate of a conventional atomizing nozzle, the water consumption per hour is only 2.5L/H. ●Low Maintenance Costs After installation, misting systems require very little maintenance. On average, the misting system has far fewer components than most other types of dust suppression equipment. There are no nets, hoses, or fittings to maintain, as some sprayer trucks may need. ●Lower Operating Costs The misting systems can be operated more efficiently compared to other methods like dust palliatives (water, lime, etc). The fog emitted from our misting nozzles contains small droplets that will not wet or damage equipment, tools, or other items within the misted area. This makes it possible to operate without delays. ●Unlimited Operating Range Almost all misting systems can be used either inside or outside, depending on the type of project you have. It allows for speed and flexibility with little to no disruption to work schedules. ●Provides Immediate Results With other types of suppression, you need to wait up to 24 hours for your working environment to become clear again, but with a misting system, you can see visible results in less than an hour. ●No Residues Left Behind Other types of dust suppressants leave behind residues, making it difficult for equipment and machinery to work properly. This is because the residues are usually made up of harmful chemicals that seep into your equipment, causing slow functionality or even electrical malfunctions. Application Of The Misting Systems In Industries Here is information on how various industries can apply the misting system to suppress dust: ●Metal Production Metal dust particles contain harmful chemicals that may contaminate the environment. The dust can cause health problems for workers if they are not properly contained or eradicated. Ventilation and filtration systems alone cannot remove all aerosolized metals from work atmospheres. Metals must be kept moist to avoid recontamination of rooms, storage tanks, and pipelines from the air once the project has been executed. In addition to this protection function, a wet surface can better resist corrosion due to its coating of oxide compounds formed by water electrolysis. An anode and a cathode of identical material can be placed parallel to each other. Water mist will cover the surface and protect it from atmospheric oxygen so that no corrosion will occur. ●Mining There are adverse health effects on the mining industry workers as well as on the environment. Exposure to harmful materials such as arsenic, nickel, lead, zinc, or even uranium can cause health effects. Misting systems provide protection against alkaline dust (e.g., sodium compounds) that tend to produce alkali lakes when they react with water. Moreover, some metal dust may contain metals that can be lethal when in contact with water. ●Powder Production Apart from the operations in metal production, misting systems play a major role in maintaining workers' health by removing harmful chemical particles from the air they breathe. In addition to this function, environmental protection is also needed because some powders may also react with atmospheric moisture and produce explosive compounds such as nitrides or carbonates. ●Cement Production Misting helps with dust separation before entering cyclones for fine particle collection. Misting system also helps cement producers reduce clinker dust emissions during cement grinding processes leading to lower environmental pollution. Improved worker safety due to the reduced risk of inhaling toxic solid aerosols that may arise in the grinding and bagging processes is another benefit. ●Phosphate Manufacturing Misting helps in dust separation, oxidation, and consequent filtration to avoid consequential problems with phosphate products that can cause damage to crop or animal growth when used improperly. The process of installing the misting system is not easy, and setting everything up correctly is time-consuming and challenging. The best choice is to be guided by an experienced professional. It is recommended to look for a misting company with many years of installation experience. Nebufly, which has been established for more than 10 years, provides customers with first-class and high-quality service. We can quickly and effectively establish a perfect misting system for any private or commercial space. Please don't hesitate to contact us by email or phone."
11,Should you get solar panels in Adelaide?,business," You're probably wondering if solar panels are worth the cost. Well, you might be surprised to know that they can actually save you money in the long run! Solar energy prices have dropped more than 50% over the past decade and it doesn't look like this trend is going to stop any time soon. As a result, investing in solar power now will still give you great returns on your investment even though there's room for more price reductions in future years. Are solar panels worth it? The short answer is yes. The rising cost of electricity from traditional sources makes solar installation seem like a no-brainer for many homeowners, but the true cost and whether they'll help you save money depends on location. On average, installation can run between $15000 -$25 000; this includes hardware as well as labour to install it in your home or business (the Center For Sustainable Energy). One factor that will affect how much power an individual uses is their monthly usage-- if someone only needs 100 kilowatt-hours per month then they may not need such large equipment installed since fewer panels mean lower costs overall compared with other locations where people use more energy daily. You've probably heard about the big solar rebates offered by most state governments. Well, if you're thinking of investing in solar panels then this is one reason that you might want to consider now as opposed to later since these government rebates are available for only a limited time (typically around 12 months). The amount given can vary depending on you. What are the solar rebates in Adelaide? There are solar rebates in Adelaide which you can be availed of when buying and installing solar panels. The rebate is based on the size of the solar system you have the STC credits you are eligible for. The more solar power systems you have the bigger rebate. If you are thinking of investing in solar panels then this is one reason that you might want to consider now as opposed to later since these government rebates are available for only a limited time (typically around 12 months). The amount given can vary depending on your needs, but also what kind of System size is used. How much do solar panels cost? The average price of a solar power system for homes ranges from around $4,500 for a 5kW system up to $8,600 for a 10kW system. The government rebates can reduce the total cost of solar power for your home by up to 50 percent, so it is a good idea to look into them before making any final decisions about installation. Is Adelaide SA a good climate for solar? Adelaide is one of the best places in Australia for solar power due to its high number of sunny days. It has over 300 per year on average, with many more during the summer months. Although it does rain quite frequently here (especially between May and August), this doesn't affect how much solar energy you can get each day since clouds. What are some of the benefits of installing solar panels in your home? Solar panels offer many benefits for homeowners. For example, they can: a. Increase the value of your home - Solar power is a renewable source of energy and this makes it more attractive to buyers. Furthermore, if you ever decide to sell then having solar installed will help you fetch a higher asking price since demand has been steadily increasing in recent years. b. Save money on electricity bills - One of the main benefits that homeowners look into when considering solar installation is how much they could save in monthly utility costs. For example, if you live off-grid and rely solely on an existing power supply then investing in solar panels can reduce your reliance upon it since most people with this kind of system are unable to produce enough electricity on their own. c. Save money by using power during the day - solar panels are designed to work best when it's sunny, so you can save a lot of energy if you use appliances or run equipment that requires large amounts of power only between say 11 am and around 30pm each day since this is when solar panels are most efficient. d. Reduce your carbon footprint - By using solar power you can help reduce the amount of pollution that we create each day and this is one reason why environmentalists around the world have been encouraging others to switch over to clean, renewable energy sources such as solar for many years now. It's also a good way to show children how the power of the sun can help make our homes more energy-efficient. How long until solar panels pay for themselves? The payback period is the time it takes for your solar power system to recoup its initial cost. This can vary depending on many factors, but it's normally 3 - 4 years. People generally like to focus more on how quickly you will start saving money each month once installation has been completed and everything starts working properly. For example, if you are able to save $200 per month on your electricity bill, then it will only take around eight months for the system to pay itself off since you can actually make money each day by using solar energy. If you are wondering how many solar panels cost in Adelaide, this is one question that many people have asked themselves at some point or another."
12,What You Need to Know Before Removing Tree Roots,business," Tree roots can be a major problem in your yard, so it is important to understand the process before you start removing them. You will need to find out what type of tree the roots are coming from and learn how much work is involved with removal. All of this information will help you decide if it is worth doing yourself or hiring someone else. If you are considering removing tree roots, it is important to know what you are getting into. Tree roots can be difficult to remove because they can damage pipes and cause other environmental issues if not properly removed. The first step in the removal process is determining whether or not the tree needs to be cut down before root removal. This article will discuss how this decision should be made and other considerations that need to be taken into account when planning for a root removal project. What to consider before tree root removal Before you can even begin to think about removing the roots, it is important to determine what type of tree they are coming from. The root system varies widely between species and can be influenced by soil conditions, weather patterns, and even how long the trees were planted. Knowing this information will allow you to develop a plan that works best for your specific situation. Tree species Different trees have different root systems. The tree species will determine how much work is involved with removing them and what type of environmental damage they can do if not properly removed. Some trees have dense and expansive roots, while others may be smaller in size but difficult to access due to deep planting. Deep Planted Roots Some tree species were planted deep when they were younger to prevent them from tipping over. These trees tend to have roots that spread in all directions and can be very difficult to remove, especially if the tree is tall or has many branches. If this type of tree needs to be removed, it will probably require a professional arborist for safety purposes. Species with expansive roots Trees like oaks and palms have large, expansive root systems. These trees can be difficult to remove because they cause environmental damage when removing them from pipes or the ground. If you are trying to move a tree with this root system, you must keep as much soil around the roots intact as possible. When deciding to remove tree roots, it is important that you consider the type of species and how much damage they can do before starting. This information will help determine if removal should be done yourself or by a professional for safety purposes. Soil conditions The soil conditions play a large role in the process of removing tree roots. Hard soil, such as clay or packed dirt, can make it difficult to remove tree roots because they will spread and wrap around other objects like pipes and rocks buried beneath the surface. This causes damage when trying to dig out the root system so that it will need a professional for assistance. On the other hand, Muddy soil is very easy to access roots in because it is loose and dug out. If you consider doing this yourself, make sure that no water runoff occurs when removing them so they do not cause further damage down the line. This type of root removal can also have environmental consequences if done incorrectly. Trees planted in the right type of soil will require less work to remove because they can be dug out without too much trouble by yourself or a professional arborist. If you have trees in either type of soil, it is important to do your research before removing them, so damage does not occur when digging around pipes and the ground. Do I need to cut down my tree? If you are trying to decide whether or not you need to cut down your tree, you should consider a few things. First, check for signs of disease or fungus that can damage your tree’s health and make it unsafe to remove roots from. If this is not an issue for your tree, then take another look at the root system itself. A tree with expansive roots may need to be removed If your tree has expansive roots, it may need to be cut down so you can remove them without causing damage. If the root system is not too dense and easy for one person to dig out, other options can help save the health of your trees. Tree stumps that have small seedlings growing on top of them do just that! They provide a safe location for seedlings to grow and prevent the risk of injury when digging out expansive root systems. Tree stumps can save trees with expansive roots If your tree only has small seedlings on top, you may be able to preserve it by removing all but one or two of them from the stump, so there is still a tree to look at. This is also an effective way of preventing damage from occurring if the root system has spread too far and may cause environmental problems in your yard when attempting removal on your own. Saving trees with expansive roots by removing some seedlings If you have small seedlings sprouting up all over, there are ways to save time and money when removing them. Arborists are professionals that have the proper equipment to remove both large tree roots as well as seedlings in a safe manner, so no damage is caused when digging around pipes or other items in your yard buried beneath the surface. Tree removal by an arborist can help with expansive root systems When removing trees yourself, it is important to consider the type of root system your tree has and how much soil you need around them. The last thing that you want to do is cause damage when digging out roots because this could lead to environmental problems later on if not handled correctly by a professional who knows exactly what they are doing."
13,New Systems Offer So Much More – Also When It Comes To Your Bathtub Or Shower,business," Taking a bath or a shower is, for most people, more than just a quick cleanse of the body. For many, it is a time to relax and soothe away the day’s cares and troubles. Therefore a great bathtub or comfortable shower is a must. The average household indeed has the traditional tub in their bathroom, a tub that one has to be steady on the feet for to climb into and out of, simply because of the way bathtubs are designed. Tubs are designed and manufactured to make sure water does not spill out; therefore they have a rather high sidewall (sometimes referred to as the ‘apron’) to keep the water inside as you sit in it or lie back to relax. Therefore the tub serves its purpose of keeping the water inside, allowing you to add more water, or to let out some as you please. This means the tub serves its purpose perfectly. But, many individuals have a problem getting into and out of their tub because of the high edge or wall of the tub. The elderly, the senior citizen often finds it hard to climb in and out of their bathtub. And, of course, other people may be struggling to do so because of an injury or whatever other reason. These people are often forced to take a shower, having to forego the bathtub option. But even many showers have high step-ups with edges that make it difficult to get in and out. Not only getting in and out may present a problem. There is often the fear one may fall and get injured during the process. All in all, there are often issues for the elderly and others with a physical impairment. That is why these people, more and more than ever before, consider the modern option, i.e., looking at walk-in bathtubs and showers, which means you no longer have to negotiate steps or high, inconvenient walls or edges. The walk-in tub is simply that: a tub with a door you open and close, no climbing in and out of. You just open the door and close it – and open the taps. The benefits speak for themselves if you find it difficult to climb into a tub. You simply get in, close the door and open the taps.

20,Uses of graphite electrodes,business," Graphite electrode refers to a kind of resistant material made by using petroleum coke and pitch coke as aggregate and coal pitch as binding agent through raw material calcination, crushing and grinding, batching, kneading, molding, roasting, impregnation, graphitization and mechanical processing. The high-temperature graphite conductive material is called artificial graphite electrode (graphite electrode for short), which is different from the natural graphite electrode prepared by using natural graphite as raw material. (1) Used in electric arc steelmaking furnace Graphite electrode materials can be mainly used for electric furnace steelmaking. Electric furnace steelmaking uses research graphite electrodes to introduce working current into the furnace. The powerful current at the lower end of the electrode can affect arc discharge through these gas environments, and the heat generated by the arc is used for smelting. The size of the electric capacity is equipped with graphite electrodes with different diameters, which can be used continuously, and the connection between the electrodes against the electrode joints. Graphite used in steelmaking as an electrode material accounts for about 70-80% of the total consumption of graphite electrodes in China. (2) Used in submerged electric furnace It is mainly used to produce iron furnace ferroalloy, pure silicon, yellow phosphorus, calcium carbide and matte. Its characteristic is that the lower part of the conductive electrode is buried in the charge, so in addition to the heat generated by the arc between the electric plate and the charge, the current passes through the charge At the same time, heat is also generated by the electrical resistance of the charge. Every ton of silicon consumes about 150kg of graphite electrode, and every ton of yellow phosphorus consumes about 40kg of graphite electrode. (3) Used in resistance furnace In the production process, the graphitization furnace for graphite material products, the furnace and production of melting technical glass, and the electric furnace for silicon carbide are all resistance furnaces. The management of the materials in the furnace is both a heating resistor and an object to be heated. Usually, the graphite electrode for conducting is inserted into the furnace head wall at the end of the hearth, so the conducting electrode is not consumed continuously. (4) For processing A large number of graphite electrode blanks are also used to process various crucibles, graphite boats, hot die casting molds and vacuum electric furnace heating elements and other special-shaped products. For example, in the quartz glass industry, 10t of graphite electrode blank is required for every production of lt electric fusion tube, and 100kg of electrode blank is consumed for every production of lt quartz brick. It should also be noted that there are three types of graphite composite materials at high temperatures, including graphite electrodes, graphite molds and graphite crucibles. In these three materials, graphite is prone to oxidation and combustion reactions at high temperatures, resulting in surface glue. The increased porosity and loose structure of the carbon layer affect the service life."

1,"Discover Why Custom Homes In Fate TX Are Become More Popular, Especially The Ones Built By Reputable Custom Home Builders",business," A custom home is planned expressly for you by an architect and built to your specifications by a custom home builder, as opposed to one that is built to a predesigned plan with no homeowner involvement. Although many custom houses in Fate TX are built to predesigned designs, you can have your dream house built completely to your specifications, so that it fits your personality and lifestyle. Many homes are production constructed, which means that a builder develops multiple homes at the same time, all in the same area, with most of the designs being quite identical. This means that the builder usually has a few floor designs that he or she uses as a guide. However, if a buyer purchases the home before it is finished, the buyer may be able to select a few things, but it is still a long way from having your ideal house custom built to your specifications. A custom home, on the other hand, is built exclusively for you by a custom home builder, and you can either utilize the architect of the custom builder to design or buy a floor plan. You can also have the house built on your land rather than purchasing the land and house together.If you are building on previously undeveloped land, you may also need to have utilities installed or work done on the land to prepare it for a residence. You'll also need to look at zoning regulations. Custom homes in Fate, TX is usually a little more expensive than production produced homes, but the benefit is that you have more influence over the building process.

2,Are Hunchback Back Brace Effective?,business," Correct posture can improve your physical and mental health. Having good posture is important, say experts. Standing properly relieves pressure on your spine, neck and shoulders and reduces neck and back pain—a big problem in America, with about a quarter of us reporting having back pain for at least one day in a three-month period. Many also suffer ""text neck,"" caused by spending prolonged periods of time with our heads (average weight: 11 pounds) tilted down, staring at screens. There also are links between posture and mental health. People with depression and anxiety tend to hunch or curl inward, research shows. On the other hand, standing straight can help you feel better. In addition to better mood, good posture's benefits include: Avoiding irreversible damage to your spine Reducing your risk of osteoarthritis Improving flexibility and joint movement Decreasing your risk of falls by improving your balance Helping you breathe easier by giving your lungs more room to expand Do hunchback back brace work? While having good posture is a great goal, most hunchback back brace don't help you achieve it. In fact, some of these devices can do more harm than good. That’s because your body begins to rely on the devices to hold you up, especially if you wear them for long periods of time. This can cause the core muscles you'd normally use for better posture to relax and weaken. A Scandinavian research review in 2019 examined six studies claiming to show wearable shirt-type hunchback back brace worked. The review found that most studies were poorly designed and, due to funding by device manufacturers, were potentially biased. The review authors concluded there was no credible evidence that this type of posture corrector worked. Another type of posture corrector uses a different method entirely, which some users have said works for them. The Upright Go device involves sticking a keyfob-sized sensor to your back or wearing it as a necklace. The sensor works with a smartphone app to detect when you slouch, and will gently vibrate to remind you to change position. One benefit all these devices have is increasing your awareness of your posture and whether you need to fix it. But, experts say the best way to improve your posture is through core-strengthening exercises, such as yoga, and by working to stand and sit correctly in your daily life. Some simple tips to follow: When sitting, keep your chin parallel to the floor, with your knees and feet pointing straight ahead. If you work at a desk, consult with your employer or view online advice for setting up a posture-friendly and ergonomic workspace. Also, be sure to get up and stretch frequently; many experts advise moving around once per hour. When standing, keep your shoulders down and back, your spine neutral (no flexing or arching), hips even and knees pointed forward, tighten your abdominal muscles, and distribute your weight evenly on both feet; your feet should be shoulder-width apart. If you continue to have trouble with poor posture, consult with your physician to determine if you have a contributing disorder, such as scoliosis (spinal curvature)."
3,Difference Between Frozen Fruit and Fresh Fruit,business," Vegetables and fruits are rich in nutrients - vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Freezing is a safe way to extend the shelf life of nutritious foods. However, many people mistakenly believe that frozen vegetables are far less nutritious than fresh vegetables. There still seems to be some controversy about whether frozen vegetables are healthy and how they stack up against fresh produce. While grocery shopping can be a chore, who doesn't love wandering through the fresh produce section? The vibrant colors and aromas are so incredibly inviting that it's hard to avoid them. Fresh fruits and vegetables look delicious in the fridge, but after a few days, they turn mushy and brown. You can make an effort to add these to smoothies so they don't go to waste, but that's not the case. What are the nutritional differences between frozen fruits and fresh fruits and vegetables? Benefits of Frozen Fruits vs. Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Frozen fruits and vegetables seem so easy and stress-free. They seem to taste the same and can sit in the refrigerator for weeks or even months without spoiling or losing flavor. It almost seems too simple to make you wonder if they are as nutritious and vitamin-rich as the colorful fresh produce you see on the shelves. Nutritional Differences - Frozen vs. Fresh Fruits Surprisingly, there's not much difference between the two. Frozen or fresh, it's both nutritious and sweet. In fact, there is evidence that frozen fruits and vegetables can actually help preserve the nutrients that fresh produce loses over time on the shelf. Fruits and vegetables intended to be frozen are usually picked at the ripe stage so that they can accumulate all possible nutrients before being processed, packaged and frozen. Frozen Fruits and Frozen Vegetables Frozen fruits and vegetables vary depending on the process the vegetable undergoes prior to packaging. Vegetables are blanched before the freezing process, which means they are placed in boiling water for a few minutes to prevent loss of flavor and color, and to kill bacteria. This results in a significant reduction in antioxidants and B- and C-vitamins in frozen vegetables, although nutrient levels remain stable once frozen. Fruits do not undergo a bleaching process; therefore, their nutrient content remains the same throughout the process and when frozen. So, which is better, frozen or fresh fruit? Fresh produce is usually picked before it is ripe so that they can survive the shipping process. While these fruits and vegetables are on the shelf waiting to ripen, oxygen begins to reduce their nutritional value and they contain fewer vitamins and antioxidants than they normally do when picked at the peak of ripeness. Ultimately, there is no significant nutritional difference between the two, although frozen produce can help lock in nutrients for several months. Hebei Agrilinks is specializing in frozen vegetables and fruit line with professional staff as a team with experiences from 1997. We specialize in frozen vegetables wholesale, these frozen vegetables are made from fresh vegetables frozen and the quality is guaranteed."
4,UK experts Remould rubber recycling process,business," Acutely aware of the environmental impact of unrecyclable rubber, UK-based rubber engineers Martin’s Rubber Company were inspired to develop a completely sustainable and unique rubber recycling process. Known as Remould™, this innovative new approach enables them to break down, re-vulcanise and remould nitrile rubber into brand-new moulded products. Rubber is notoriously difficult to recycle. Unlike plastic, it’s not a simple case of heating and re-using rubber. Thermoplastic materials can be heated, deformed and reprocessed into new or different products. But vulcanisation permanently “sets” the bonds of a rubber and that process is incredibly difficult to reverse. Rubber is like a sponge cake. Once a cake has been baked, it’s impossible to extract the constituent parts – the eggs, the flour, the milk – to be re-used in another recipe. That, in an eggshell, is the enormity of the challenge that has faced conscientious rubber manufacturers who have previously attempted to recycle vulcanised rubber. It’s challenging, for sure. But not impossible, as Martin’s Rubber Company has proven. Remould™ rubber recycling Alongside their industrial and academic partners, Martin’s Rubber Company has successfully developed a scalable, proprietary rubber recycling solution, known as Remould™. For the first time this innovative process enables them to break down those aforementioned molecular bonds to produce a reusable material. Remould™ technology creates a closed loop recycling process that allows the Southampton-based rubber engineers to de-vulcanise end-of-life rubber products and re-vulcanise them into fresh ones. They simply combine the de-vulcanised rubber with raw, virgin rubber to form new bonds and a newly moulded product. Martin’s Rubber Company is re-shaping the rubber recycling process to create sustainable rubber products using their new recycled material, known as Envirolast. All of their products are unfailingly kind to the environment and exhibit reliable, repeatable physical properties, as well as a high-quality finish. “Over the years, there have been many attempts to find a successful way of reforming rubber that have ultimately ended in failure,” a spokesperson for Martin’s Rubber Company told us. “But we’ve been able to develop a solution that not only reverses the state of rubber compounds but also enables us to recycle rubber and fulfil our commitment to producing eco-friendly rubber products.” Currently available in nitrile, Martin’s Rubber Company guarantees that as much as 50% of the rubber in every one of its Envirolast moulded products has been recycled using its game-changing Remould™ technology.

5,AN OVERVIEW OF THE REGULATORY GUIDELINES OF THE eNAIRA,business," The World is becoming more technological by the day and the development of technology in recent times have adopted a more versatile approach so much that it cuts across every aspect of human existence and dealings. Under this circumscription is the financial sector of the economy. While technological advancement is being recorded in other variants of human life, the financial sector must also be up to speed technological to prevent a dysfunction in the system. In this regard, the recent development in FinTech and technology at large has caused the Government of Nigeria, acting through the Central Bank of Nigeria (“CBN”) being the apex monetary authority in Nigeria, under the empowerment of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act of 2007 and the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act of 2020 (BOFIA) to issue legal tender currency, ensure financial system and promote the development of electronic payments system; to rationalize and propose to introduce the eNaira system. Particular attention is paid to the framework of the eNaira as set out in the official Regulatory guidelines on eNaira issued by the CBN on October 1, 2021. The eNaira system is essentially the digitalization of the Naira denominations already in circulation in Nigeria. The intention is for the paper denomination and the digital denomination to rank pari passu i.e., at ratio “1:1”. Thus, every N5 in paper money would equal 5 eNaira and so on. The traditional paper Naira valuation at the Foreign Exchange Market, Money Market, Stock Exchange Market, Capital Market and so on, would also be the value of the eNaira. The CBN in its optimism, believes the eNaira to complement the traditional Naira “as a less costly, more efficient, generally acceptable, safe and trusted means of payment”. It is also speculated to improve monetary policy effectiveness, enhance government’s capacity to deploy targeted social interventions and boost remittances through formal channels. In Operating the eNaira, an eNaira wallet is required. The eNaira wallet is used metaphorically with a physical wallet, to perform similar functions i.e., to access, use and hold the eNaira. The eNaira is also exchangeable for other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Hence, a holder desirable for a CBDC other than the eNaira can seamlessly exchange his eNaira for that CBDC. The eNaira shall apply to all financial institutions (FIs) i.e., companies engaged in the business of dealing with financial and monetary transactions such as deposits, loans, investment and currency exchanges, e.g., Banks, trust companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, investment dealers and so on. The eNaira would be minted and issued by the CBN through the Digital Currency Management System (DCMS). The CBN would also administer the eNaira through the instrumentality of the DCMS. There is a mandate on FIs to maintain a treasury eNaira wallet for holding and managing eNaira on the DCMS. FIs would manage their digital currency holdings, requests and redemption with the CBN through the Financial Institution Suite. The FI Suite would take the form of an application to be used exclusively by FIs. Having minted the eNaira, the CBN shall store them in an a non-physical “warehouse” called the ‘eNaira Stock Wallet’. This stock wallet shall belong exclusively to the CBN. a FI shall maintain one treasury eNaira wallet to warehouse eNaira received from the CBN eNaira stock wallet. FIs may however create sub-treasury wallets for branches tied to it and fund from its single eNaira treasury wallet with the CBN. The eNaira platform would provide eNaira Consumer wallets for end users to transact eNaira. Every transaction by holders will be consummated from the eNaira consumer wallet. A FI may create eNaira branch sub-wallets for its branches. The eNaira branch sub-wallet shall be funded from the treasury eNaira wallet. To make and receive payments for goods and services through eNaira, the eNaira Merchant Wallets would be used. eNaira wallet would be secured by a two-factor authentication primarily and subsequently, other measures would be employed. Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) checks would apply to the eNaira for fraud detection and prevention. For efficient transfer of eNaira, FIs shall integrate their backend systems to the DCMS. On the occasion of any complaint, the Helpdesk of the user’s preferred FI Helpdesk is to be contacted. Where the complaint is solved, resort would be made to the eNaira Helpdesk. Complaints in this sense also involves disputes arising between FIs which would be directly reported to the eNaira Helpdesk Team and resolved within two (2) working days. Where a party or both parties are unsatisfied with the resolution of the eNaira Helpdesk Team the dispute shall be referred to an arbitration panel under the extant Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Categorisation of Users The eNaira Guidelines created different categories for users, each with its distinct requirements. Unique identifiers are provided for three categories of users: (i) corporate entities are to be identified by their Tax Identification Number (TIN); (ii) individuals are to be identified by their National Identity Number (NIN) and/or Bank Verification Number (BVN); and (iii) Merchants, who are not corporate entities, are to be identified by their BVN. eNaira Guidelines in addition, different documentation requirements apply to each category of user. Users are categorised here into Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Merchants, each with its daily transaction and eNaira wallets limits. Merchant is the only category of user without any daily transaction or eNaira wallets limit. Transaction Types The eNaira Guidelines recognises four transactions, each with its distinct available services. Subsequent types of transaction can be created subject to approval by the CBN. Charges and Cost Structure Charges for e-Naira transaction must be in line with the Guide to Charges by Banks, Other Financial and Non-bank Financial Institutions, 2020 (the “Guide”). There is no specific capture of charges for e-Naira transactions under the Guide since the Guide was released before the launch of eNaira. Given the nature of e-Naira transactions, a close charge rate provided for under the Guide is that of electronic funds transfer: ₦10 is charged for transaction below N5,000; ₦25 is charged for transaction over ₦5,000 but not more that ₦50,000; and any transaction above ₦50,000 attracts ₦50 charges. Anti-Money Laundering/ Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Compliance Financial institutions are required to comply with the provisions of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended), the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 (as amended), and all subsisting anti-money laundering laws and regulations as may be issued by the CBN from time to time. eNaira Guidelines. This puts financial Institutions under obligation to put in place policies for detection of any money laundering and terrorist financing activity Risk Management Here, financial institutions are required to ensure that there are sound risk management procedures, that will address any threat that comes on. Examples of such risks, includes: a.	Treasury Maintenance – Financial institutions here, have the duty to maintain the eNaira wallet, for holding and managing eNaira on the Digital Currency Management System (DCMS), if any financial institution fails to adequately maintain this treasury, there is risk of sanctions by the CBN. b.	Loss/Theft of eNaira wallets- The user may lose his/her device, and this means inaccessibility of the eNaira wallet/platform c.	Hacking- With the giant strides in technological advancements across the globe, hacking is a word a lot of people have become too familiar with. Sadly, the eNaira is also prone to being hacked by cyber hackers. Is there a way out of all these? Yes, the CBN guidelines has successfully provided for ways the highlighted risks could be mitigated. This includes: a.	Financial Institutions, ensuring there is an existing risk management framework b.	Financial Institutions, ensuring that an appropriate governance procedure exists c.	Documented and approved policies d.	Financial Institutions, securing their Information technology infrastructure (ITI). e.	From time to time, these financial institutions are also required to implement additional risk management measures, as may be prescribed by the CBN guidelines. eNaira Wallet Recovery Process Under this section of the guideline, the CBN provides different responsibilities for stakeholders, to ensure a prevention or minimization of loss of data, after a user’s device has been stolen or a hack of the eNaira wallet. a.	Banks •	Banks shall ensure that eNaira users have access to channels, to report such loss, theft, or hack. At the very least, banks shall ensure that customers can report via: USSD channels; internet banking platforms; customer care phone lines; and In-branch customer care. •	A system should be on ground, to identify the identity of the complainants. a KYC is suggested for this. •	Where such reports have been made, there should be an immediate restriction on those eNaira wallets to prevent loss of funds b.	eNaira wallet users •	Wallet users shall ensure the protection of the eNaira wallet login credentials and devices to prevent any third-party disclosure. •	Make a prompt report to Financial Institutions or the eNaira helpdesk where there has been a loss/theft of device or a user’s eNaira wallet has been compromised. c.	Merchants •	Merchants shall provide channels for eNaira payments at sales outlets. Wallet Recovery What an eNaira wallet is lost or hacked, what happens next? In the event, that the device is lost or stolen, for a user to recover the eNaira wallet, the following must be done: a.	Download a new “eNaira Speed Wallet” from the app stores b.	Accept the terms and conditions of usage of eNaira c.	Create a new username and password d.	Input a two-factor authentication credential Or even contact the Financial Institution for assistance. If on the other hand, it is comprised, the user shall: a.	Request for a change of password using the forgotten password functionality in the eNaira app or using the USSD password change process b.	Select an appropriate password c.	Input username and password for existing users, and d.	Input a two-factor authentication credential Or also contact the Financial Institution for assistance Financial and Regulatory Reporting Financial Institutions shall render returns to the CBN in line with the provisions of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 and as may be specified regularly"
6,How to showcase a product on Amazon for a successful sale,business," The pandemic has changed the dynamics of product procurement and sale. Due to this online sales are at an all time high. With the absence of a real brick and mortar store and high return, FBA charges how can one be sure that the product showcasing is perfect? The solution is to resort to professional product photography for the product. We need to make sure that the product images truly represent the actual product for sale. This calls for a product photography studio which is geared with high end photography camera, lenses and immense knowledge of lights. With online shopping just at the click of a button, it is almost impulse buying. The decision is taken within a few minutes while on the product listing. Also with millions of sellers selling the same product for varied pricing, it is imperative to satisfy this buying urge in the form of providing all information of the product to the buyer via the product imagery. Here we discuss the DOs and the DONT's for the best product image which can satisfy the buyers buying impulses. The DOs Make sure the camera lenses are of professional nature. This allows to capture the details of the product in its Hero shot. It also allows for white balance capability which is the pre-requisite for Amazon main image. Alternate product image- Show case the product at various angles in order to show all sides of the product. With the absence of a physical product in hand, this shot can showcase the product at various angles and all its sides. Information bases images- These are called product infographics. With less time at hand, buyers would not essentially read the product specifications. The information gathered via visual means is more powerful than the text reading. Add all possible information of the product on this image. There can be 2 infographics in each product listing allowing to showcase the various aspects of the product, its usability and assembly. Dimension shot- This is very important photo. Add the exact dimensions of the product on this shot and if possible showcase a relative item near it. This relativity helps the buyer get a general idea of the size of the product. -Lifestyle photo- Spice up the listing with a lifestyle photo of the product in use. Some times professional photographers create high end composites using stock imagery and inserting the product in to it. This can be easily achieved by shooting the product in perspective and superimposing it on to a great stock image. This does require for an advance photography and graphics skill set. Make sure the studio has this capacity. The DONT's- Avoid using phone cameras. They do not provide the megapixels to capture the details of the product. Some photographers claim to shoot high resolution photos but with phone cameras which lack the details Do not add too many details on the infographic shot. This makes the product look too technical. Add the correct dimensions of the product without adding extra inches to them. This can lead to negative feedback. Do not add unnecessary props. If the props are not included with the product, make sure to mention this on the images. For eg- Phone holders do not come along with phones, but still have to be showcased with one. In such a case make sure to point out the fact that phones are not included. Buyers sometimes get confused with this and places an order assuming that the props are included at the pricing of the Amazon listing. Spare the comparison chart. Do not compare your product with the similar product sellers. This can create a huge unnecessary trouble. Also there isn't any way to prove that your product is better than your competitor as the customer will tell this for a fact after usage and review. Lifestyle photos of the product should be relatable. Do not show a product not meant for children on a kid model or children stock images. Know the product limits and abide by them. By following the proper Dos and DONT's it will the whole product listing process will be easy and successful at the first go. This will also help with zero returns due to conflicting product information. The success journey begins with such professional photography and ends with a five star client review."
7,The Usefulness of Fumigation in 2021,business," Fumigation is the act of fumigating, or applying smoke or vapor, as for disinfection. But in Portuguese language it is called Dedetizacao. Fumigation is a method of controlling pests or removing harmful microorganisms and completely smothering or poisoning an area with an airborne pesticide - or fumigant filling. It  is used in pest control of buildings, soil, crops and production and is also used during processing of imported or exported products to prevent migration of foreign organisms. This method affects the structure itself, affecting the insects that live in the physical structure, such as almonds and dried wood ponds. Fumigation is a process where at the required temperature and pressure a fumigant can contain a chemical in a sufficiently gaseous state that would be lethal to a given insect. This definition implies that a fumigation acts as a gas or smoke in a harsh way. Types of Fumigation Fumigation is a technique that uses a variety of chemicals to remove pests and insects from homes, buildings and processed products. The operation is dangerous and all fumigants are harmful to humans to some degree. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, prevention is better than cure for pest control and the use of sanitation, mechanical control and harmful inert compounds will prove to be safer and more effective alternatives to smoking. There are various types of fumigation, for example- Gas fumigation Solid fumigation Liquid fumigation And there are different types of chemicals which are used in fumigation. These are Magnesium Phosphide - is a dark gray solid that is typically used in a powder or granule form; Methyl Bromide - is an effective fumigant against a wide variety of pests and; Sulfuric fluoride is a pressurized liquid gas that is typically used for pest control in residential settings. Why is Fumigation necessary? Products such as foodstuffs, oilseeds, pulses, spices, tobacco, textiles, timber, etc., which are the main items in today's export market, are extremely susceptible to the attack of grain stored during storage. These attacks can cause extensive damage. Also, strict segregation and regulatory requirements of different nations make pest-free shipments mandatory. Fumigation or the use of gas in an enclosed space) is an essential requirement as a healing strategy; At all stages of the development of eggs, larvae, pupae and adult insects, it does not kill the live infestation, but rather helps to prevent the spread of unwanted insects from one country to another. Here are some reasons why Fumigation is essential for your home or office when working regularly. To take precautionary measures It is always better to be sorry than to be safe. Above all, with proper fumigation, the problem will keep it away before it gets bigger. Regular fumigation can also ensure that you spend less money, helping to detect destructive pests before they are fully exposed to your furniture in your home or office. Insects like rats can be dangerous and they can cause significant damage because they like to hit paper, cloth and even electrical wires. You can save more money by taking proper precautions with regular fumigation and trying to replace your damaged equipment. Taking care of insect problems If you notice that pests are spreading on your property, the necessary fumigation or should be done as soon as possible. Smoke, bed bugs, cockroaches and many common insects can be cleaned with proper fumigation if your home or office needs it. There are many pest control services out there, with many pest control companies dedicated to late control and many more. To ensure comfortable work environment No one is willing to work in an office where insects roam. As such, you should ensure that your employees receive adequate protection from pests and continue to work as best they can. A comfortable work environment can also bring many benefits. It is sure  that this is through fumigation. With fumigation, you can create a comfortable work environment for your employees that are pest-free and can give your clients a nice first impression when they visit. Save money and time Many people who have an insect problem have used many other ways to overcome the problem. You can shop for traps and pesticides, but if the infestation is too much, it is best to call the pest control agency to deal with the problem by fumigation. Choosing fumigators instantly saves not only your time but also your money. Although their initial cost may seem high, they allow you to completely eliminate pests in your office and home. Before settling in a fumigation company, it is always best to find out as much as possible about them. When is Fumigation Necessary? Fumigation has long been a staple element of the pest control industry. No one wants to smoke in their home but in some particularly devastating cases of infection, the entire property may need to be fumigated. Depending on the species of insect, different chemicals may be used for fumigating. Although almost all pesticides used in fumigation are dangerous to humans and animals, it is, therefore essential to try to fumigate your property without the assistance of your licensed extermination professionals. The vast majority of Fumigation cases in the United States are caused by the presence of dried wood ponds. Late wood can survive years after years and can survive a wide range of organic matter, including fabrics, drywalls and even floors. These are often brought home in pieces of furniture or clothing and stored for several months before they are identified. These are extremely difficult to remove without fumigation. There are several other common species of wood in the home that may require Fumigation. Some beetle species, especially the powder post beetle, feed on wood and can penetrate deep into the home's infrastructure, making them almost impossible to treat. In some extreme cases tents and fumigation have been used to deal with the infestation of a dangerous bed bug. Your pest control professional will give you more information about your property and the possibility of fumigation for your available options. Some home and business owners simply don’t want to fumigation up their home and in some cases professional inspections may be able to control the pest problem. Fumigation is certainly controversial due to the use of large amounts of deadly chemicals. Each pest company uses a different mixture of pesticides but the old standby for fumigation, methyl bromide, has been expelled from the industry due to its effects on the atmosphere. It’s important to remember that fumigation can kill pets, plants, and even contaminate open food in your home or structure. So it’s important to follow your exterminator’s advice in the letter before considering treatment. How does Fumigation work? Step 1: The treated area is covered with tarp (known as “tenting”) then all ventilation holes and slats are taped to make sure the fumigation chemicals are stuck inside. Step 2: After all the people and animals have left, the pesticide vapors are pumped into the tent structure where they enter the wood, furnishings and all elements of the structure to destroy hard-to-reach insects. Step 3: The chemicals are allowed to stand for a certain period of time, usually within 24-72 hours, then the area is de-fumigated and the tent is removed. Step 4: A pest control professional will manually inspect all areas of concern on the property to make sure the pest infestation is under control. Continuous follow-up spot treatment may be required. How Infestation Happens and Fumigation Happens In The Cargo? The haze of export cargo becomes extremely essential as there is a possibility of hidden nuisance in the cargo. Cargo infection can occur due to the following factors. (a) High humidity in cargo significantly affects the cargo. The nuisance develops rapidly during the voyage and when the cargo discharge reaches the port it is re-fumigated at the expense of the exporter or buyer. (b) It is always best to smoke before export to avoid huge fumigation costs and handling costs at the discharge port. Good sanitation and scientific storage methods need to be followed to keep cargo in good condition before export. (c) Fumigation operations are effective and a good alternative to any other method of pest control because the fumigant spreads in the smog process and spreads to all areas of infection where spray operations or other methods of pest control will be less effective. (d) Another important issue that needs attention is the treatment of packaging materials because obsolete packaging materials are prone to infection and become carriers for the introduction of new pests in other countries. Therefore, wooden packaging materials should be treated before export. There are two main types of fumigants, methyl bromide and phosphine. Finally, we can say that Fumigation is the better way to kill or remove the microorganism, pests or insects. This process is very fruitful and successful way.

8,Why We Need To Update Our Expectations Of The Workplace: The 7X3 Rule,business," The world has changed and so have the expectations of employees and the realities of today’s  workforce. There have been many studies, articles, and research over the years that well articulate the evolution of the workforce and how important it is for businesses and organizations to evolve along with it. Enter the COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 forced the world through a massive disruption to the norms of the workplace and forever changed the perceptions and expectations of the modern workforce. Many view these new expectations as something created by the pandemic. In small ways that is true. Expectations around heightened safety protocols with sanitization and flexibility in sick leave for testing and social distancing were new expectations that employers need to respond to with no real advanced warning. However, when it comes to the vast majority of the “new” expectations that employees are bringing to the workplace since the pandemic, most were not created by COVID-19. They are only amplified by it. The disruption of the work norms caused by COVID-19 had a number of effects felt by employees around the world. First, many employees were exposed for the first time to how challenging, stressful, and unreasonable their jobs actually were. •	These realizations came from being forced to stay home and being able to avoid the stresses of their job. They were able to spend more time with their families. They did not have to deal with the interpersonal conflicts they experienced everyday, and were not pushing their bodies and minds to their breaking point. •	Some people saw how good their life could be without the physical, mental, and emotional stress of their job and workplace. Second, many employees understood how inadequate their compensation and benefits were to meet their needs. •	Some workers were given a fresh perspective on how much stress and risk they had to deal with for a relatively low income. •	Many workers were exposed to the cost of time and money they were exposed to by commuting to the office every day. •	Perhaps most significantly, workers were exposed to how insufficient their employee benefits are. Third, many employees realized how much better their lives and work can be when they are given little flexibility and freedom. •	Workplaces saw comparable, if not improved, efficiency and employee experience when provided more flexible working conditions. •	Workplaces that allow and support continued freedoms, like remote working, saw higher productivity. These are only three realizations caused by the disruption of the norms of work. However, they are excellent examples of the new perspective that employees have when viewing their workplace. This new perspective plays a large part in what people are calling “The Great Resignation”. Employees now have higher expectations of their employers. If employers and workplaces are not meeting these expectations; some employees may quit, others became disengaged, and many will consider looking elsewhere. For employers, this means that you will have a much more challenging time recruiting, hiring, and retaining staff if you are not meeting the expectations of the workforce. Put simply, a major effect caused by COVID-19 is that people have taken a hard look at their lives and realized that they are dissatisfied with their jobs. As a result of this job dissatisfaction, employees are losing motivation, becoming disgruntled, exploring their options, and quitting their jobs. This reaction is not only understandable but fairly predictable. Employees were given the opportunity to see their lives and work without the daily stress and bias that comes from being in the middle of the situation. They saw the forest through the trees and were given a chance to reflect on their situation. This new perspective caused many to not return to their jobs, or refuse to put up with the factors of their jobs. Many employers and businesses saw this refusal to accept the factors of the job, that were the norm pre COVID-19 (such as the compensation and job security), as a desire not to work. There has been a lot of backlash from the businesses communities worldwide that employees do not want to work anymore and that the lockdowns spoiled people. The truth is, it’s not that most employees do not want to work, it is that they do not want to work for a business that is not treating them fairly or sufficiently providing them what they need to be successful. The reality is that workers expect their jobs to provide benefits, job security, working conditions, etc that are competitive for their region or industry. They except that the pay, safety, and wellness supports to sufficiently meet their needs. And they expect the policies, tasks, and compensations to be fair and equitable. In this new normal the workforce has the 3 expectations of: •	Competitive •	Sufficient •	Equitable These expectations are how the workforce assess the 7 factors of: •	Wellness •	Conditions •	Policies •	Compensation •	Job Security •	Safety •	Consistency When the 7 Factors are not properly addressed they cause Job Dissatisfaction, this effect we are experiencing that is causing this frustration in the workforce. The successful alignment that happens when the 7 Factors that cause dissatisfaction are addressed by the 3 Expectations is what is called The 7X3 Rule. This happens when a workplace makes the effort to address the factors like wages, safety, wellness, policies, etc. to make them competitive with comparable jobs in their region or sector, make them sufficient to accomplish their purpose and meet the needs of their employees, and equitable, fair, and accessible to everyone. This is how you will be able to change the workplace to resolve many of the issues facing our workforce. The 7X3 Rule is defined as when All 7 Dissatisfaction Factors of the Workplace need to be addressed according to the 3 Expectations of the Workforce. This is something that we need to start bringing into our common language, especially when we are talking about working conditions, the causes of employee turnover, and this new reality we find ourselves in. Employers. Take stalk. Are you meeting these expectations in your workplace? You need to make sure that the Wellness supports you have are meeting the needs of the employees. Are they getting the time they need to recharge and recover? Are the leaves and days off enough to actually support them? Or is it just that your wellness plan is mostly an annual company picnic and a treadmill in the breakroom? Are your Leave Policies encouraging employees to take the time off, or are there unspoken rules that punish them if they do? Do your Behaviour Policies actually resolve and deter harassment or do they just pacify complaints? Is your workplace actually safe for your employees? For many frontline workers mask mandates and vaccination enforcement has them now dealing with irate customers. Do they feel they are as safe or safer with your company compared to similar jobs? We all need to take a fresh look at the modern workplace, and the lens of The 7X3 Rule is a good place to start. Employees, in large part, truly want to work, and employers, in large part, truly want to allow them to do their best work. But the arrangement we have come to in the past is no longer good enough. The 7X3 Rule is how a workplace can begin to update how they understand this new normal and prepare their workplace to thrive in this new reality."
9,How To Setup High Converting PPC Ads,business," For those who are familiar with how PPC ads work, you will know that they are generally designed as a result of a campaign being launched using bid prices and key phrases. This means that they are targeted towards the demographic in question and as such are more likely to convert from a potential customer to a regular user. With all the benefits this has to offer, learning how to setup high converting PPC ads can seem like a daunting task but it's not difficult if you know what you're doing. The following steps will help you ensure that your site receives the best possible amount of traffic from your PPC ads and that your customers remain loyal and stick with your company. The first step to understanding how to setup high converting PPC ads is to take a look at the bid price you're going to be bidding on. It's important to set this price at a point above your cost-per-click (CPC) but below your cost-per-impression (CPM). If your ad is successful it will bring you a lot of traffic which will ultimately translate into increased revenue for your business.

How To Target The Potential Prospects Using PPC Ads Many people find themselves struggling with PPC advertising. This type of marketing can put you on a treadmill of failure if you are not careful. Yet if you pay close attention to the methods that are used for this type of advertising, you will be able to easily use PPC ads to your advantage and help you generate traffic to your website. You really should keep an open mind when it comes to PPC ads, though, because there are still some things that you need to learn to be successful with this form of marketing. First, it is important to understand that finding potential prospects is the key to making money with PPC ads. By finding these potential prospects - people who want to buy what you are selling - you will have struck gold. To get these people to go ahead and order what you are selling, you must present them with a viable product. With PPC ads, you have a couple of options available to you: you can either present the product as something free that they can obtain, or you can use direct marketing techniques to create interest in the product. Understanding how to make the most out of your ads is crucial to get the results that you desire. When you are trying to target people that are in your target market, you must understand what words and phrases are going to bring you the most results. This is why it is critical to choose keywords carefully, as the keywords that you use in your PPC ads are the very words and phrases that potential customers will be using to find your business. So if you do not carefully choose your keywords, it is likely that you will not be able to get the greatest amount of traffic to your site. One of the best ways to use keywords correctly is to choose them wisely. If you choose keywords that are too general, then your ads will not show up at all, and if you choose the wrong keywords, your ads may not bring in any traffic at all. Choosing keywords that are too specific will likely cause you to pay a lot of money for ads that are not bringing in any traffic. Another important factor when it comes to understanding how to target the potential prospects using PPC ads is to make sure that your ads are targeted. You will likely attract some people who are not in your target market because of the keywords that you choose. To attract more potential prospects, you need to make sure that your ad copy and your ads are relevant to what your potential customers are looking for. So for example, if you sell a laptop online, your ads should target people who are looking to buy a laptop and not just someone who may want to buy one but cannot right now because he or she lives in New York City. Another important thing to know when you learn how to target the potential prospects using PPC ads is that you should write your ads using the right words. You have to learn how to choose words that are specific to what your ad wants to convey about what you are selling. There are many great keyword tools out there that you can use to find out which words are the most searched for as well as how many searches each word receives. This will allow you to write your ads with the right keywords so that you will attract more potential prospects. Another good way to learn how to target potential prospects using PPC ads is to use blogs. Blogs are a great way to attract more attention to your ads because you can talk about your product in a little more detail. But you should be careful when choosing the blog that you use in your PPC campaign. One of the best things for your ads is if you choose a blog that has a large following, you will get a higher click-through rate on your ads. This will help you to generate more revenue for your business."
10,Common Mistakes Plastic Surgeons Make,business," The simplest of things become those that are overlooked the most frequently yet affect your bottom line more than you realize, so this blog post will cover 3 common mistakes plastic surgeons make in their practice. Mistakes in easy, day-to-day tasks can lead to confusion, chaos, and frustration throughout your office and hugely impact your plastic surgery practice. It’s easy to miss what’s not working when you are focused on your patients’ needs, as well as managing staff and performing surgeries. See if you are making any of these common mistakes plastic surgeons make then address them. So your practice and profits flow better. COMMON MISTAKES PLASTIC SURGEONS MAKE #1: NOT HAVING AN A-TEAM SUPPORTING YOU Surrounding yourself with an outstanding team may seem like a daunting task, but ultimately those working among you are vital to your success. You may need to evaluate your workplace and ask yourself; Are the people on your staff helping or hurting your practice? One of the most common mistakes plastic surgeons make is having the wrong team can easily make or break your practice. While working as a business and marketing consultant to cosmetic practices, I have seen a wide variety of behaviors that go unchecked and hurt your image. For example: •	Staff is charming to the surgeon and disagreeable to everyone else; •	You think the staff is following up, taking photos, asking for referrals, but you found out it’s not happening; •	The receptionist sends the patients to the internet to buy products since they’re cheaper than those sold in their office, and it goes on and on. If you have experienced any of these common scenarios, it may be clear that you do not have the right team in place. Team Work Duties Form If you have your doubts about who has your back and are questioning their value to your practice, try out the simple exercise of a “Daily Duties” form for one week. Beginning on Monday, the members of your team will write down every task they perform throughout the day and record the amount of time that it takes for them to complete. On Friday, they will submit the completed form to you. By evaluating these forms, you will be able to see who on your team values their time and work by thoroughly filling out their form.  It will also show you those who rush through the assignment and carelessly complete the form. You will also see which team members don’t complete it at all, and therefore do not value their work, or you. This exercise will give you a better idea of which staff members take their jobs seriously and care about the practice as a whole, as well as those who don’t. MISTAKE #2: Not using the resources you already have to attract more patients Let’s consider the value of just one of your patients and how they can grow your practice for you. On average, a typical cosmetic patient has approximately 200 people such as friends, family members, colleagues, neighbors, hairstylists, gym buddies, etc. in their circle of influence. Now imagine that your patient refers them to you, and in turn, these new patients refer those in their circle of influence and so on.  Your patient database and revenues would grow exponentially with the compounding effect. The way to get these referrals is to set up systems that happen automatically as part of your processes, so your patients know you value them and their referrals that grow your practice. Pre-Op and Post-Op Photos A great example of this process can be as easy as taking photos of your patients once they are healed and making them readily available to them so they can show off your work to their friends. In my book “Your Aesthetic Practice/What Your Patients are Saying,“ I asked patients about it, and here’s what they said: •	82% stated that they wanted their before/after photos •	76% stated that they would have shown them to others, if only they were made available to them While taking photos is easy, you must remember that it’s all in the presentation. The best time to provide a patient with their photos is at their post-op appointment. This is the time when they will be at their happiest and will be the most excited about their results. A handwritten note thanking them for their trust in you along with their photos can speak volumes! Be sure to include your name, telephone number, and website so their friends can contact you to book their own appointment to consult with you. This simple process can be used for both surgical and non-surgical procedures alike. Another one of the common mistakes plastic surgeons make is not taking advantage of the simple, yet the effective process is the use of gift certificates. So many practices offer them, but it seems to be an unspoken secret in your office. How do you change that? The best way to market your gift certificates is at checkout with a gorgeous display and customized gift bags. A sign that reads “Need a Quick Gift?” is sure to grab the attention of those standing with their wallets out and credit cards in hand. Not only does this increase your revenue for the day, but it also introduces a new patient to your practice. MISTAKE #3:  Not having a clear patient attraction plan in place Something to always remember is, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” By failing to plan how you acquire new patients, you are setting yourself up to lose would-be patients to your competition. Acquiring these new patients is so much more than just one email, one social media post, one Google ad. It requires a persistent plan that keeps your name in front of consumers looking for cosmetic rejuvenation. By keeping your name in front of your current patients, in addition to continuously reaching out to new prospective patients online, they are more likely to choose you. But in today’s noisy world, you need up to 31 points of contact to get someone’s attention. Basically, you need to be everywhere and use all marketing channels available that prospective cosmetic patients could be using. You need lots of poles in the pond working together. So, in addition to your Website, SEO and google ads, put together a plan that includes lots of other strategies such as: And, once you create your new patient attraction plan, be sure to assign tasks to each team member to ensure its executed. This way, you allow your staff to focus on practice-building in a fun and engaging way, so they feel more part of your success. For example, choose a theme for each month, as well as a marketing plan like this: January’s Theme – “Show Off a New You This Year” •	Google ads for Tummy Tuck and Mommy Makeover (Web Company) •	Website spotlights with videos explaining Tummy Tuck ad Mommy Makeover (Web Company) •	Email to Patient List with January tummy tuck special (assigned to Karen) •	Social Media Posts – 3x per week (Assigned to Sandy) •	In-house Signage •	Add more B/A Photos and testimonials to the Website (Assigned to Ken) •	Write a blog post (Assigned to Sophia) •	Text certain patients your tummy tuck special (Assigned to Karen) Now everyone on your team has clarity and focus for January. Just do that every month and see how much better your results are when the plan is clear. Once you fix these all-too-common mistakes plastic surgeons make that are seen throughout several cosmetic surgery offices, you will find that your practice is running more smoothly and effectively. If you could use some help fine-tuning your practice to run on all cylinders, let’s talk. I can show you how other successful practices handled the roadblocks in their way and are now set up to succeed."
11,Plastic Surgeons and Branding | How to Brand Cosmetic Surgery Practices,business," I am often asked about plastic surgeons and branding, so I wanted to weigh in on the question, “Do I need to “brand” me? Frankly, there’s no one right answer. There is only the right answer for you. What is Branding? Branding is the process of communicating the unique differentiator that sets you apart from your competition. It leaves a memorable impression on prospective patients and tells them what to expect from you when they do become a patient. Branding also increases the value of your practice, provides your staff with direction, and makes acquiring new cosmetic patients easier because they are attracted to the “persona” that gives them a certain perspective of you. Examples of plastic surgeons and branding techniques include the use of logos, website design, imagery, your advertising, customer service, your reputation… to name a few. But it’s also how your phones are answered, how your staff dresses and acts, how clean your bathroom is, and every other detail that tells patients what you value. PLASTIC SURGERY AND BRANDING EXERCISE To simplify your own branding, here’s an exercise to build your own successful brand: •	Define how you want to be perceived. Ask yourself, how do you want patients to describe their experience with you? •	Based on your answer, organize your practice based on that experience. •	Now communicate that experience with other prospective patients. •	And be consistent. This exercise will also help you determine your target market. Because if you are not liking the quality of patients you are seeing, your branding is off. Certain patients don’t just show up at your door by accident. You are doing something to attract them, so review your branding to “up-level” it. In my experience, here’s a more likely scenario that happens with your branding…. Plastic Surgeons and Branding You get a lot of calls from the sales reps for your local TV, radio stations, magazines, and billboard companies telling you to “increase your Branding and Name Recognition” by advertising with them. The contracts are usually for a year, and they can run hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. They show you the demographic charts of their audience and promise you celebrity status since you’ll be recognized throughout your community. You’re tempted because you believe you’ll be a lot busier if more people know about you, right? So, the question becomes, Is it Smart to Invest in “Name Recognition and Branding”? Maybe. Maybe not. Let’s dig deeper into plastic surgeons and branding. Let’s look at the making of a Brand. Branding is what makes prospective consumers feel a certain way about you and your services. It’s a multi-billion-dollar industry that caters to the big guys like Mercedes, Apple, and McDonald’s as you can see in these ads: The point of Branding is to produce entertaining, funny, or clever advertising (Although I don’t understand what they are trying to say in these ads.) Companies are spending a small fortune on media placement, so the ads are everywhere, and they hope that people will have a positive reaction to them. The issue is there is NO WAY to track results since these are “Name Recognition” ads. Ad agencies in New York make millions off of these big companies because they are rewarded for winning awards for being creative – NOT for bringing intangible results. Branding Cosmetic Surgery: Let’s look at the cosmetic surgery industry and see how they “brand” surgeons. My problem with this branding ad is that it’s so subtle you have to read/think/study it to figure out they are referring to cosmetic surgery! And here’s another problem: Branding ads like these NEVER have a measurable call to action, so there is no way to measure your return on investment. Before you spend another dime on this type of practice advertising, answer this question: Do you, as a plastic surgeon, NEED to be a household name? An important question to ask yourself when it comes to plastic surgeons and branding is, does EVERYBODY need to know you or just those who are interested in cosmetic surgery? How much is it worth to you to see your name and face in lights and have people say, “Hey, you look familiar”? (Be honest. If that’s what you want, that’s fine, but it will cost you.) Your brand as a surgeon defines what you stand for. It’s your values. It’s the emotions you evoke so prospective patients FEEL safe AND TRUST YOU. Branding is in the Details For you, branding is in the details. It’s the many factors that help prospective patients choose YOU over your competitors. Details like your website, your online reputation, your phones, staff, office and furniture, restroom cleanliness, and on and on. So, I highly recommend you first concentrate your branding efforts such as: •	5-Star Patient Reviews •	Excellent before/after photos •	Website design that is easy to navigate •	Friendly, warm staff who treat your patients like family •	A patient experience that is better than the one they get with your competitors This is much more important than being recognized by the public who would never even consider plastic surgery.

12,Convert More Consults with Risk Reversal Strategy,business," The risk reversal strategy is a proven strategy that makes it impossible for patients to say no. This might sound radical but hear me out before you tune me out. Make it impossible for patients to say no to you by using Nordstrom’s risk reversal strategy. If you buy anything at Nordstrom, you know that if anything goes wrong with it or you are unhappy in any way, they will take it back…no questions asked. Nordstrom’s guarantee is what built its iconic business. The confidence of knowing that they will take back anything is what sets consumers’ minds at ease buying from Nordstrom. And they are not the cheapest game in town, and they are not offering discounts at every turn. HOW TO USE RISK REVERSAL STRATEGY TO CONVERT MORE CONSULTS What consumers/cosmetic patients really want is to make a smart buying decision they are happy with. We all have “stuff” we bought and wished we hadn’t, or we felt pressured into, and now we’re stuck with it and live with regret. That makes consumers wary of doing it again and wasting money. This fear is huge in cosmetic rejuvenation. It’s a much bigger deal when your body is at stake, so cosmetic prospective patients are afraid to make a bad decision. They’re scared they will not get what they want and then regret it. So, they’re on the fence for years deciding if they should or shouldn’t move forward with plastic surgery, and then once they decide they should, now they must decide WHO to choose to perform the procedure. That’s why they are going on multiple consults and procrastinating. Understanding Your Consumer So, knowing that about consumers, it would behoove you to figure out how to calm their fears, so they choose you. The more you remove the risk (called risk reversal), the more consultations you will convert because you are lowering the hurdle of entry, which is fear, for the cosmetic patient. The best companies and marketers out there use risk reversal to make it easy for the consumer to buy. But transferring the risk from the patient’s shoulders to yours is a very touchy subject for plastic surgeons. Most surgeons think they will go broke if they offer some sort of guarantee, so hear me out. How to Guarantee Your Work Without Breaking the Bank Think about what you currently do when a patient comes back to you after a procedure and is livid and upset by the results they got. You, too, can see it’s not the optimal result, and this patient isn’t crazy, so don’t you do a touch-up? Or even go back in to perform a revision at no charge? Or, if it escalates, don’t you even refund them their money after they sign an agreement not to disparage you? So, if you would do it anyway, why not get credit for it and use that risk reversal to convert more consultations, especially when the patient is deciding which of you or your competitors to go with? Most plastic surgeons are scared to give guarantees because they think their patients will take advantage of them. Well, it will happen occasionally, but I guarantee you will close so many more consults that more than makes up for the 1 or 2 issues you may have. But most cosmetic patients are honest and ethical if you choose wisely. And those patients that take advantage of you, would have done the same thing even if you didn’t have a guarantee. By the way, you are not broadcasting this out to the world. You are only using it in the consultation with the patient who is on the fence and close to making a decision, but the fear factor is preventing them from saying yes. HERE ARE A FEW PARTICULARS ABOUT RISK REVERSAL: Take time to show your patients results they should expect. Walk them through it and carefully explain and educate them on the emotional and physical benefits you offer. Here is a sample script for your coordinator to say to the prospective patient: “Karen, Dr. Smith says you are a perfect candidate for this procedure. So, if you don’t look at yourself in the mirror and feel more confident and secure within 6 months after the procedure, just let me know so we can make it right and make you happy, even if Dr. Smith has to do a touch-up on the house. That’s how strongly we believe in the results you’ll get.” Since cosmetic results can take months and even up to one year for the final results, make sure the patient is aware of the time frame. Interestingly, the longer number of times you make your guarantee, the lower the number of refunds. The majority of patients get used to their look and move on with their life to focus on something else more pressing. When a practice begins assuming the risk for the patient it is not uncommon for them to see double or triple the number of scheduled surgeries. With those kinds of numbers, it makes the handful of people who take you up on your guarantee well worth it. You will have a whole lot more cosmetic patients use your services because of this unique feature. Look, if you are confident in your abilities like I know you are, and you are selecting patients that make sense, then they should be getting the results and outcomes they want to state your guarantee in the strongest possible, legally permissible terms. As prospective patients are weighing their options and comparing surgeons, think about the difference your guarantee will make in their minds. If you want to help propel uncertain patients “off the fence” this will do it. When you use this risk reversal strategy, the revenues you gain in booked surgeries will far surpass the revenues you will lose. I guarantee it.

13,Prevent Problem Patients [Checklist],business," “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” prevent problem patients. I discovered Ben Franklin coined this timeless phrase back in 1736 to remind Philadelphia citizens to remain vigilant about fire awareness and prevention. This advice works just as well today in our own industry. TIPS TO PREVENT PROBLEM PATIENTS AT YOUR PRACTICE A little precaution BEFORE a problem occurs is preferable to a lot of fixing it afterward. As a cosmetic surgeon, you get all the risks when dealing with a cosmetic patient. You hope/believe the prospective patient heard you when you say: “I can’t make it perfect, but I can make it a lot better.” The good news is most consumers make for great cosmetic patients. They have done a lot of research online and read/watch/heard about the good, the bad, and the ugly. They are friendly, reasonable, and realistic. But the few patients who aren’t can wreak havoc with your reputation and mental health. Plan Ahead to Prevent Problem Patients What can trip you up are your own emotions during the consultation process. The two major ones being ego and greed. It can be difficult to say no to prospective patients who want to give you money. That’s completely understandable. Same thing with your ego. It’s so much easier during the consultation process to ignore your gut telling you to beware than to say no. When interviewing surgeons about problem patients, they repeatedly say, “I knew there were red flags, but I thought I could manage them.” Most of the time you can, but why not set up a process to help you stay out of these sticky situations that come back to haunt you later? I recommend you get together with your team and review what you have discovered from experiencing problem patients. Looking back, what were the warning signs? Then develop your own pre-surgical red flags checklist. Below is an example to give you a good start: Red Flags Checklist Prevents Problem Patients •	Their significant other makes the appointments and schedules the surgery rather than the patient doing it herself •	Rude to staff •	Lying •	Demanding •	Self-centered •	Inflexible •	Whiny •	Bad-talking other surgeons •	Overdramatic •	Too emotional / Too unemotional •	Does not understand the procedure •	Repetitive behaviors •	On meds (Call their psychiatrist) •	Won’t take photos •	Won’t sign consent forms •	Vague about post-operative support •	Your staff has reservations •	You just don’t like the patient Make it protocol for you and your staff to go over this checklist during the consultation process. If you can check any of these boxes – BEWARE! Post-Op Problem Patients However, you can still end up with a post-op patient who is not happy. It happens. What’s most important is what you do about it that makes all the difference in how it plays out. So rather than wing it when it happens and emotions are high, set up guidelines now to deal with it in a rational way. Here are steps to help you work with and prevent problem patients: Listen to Your Patients You can’t solve a problem you don’t know you have, and you can’t assume anything. That’s why listening is critical. Give the patient your undivided attention; use their name and eye contact. Don’t rush. Listen to a patient’s complaints without interrupting. Sometimes, the patient just wants to be heard and understood. Then repeat back what they said to ensure you are both on the same page. This alone could diffuse them. It will also help you determine if this is a real issue or just a complaint the patient wants to share with you, get off their chest and move on. Acknowledge Avoid this temptation to be defensive. Don’t make excuses, don’t qualify, and don’t disparage a patient for speaking their mind. Just listen and learn. Offer a sincere apology for how they feel. Not for any wrongdoing on your part, but you are sorry they are not happy. Ask Questions Be curious and probe deeper with questions to figure out how serious the situation is. For example, “Karen, what’s prompting this? Did someone say something to you?” You are looking for the WHY they feel the way they do. Maybe they went back online to research their concerns and got themselves worked up from other patient stories. You just don’t know unless you ask. Another great question to ask to figure out where the patient’s head is at is, “Karen if you were me, what would you do?” This puts the patient in your shoes. They may surprise you and have a simple request that would satisfy them. Again, you just don’t know unless you ask. Do Something! Make it right! Don’t just promise to make it right actually take a proactive step in the right direction. Offer solutions such as cortisone shots, lymphatic massage, a touch-up in the office, comp your fees, or discount OR fees to go back into surgery. Then thank them for being reasonable and working with you to rectify the situation. Oftentimes, you can turn this problem patient into a raving fan by handling the situation with composure, assurance, and poise."
14,"Plastic Surgeon PR | So, You Want To Be Famous?",business," Do you ever wonder how or why you saw your colleague on The Doctors or in Vogue Magazine?  He seems to be everywhere, touting himself as the expert. Really? How does he do that?  How does he get to be portrayed as the expert and not you? That is because he invests in Plastic Surgeon PR marketing. Plastic Surgeon PR is a great vehicle to set you apart from your competitors and help convince the public that you are the market leader in your industry.  That gives you instant credibility that builds trust with prospective cosmetic patients, so it’s an important branding tool. Since traditional advertising is not working like it used to because the public is weary of being bombarded with promotion, PR overcomes the skepticism that viewers have for paid promotion, and it’s free!  Or is it? PR is generally not happening by accident. Savvy plastic surgeons are making it happen by turning to media professionals for help in getting the exposure they crave or doing it themselves. BEST WAYS FOR YOU TO GET YOUR OWN PLASTIC SURGEON PR: Hire a PR Agency This can run from $2,000- to $20,000+ per month to have a PR agency use their media contacts to get you exposure on popular media channels. It’s their connections you are paying for since they can make a call to the right people, and you can’t. It’s often a long-term contractual agreement with no guarantees, so choose carefully. Free PR Get involved with well-known hospitals, charities, and medical associations so you can piggyback off of their PR department efforts. Get to know their PR people and pitch their story ideas. They are always looking for content, so help them out, and they’ll help you out with free media coverage. Use your own platforms (blog, Youtube, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) to comment on what’s trending online. Visit sites like “What’s Trending“ or “Reddit” to discover hot topics. For example, when a popular celebrity has plastic surgery, you critique their results and make suggestions for improvements. Or, when the media is wondering what the celebrity did recently to change their look, you jump in with your professional opinion. While you’re at it, take advantage of every PR opportunity you are presented with. Take photos with celebrities at charity events, sporting events, or however they cross your path. The “transference of credibility” is at play and gives your brand a nice boost. Local PR Decide what your objectives are. What are you trying to accomplish and how much are you willing to spend to get your name in lights and is it worth it to you? If your objective is to attract new cosmetic patients, why not go local?  You have a much better chance of getting coverage at an affordable price (or free,) and the viewers, readers, and listeners are more apt to actually become a paying patient since they are nearby. Do-it-Yourself PR Strategies Be your own PR agency for free!  It takes time, patience, and creativity, but it can pay off. Here’s how you do it: Position Yourself as an Expert Prepare a media kit including your cv, photo, topics of expertise, and any other PR you’ve gotten as well as any research, writing, or speaking you’ve done in your field.  If you position yourself as an expert, the editors and producers may call on you when the need arises for professional comment. Build Third-Party Credibility Getting endorsements from unbiased third parties is a good indication to the media that you are credible and respected in your field.  Be sure you add accolades you’ve gotten from well-respected individuals or groups you’ve worked with. Sit on boards and participate in your specialty’s society. Pitch Ideas with Hooks It is NOT about you or your services.  Self-promotion is a huge turn-off.  Rather, it’s all about whether your story will interest the media channel’s audience – period. Examples of good pitches include: •	Offer a free demonstration, treatment, or report on a new procedure.  Not only does the media love to offer their audience a freebie, but you are also building a database of prospective new patients to follow up with. •	Be first to market with a new technical advancement, especially one that is the solution to a common problem (cellulite reduction and non-surgical procedures are uber-popular).  The company you buy the technology from should offer you marketing support and possibly PR. •	Tie in your cosmetic services with a current trend, fad, or news issue.  The point is to piggyback off that coverage.  For example, erase away summer sun damage without surgery and PRP facial rejuvenation. •	Use your ethnicity, gender, or rags to riches story if it differentiates you. Everyone loves a good story. •	Your pro bono work is a great human-interest story. Perhaps you offer tattoo removal for gang members ready to turn their lives around or help domestic violence victims get their life back, or repair cleft lips for children overseas. Upload Press Releases Online You must spread the word online so reporters, as well as Google, know you exist. Your press release is a one-page summation of a newsworthy story.  “For Immediate Release” is typed in the top left corner. Include a very catchy headline that sums up the information in the release. Then use another two or three paragraphs explaining your key points. Add as much emotion as you can. Be succinct. Now upload your press release to the numerous services available such as Newswire, PR News Wire, PR, and PR Web. Author Content for SEO Write your own book and/or self-publish by writing blog posts for your website and then turn them into interesting articles to post on distribution sites such as E-Zine Articles, Articles Base, and Article Biz. Now, if anyone were to google a cosmetic procedure you wrote about, or they googled your name, that article would appear in the search results and lead them to your website. Network With Your Patients Make it a point to get to know your patients. Before meeting them for the first time, have your staff check them out online to see what their online presence is like. They may be influencers with a huge following online and be willing to post about you. Or they may be a member of the media or know someone.   Let them know you would be interested in PR and see what happens. Shortcut PR A shortcut to PR is to pay for it. There are plenty of opportunities to pay for airtime or print space, so it’s worth a call to find out their rates and their audience demographics. For example, the airline magazines include a section about the best doctors. I call this “ego advertising” because the chances of someone flying on a plane, flipping through the airline magazine, seeing this page, calling you, flying to your office, and having surgery are very slim. However, it’s a great branding piece if you make the most of it by “growing legs” around it. So, you add this to your website, display it throughout your office, send out a press release, show it off on social and anywhere else you can highlight yourself as the best. You now have the tools to create Plastic Surgeon PR for yourself. It just takes money, time, connections, and/or creativity. Nobody said it was easy."
15,Plastic Surgery Marketing | Know Your Numbers,business," Know Your Numbers Here’s an interesting 2021 plastic surgery marketing trend that affects you… “There will be no more silver bullets everyone will have to optimize for marginal gains.” In the past, you could pick one or two main marketing channels (your silver bullets) and live off of them to get you the cosmetic patient leads you needed to run a successful practice. Not anymore. There is just too much noise in the world today. PLASTIC SURGERY MARKETING IN 2021 Look at the list I came up with within one minute, in no particular order, and I’m sure there are plenty more: •	Website Design •	Real Self •	Link-Building •	YouTube •	Practice Newsletter •	TV Ads or PR •	Radio Ads or PR •	Cable Ads or PR •	Public speaking •	Retargeting Banner Ads •	Direct mail •	Email •	Texting •	Patient Events •	Press Releases •	SEO •	PPC •	Articles •	Blog •	Directories •	Doctor Referrals •	Alliances •	Fundraisers •	Billboards •	Print Ads •	Banners •	Social Media Posting •	FB/IG/Linkedin Ads •	Chat Bot Crazy right? You will never have enough time, money, or energy to use all of these cosmetic patient marketing channels. But that’s not all. There are also too many technology choices that need to be considered carefully so you don’t end up with a coat-hanger 😉 And, not to pile on, but there are also too many generational differences since you may be catering to patients in their 20’s up to patients in their 70’s. So, what do you do?  How do you make sense out of all these variables, so you create your plastic surgery marketing plan and invest your resources wisely? Know Your Numbers The answers you are looking for are in your numbers. When you collect and review your data from your plastic surgery marketing efforts, you have a better picture of what is driving your success. But this cannot be anecdotal. Take the emotion out of it and look at real data that doesn’t lie. The fastest and easiest way is to follow your successes first. In other words, “follow the money.” There’s no need to get all fancy and go off on a tangent at this stage. Just review where your revenues are currently coming from and go back for more. Revenues by Procedure Start by running a report called, “Revenues by Procedure”. This will show you which of your procedures are more profitable and which should be re-evaluated since they don’t bring in the revenues worth the effort. Sometimes (most of the time), less is more is the way to go. Drop the busy work that is not bringing in the revenues so you can redirect your focus to the procedures that are. For example, this pie chart below shows this practice’s big hits are injectables, Coolsculpt, and facelifts. Good to know when they are considering their marketing plan. However, skincare is the loser at 1% of revenues. Yet, I watch so many practices put a ton of effort into this thanks to their skincare reps, but is that the best use of your resources given the data? Revenues by Referral Source Another great plastic surgery marketing report to pull is “Revenues by Referral Source.” This tells you how your patients hear about you. This data is crucial to know so you can allocate your time and money to those marketing channels that are directly attracting new patients to your practice. Again, this cannot be anecdotal. It’s too easy for your ego to trip you up here. You may love to see your name in lights but just be sure it’s bringing you results. However, the referral source is not so cut and dry in today’s technical age. What I mean is when you ask a prospective patient who calls your office how they heard about you, they will oftentimes say “the Internet or google”. However, as they get to know you better and open up, the answer can change to a girlfriend mentioned you, so they check out your Instagram and that led them to your website and that’s why they said the Internet. If that happens, just be sure you update your data for accuracy. As you can see from the pie chart below, this plastic surgery practice was about 50/50 Internet and relationships via current patients returning for more and referrals from patients and spas. Social media is only 1% of their revenues, and magazine ads were 0%. If I were consulting with them, I would recommend they take the magazine ad budget and reallocate it to investing in referrals instead – using The KiSS Club. I would also recommend they outsource the social media unless the surgeon gets serious about participating in the content. There are a lot more numbers to know but do you see how knowing just these two data points will give you such good intel to make better business decisions about where to invest your time and money on marketing certain procedures using certain marketing channels? Plastic Surgery Marketing Data Tracking Tools In order for you to accurately track data, there are lots of tools and technology available. Your plastic surgery marketing software is the control tower that collects all data. Please be sure you choose a CRM platform that is data-friendly when it comes to entering data and retrieving data. Because it doesn’t matter if you can input it if you can’t get it to come out in a format that tells you vital information. The good news with all of this technology at our fingertips is that it’s tracking all clicks and links, so get familiar with google and social media analytics. Phone calls and lead tracking platforms are also super helpful to track data. Or at least use google sheets to collect data that can be updated regularly by all parties involved. I will leave you with this motivating quote, “Money is Attracted to Clarity” so happy tracking!

16,How A Small Business Can Improve Their Credit Score And Get Funding Easily,business," The first steps to improve your credit score is understanding what it means. Your credit score is calculated based on five categories: payment history, debt levels, length of credit history, types of credit used, and new credit. A good credit score is of critical importance for small businesses relying on their financial reputation. Having a decent credit score gives you the financial flexibility to explore different options and gain the trust you need in the lending industry. Small businesses can increase their chances of getting funding or a bank loan by improving their credit score. Here are some vital business tips that can help increase your credit score and brighten the prospects of getting the funding your business deserves. It would also help to consult a professional funding company like Fundwise. Be Sure To Pay Your Bills on Time Paying bills on time is a simple yet effective method of improving business credit. Making timely and consistent payments strengthens your credit score. It improves your chances of a business loan. Try paying your bills on time, even if you’re paying the minimum amount. How A Good Credit Score Helps? A small business with a good credit score will find it easy to get funding, as banks are more likely to lend money and offer loans. Credit scores of 700+ indicate excellent credit history, and businesses with higher scores may have an easier time getting low interest rates on loans or lines of credit. Monitor Your Business Credit Monitoring your business credit report is necessary for effective credit score maintenance. You should make checking the score with the credit bureaus a routine practice and highlight information you consider doubtful or causes a significant drop in your rating. It is essential to address problems identified in the report and carry out proactive decision-making to avoid them in the future. Warning Signs You Need To Pay Attention To How do you know if your company is in trouble? Well, for starters, a significant warning sign is a high debt to equity ratio. Things like not having enough cash flow and still paying off debts, mean that bankruptcy might be looming over your head (unless some drastic changes happen relatively quickly). “Day’s sales outstanding” can help predict potential issues with the business. Lower your Credit Usage Lowering the credit utilization rate will help a small business get approved for loans. A company should aim to keep this rate below 30%. Use credit cards with a low interest rate (i.e., one that doesn’t charge an annual fee) instead of multiple ones at high rates. Ensure the total balances across three or more card accounts are less than 20% of your limit. Consider using balance transfer offers when opening new accounts if you are looking to consolidate debt. Fundwise helps small businesses get the funding they need by giving solid advice regarding their credit score. We make small business funding possible by helping you increase and improve your credit score, making you eligible for financial support from financial institutions such as banks."
17,Why Are Fire Doors Important?,business," You cannot overlook the significant role a fire door play in fire safety. Fire is a major hazard to any type of property – industrial, commercial, and residential. When it comes to safeguarding these areas, there is only so much a fire extinguisher can do. Fire doors are engineered safety devices, help to keep fires controlled in a specific to ensure the safety of the occupants of your commercial property or home, as well as essential documents, equipment, possessions, etc. Fire resistance tests and ratings offer you guidelines concerning fire safety issues. Their objective is to assess the assembly and durability of the material used to contain a fire within a specific area, including to care for structural integrity. A fire-rated door that is installed properly, along with fundamental ironmongery plays a major role in a building's reactive protection system.  A fire door can tolerate fires for a few hours, providing emergency services ample time to extinguish the fire and salvage your property. Besides their capability to bear up to fires and their extreme temperature, they are also tested independently for their resistant thresholds. If installed the wrong way or without unfitting hardware, you are putting occupants and property at risk. A fire door that is not fitted correctly may only endure approximately five minutes during a fire scenario.  For that reason, you should make sure that your fire door is compliant and have the correct rating. Fire resistances speak of the materials used or the construction namely the distinctive elements in a wall such as sheathing products, insulation, siding, etc. The following British Standards relating to the assessment of fire doors:  BS 476- 22: 1987 and BS EN 1634-1:2014 and determine a fire door rating such as FD30 or FD60. Often you will notice the letter ‘s’ after FD60 or FD30, for instance, FD30s. The ‘s’ indicated that the door has been fitted with smoke seals. When installing a fire-rated door or multiple at several exits and entry points in your building, you can give your residence or facility an all-embracing fire safety plan. When it comes to fire doors, there is more than one way you can benefit from them. They facilitate the efficient and fast evacuation of people in case of a fire emergency, limit the damage done to a property, help to constricting the fire to one place along with smoke and toxic gases emitted, and can safeguard your commercial or home not just from fires but also from potential treats and burglars as well. Even though fire doors make the most sense in a commercial or industrial facility, a lot of residential premises can benefit from them too.  To increase your fire protection plan, it is important to pick the ideal location or installation, one that offers the best protection without hampering a fast exit for instance exit and entrances that provide access to corridors, doorways that separate different buildings, exits that open to stairwells and elevator shafts, and between non-hazardous and hazardous spaces in factories. If you have been considering up upping your fire safety plan, then installing a fire door is the best approach. According to the Fire Safety Order, your fire safety equipment for example fire doors should be inspected and maintained regularly. Keep in mind that they are an important element of your building’s safety, aesthetics, and structure.  Appointing the correct company is a must if you want your fire doors to work well and having them inspected every six months by an FDIS inspector is important to ensure that they are maintained and still compliant."
18,Adapt and Adjust. Talent Retention Strategies in the Times of the Great Resignation,business," The phenomenon of people leaving their jobs or switching their positions in the last few months has been referred to as the “Great Resignation.” The pandemic is seen as a great accelerator of what would be in motion. Employees who were questioning their moves are now taking this more seriously and offering in their resignation letters. This trend has been a great inflection point in the job market, where the employees have so much power and have created the demand for higher turnover. The employees are taking more control of their lives and seeking new roles that they consider people-centered and have their interests at heart. Several studies have all indicated that the working population is thinking about a job change. A Microsoft survey says that 41% of workers are thinking about quitting their jobs (AON, 2021). A new Gallup study found that 48% of the American working population was actively searching for a job or new opportunities (Gandhi, 2021). Pandemic Pent up Demand Several factors are attributed to the Great Resignation. The pandemic era has forced many employees to re-evaluate their goals and establish what they want. Employees have had a chance to re-evaluate what is important for them. Knowing what they want and how to do it is an excellent opener for the great resignation. They plan out the risks of moving from one company to another while still keeping an eye on their career advancement. People are looking for new opportunities that will offer more flexibility than what they have at their current job. The pandemic also accelerated the demand for new areas of interest and technological developments. The prospect of remote work may have alienated some people who thrive on constant communication with their colleagues. Some may want to check off their ideas with their managers and communicate face to face. On the other hand, some employees embraced remote working and would like to continue with the flexibility be to be able to attend to other issues happening in their lives. Some may have found the opportunity to move to lower-cost locations. Employees wanting to quit are also driven by factors like burnout, financial concerns, mental health safety issues, craving more stability, or a greater need for work-life balance. Reversing the Cycle It is evident that employees have gained confidence and assessed their risks. They are seeking more control of their lives and searching for a life-work balance. The pandemic has been a point of inflection, consideration of the future, and for many employees, a reset button. As noted before, employee expectations are changing. Money as a reward is no longer an only motivator for retention. Higher rewards will not automatically translate into keeping the top talent. Employers, therefore, need to rethink and develop a redefined way to retain the talent workforce. According to Gandhi (2021), workers in all job categories, from customer-facing service roles to highly professional positions, are actively or passively job hunting at roughly the same rate. Unfortunately, most employees are not engaged or are actively disengaged, leading to lost productivity for the company. Management will need to define productivity more broadly and include more collaboration to drive up employee engagement. While redefining your employees’ learning and well-being curve, it is imperative to consider some strategies that you could implement to motivate and retain your employees. Engagement and Retention Strategies Here are some retention strategies that would fix workers’ disengagement. Use data efficiently and effectively. Examine what the factors that are driving and retention are. Engaged employees, struggling employees, cost to training and retain those employees. Identify opportunities in your company that will motivate your team. Some top talent may need reminding that the company is catering to their needs, whether monetary or otherwise, to give them a sense of purpose and security in their job. Find out what employees really think about your company. You may be offering them salaries that are commensurate with the industry standards, but their perceptions may differ. Employee recognition will make them feel part of the organization. Establish what they think and communicate clearly to the team (Lawton, 2020). Define your culture. Do the employees see transparency in the company? How is communication done? Do employees feel that they are cared for? What is the relationship between management and the employees? All these factors will highlight the culture of your organization and how you attract and retain talent. Communicate effectively. Communication breakdown may lead to workers performing poorly. It is crucial to change any perception of misunderstood employees by listening to them, sharing, and providing feedback. When they perceive that the communication lines are open, employees increase their trust levels. Organizational leadership ought to increase its efforts to support the workers. Is the company leadership and management out of touch with the workforce concerns? Are they offering options such as paid paternity leave or other employee perks? Reconsider remote working or a hybrid format of working. Many employees will welcome the opportunity to work from home whenever this option is available. Re-evaluate the value that the company is offering its employees. Expand your hiring scope to include hiring across geographies and different backgrounds. Expand the use of technology throughout the organization. Technology has been a critical driver to other areas of growth for companies. Assess the learning opportunities that are available in your organization. Increase the likelihood of your employees taking up new skills and upskilling to handle new challenges. Organization’s Opportunity for the Future Both the organization leadership and the employees should use this chance of the Great Resignation to strategize how they work, where they work, and how work fits into their lives. Because of the competition to retain the best talent, the whole work landscape will have shifted to a more inclusive human-centered work world. Organizations that take the lead in the shift will leap bounds in the future (KForce, 2021).  References AON. (2021, August 25). The Great Resignation? Retaining Talent in a Job-Hopping World.

19,network marketing,business," Choosing a Career in Network Marketing For Beginners The Network Marketing industry has become a billion-dollar industry. Many people believe that network marketing is not real. However, there are thousands of Network Marketing companies in existence today and most of them are quite legitimate. Network marketing, also known as pyramid selling or multi-level marketing is a proven sales strategy for the retail sale of goods or services where only the initial sales of the MLM business are derived from the sales of its recruits. It is not uncommon to hear of many Multi-Level Marketing companies that have been around for several decades now and still are surviving. So, what is it that makes some MLM companies survive and others not? Is it their sales recruiting system? For many years, the multi-level network marketing industry was able to attract a lot of distributors who were willing to join for a chance at earning a bigger income. Some even believed that it was the perfect business opportunity for beginners because they could earn without having to invest a lot of money. However, things changed when the negative public comments about pyramid schemes forced the industry to change their rules to ensure the safety of their distributors. These changes to the network marketing industry made the earning potential of a distributor much higher than what it was before. However, many network marketing companies still follow their old sales recruiting strategies which does not guarantee anyone a good income. This is why some people end up quitting their network marketing business before they are able to earn the income they aspire to. There are many reasons for this including bad compensation structures, unrealistic goals, ineffective training and not enough support from upline networks. One of the best training and support networks out there today for network marketing are the Internet entrepreneurs who use this business model as their main source of income. They have independent agents who are willing to teach them the ropes in order for them to earn their first income. The independent agents will also help the newbies by showing them the proper way of developing a downline. Once they feel confident enough to introduce the concept of business partners, salespeople, and distributors, the beginners can then take the plunge and try out their own products. The Internet entrepreneurs will not only give advice on how to promote their products but will also provide their downline with marketing techniques that are proven effective. The independent agents are also well trained to handle customer service problems that may arise. This type of business model works because instead of earning commissions from every sale, they receive commissions on the sale's value and not from the commission rate. This allows the newbie to build a better reputation and credibility among his peers in the network marketing industry. There are two types of commission structures that network marketing companies offer their members: multi-level and pyramid. If you are a beginner and aim to learn the ropes first before deciding which type of company to join, it would be best to look upon multi-level marketing companies. Here, each distributor earns a certain amount of money once a client has been reached. With the pyramid structure, a distributor is paid a higher commission for every member that he brings into the company. You must remember that your success as an independent agent or distributor does not solely depend on the income earned by your downlines. You need to do your part too. Look upon each distributor as someone who can help you earn a good income and not just someone who is simply there to earn a commission. Distributors who care about their teams will be those who will be able to help them achieve their goals. This is one secret that you need to keep in mind when deciding whether to pursue a career in network marketing."
20,Thinking About Adding a Laser to Your Practice? Renting Versus Owning,business," By Wm. Philip Werschler, MD; Kari Larson, MBA and Catherine Maley, MBA Author, “Your Aesthetic Practice” www.catherinemaley.com Ms. Maley is President and Senior Marketing Strategist, Cosmetic Image Marketing, San Francisco, California. Dr. Werschler is Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine/Dermatology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle. Ms. Larson is a Cosmetic Practice Development Specialist, Premier Practice Institute, San Diego, California. The authors report no actual or potential conflict of interest in relation to this article. With hundreds of laser models currently on the market, considering how to acquire this technology without breaking the bank is important. This column analyzes some important issues to consider before acquiring new laser equipment. Because laser technologies are produced and updated so frequently, making the wrong decision can result in poorly trained staff, outdated equipment, or equipment that requires costly upgrades and service. Many practitioners find themselves with laser equipment that sits in a storage room collecting dust because they do not know how to use the technology or market it to their patients. Why Rent? Opting to rent laser equipment can eliminate the aforementioned problems. Space is a precious commodity, and renting lasers can help turn those expensive doorstops into profit centers that enable your practice to stay on the cutting edge of today’s medical advances. Additionally, when renting lasers the twin burdens of maintenance and obsolescence are off-loaded from the practice. All preventative maintenance and repairs become the responsibility of the rental agency, and upgrades or replacement with newer technology is done on a regular basis. Renting a laser provides low-barrier entry into the laser market; you are essentially outsourcing laser services in your practice. The practitioner schedules the patients and the laser collects the fees from the patients and pays the rental company a contracted rate. A rental company will supply a certified technician to operate the rental laser, as well as a modern laser system with a complete line of accessories. In addition, rental companies provide in-service education and certification programs for office staff. Because a certified technician is on-site to oversee the proper use of the laser, the physician’s liability is reduced by making sure all safety measures meet American National Standards Institute requirements. This also decreases staff salary overhead, as the rental company pays the technician directly. Renting provides access to highly advanced laser equipment only when you need it without the capital expenditure, financial exposure, or risk of equipment obsolescence involved in purchasing. In addition, liability risks, maintenance issues, and concerns about either using the equipment too much or too little are eliminated. Why Purchase? Although renting equipment offers some advantages, it also reduces your potential income from the laser because the rental fee affects your profit margin. Rental costs vary greatly, commonly ranging from a flat rate of $800 to $1,200 for a half-day; $1,000 to $2,000 for a full day; or a percentage of the total daily revenue with no initial cash outlay. The rental fee includes the laser equipment and the certified technician. Rental companies can also address liability issues, depending on your insurance plan, to ensure coverage. Because of the expense associated with renting a laser, the incremental cost of doing business on a given day is increased, as you will need to treat a certain number of patients just to break even. Another disadvantage to renting is that the laser you get may not be in top condition and may show considerable wear because it is continually being moved from office to office. Malfunctioning equipment causes scheduling problems and dissatisfied patients. Although renting has its advantages, it is not a viable long-term option if your goal is to expand your aesthetic practice. A primary benefit of owning a laser is the profit margin. Fillers and toxins are an expense for the physician each time a patient is treated, but this is not the case with lasers. Purchasing a laser requires a substantial initial expenditure and some minimal recurring costs such as the maintenance fee or service contract and disposables such as cryogen. Although the initial cost of purchasing a laser can be somewhat of a deterrent, the long-term benefits generally outweigh the start-up costs. Furthermore, various options are available when purchasing a laser such as leasing with an option to buy. Owning a laser gives you the advantage of having the technology available at all times for your patients’ convenience. The ability to offer aesthetic services at the convenience of your patients can easily increase revenue by 20% to 30%. If you can only offer laser treatments on certain days (ie, when the rental equipment is in your office), you are sacrificing potential income. The aesthetic patient can be demanding and may not be willing to wait. Thus, by not owning the equipment, you risk losing your patients to competitors who can offer appointment times that fit their schedules. Upon purchase, laser companies also provide equipment training and certification for the physician and office staff, as well as marketing tools to help build a laser practice. Owning a laser and operating it regularly allows the physician and office staff to become familiar with the equipment and proficient in its use. Maintenance Regardless of whether you own or rent your laser equipment, maintenance is a consideration. When laser equipment breaks down, the practice is disrupted. Lasers will either need to be sent for repair or the technician will need to come to the office. This means that appointments must be rescheduled, creating an inconvenience for patients and office staff. Most maintenance issues can be resolved within 24 to72 hours. If a laser is purchased, a maintenance contract also should be purchased. Periodic maintenance contracts provide scheduled maintenance for the laser and also can provide warrant-type coverage for unexpected breakdowns. Maintenance contracts range from $1,000 to $10,000 per year. However, if the laser is generating $50,000 to $100,000 per year, the cost is relatively small compared to the revenue generated. When renting a laser, maintenance is included in the contracted fee. Although the rental company is required to repair the laser, the breakdown is still inconvenient to your patients and office staff. Furthermore, rented lasers are more likely to malfunction because of excessive transportation, wear and tear, and multiple operators. Conclusion Before deciding whether to rent or purchase laser equipment, consider the goals of your practice. Are you providing laser services to expand the aesthetic side of your practice and using lasers as the loss leader, or are you merely offering an additional service to your patients? If you are new to the aesthetic market and would like to test the waters before you jump in, renting is a good opportunity. It allows you to try different systems to better understand the technologies and determine which would work best for your practice. Distinguishing between the various lasers and their capabilities can be confusing; renting allows you to evaluate the equipment before buying. It also gives you the opportunity to build up your aesthetic patient base without the pressure of a monthly lease payment. The transition from renting to purchasing should occur when the revenue generated exceeds the cost of ownership. Typically, a $100,000 laser will range from $2,100 to $3,000 per month depending on the term of the lease. If you are only renting one day per month, you are a good rental candidate; however, if you are renting 2 to 3 days per month, you should consider purchasing."

1,How to Design a Killer Plastic Surgery Ad that Gets a Response,business," As a plastic surgeon, if you don’t know how to design a killer plastic surgery ad that gets a response, you end up feeling like you’re throwing your money away on cosmetic surgery advertising that just doesn’t work! Oftentimes, you knew it wasn’t working, but you kept running your ad anyway, hoping that the repetition would finally kick in and prospective cosmetic patients would call you? And, remember how the advertising sales representative kept insisting on the need for repetition and patience? The growing competition has increased aesthetic advertising a lot. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons, statistics show that in just one decade cosmetic surgery advertising has increased by 2000%! That means you need to think more strategically about your plastic surgery advertising efforts.  You will have to target your audience and appeal to them in a way that separates you from all the other plastic surgeons. It is difficult to write plastic surgery advertising that gets your telephone to ring, and many variables go into the making of an effective direct-response ad. Do you currently copy what you see in the ‘social’ magazines or the newspapers in your community where the content is often no more than a photograph of a pretty girl with a list of the services you offer? Or perhaps you use a publication’s graphics department where ‘creative’ people design an ad for you and then hope for the best? Well – no more.  Now is the time to reconsider your cosmetic surgery advertising before investing another dime in it. Because once you know how to design a killer plastic surgery ad that gets a response, you see why your current advertising is not working for you. PLASTIC SURGERY ADVERTISING OBJECTIVES What are you expecting your plastic surgery advertising to accomplish? Are you looking for name recognition to build awareness of your services among prospective patients? Or reinforce your brand image, remembering that every ad is a building block for your brand?  While all of that is nice, your true objective is to get the prospective patient to contact you – period. You will need to commit to advertising and do what it takes to get a good response. If you play it safe, you will get safe results but is that what you want? What you really want is for your plastic surgery ads to be effective and provide a return on your investment.  That means you need to think creatively.  You need to consider how you can tell your target audience what they want to hear and then give them a reason to respond to you now. ELEMENTS OF A GOOD PLASTIC SURGERY AD There is no one way to write a great ad.  It takes an educated guess and then testing and tracking to see if it is working.  Changing just one element in your ad can change its response, so try different things and if it doesn’t work quickly, try something else. However, every one of your plastic surgery ads needs to contain the following: Tense The most successful cosmetic surgery ads are written in the second person, using the word “you” because every reader is asking themselves the same question, “What’s In It for Me?” so be sure to tell them by spelling out the benefits they will receive. Headline Your headline is the most important element. The best headlines promise the reader a benefit.  Also, specifics get better readership than generalities. By the way, people read the headline five times more than they read the body, so be sure yours is eye-catching and memorable. An example would be, “You Could Look 10 Years Younger – Tomorrow!” Graphics Research has shown that cosmetic surgery advertising showing before and after photographs had a better response than ads that didn’t show any.  Your ad should show the end result of using your services. And use photos that depict your preferred patient target.  So, if you are attempting to attract the younger girl for liposuction, be sure to use that age in the photo.  And you’ll be viewed as more credible when you use your own patients in your cosmetic surgery advertising and tell your readers it’s an “actual patient” rather than use a model. Copy You cannot bore people into using your plastic surgery services; you can only interest them. Tell the readers what your services will do for them and tell them by using specifics. Here are some ideas: –  Testimonials make copy more credible since readers find the endorsements of your patients more persuasive. It’s always more compelling when a patient tells another patient how great you are (rather than you tell them how great you are.) –  There is a saying that says, “You Sell More When You Tell More.” This is called marketing through education, and prospective cosmetic surgery patients are thirsty for information about procedures they are interested in.  So, if you are writing a long copy, use bold subheads that state the benefit then explain it in more detail in the following paragraph. –  Try a believable ‘how to’ statement – “How You Can Look 10 Years Younger …” –  Use power words such as “Introducing,” “Announcing,” and “Free” – still the most powerful word in the advertising vocabulary –  Add action words such as “Discover,” “Learn,” and “Enjoy.” –  Ask a question to pique the readers’ curiosity – “Do You Think This Woman Had a Face Lift?” –  Use your name in the headline to strengthen your brand and obtain additional name recognition – “Do You Think Dr. Smith Performed a Face Lift on this Patient?” DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH YOUR PLASTIC SURGERY ADVERTISING Think outside the box. In advertising, you need to rise above the clutter.  Try something different: – Produce your own DVD.  Have a professionally produced DVD made of you, your staff, and your office. Offer a Free DVD in your advertising to identify people interested in cosmetic surgery. – Provide a toll-free number with a recording explaining some of your highlights and inviting them to leave their name and address so that you can send them a free DVD. That gives you enough information to follow up with them later. – Patients want information, so offer them a special report on the details of a procedure.  Perhaps the emotional roller coaster of a facelift before, during, and after surgery. Have one of your patients keep a diary and take photos every day to chart their recovery.  Prepare a report you can mail to the prospective patient and then follow up with them later. – Design your ad to look like a newspaper editorial. This format allows you room to explain a procedure in detail and can pass for a feature story, a health column, or a human interest story that involves a patient and their before and after photos. – Use a local celebrity or personality to tell their own story about how your services have improved their lives. – Advertise your participation in a local fundraiser to show your interest in helping your community in a selfless way. – Invite your readers to participate in a study or an educational event. Special Offer The point of the special offer is to get the readers to raise their hands to say they are interested.  The offer is the single element in your plastic surgery advertising that gets your reader to stop, notice and act now rather than wait until tomorrow – or never.  You need them to respond to you now.  Here are some ideas: – Make your offer irresistible. Offer a free gift when, for example, they schedule a signature facial from your Aesthetician – Announce if they register for your online newsletter, they receive a $20 Off coupon for retail products you carry – Offer a complimentary computer imaging or skin analysis session so the prospective patient can see herself, her concerns, and the possibilities for improvement – Offer a simple report that explains the various wrinkle fillers available so the reader can make an informed decision Expiration Date It’s imperative to include an expiration date in an offer.  You want to instill a sense of urgency, so they act right now rather than wait.  Although they have good intentions, life gets in the way, and you don’t want this opportunity to slip by. Lastly, be sure to offer multiple ways for them to contact you – by mail, email, telephone, text, or direct messaging from social media. While they may not be ready to schedule the consultation with you just yet, they would like a less intimidating way to learn more, so give it to them in the way they are most comfortable with. And remember, the patient that responds to your plastic surgery advertising is golden.  Nurture that new relationship with ongoing communications so the patient bonds with you.  Your dialogue with them should help build a bond so when they are ready; they call you – and only you! So now that you know how to design a killer plastic surgery ad that gets a response, review your current advertising efforts, and make the needed changes to get great results."
2,How Do You Follow Up After the Patient Consultation?,business," How do you follow up after the patient consultation? Or, don’t you bother? You may be under the belief that once a prospective plastic surgery patient leaves your office without booking the procedure you and your office just spent an hour talking about, all is lost.  You may be assuming they are a lost cause, but is that true? Not necessarily…. There are all sorts of reasons the patient didn’t say yes at their consultation. Maybe they didn’t agree with your recommendation. Maybe they got sticker shock. Maybe they chickened out or a whole host of other reasons you’ll never know about if you don’t follow up. Patients today can be fickle consumers who shop around.  There is a very good chance they visited you as well as several of your competitors, so they feel as if they did their due diligence to make an educated decision based on comparison shopping. But maybe that left them confused as to who to pick, so they are stuck. So now they go back to procrastinating because of their uncertainty. On the other hand, let’s say you did everything right, and now you are stuck because you don’t know how or even if you should follow up for fear of looking as if you are chasing the patient. I always find that comical because you should much more afraid of losing that patient to your competitor. The biggest reason you don’t follow up is because you don’t know how. And that uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. Instead, use these tactics to follow up professionally and close the procedure: •	Send a handwritten note to the prospective patient immediately.  Express how much you and your staff enjoyed meeting them and that Sara, your coordinator, will be following up on Friday if you don’t hear back sooner; •	Now be sure Sara calls back on Friday to check in and attempt to close the procedure by saying you still have surgical dates available this month or she’ll have to wait until next month; •	Have your patient coordinator call the patient with an important development that just came up;  i.e., CareCredit is offering a new 0% financing program or there’s been a surgery rescheduled, so if they can book now, they can save $500. The point is to make it compelling. •	Lastly, mail/email them a current article you wrote, or found on the Internet talking about the very procedure they are interested in and, again, ask for a decision. And, if none of that works, simply add them to your database so they can receive your invitations, newsletters, and email blasts because you just never know when they are ready for you.

4,10 Plastic Surgery Marketing Tips,business," Introduction You cannot be successful in the plastic surgery industry without a steady stream of plastic surgery patients coming to you, so below are 10 plastic surgery marketing tips to help keep a steady stream of cash-paying patients coming to you. But, first, a little background. The female plastic surgery patients’ wants, needs, and concerns are complex and ever-changing. Rather than a goldmine, it can be more like a minefield to understand these patients and why they chose you over all the others, stay loyal to you and refer their friends to you. You Are in an Enviable Position. Here is the good news. You cater to a very hungry market – the plastic surgery patient who wants to look and feel good and will invest their time, money, and effort to do so. Think about it. The patient who cares about their appearance has a built-in need now and for years to come because if they care today how they look, they are really going to care as the aging process takes an even bigger toll. So, putting in the effort up front now to attract these plastic surgery patients to your practice and nurturing those relationships will prompt them to return again and again for procedures, treatments, and products to help them look and feel good for a lifetime. The tips below will help: 10 PLASTIC SURGERY MARKETING TIPS TO GROW A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR COSMETIC PRACTICE: Tip #1: Target Higher-Value Cosmetic Patients In today’s world of surgical and non-surgical technologies, everybody is a prospective patient. Ask anyone what they would change about their appearance if there were no money or time issues, and I guarantee 90% of them will give you an answer. However, you will run out of time, money, and energy to attract everyone to your practice. Instead, identify who your most profitable patients are and then focus your efforts on them. For example, females still make up 85% of the market. So I would start there. Then decide which age group you like to work with and which procedures are your favorite. It’s much more effective to target certain groups of patients than it is to market to everyone because that will make you “The Jack of All Trades and Master of None.” Tip #2: Understand the Decision-Making Process of a Plastic Surgery Patient Put yourself in your patients’ shoes. Imagine how difficult this decision is when you consider how many posts, directories, advertisements, banners, social posts, and YouTube videos these prospective patients see, read, watch and talk over with their friends. It’s mind-boggling to not only choose the procedure you want but who should perform it. Help your patients make a good decision by assuring them with tons of social proof. Cosmetic Patients need reassurance they will get a great result and have no regrets. They get that reassurance through your before/after photos, online reviews, and patient testimonials, so have a process in place to collect that social proof. MarketingTip #3: Make the Aesthetic Patient Feel Acknowledged The plastic surgery industry is all about emotions. The patients you cater to have something about their appearance that is making them feel uncomfortable about themselves. That hurts their confidence and self-esteem, which then affects the quality of their lives. It takes empathy and compassion to acknowledge and understand your patients’ concerns. So they feel heard and understood. The more comfortable you can make your cosmetic patients feel, the more likely they are to connect with you, open up and say yes to you. Tip #4: Increase Revenues-Per-Patient You are leaving money on the table if your patients don’t realize everything you offer. So often, your patients see you for one procedure but go elsewhere for their other cosmetic rejuvenation needs. It’s typically because they didn’t even realize you offered more. Don’t make that mistake. Be sure you have lots of tasteful in-house signage such as a menu of services listing ALL of your surgical and non-surgical procedures and treatments, so you never hear, “I didn’t know you did that!” Tip #5: Stop Ignoring Your Current Patients The #1 reason cosmetic patients leave your practice is not because of a bad result. And, it’s probably not because they didn’t like you and your staff. It’s because of your indifference. The reality is they did not stop wanting cosmetic rejuvenation. They just stopped wanted it from you because you’ve been ignoring them. And your competitors have been courting them, so they went to them instead. It takes so little effort to keep in touch with patients who already know, like, and trust you. Be sure your marketing plan includes communications with your current patients. So they know you care. Tip #6: Encourage Referrals Word of mouth referrals has always and will continue to be the lifeblood of plastic surgery practice. It doesn’t get any better when a trusted friend boasts about their results and how great you are, so don’t leave that to chance. Remind your patients you appreciate them referring your friends to you. And when they do, make a big deal out of it by sending them a thank you note with a gift card showing your appreciation. Tip #7: Reactivate Your Lost Patients It’s always faster, cheaper, and easier to reconnect with patients who have visited you before than it is to attract total strangers to your practice. Be strategic when reaching out, but also be thoughtful. Frankly, these patients may have moved on because they didn’t care for the experience they had with you, or maybe they left you for a cheaper price elsewhere but had a bad result and are too embarrassed to return. So reach out to them in a heartfelt way. Ask them if you did something wrong because you want to make it better. Include a gift card to welcome them back and then hang on to them this time! Tip #8: Create a WOW Patient Experience Our industry is all about the relationship the patient “feels” they have with you. In my book, “Your Aesthetic Practice: What Your Patients Are Saying,” I asked cosmetic patients why they chose you versus your competitors, and the answer is always the same…they felt more of a connection with you and your staff than they did with the others. Please be sure every interaction with patients, whether on the phone or in-person is a good one. The goal is to make them feel comfortable during every step of the process. Tip #9: Implement a Cosmetic Patient Loyalty Program Everyone knows it’s cheaper to retain a cash-paying patient than it is to find a new one. The easiest way to make that happen is to implement a loyalty program that puts “golden handcuffs” on your patients, so they return, refer and review. But it’s got to be easy for the staff to track and compelling for the patient to use. For example, The KISS Rewards Club is a platform that tracks everything for you, but it also includes the ongoing marketing efforts it takes to keep a loyalty program alive. Tip #10: Build Your Credibility Through Strategic Alliances Third-party endorsements are powerful. Someone else who is credible and singing your praises to their own database of patients, customers, or clients is the most effective advertisement. It’s called “transference of credibility.” If someone has a following of ardent fans and boasts about you to them, they transfer the credibility they have for that person to you. Who do you know who has a following? Possibilities include:  non-competing physicians and cosmetic dentists, salon owners, retail shop owners, social media influencers, and local personalities. Conclusion Please use these 10 plastic surgery marketing tips to grow. Plastic surgeons today must use their advertising budget to proportionately attract new cosmetic patients to the practice and then spend the rest nurturing those same patients, so they return, refer and review. That’s smart because cosmetic patients have endless needs you can address for years to come, and so do their friends."
5,Build a Successful Cosmetic Practice One Patient at a Time,business," Build a Successful Cosmetic Practice One Patient at a Time To Set Yourself Up For Success No Matter What Happens Down the Road. You build a successful practice, one patient at a time. You really do. It’s a slow and steady growth over years rather than instant gratification. Every single encounter with a prospective patient is vital to your success and the growth of your practice. Let’s take a look at the lifetime of one of your prospective patients: Case Study of One Patient Named Sue A friend tells a friend about you. Her name is Sue. Sue is 36 and concerned about her sun damage. She’s got wrinkles around her eyes and brown spots on her face. Sue makes an appointment with you. Your appointment with Sue goes well. During the consultation, you find out that Sue works for a large financial institution downtown, and she comes from a big family. You treat Sue with her first laser treatment and then introduce her to Nancy, your skincare consultant, who sells Sue sunblock and a nighttime moisturizer. Your receptionist rings up Sue’s order and books her 2nd laser treatment. Sue has dinner with friends that evening and mentions her treatment and products. The friends are curious and will watch Sue’s results. Sue has now been in four times and is very friendly with you and your staff. Since she is comfortable with you and trusts you, she also wants Botox which you inject in her crow’s feet and glabellar lines. At work, Sue is getting compliments on her clearer-looking skin and tells her co-workers about you. Sue attends a family reunion, and her sisters and Mother want to know what she’s been doing since she looks so great. Sue tells them about you. The following week, your office books consultations with two of Sue’s co-workers and with one of Sue’s sisters and Mother who want to come in together. Sue’s co-workers get Botox, and one of them signs up for the same laser treatments Sue is having. One of Sue’s friends also books a consultation. You send Sue a thank you note with business cards. And that reminds her to give your number to another friend. Sue’s sister buys a complete product line and books a liposuction procedure. Sue’s Mother also buys products and books a bleph. Sue attends her monthly business women’s luncheon where, again, people commented on her clear skin and, again, she told them about you. One of the ladies asks if you would be willing to talk to the entire group at next month’s luncheon. Sue says she will ask you. Sue visits you for her last laser treatment and wants a little wrinkle filler in her nasal labial folds as well as plumper lips. She also asks you if you would speak to her women’s group next month. The attendance will be 60-80 women. You say yes! At Sue’s women’s business lunch, your staff passes out your practice brochure and business card, as well as your latest newsletter with a special promotion on Botox. Your talk goes well, and you show many before/after photos from the simplest skincare to full surgical procedures. You are lightly funny, connect with the women, and they ask you so many questions, you have to cut them off and offer them a complimentary consultation to discuss their personal concerns. That week, you receive more than 12 telephone calls from Sue’s business group. Your receptionist books 7 consultations. One of the attendees is a reporter and wants to interview you for your local newspaper. Another of the attendees happens to work at the local TV station and wants to talk with you about participating on a panel of experts at their upcoming health event that is attended by more than 3,000 people and videotaped and shown on TV as well as their Website. Another attendee owns two exclusive spas in your area and wants you to participate in their upcoming gala event to raise money for breast cancer. It is attended by 1,000 prominent community leaders (and the socialite, fundraising wives), the media is there and you can provide a gift basket for the silent auction as well as attend the event to network with the other powerful people in your community. Sue visits her hairstylist for a trim and color. Sue’s stylist comments on how great she looks, so they discuss you and cosmetic enhancement. Sue’s stylist wants to meet you and perhaps display your business cards in her salon so she can refer her clients to you since they ask her about this “stuff” a lot. Sue will bring your cards and your practice brochure to her stylist at her next appointment. Fast forward ten years – Sue has since married and has two children. She returns to you for post-partum rejuvenation and books a tummy tuck, breast lift, and bleph. You keep in touch with Sue over the years with bi-annual newsletters, email messages with special promotions on products, and skincare treatments, annual open houses, invitations to in-house seminars to learn what’s new as well as personalized thank you notes/complimentary skincare treatments for her referrals throughout the years. Fast forward another ten years – Sue’s children are grown and out of the house. Sue has been running a home business but is ready to enter the workforce again, but it’s competitive, and she wants to look and feel her best. She returns to you, yet again, for facial rejuvenation and books a face/neck lift and liposuction. And, so on and so on and so on…. So, in Sue’s lifetime, she has been worth more than $40,000 to you personally and another $90,000 in untold referrals to your practice. The above patient scenario speaks for itself. The aesthetic patient that feels bonded to you, your staff, and your practice will become your walking/talking testimonial to people they come in contact with throughout their day and throughout their lifetime. These patients are your practice advocates and should be treated like gold. Don’t take them for granted. Acknowledge and appreciate them for what they are – your cheerleaders who keep coming back to you again and again and bring their friends, family, and colleagues. That’s how you build a successful cosmetic practice one patient at a time.

6,It Takes a Marketing Mix to Grow a Plastic Surgery Practice,business," Successful plastic surgeons know it takes a marketing mix to grow a plastic surgery practice for lots of reasons. The big one being the demise of controlled mass media. Consumers are no longer held captive by a select few TV channels, radio shows, and newspapers who owned the public’s attention. Thanks to the Internet, you can now get your news anywhere you want, and you control who and what you listen to and watch. As a solo plastic surgeon, you can use that to your advantage and capture the attention of prospective plastic surgery patients. You do that by starting your own media channels to build a name for yourself with a select group of consumers. That is powerful. You can become a celebrity in your own right and capture an audience that is interested in your cosmetic services. Keep in mind - you don’t need everyone to know you….just those who want your services. However, the flip side is that all plastic surgeons have the same opportunity to build a name for themselves on these various medical platforms. So, it takes an enormous amount of time and effort to do that effectively, so you stand out as the obvious choice when consumers are looking for a cosmetic rejuvenation provider. Here are strategies to help… MARKETING CHANNELS PLASTIC SURGEONS SHOULD USE So many marketing channels exist for you to use when attracting more cosmetic patients. However, no one method works all the time for all prospective patients.  Therefore, you need to develop the right marketing mix, which is defined as the methods you use to promote your services and products. This consists of using different long- and short-term messages and avenues until you get the results you’re looking for. Here is a sampling of those marketing methods to choose from: Website Design SEO PPC Articles Blog Directories Physician Referrals Alliances Fundraisers Billboards Print Ads Instagram Posts & Stories Facebook Posts & Ads Text Press Releases RealSelf Link Building YouTube Newsletter TV Ads Radio Ads PR Public Speaking Retargeting Ads Banner Ads Direct Mail Email Patient Events and much more. Isn’t that crazy? Because you have so many choices, you’ll go broke trying to be everywhere so be strategic. DEFINING YOUR PREFERRED PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT Marketing your aesthetic practice starts with defining your preferred patients. You then have to be where they are consistently so that when they’re ready for cosmetic enhancements, they think of you—not your competitor. When it comes to attracting the best patients, keep in mind the importance of target marketing. You’ve probably heard the saying, “You can’t be everything to everybody.” There’s great truth to that. So cater to the group you consider your perfect patients. Learn their demographics and needs. This is important because only a certain percentage of the population will purchase cosmetic enhancement procedures, products, or treatments. By promoting your marketing efforts to the right niche market, you’ll be more productive and profitable. You won’t waste your effort, time, or money by throwing out your message to just anyone. PERSONALIZED MESSAGING Marketing strategies are also becoming more individually oriented. Using a sophisticated software program, practices can develop a database that allows them to individually approach prospective and existing patients. This approach provides a solution to a specific concern they may have and relays that information in the format the patient wants to receive that information. An example is a cosmetic patient who has had a wrinkle filler treatment from you and who has agreed to receive email messages from your office, so you send his/her your e-newsletter telling them about the latest FDA-approved wrinkle filler that lasts longer. Successful practices realize relationship marketing is much more important than transactional marketing. Therefore, keeping current patients is more important and cheaper than trying to attract new patients. Long-term strategies build your brand awareness and your practice. Short-term strategies create a temporary, immediate revenue boost by giving patients an incentive to purchase now. By implementing long- and short-term marketing strategies, you can gain immediate revenues while building your reputation and practice."
7,SEO or PPC? What to choose for your business?,business," It is definitely a large marketplace in the online community especially if you have an internet business that you cannot ignore. Thousands even millions of consumers on the internet that you can tap. The internet at the same time also poses a quite different challenge. The Internet provides also gives you easy access to as much competition as you can imagine. It is too congested and crowded. To make your business able and running to compete, having a website is not enough. To give way for the online community to access your website, you must take other alternatives at any rate or chance possible. Make your website known. You have to expose it and be visible. Consumers and surfers have to be targeted frequently. Invest your internet site in marketing. Basically, there are two options available to you, PPC and SEO. As a strategy for search engine marketing, probably these two options are the most desirable alternatives for your internet business that you can get. Our team app promotion services recommend using two strategies at the same time, but you can also focus on only one. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Many types of research indicate that 60% - 70% of internet users and surfers actually using the Google search engine to locate and find web pages and websites, for any topic they desire. To make sure that the internet users will find your website, SEO is the process taken when ranked among the top results of a search. You can make sure that you will be visible this way and can stand out clearly from the rest. You will have to build on your own internet site frequently hit internet links to website pages to get search engine optimization. This will involve Independent Back-Linking Network or IBLN, wherein thousands of pages will be utilized to promote a particular website of a client. To pay for the clicks in SEO, there is no need for you, although it will require you to spend time to get a favorable combination with doing research of ads and target audience. It is a long-term one. The SEO process requires months, at least 6 months before the proper outcome is fully achieved, but you will definitely get a steady source of profit, once the goal is accomplished. PPC means Pay Per Click. On a search engine, it gives way to advertising. Whenever you make a search, these are sponsored listings that you see. Whenever a visitor or web surfer clicks on any of your ads, there will be a charge. The first process will be bidding. It will definitely get the chance for the highest bidder for the price per click to be first listed in the search engine. You can still basically control your campaign with this kind of advertising, as you get to create your own ad. You will also stay within the bounds of your budget and still manage the target audience. Most PPC advertising providers will allow you to specify the target market, either by industry,  topic or geographical location. Also if your ad is competitive with the rest and if it gets to be shown at all and if it is competitive with the rest, you can very well check. When you get to maximize the PPC strategy, there are some guaranteed benefits. To the whole of the online community, PPC lets you advertise, also relatively easy to set up. PPC advertising may seem very expensive at first glance. Possibly it could happen that someone out there will go on clicking on your ad. Without the expected profit on your part, definitely this will give you a large bill. Be rest assured that there is protection for you if this provides a lot of worries. For a certain period, you can set a budget. Your ads will no longer be displayed at the moment your budget has been used up by the target number of clicks, until the next period you want it again displayed. To changes in market trends and demands, you will also be able to adjust well."
8,Marketing Plastic Surgery Procedures,business," Plastic Surgery is a lucrative business, and that makes it difficult when marketing plastic surgery procedures. Plastic surgeons, as well as other specialties and corporations, want to capitalize on the growing demand for cosmetic rejuvenation. This means plastic surgery patients have more choices now than ever before, so marketing cosmetic surgery effectively takes strategy. No marketing method works all the time or every time.  People change, the media change taste change. So marketing for plastic surgery procedures needs to be strategic.  Different long- and short-term messages and marketing channels must be tried and tested until you get the results you’re looking for. Here are pointers: DEFINE YOUR “PREFERRED PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT” FIRST When marketing cosmetic surgery through mass media channels, you are talking to everybody and nobody.  You’ve probably heard the saying, “You can’t be everything to everybody.” All plastic surgery patients are not created equal. You have to consider different generations' ages, ethnicities, genders, social economics, and consumer trends. Target marketing is necessary, so you focus in order to save money and get a good result. Cater to the group you consider your preferred cosmetic surgery patients, whether it be a particular age group or procedure. Learn the demographics and needs of that group. And be where they are on the Internet, the events they attend, the blogs they read, and so on. This is important because only a certain percentage of the population will invest in cosmetic enhancement procedures, products, or treatments. By marketing plastic surgery to the right niche market, you’ll be more profitable. You won’t waste your effort, time, or money by throwing out your message to consumers who have no interest in your services. MARKETING STARTS WITH YOUR CURRENT PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS While you’re waiting for your mass media marketing strategies to take hold, implement some “fast-acting” marketing projects that give you revenues now. Start with your current cosmetic surgery patient base. They already know and trust you. Therefore, they’re much more apt to respond to your marketing efforts. Your current patients are also your lowest-hanging fruit since a patient who wants to look good today, will want that again, so keep in touch. Use these marketing mix strategies to cross-promote comparable procedures and treatments and encourage patient referrals: Patient Marketing via Facebook Use your current patient email list in your Facebook audiences when setting up a Facebook ad campaign. This way, your current plastic surgery patients will see you in their Facebook stream. That alone may compel them to reach out to you or, at least, like and share your posts and ads with their friends on Facebook. You also want to add your own patient list as a “look-a-like” audience in your ad campaign. Facebook will analyze your patient list to send your ad to others that mirror the similarities of your current patients. Social Media Booth Set up a corner of your office as your social media booth. Order a customized backdrop stand with your logo and Website on it so all photos and videos show your contact information in the background. Now every visiting patient can sign your praises to their social media friends by taking photos with you and the staff. You can also interview them about their experience with you and then forward the video to them so they can upload it to their social platforms, and you can do the same on your social platforms. Patient Email Marketing Email marketing still wins, hands down, over social media when it comes to reaching, interaction and results. First of all, you are sending emails to patients who already know, like, and trust you, so there’s a better chance of them wanting to hear what you have to say. And, unlike social media, you have more time and space to get your message across. It is, by far, the fastest, cheapest, and easiest way to stay in touch with your plastic surgery patients. Make your practice emails eye-catching, fun, informative, and always include special offers with a tight expiration date, so patients respond now. Use any of the email platforms such as www.ConstantContact.com or www.MailChimp.com and watch the analytics they provide, so you know your open rates. I highly recommend you email twice a month, so you stay “top of mind” to your patients, but don’t overwhelm them, and be sure you have permission to send emails to your patients. They also must be able to opt-out if they wish. Social Posts Repurpose your email design into social posts for Facebook, Instagram, and any other social platform you use to grow your audience. There’s no need to start over from scratch. Use the same graphics and copy from your email so no matter how patients and their friends see you, they will see consistency in your design and messaging. And, if you’re getting likes on your post, boost it with $10 to get it in front of other prospective cosmetic patients. Word-of-mouth Referral Program Offer an easy way for your patients to refer their friends and family. The best referrals will come from satisfied cosmetic surgery patients who were treated well and who got a great result. When they do refer someone to you, thank them with a personal phone call and/or note to show your appreciation for their support. TRACKING RESULTS WHEN MARKETING PLASTIC SURGERY Make sure your staff asks every new patient how they heard about you. Your scheduler offers that drop-down menu of referral sources, so be sure it’s set up and every staff person knows to use it. You can also code your ads, use a special telephone line or have cosmetic surgery patients present a message for the special price you mentioned in your patient email, social post, or referral cards. Regularly pull up reports to determine where your marketing results are coming from. Conclusion When marketing plastic surgery procedures, it takes different messages, different formats, and consistency to connect with your current patients as well as your preferred cosmetic surgery patients so you catch them when they are ready for rejuvenation. Because if they aren’t ready for your services today, they will be three, six, nine months from now, and you want to be there."
9,Are You a Rich Surgeon or Poor Surgeon?,business," Are You a Rich Surgeon or Poor Surgeon? In his bestselling book, “Rich Dad, Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki presented the “Cash Flow Quadrant.“ Using this quadrant, Mr. Kiyosaki explains clearly why some people make a lot of money AND have time to enjoy their riches, while others are stuck in the rat race. As you can see, “the rich” have either businesses in which PEOPLE are working hard for them, or they have MONEY working hard for them while they enjoy a good life. The good life as a plastic surgeon is whatever it means to you, such as: – Working only 4 days per week and taking Fridays off to do what YOU want to do – Having dinner every night with your wife and kids – Taking 6 weeks of vacation each year while... – Enjoying the freedom and PEACE OF MIND to retire today if you felt like it AS A PLASTIC SURGEON, WHICH QUADRANT ARE YOU IN? Sadly, most plastic surgeons are stuck in the “self-employed” quadrant. Yes, you work for yourself (and Uncle Sam), but most probably you cannot take a 6-week vacation without a severe negative impact on your business and your income. If you want to become wealthy AND enjoy life, you need to move to the right side of the quadrant. But let’s be honest: Do you have a team of superstars that work hard for YOU? Can you leave your practice for a few weeks, come back, and find your practice in better shape than before you left? In order to move to the upper right quadrant of financial and time freedom, you need to focus on the following: THE TEAM SUPPORTING YOUR PLASTIC SURGEON PRACTICE You can’t do this alone, and you can’t be the only revenue generator in your practice. That leaves you vulnerable. If you’re not working, no money is coming in. So you either are always there keeping the cash flowing, or you’re not there but, then you’re worrying and/or feeling guilty for not being there. You can’t win with this business model. A better way is to find other revenue-generators and supporting staff that takes the pressure off you and build their own revenue streams. For example, if you’re currently producing 95% of all revenues in your practice, a goal is to get that down to 75% and then 50% and even 30%. BUT that doesn’t happen quickly and easily. Finding the right team players takes a lot of effort up front, but it is essential when building a sustainable business/practice. For starters, WHO would you bring on? Another surgeon, nurse injectors, laser techs, aestheticians, experienced coordinators who know how to convert? Figure that out first, and then be extremely clear with them about your vision and expectations, as well as…. IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS FOR CLARITY AND CONSISTENCY Money loves clarity, and so do your team members. You can’t expect excellence from your team until they understand your definition of it. Be clear about HOW you want things done. Each team member needs to map out their processes and step-by-step processes. They can use google docs to write it out and/or do screen capture videos explain what exactly they do to accomplish their tasks. Here’s a great way to test their skill in explaining things. Give their how-to materials to another team member and have them do it. If they can complete the task, you’re good. If they can’t, improve it until they can. Why are we doing this? Because this is exactly what happens when someone on your team goes on vacation, has an accident, and is out for a month or suddenly quits. When you are set up correctly, it’s a little annoyance rather than a major breakdown because your systems have your back. HOLD YOUR TEAM ACCOUNTABLE Are you a Rich Surgeon or a poor surgeon oftentimes hinges on this…. The majority of surgeons I’ve worked with have trouble letting go of control…..UNTIL they see they can, and their practice doesn’t fall apart. Most likely, you, too, have experienced toxic staff, patient complaints about your service, or even embezzlement. That’s what makes you hold on tight. While it’s understandable, it’s not necessary once you hold each team member accountable for their own actions, behaviors, and results. Because this isn’t about abdicating. It’s about empowering your team to step up, have your back, do their job, and report back to you regularly. Now you have the peace of mind knowing things are working well or there are issues to address, but it’s no longer guesswork or hoping everyone is doing what they are paid to do. It’s a system to know everyone is on their game, and you know, the health of your practice on any given day. There is a lot more to running your practice like a business, so it’s a well-oiled machine that can run without YOU, but this will get you started. Of course, let me know if I can help."
10,Plastic Surgery Receptionist Phone Skills,business," ASK CATHERINE THIS WEEK’S QUESTION: PLASTIC SURGERY RECEPTIONIST PHONE SKILLS: DOES SHE HAVE THE TRAINING TO CONVERT CALLERS? Dear Catherine, I can hear my receptionist on the phone, and I cringe at her phone skills.  No matter how many times I tell her what to say, she will often say something random and loses the caller. Just today, I heard her say, “No, we don’t do that,” and she hung up on the caller.  When I asked her which procedure the caller was asking about, she told me…. …..”The caller wanted something called [brand name skin tightening device,] and I told her we don’t do that.” So I had to explain to my receptionist we don’t offer that particular name brand because we found something that works even better, and THAT’S what she should have told the caller. That one mistake costs us $4,500. Any suggestions for fixing my phones?  Dr. T Catherine’s Answer: Dear Dr. T, Your question is a good one.  Every practice has experienced “bad phones” that cost them patients and thousands of dollars in lost revenues. THE COST OF BAD PLASTIC SURGERY RECEPTIONIST PHONE SKILLS Let’s do the math:  If your receptionist loses that $4,500 caller just 1x/week, that adds up to $234,000 per year! Wow! The solution to Fix Your Phones is simple but not easy. Here’s what it takes to get your phones in order: That’s how you prepare your receptionist to handle patient inquiries effectively and fill up your schedule. Otherwise, your new patients aren’t ever going to meet you if your receptionist can’t successfully convert these callers into appointments. Frankly, your receptionist may be unknowingly sabotaging your best practice promotional efforts simply because they don’t have the receptionist phone skills training and tools they need. TEST YOUR PLASTIC SURGERY RECEPTIONIST PHONE SKILLS Think about how YOU feel when you call a business. And your call is handled poorly. Certainly, that’s not the way the owner would want you to be treated. Well, it’s the same in your practice. Most doctors don’t believe this happens in their office – until they hear it for themselves. I assure you, in my consulting work, I have called hundreds of practices and have been amazed at what I’ve heard on the other end of the phone. Rather than me belaboring the point – test it for yourself. Call your office as any prospective patient would, and then tell me what you think. Every call affects your bottom line, and either enhances your image or destroys it. Your staff can represent you as a true professional or not – but the choice is up to you. During my staff training sessions, I often hear, “But, I don’t know what to say when the patient says that.” Or, “What else could I have said that would have made a difference?” My answer is – plenty! Prepare your receptionist for success. Equip them with effective responses, phrases, and questions to help them not only bond with and educate your patients but actually close. With the right words to say, your staff will be so comfortable with the process and so prepared that they’ll look forward to phone calls and patient interactions because they’re confident, trained, and ready to close! Are YOUR phones set up for success or sabotage? How have YOU tackled YOUR OWN phone frustrations? If you know or suspect your phones are not being handled professionally, it’s an easy fix, so get your receptionist the phone skills she needs to represent you professionally."

13,Disabling facilitation of public and private sector corruption through risk management,business," As professionals we should avoid falling prey to public and private sector corruption. Corruption robs both the public and private sector to the extent of eroding our individual professional brand and that of our companies (reputational risk), it undermines the employees of both sectors who are truthfully and impartially committed to their professions. Corruption is defined as any conduct or behavior in relation to persons in private or public sector entrusted with responsibilities in their office, which contradicts their duties, and which is aimed at obtaining undue benefits of any kind for themselves. Although most companies and government departments have clearly articulated policies that condemn fraud, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, favoritism, kickbacks and other forms of corruption, these policies don’t seem to be working as intended hence corruption keeps rearing its head. Corruption inhibits possible foreign investment, stifles economic growth and undermines  efforts towards achievement of sustainable development. It further undermines the various layers of controls created by companies, member organizations such as IRMSA, legal and judicial systems. Corrupt individuals and businesses who pay bribes to avoid complying to set rules, laws and regulations continue to benefit unduly by securing tenders, contracts and favours at the expense of those who choose to uphold high ethical values.   Many have lost their lives while fighting corruption and people’s lives continue to be threatened where there seems to be pushback. This renders the fight against corruption a more complex one. Most concerning to risk professionals is that corruption leads to other possible related and unrelated risks materialising. For example, if a private sector service provider pays kickbacks to a government department employee in order to secure a tender to provide a particular service , the service provider may not be able to deliver the service at the required standard or in extreme cases, not deliver the service at all. If the government department was intending to address a particular risk by putting in place controls with this service, it means the risk will highly likely materialise as a result of controls not being applied. David Lewis, the executive director of Corruption Watch, explains that one of the lessons we have learnt from our country’s recent past is the role played by private-sector companies and professions in facilitating public and private-sector corruption. These include members of the legal and auditing professions, tax advisers and management consultants, and real estate agents. Lewis further explains that the work of their organization as a corruption watchdog going forward will focus increasingly on these identified facilitators of corruption. To make the risk of corruption prominent in our organizations we need to create scenarios in our risk discussions which demonstrate instances whereby corruption risks can materialise. The jargon used in the scenarios has to be relevant and at the most, be specific to the organization. Where controls don’t work as intended, alternative or a combination of controls should be applied to deal with weaknesses. For example, to mitigate collusion, staff rotation can be used and supplemented with automation of certain processes. Corruption undermines the efforts of professionals in the private and public sector who live up to their mandate, and as risk professionals we need to protect the controls  created through member organizations, watchdog agencies and  legal and judicial systems. Risk management can be a useful tool to ensure that these controls are adhered to and where they are inadequate, risk managers must ensure that additional measures are put in place. One of the benefits of risk management is that when it’s done intelligently, it can contribute immensely towards the eradication of fraud and corruption, create sustainable value as well as protect and enhance reputation. . In these unprecedented times, the risk manager’s role in the fight to corruption is more important than ever and as a risk professional you need to ask yourself the following questions about your organization. Have you: •	Considered corruption as a potential risk? •	Created scenarios relevant to your organization to demonstrate instances where corruption risks can materialize? •	Does corruption feature in your risk register? •	Are controls applied to deal with weaknesses in implementation of policies to mitigate corruption risks? •	What additional mitigation strategies have you implemented to proactively identify instances whereby individuals in your organization could facilitate private or public sector corruption? •	Are these controls effective enough to disable possible facilitation of corruption?

15,Convert More Plastic Surgery Consultations,business," You convert more plastic surgery consultations when you hire a patient coordinator with the right character, mindset, and skills. The right coordinator is a practice game-changer who can take your practice revenues from “just enough to pay the bills” to a windfall every month because they know how to book cosmetic procedures! This position cannot be taken lightly. You may think anyone can step in to do the job of a coordinator, but you would be sorely mistaken. Converting consultations is an art and a trained skill. It takes the right strategies, knowledge, and then lots of practice to get good at confidently taking a “stranger prospect” to a paying cosmetic patient. See the below traits of a great patient coordinator to ensure you have the right person representing you: GET THE RIGHT PATIENT COORDINATOR IN THE POSITION OF “CONSULTATION CLOSER” Your coordinator must believe in YOU, your skills and be open to aesthetic rejuvenation. If your patient coordinator would never succumb to this world of vanity, how in the heck are they supposed to praise and promote you and your services? However, that does not mean you are looking for an aggressive, loud-mouthed salesperson who can’t relate to your patients (or maybe it does if your patients DO relate to that type of personality.) Different parts of the country have different “styles” of communicating, so be sure your coordinator fits well with your type of patient demographics. You are looking for certain personality traits MORE than you are looking for experience. The aesthetic industry can be learned easily. Powerful people skills cannot.  Be sure you have the right coordinator representing you who looks, acts, and feels the part. THE RIGHT MINDSET AND ATTITUDE The best coordinators have confidence knowing they are providing a valuable service to prospective patients who need guidance. They believe in the surgeon(s) they are representing. And they also believe in cosmetic rejuvenation as a gateway to personal self-fulfillment and happiness. That means they do all they can to help the prospective patient get to a yes, and they persevere in the face of resistance. They don’t see resistance as rejection. They see it as an opportunity to clear up the confusion on the patient’s side, so they also get to a yes and be happy. EXCELLENT PEOPLE SKILLS The right coordinator also has the people skills to make a prospective cosmetic patient comfortable and trusting enough to decide to have their cosmetic procedure with you. They stay focused on the patient’s wants, fears, objections so they can artfully address the issues in the patient’s mind that are stopping them from moving forward. They do that by bonding with, listening to, and asking questions. So the patient feels heard. The patient now opens up more because she trusts the patient coordinator has her best interests at heart. SKILLED AT CONVERTING PLASTIC SURGERY CONSULTATIONS Converting prospective patients to paid cosmetic patients is the #1 skill needed to be a top patient coordinator. This is where the rubber meets the road. This is the difference between an okay coordinator and a converting rock star. To convert more plastic surgery consultations, it takes confidence, and it takes courage. For example, when the coordinator has presented the options to the prospective patient, they must transition to a strategic question rather than a yes/no question that can trigger resistance. The patient is looking to you for guidance and isn’t going to hand it to you– You have to ask for it in a professional and comfortable way, so the patient says yes. So instead of asking, “Sarah, did you want to do this?” you ask, “Sarah, I only have 2 dates left this month on the 10th and 15th, or did you want to wait until next month? (most cosmetic patients hate to wait so this adds urgency.) When they pick one of the choices given to them, the patient is moving forward and you now have a booked surgery! Want more? Let me train your patient coordinator to be a converting rock star. Have her join The Converting Club for Coordinators to get started right away. GIVE YOUR PATIENT COORDINATOR THE TOOLS NEEDED TO EDUCATE THE PATIENT Consider what a difficult conversation this is to have with a complete stranger. The cosmetic patient is uncomfortable with their appearance, so they are feeling vulnerable and anxious. The coordinator’s job is to put them at ease and reassure them they are in the right place and will be happy with their result when they decide to move forward. Your coordinator must have a process set up and powerful questions to ask, as well as tools, to help the patient articulate what they want, why they want it, and what it will take for them to say YES. One helpful tool is “The Aging Face” signage. This is for patients who want facial rejuvenation. But don’t know how much or how far they want to go. The signage helps them determine surgical vs. non-surgical solutions. TIP:  Patients are much more driven to a solution to their problem vs. the solution you have to fix their problem. Think:  Problem First – Then Solution. SCRIPT YOUR PATIENT COORDINATOR SO THEY KNOW HOW TO ASK FOR A DECISION So many practices have patient coordinators who are nice. And look at the part but have no idea how to ASK FOR A DECISION. This one skill makes the difference between 25% conversions and 75% conversions. But like anything else in life, it’s a learned skill. It takes proven strategies and practice. For example, a trained and skilled patient coordinator is never pushy or aggressive. They have the words and scripts and processes they follow to “lead” the patient to a decision that is comfortable for the patient. For example, a simple closing strategy is the “Choice Close.” That means rather than the patient deciding a YES/NO question. They choose EITHER/OR, and YES is assumed… “Sara, Dr. Smith’s surgery days are Wednesdays and Fridays. Which works better for you?” Now Sara has most likely moved from IF she is going to book to WHEN she is going to book. It’s a small nuance with a big effect. Try it. If you know in your gut, your coordinator could be better, let me train her."
16,Dealing with the Unhappy Cosmetic Patient,business," It takes compassion and patience when dealing with the unhappy cosmetic patient, but it’s well worth it when growing your practice. For the most part, you have nice patients who are reasonable and pleasant to work with. Some of them have given you great reviews, but every plastic surgeon had bad reviews that will not go away. Long story short, these patients had unrealistic expectations and, no matter what you tried to do to make them happy (or at least not unhappy), they preferred to bad mouth you online. So, how can you make an unhappy patient happy before it gets to the point where they are complaining about you online? UNHAPPY PATIENT HURT YOUR ONLINE REPUTATION Thanks to online patient reviews, directories like Real Self, and social media, it is too easy today for an unhappy patient to blast you, your credibility, and your reputation. A bad review takes the unhappy patient minutes to write but follows you around for years. That makes it necessary to anticipate and continually improve upon all aspects of the patient experience with you because it’s not about just that one consultation, treatment, or procedure they have with you. It’s about setting up processes so that the prospective patient is happy and satisfied with their experience and result from beginning to end. But what do you do with the occasional unhappy patient? How do you make them happy? Here are proven strategies to turn them around: SHOW THE COSMETIC PATIENT YOU CARE The majority of cosmetic patients rarely badmouth you IF they feel a connection with you. Most of them would actually be quite forgiving if they felt that you cared about them. For example, the cosmetic patient has got to feel as important after they pay you as they felt before they paid you. You never want them to feel dismissed by having someone else see them for their post-op appointments and having only your staff call them to see how they’re doing. That means: •	YOU make the follow-up call to see how they are doing •	YOU see them for their post-op appointment •	YOU give them your cell phone for emergencies Even though you’re super busy, taking minutes out of your day/evening here can save you many hours and dollars down the road. There is a saying in our industry that says, “They won’t sue you if they like you,” so keep that in mind. HEAR THEM OUT Listen to your patients. You can’t solve a problem you don’t know you have, and that’s why listening is critical. Oftentimes, the patient just needs to vent – for whatever reason. If you let them, it can diffuse 80% of their anger, so they calm down and are now in a rational state of mind to talk and come up with solutions. Just listen. You don’t have to agree, dispute, or negotiate what they are saying. Just listen. Keep your ego in check and squash defensiveness.  Although the patient may be attacking your skills or integrity, keep your cool and remember the objective here is to neutralize the unhappy patient so they don’t damage your reputation. Don’t make excuses, don’t qualify, and definitely don’t disparage the patient for speaking their mind. Just listen and learn. MAKE A SINCERE APOLOGY This is tricky because you don’t want to admit wrongdoing; however, you do want to acknowledge your sincere concern for your patient’s feelings. Be honest with yourself. Is the patient being completely irrational, or is there room for improvement in the result they got? The answer is usually somewhere in the middle, so apologize for the situation and acknowledge how they feel by saying something like, “Sara, I’m sorry you’re not happy with (me, staff, result,) so let’s talk about a solution.” FIND OUT WHAT THE COSMETIC PATIENT WANTS Now it’s time to make it right. Find out what the cosmetic patient wants. Ask a simple question like, “What is it you want me to do for you?” Did you notice you are NOT admitting guilt here? You are simply acknowledging their feelings. There’s a good chance it’s going to be easier to appease them than you thought. If it is something reasonable, why not give it to them and move on? If the unhappy patient wants more than that, like as a refund, it’s best to contact your lawyer to draw up an agreement to go with it, so they agree not to talk about you online or offline. More helpful insights about handling cosmetic patients are in my book, Your Aesthetic Practice/What Your Patients Are Saying."
17,How to Start an Online Business in 2021,business," ""The secret of getting ahead is getting started”, the famous quote of Mark Twain has seen precedence in every generation and 2021 would follow suit as well.

Here are some of the key factors which might help make the path less rough and help you understand how to start an online business in 2021. Having the Right Mindset To start something, the first and the most important thing is to have the right mindset and a determination to make it happen. The mindset is more important than the right timing. Especially in the time of pandemic when the businesses have seen a downfall, one becomes discouraged to start off with a raw idea and turn it into a business. So it becomes incumbent on you to have complete grit to go through with the plan. Origin of the Idea Chase the thought process which generated the will to start the business in you. Trace the origin of the idea of starting the venture and evaluate how practical it is for you to go after it. Once you figure out the origin of the idea, map out the road to go about the business you need to start. For example, if you are going for a clothing brand, you need to be thorough with the research of such a start-up and how profitable it would be. Research and Recognize Your Niche The next and one of the most crucial steps is to do research and find out your best-suited niche. There are a lot of options to learn from as we live in a world where most of the ideas are explored and hence that increases our options to learn from. Make sure to tap on the right resources for your research work and be as thorough as you could be. To understand how to start an online business in 2021, you have to consider different platforms as well as different models altogether to learn thereby enriching your thought process. Looking at a plethora of things would give you the edge as now you would know what is the most suitable choice for you. It would also help you amalgamate different business ideas and build a strong foundation. Structural Processing Once you are done with your research, you will get the raw structure in your mind. Looking at different ideas would have enhanced your model more. Now it's time to plan out the skeleton. With your research, you would also know the problems with different models and why some of the businesses did not flourish while others did. This would make you well equipped to deal with different kinds of bugs. For example, if a clothing brand offers a rich collection but the prices are sky-high, you would want to build a brand that suits the pockets of the consumer and does not compromise on the quality as well. Funding Sources After the arduous process of planning and structuring, the onus falls on the monetary aspects. Look for the resources that would fund your venture. Normally people fall on their savings which are mostly generated through their jobs. Map out your needs with your budget and see if it aligns or not. Do not take hasty decisions of quitting your job instantly. Stick with it because extra bucks would not hurt. If the savings do not suffice your needs of the business, you would need to consider taking a loan from the bank. Be careful with the monetary aspects the most as it would be the crucial part. Determining the Target When you wish to know how to start an online business in 2021, you need to understand and identify the target audience. Switching back to the example of a fashion brand, if you want to target female clothing then prepare a model for different age groups and different body types. Know the market and what is liked by the different audiences and how are your competitors serving their needs. Determine the way in which your product would stand out and hence earn you rewards. Goals and Milestones When you start a business, essentially the motive is to build a profit out of the service you would be providing. This motive turns into determination which is good but it might get out of hand if you do not keep it in check. Keep a realistic approach and even more realistic expectations from your business. Most companies suffer a loss at the start of their journey and hence fall prey to downfall as their hopes from their business were high. Learn to accept all outcomes and be ready when the storm hits you. The business would not always bloom and so it will not always dry up as well. So keep your expectations grounded. Performance Review When you've started the wheel once, check how it is performing. In the beginning, give a lot of importance to your reviews but do not attach yourself to them. If the reviews turn out to be positive, keep on going in the same way as you were. However, if the reviews are critical, ask the consumer what was the problem and be handy with the solution. Design a team for troubleshooting. Business Registration The last but essentially the last step is to get your company registered. Be aware of the laws of the place you reside in as they vary in the terms of registration. If the place demands you to register the company as soon as possible then don't delay the process. Conclusion When questioning how to start an online business in 2021, one must keep in mind that starting something new is big learning in itself. It requires all the more diligence, determination and discipline than a 9-5 job. Hence being well acquainted with all the laws and functions of starting a business might help make an informed decision and build your own brand."
18,5 Key Practices for Immigration Compliance,business," 5 Key Practices for immigration compliance Start by knowing the rules that apply to recruiting and employing temporary foreign workers - or at least know where to find them. Principal sources of law and regulatory bodies. The main sources of laws and rules governing the hiring and employment of temporary foreign workers in Australia are: The Department of Home Affairs The Federal Register of Legislation Australian Border Force Key rules and procedures: Many rules apply when an Australian employer wishes to employ one or more temporary foreign workers. Three of the most important are: A work visa (also known as a ""work permit"" in some countries) is the basic immigration tool that allows ""foreign nationals"" (people who are not Australian citizens or ""permanent residents"") in Australia to work as a temporary foreign worker. Home affairs prohibits a foreign national from entering Australia to ""work"" without prior authorization. When it comes to determining whether a foreign national enters Australia for the purpose of ""working"" - and therefore requiring a work permit – Home Affairs focuses on the activities of the individual rather than on how he (or anyone else, including potential employers) categorizes the arrangement. Home Affairs defines ""work"" as an activity: for which wages are paid or commissions are earned; or compete directly with the activities of an Australian citizen or permanent resident in the Australian labour market. So, for example, a foreign national that an Australian organization might call ""volunteer"" simply because they are not paid is most likely (and probably is) ""working"" in the sense of Home Affairs if “the work is normally paid, and therefore requires a work permit”. Consistently review the work permit: An important part of the due diligence process is the review of the foreign worker's temporary work permit, focusing on the following key fields to confirm that they are complete and correct: Employee's name (currently last name and first name(s). Employee “Personal Data” (currently date of birth, gender, country of birth and nationality, and travel document number, such as passport). Date of expiry of the work permit. Name and location of employer. Worker's profession. Any other note, comment, or condition (for example, prohibition to work in the medical field, obligation to maintain health insurance while in Australia etc). Due diligence also involves reviewing the LMIA or online job posting, as appropriate and when necessary, both for accuracy and consistency between it and the temporary foreign worker's work permit Time: Labour contract. Actual working conditions (such as wages, benefits, working hours, job description and duties, work location, etc.). It is good practice for all employers to use a properly drafted and executed written employment contract. The same goes for temporary foreign workers. Due diligence includes reviewing the employment contract to ensure its terms comply with the LMIA or online job posting, if applicable, including the following key terms: Cash salary . Benefits. Working hours. Job Description. Tasks and places of work. Requiring employers to keep records on temporary foreign workers for seven years - and Home Affairs' right to conduct random audits on those records - means employers must prepare; and although temporary foreign employers under an open work permit are not subject to this record keeping requirement and audit power, it is still a good practice: Record. Create and maintain an up-to-date, well-organized and easily accessible file for each worker containing a copy of their respective immigration work visa, LMIA or online letter of offer (if applicable), employment contract, timesheet, passport and employment file. Review all business records, including all payroll records and timesheets. Alternatively, organisations can purchase a product that makes meeting the compliance requirements simple.

19,Importance of experiential marketing in the printing industry by 2021,business," Your customer experience includes all points a customer or prospect comes into contact with your company - whether it's digital, verbal, physical, or visual. In essence, the difference comes down to how a customer perceives a brand; a business may think it appears one way to consumers, but to them, it could seem completely different, and it all comes down to how they perceive a business. Nowadays, traditional marketing isn't effective. The use of experiential marketing is without a doubt more effective than TV, billboards, flyers, and podcasts. Not only does that resonate with consumers today, but it also has a long-lasting impact and influences future purchases more. By using experiential marketing, brands invite customers to experience their products directly rather than making them observers and hoping traditional marketing efforts will ring true for them. Live events are known to have a greater impact on consumers than television advertising, according to 93% of consumers. WHY EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING? An experiential marketing strategy consists of any face-to-face or offline marketing effort to raise brand awareness, generate and nurture business opportunities, and ensure long-term customer loyalty. The 360-degree omnichannel experience is both an individual (activations) as well as a collective (the number of activations). It is essentially an emotional, physical interaction between customers and brands. Among the other names we can use today for this are: •	Marketing events •	Marketing participation •	Marketing engagement •	In-person marketing •	Marketing loyalty •	Marketing via live events A key aspect of experiential marketing is involving customers actively in what is being sold in a new and innovative way. In the right hands, digital marketing is a way for consumers to connect with brands in ways they just can't get from standalone marketing channels such as online, television, print, or radio. Despite the central role of digital and online interaction, particularly viral sharing, a large portion of the emotional resonance that results from good experiential marketing is driven by the physical components a business (or brand) brings to the table. At Creative Roots, we can help you develop a number of materials that are designed to showcase your designs and communicate your intention to your audience or customers in a variety of ways. Large-format prints give your experiential marketing and your brand the weight and perceived value they deserve. In-person interactions are one of the most important ways to differentiate your brand from your competitors. Virtual and online experiences are important for most brands. Poor Customer Experience Impacts? A brand that doesn't earn its customers' trust and loyalty could end up: Leaving for a competitor - 70% of B2B customers leave after experiencing one bad experience. However, due to contract restrictions, the number of people wanting to leave is likely to be higher. If you cannot get out of your contract, you will probably do more damage to your business by leaving negative reviews - 95% of the time they'll share their bad experiences with others.

20,How to Follow-Up AFTER the Consult,business," Most plastic surgery staff do NOT know how to follow up AFTER the consult, and that’s why their conversion rates are low. Let’s face it….It’s easier to only focus on the patients who moved forward with their surgery and never on the ones who said no or just never said yes. Your staff will tell you they don’t like to push prospective patients who haven’t decided, and they will add that it makes you look desperate, hoping you agree, so they don’t have to do it! Here’s a typical scenario: Hmmm…. You thought you had a great consultation with your prospective patient, Sara. She seemed to get along well with your staff. You thought you had a good consultation with her because she asked a lot of questions, and you had a good connection…at least you thought you did. So you meet with your coordinator later that day and learn that Sara ended up saying, “I gotta think about it,” and walked out the door. Then you find out later in the week that your coordinator emailed Sara, but she hasn’t heard back, so Sara is dropped in the “dead leads” file. You move on to the next consultation that you hope converts, and the cycle continues… WHY DIDN’T THE CONSULT BOOK? Since cosmetic rejuvenation is a very personal as well as an emotional decision, there are all sorts of reasons why the prospective cosmetic patient didn’t book…. –  Maybe the downtime was too much for them. –  Maybe the reality of surgery and general anesthesia scared them away. –  Maybe they couldn’t afford it or didn’t have a way to comfortably pay for it. Or, maybe they got the bad news that morning and weren’t in the right mind frame. Or a dozen other benign things could have happened that had nothing to do with you. It could have had everything to do with their frame of mind at the time that prevented them from moving forward. The point is people change, their moods change, and their circumstances change, so you can never assume anything. The patient’s reluctance to connect with you after the consultation could just be a simple, “Not Now” or “Not Yet.” You just don’t know. HOW TO FOLLOW UP AFTER THE CONSULT? If the prospective patient can’t or won’t make a decision during the consultation or says they have to think about it, don’t push.  For whatever reason, they are just not ready to book. So rather than hope they call you back when they ARE ready, here’s a really effective proactive strategy to get you closer to the finish line: Hold something back in the consultation that your patient coordinator can follow up with when you reach out later. Example #1:  Competition Let’s say, Sara, the prospective patient wants a Mommy Makeover.  She mentions at the end of her consultation with your coordinator that she’ll be going on three more consults to do her due diligence and you happen to be her first visit. Ugh! Your coordinator can now email Sara your  “Checklist of Questions to Ask the Surgeon During Your Mommy Makeover Consultation.” Now fill the checklist with questions you can say yes to that your competitors may not be able to; i.e., you have performed an above-average number of Mommy Makeovers, etc. And, fill it with patient stories and photos of OTHER Mommy Makeover patients just like them who have had the procedure.  Add their contact information or at least an invitation to set your happy and satisfied patients up to talk with Sara about their experience. Now your coordinator calls Sara and says: “Hi Sara, it’s Kim from Dr. Smith’s office. It was so great to meet you the other day. I know you’re thinking it over, and I had an idea that may help. I thought of a special checklist Dr. Smith wrote about Mommy Makeovers that would help you get the most from the consultations you’re going on. I just emailed it over to you, so please take a look and let me know if it’s helpful to you. Ok? Example #2:   Finance Let’s say Sara told you she needs to think about it because it’s a lot of money and she’s not sure it’s worth it. She did mention she wants to use her own credit card because she thinks the cosmetic finance company fees are too high. So, knowing that, you call Sara the next day or two and say, “Hi Sara, it’s Kim from Dr. Smith’s office. It was so great to meet you the other day. I know you’re thinking it over, and I have some news that night help.  Our finance company just introduced a 0% Interest Pay Plan, so you can have what you want now without you using your own credit card. How does that sound? But now, you need to zip it and listen. Let Sara tell you what she thinks of that. It might be just what she needed to move forward. Or, if it doesn’t budge her and she’s not excited about the new information, at least you have a better feel for where’s she’s at, and you’ll want to try other strategies. To get more proven, “Follow-Up AFTER the Consult” strategies, Join me at The Converting Club for Coordinators to discover: –       What you can do to get the prospective patient to take your follow-up phone calls or call you back excited to speak with you; –       The number of times you should follow-up before you become pesky and ruin the new relationship you have with the prospective patient; –       What the prospective patient wants from you to help them decide if they should choose you or your competitor and so much more. Once your staff learns how to follow up AFTER the consult, you’ll see your conversion rates increase. And your staff grow as a professional representing you."

1,What is a Good Conversion Rate?,business," Question: What is a good conversion rate? Dear Catherine, I would like to know what is a good conversion rate? I had the same patient consultant for many years, and she did a great job. We made a really good team. I performed several procedures on her throughout the years, so she was a great testimonial, and she knew how to credential me as the best. She was also very good with my patients and really good at closing consultations. I never realized how good she was until her husband got a promotion and she moved away. My current coordinator has been on the job for the past year, and we are getting mixed results. She’s nice enough, but we don’t get the same results I used to get. My consult conversion rate used to be in the high 70’s for years, and it’s dropped significantly. My coordinator says that’s because the patients are price shopping our competitors and our prices are too high. I’m not sure that’s true. I don’t know if it’s the patients or the coordinator; or something else. Can you tell me what is a good conversion rate? Dr. W Catherine’s Answer: Dear Dr. W, Thank you for reaching out and asking such a loaded question. You are not alone. Lots of plastic surgeons are experiencing sporadic conversion rates. Or “feast or famine” months, and they’re not sure why. This inconsistency can wreak havoc on your day, your attitude, and your pocketbook. You start questioning yourself and doubting your staff, and that’s a path to even more frustration. So what’s really happening? Well, the bad news is, there’s no one easy answer. So many variables go into your success (or lack thereof) when converting consults. Here’s a shortlist of why your conversions “could” have dropped: •	Your SEO isn’t working like before because google changed the rules; i.e., is your Website “responsive” so it’s mobile-friendly? If not, you’re being penalized in your search results; •	A new competitor came to town and is out-marketing you; •	You changed up your marketing strategy, and while you’re getting more Internet leads, they are poor quality leads; •	Your coordinator has never had work done, so she’s not a great walking/talking testimonial for you; •	Your coordinator needs more converting skills to get to a YES, etc. Because the reality is your efforts don’t count until the patient says YES and PAYS for your services, right? That’s where your patient coordinator comes in. Granted, consults are more difficult to close when they are “Internet Stranger Patients” versus word-of-mouth referrals patients. It can be the difference between a 15-20% to a 70-80% closing rate. This is why your coordinator must be on her game to convert these consults to the best of her ability. Here are some suggestions to help you get your conversion rates up: #1: YOUR COORDINATOR MUST PROFESSIONALLY POSITION YOU AS THE BEST CHOICE ABOVE YOUR COMPETITORS. First, your coordinator must believe in YOU. Your skills as a surgeon, and truly believe you are the best choice. So she can present you as such to your prospective patients. The easiest way for your coordinator to close more consults is to show off her own results from your skills and expertise. That turns her into a personal storyteller about her own journey and immediately builds trust and credibility with the prospective patient who can see for themselves, results they, too, can expect. #2: SHE MUST HAVE POWERFUL RAPPORT-BUILDING SKILLS TO QUICKLY BOND WITH YOUR PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS SO THEY CONNECT. Consider what a difficult conversation this is to have with a complete stranger. The cosmetic patient is uncomfortable with their appearance so they are feeling vulnerable and anxious. The coordinator’s job is to put them at ease and reassure them they are in the right place and will be happy with their result when they decide to move forward. Your coordinator must have a process set up and powerful questions to ask, as well as tools, to help the patient articulate what they want, why they want it, and what it will take for them to say YES. #3) YOUR PATIENT COORDINATOR MUST “COMFORTABLY AND CONFIDENTLY” CLOSE BY ASKING FOR A DECISION. So many practices have patient coordinators who are nice and look the part but have no idea how to ASK FOR A DECISION. This one skill is a practice game changer when you have a skilled professional representing you. But like anything else in life, it’s a learned skill. It takes proven strategies and practice. For example, a trained and skilled patient coordinator is never pushy or aggressive. They have the words, and scripts, and processes they follow to “lead” the patient to a decision that is comfortable for the patient. For example, a simple closing strategy is using an “assumptive” statement to help the patient make a decision. So, after your coordinator presents the quote, she confidently goes back to the computer and says, “Sara, since Dr. Smith is pretty booked out, let me give you some dates we still have available to give you an idea of when you can have this done.” If Sara doesn’t object, she is moving closer to a decision, and you are that much closer to a yes, so keep going. To get more proven strategies to convert more consultations to booked procedures, check out The Converting Club for Coordinators."
2,How To Run Your Practice Like A Business,business," THIS WEEK’S QUESTION: I presented timely concepts in the presentation: “How to Run Your Practice Like a Business.” During the registration process of that training, I opened it up to pre-questions you had so I could address them during the presentation. Here’s a sampling of the flood of questions that came in from surgeons all over the US: •	How do I know what my practice is worth? •	Where can I find good staff and how do I train, and motivate them? •	What’s a reasonable overhead %, and what’s mine compared to my competitors? •	How much should I be spending on marketing for new patients, and where should I spend it? •	Should I add a nurse injector or NP? If so, how do I pay them? While the questions varied, the majority of them kept leading to one main question you most wanted answered, and that was…. How the heck do I set up a smooth-running practice with the right staff that supports me and stays busy and profitable even though the competition is all around me, so I know I am making progress and growing? CATHERINE’S ANSWER: That is a loaded question but not that difficult to answer. The answer will give you the clarity you need to grow your cosmetic practice withOUT working more hours and hiring more staff. Once you understand the business principles of any successful practice, you’ll quickly see how leveraging your skills, effort, and resources takes your practice to a whole different level and give you the clarity and peace of mind you’re looking for. Here are the practice fundamentals that need to be in place for you to succeed in today’s crazy competitive, complex and saturated marketplace: Build a Team Of Rock Stars You need a team of rock stars that are trained and motivated to ensure your success. •	The kind of staff who have your back; •	Who eagerly and cheerfully sing your praises to prospective patients; •	Who takes care of your current patients and treat them like family; AND •	Who work together as a team. Because the opposite of that opens the door to what you DON’T want to happen: High staff turnover, an uncomfortable working environment, tension, or god, forbid embezzlement. None of that can happen when you are set up properly. Strategic Marketing and Planning So, what’s the BEST way to grow your cosmetic practice? Is it SEO? PPC? Consumer Directories? Social Media? As you can see, the list is endless and that makes it easy to get overwhelmed so please hear this…. The most successful surgeons I know aren’t opportunists. The most successful surgeons I know are STRATEGIC. Instead of chasing marketing tactics, they take time out to create a comprehensive and strategic business plan using a specific formula. They implement a marketing machine to keep a steady stream of cosmetic patients coming to them on autopilot. Set Standards So You Don’t Compete On Price Because the cosmetic patient today has so much choice, they are confused as well as skeptical. They must weigh the pros and cons of price versus value and then choose the BEST CHOICE for them. So how do you position yourself as the best choice? You “pre-frame” you as the best choice using logic, emotion, and personal reasons why they will get the best result and patient experience when they say yes to you. Set Up Your Practice To Grow A successful cosmetic practice is built on metrics, predictable income as well as processes and systems. The secret is to watch these metrics regularly so you can be sure things are running smoothly. You will also clearly see what you need to address as a trouble spot brewing, so you’ll never again be blindsided with surprises. Want More?

4,Why Marketers Should Use WordPress Themes?,business," WordPress themes are not new to the online world. This open-source platform has been used for some years by bloggers, designers, and anyone who enjoys the flexibility offered by this free software. However, WordPress is much more than a blog platform. It is one of the most popular ways to promote a business on the web. Here are some of the top reasons why marketers should use WordPress themes for their websites: WordPress themes are very easy to use. There is no need for any technical knowledge or coding skills to create a website using WordPress. All that is needed is a bit of research and some creativity to put together the look and feel of the perfect website. In addition, the various options provided by WordPress make it easy for a marketer to be creative and have an idea about how to promote his or her products. WordPress themes provide a great number of possibilities. If a marketer wants to promote a particular product, he or she can search through themes that are built to highlight the best features of that product. As a result, the marketer will only be required to focus on the content and the design of the website rather than the product itself. WordPress themes are affordable. Unlike many online businesses, WordPress comes completely free of charge. Furthermore, there are numerous free themes available. Because these sites are maintained and developed by bloggers themselves, they are often considered one of the cheapest ways to get a site designed and launched. This means that marketers should use WordPress themes for their websites to save money and to ensure that their sites are constantly being updated with fresh content. The WordPress theme offers a wide range of functionality. A typical theme will offer several different options when it comes to styling the website. These include colors and fonts. In addition, the theme may also allow the use of a plug-in for additional functionality such as product reviews and customer management. A great deal of time can also be saved because WordPress offers plug-in development, which means that marketers no longer need to hire someone to write product reviews and manage customer accounts. The WordPress dashboard is user-friendly and allows marketers to quickly and easily change products, change prices, and display information about their products. There is also a lot of room for customization. Marketers can easily create and change their domain names and alter the structure of their URLs. They can also easily set up email campaigns that will send out bulk messages to their subscribers and track the effectiveness of each campaign. The downside to using WordPress themes is that they can be difficult to customize. Many WordPress themes are designed with default formats, which makes it difficult for a business to customize its graphics so that it fits with its product's branding. This is especially true for businesses that focus on a specific product or niche market. In addition, these themes are not compatible with every plug-in available.

7,How to Keep Staff Busy While You’re In Surgery,business," DEAR CATHERINE, I have two staff members that have been with me for a few years, and the rest are new with less than six months with the practice. I have a feeling - when I’m in surgery; there’s not a ton getting done; actually, I know for a fact, one of the staff is spending a lot of time on wedding websites since she’s getting married. What can I do to keep staff busy, ALL of the time – whether I’m there or not? CATHERINE’S ANSWER: Dear Dr. D, Thanks for that question. It’s not uncommon for surgeons to wonder what goes on when they are in surgery or at a conference. Or simply away from the practice. You hope your staff is as productive without you there as they are with you there, but you don’t know, do you? And, does it seem like no matter how many staff you add to your payroll, they still say they don’t have time to do what you want, and they want to hire more staff? And since you have to rely on them, it’s almost impossible for you to know if that’s true or if something else is going on. But in the meantime, you bring more people on board, then your payroll gets out of hand, and pretty soon, you are working just to keep up with the overhead. Here’s what you can do to get a handle on who’s doing what so you have peace of mind: DEFINE YOUR STANDARDS This is when you take off your surgeon hat and put on your leader/visionary hat. The staff looks to you for direction to lead them with clarity and certainty. You must set standards they live by. Otherwise, you have staff sliding through the day with minimal effort instead of rising to the challenge of being their best. Tell them what your vision is for how you want the practice to grow. Explain to them how you want to set up your practice to be positioned against your competitors, so you stand out as the best choice. Constantly remind staff what your goals are for the practice and how intricate each one of them is to your success since you can’t do this alone. That means staff must know what is expected of them – in much more detail than you probably think. You can’t leave things to chance, and you can’t keep saying, “They should know that.” Get it in writing. The goal is to be specific about the results you expect and let them figure out how to get it done. This is what engages them, gets their creative juices flowing, and raises their standards for themselves as well as for the practice. Get Staff Engaged Each person who works for you needs to understand where they fit into the picture and how valuable their position is to the success of your practice. For example, they are not just the receptionist. They are the ambassador to your practice who is the first point of contact for the new prospective cosmetic patient. They are responsible for setting the stage for the entire experience this new patient has with you. This responsibility gives your staff person status and significance which can be a great attitude-changer that changes the way they see themselves. Please get staff input. I guarantee they have lots of good ideas for you if you welcome them. That’s what gets them engaged. Ask for their suggestions on how they could improve the results for their position as well as what improvements can be made throughout your practice to improve the bottom line. Here’s what you’ll discover to help your staff help you: •	How your staff can do 70% of the “heavy lifting” so you have more time to focus on your craft; •	Turn your staff into your professional “Sales Ambassadors” rather than just an overhead expense; •	What your staff can do to position you as the BEST choice over your competitors. CELEBRATE THE WINS Staff must feel appreciated for going above and beyond the minimum effort. They will be more receptive to helping you reach your goals when they feel respected and valued by you. So, acknowledging them for a job well done goes a long way. It doesn’t necessarily have to be money either, it can also be a simple thank you as they walk out the door for the evening or a catered lunch when you’ve had a great month. It’s the acknowledgment of your appreciation that tells them they are valued and respected for their role in helping you grow. How do you hold staff accountable? How do you incentive your staff to do their best?"
8,Selling the Invisible: 4 Key Elements Needed to Promote Cosmetic Surgery Procedures,business," A question I received: DEAR CATHERINE, More and more, I find cosmetic patients coming to me to fix some work they had done elsewhere. Why are they not choosing me initially? I am not the cheapest, but I am fairly priced for my skill and expertise, so what is going on? I cannot imagine why cosmetic patients would risk getting sub-par results just to save money. What am I missing? Dr. C CATHERINE’S ANSWER: Dr. C, That’s a great question. As a plastic surgeon, you’re in a tough position when it comes to promoting the invisible. Your cosmetic surgery services are intangible. Prospective patients can’t “see, touch, feel” your product, so that makes it difficult for them to decipher the quality of work they are paying for. That’s a big reason it’s so difficult for them to decide on you versus your competitors. There’s nothing tangible for them to compare. Cosmetic patients also have to get past the fear of uncertainty and regret. Let’s face it – once they have a cosmetic surgical procedure performed, it cannot be undone or returned. If the procedure was not done properly, or if the patient is not satisfied, they can attempt to have it redone to get the result they wanted, but the initial work cannot be erased and must be dealt with. So, why wouldn’t a cosmetic patient choose you over others? The reality is cosmetic patients are choosing you for so much more than just your medical degrees. HERE ARE 4 KEY ELEMENTS NEEDED TO PROMOTE COSMETIC SURGERY PROCEDURES Product Because your cosmetic services are invisible and do not provide prospective patients with visual clues about function, performance, and benefits, you have to be creative. The way to win over your competitors is to help patients understand what the procedure entails and its value. The procedure description should clearly state: •	What the procedure is – what is performed •	Why the procedure is important – the solution to their problem •	Benefits of the procedure – time saved, reduced costs, improvements made •	Deliverables – what the patient can expect in terms of recovery and assistance People Your staff needs to have the training, tools, attitudes, and image to provide exceptional service. In addition to technical skills, they have got to be patient-centric focused. That means people skills are needed for open communication with the patient, so they are comfortable, and you are living up to their expectations. This not only streamlines the process but it also improves the value of the service the patient perceives they are getting. Process Well-defined processes ensure that the service is provided consistently. This is important for efficiency as well as for the perceived quality of service. For example, your ancillary services may be performed by your staff. However, the patient often expects the service to be provided in a specific way or by a specific individual—and that can pose challenges in assigning staff, managing the process, and ensuring a consistent experience and result. Properly documented processes also make it easier to train new staff that joins you so, they too, provide consistent services. A procedural protocol that runs smoothly is perceived as a sign of quality by the patient and cannot be taken lightly. Physical Evidence This last “P” deals with anything ‘tangible’ or visual. That includes your before/after photos, reviews, and patient testimonials. But it goes beyond that to your image, such as your lobby, location, furniture, marketing materials, hair, shoes, jewelry, clothes, etc. It’s the details that distinguish you and help position you as the best service provider at a fair price. Patients notice if your office is cluttered and not well maintained. Your office has to look at the part and match your practice’s positioning and branding. If you want to be a high-end practice that charges more than your competitors, make sure your office shows it. Creating patient relationships, setting appropriate expectations, and learning to represent your practice in an acceptable way (e.g., through appearance, attitude, and communications) is what encourages patients to say YES to you. For even more strategies to make you stand out from your competitors, check out this online learning module in More Patients Academy: What have you done to differentiate your invisible skills and expertise? What creative ways do you promote your intangible procedures?"
9,Grow a Multi-Million Dollar Plastic Surgery Practice,business," If you want to grow a multi-million-dollar plastic surgery practice with cash-paying patients eager to pay a fair price for your skill and expertise. And have professionally-trained staff promote you as the Best Choice and enjoy a smoothly-run practice that runs like clockwork with OR without you there, then this is the most important post you’ll ever read. But First, a Warning: Before we go further, let me make something abundantly clear: This isn’t one of those “quick fixes” that promises you a fortune for doing nothing. Here’s the thing. The plan I outline for you to run a successful multi-million-dollar cosmetic surgery practice works great for other plastic surgeons I have worked with, and I believe it can help you too. But I’m not suggesting everyone who reads this is going to make a fortune. It’s likely many won’t because they don’t follow the plan or put in the effort it takes to “move the needle” and actually improve their situation. At the end of the day, you are the only person who can make you successful, not me, not a conference, and certainly not an Internet marketer. What I can tell you is that every practice I have consulted with has benefited from my perspective (as you’ll see in their comments below,) so this might be of interest to you. WHAT OTHER PLASTIC SURGEONS SAID ABOUT CONSULTING WITH ME TO DISCOVER HOW TO GROW A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR COSMETIC SURGERY PRACTICE… Very well established, successful multi-surgeon plastic surgery practice in a very competitive area: “We engaged with Catherine for several reasons.  While we run a very successful cosmetic practice, we are always open to discovering new ways to “better our best” in terms of staff, practice structure, and processes.  Given Catherine’s years of “best practice” study around the world, we thought her an excellent choice to help us re-imagine our practice. Catherine was instrumental in setting up a new structure that made our large team of surgeons and staff work together more cohesively. She outlined a plan that put key metrics in place, gave us a clear plan to follow throughout the year, and trained our staff to increase their conversions by at least 10%. We immediately felt a renewed sense of optimism and enthusiasm for our growth. Since engaging with Catherine, I’m happy to report that revenues are up 15% over the last three months – 22% in the last month alone! I highly recommend Catherine’s consulting services to any practice looking for “best practice” additions to their operation.  Her years of experience allow her to bring outside eyes to your practice, recognize what’s off, and recommend concrete actionable plans for improvement. Robert Sigal, MD, President, Austin-Weston – Reston, VA Established, Successful Solo-Surgeon Plastic Surgery Practice “Your on-site practice visit was awesome and invaluable. Thanks to your strong presentation and people skills, you were able to shift the culture in our practice and that has made a significant difference in the way my staff is interacting with my patients. You also made it possible for me to figure out what to do with key staff, and that has allowed me to grow the best team to support my vision for the future. It was money well spent. Thank you.” Armando Soto, MD – FL Facial Plastic Surgery/Dermatology Practice Wanting to Grow Cosmetic Surgery Side of Practice: “We have been very pleased with our relationship with Catherine. her recent evaluation and recommendations for our practice have been extremely helpful. Her experience enabled her to accurately evaluate our practice in its current situation and identify the potential for growth. Her interaction with our staff has been tremendous. She has concrete ideas for marketing our practice, ideas that we can implement immediately. We would recommend her service without hesitation.” Jerold J. Olson, MD – AZ ENT Surgeon Opening a MedSpa Within His Practice: “We were opening up a cosmetic center in our ENT practice, and I needed help figuring out how to profitably grow a cosmetic practice NOW– not years from now. However, there were so many different options. And I was getting pulled in so many directions that I knew I needed someone with experience, in working with practices like ours, who could give me a road map to lead me through the maze to save me time and money. I chose Catherine because I heard her speak at a medical conference, and she was entertaining, knowledgeable, and passionate about helping surgeons grow the cosmetic side of their practice. I also read her book, and that solidified my trust in her. Catherine turned into my “aesthetic coach” who gave me direction and kept me from wasting money when it came to offering specific procedures, technology, and devices. She kept me focused on investing in things proven to grow the bottom line, so I got a lot more bang for my buck than I would have on my own. I am grateful to Catherine for sharing her time and talents with us. Although I originally balked at her fees, I quickly learned how much more value we got from the expertise that saved us a tremendous amount of time and money that would have been wasted. I highly recommend using Catherine’s coaching and consulting services if you want to do it right the first time.” David Hartman, MD – VA Established, Successful Solo-Surgeon Plastic Surgery Practice: “Catherine, sorry for the delayed response. Things have evolved a bit differently from when we last talked. Yes, last year did turn out well, and you and I discussed some of your other suggestions that we had implemented. But I expressed that we didn’t see the effect we had hoped for, and so you and I discussed some other strategies on tweaking the right message, right audience, right medium. I still have yet had time to follow up on implementing the additional, new strategies we discussed in our last phone call. However, I felt the need to reach out and follow up with you because, as it turns out, the suggestions we had implemented that I complained we hadn’t seen any results from….well, I was wrong. In the first quarter this year, our earnings from cosmetic surgery are up 96% over one year ago( last year was slower than usual first quarter) and 44% from our prior best first quarter ever! This increase in revenue was achieved by only adding a few additional patients over that quarter–better patients, better revenue with minimal additional labor on our part. I attribute this to a few things. Implementing your strategy to go “deep” in our marketing efforts in our local community, doing the same ad with better before/after photos of a facelift patient across multiple prints and direct mail pieces, and repeating these over a period of time, the age of our practice in the area and the local economy that continues to improve. The general marketing principles and guidance regarding the location of our practice and principles for future practice marketing and development were sound advice that has proven to be beneficial and true. Thank you for your practical insight and advice. We still have a way to see the full implementation and effect of all of your input, and I am excited to see the results as they unfold! We have enjoyed working with you, and I believe what you offer is unique in the consulting industry for our field. Any practice, at any stage, could benefit from the vast array of consulting information and products your firm offers. we look forward to continuing to seek out your services as we continue to grow!” Leo Lapuerta, MD – Houston, TX New Plastic Surgeon Entering the Marketplace in a Very Competitive Area: “Catherine gave my staff excellent training on how to convert callers to appointments and appointments into procedures. She also showed my staff how instrumental they are in growing my practice and gave them excellent tips on how to network and market me and the practice in the community. I highly recommend working with Catherine if you want to save time, money, and hassle figuring this out for yourself. Working with her is well worth it.” Vishal Kapoor, MD – Beverly Hills, CA Well-established, successful solo-surgeon plastic surgery practice in the very competitive area: “Catherine’s consulting service has paid for itself many times over the investment I made engaging with her. Working with her helped change my perspective of how to run my already successful practice to one that is more streamlined and profitable. The training she gave my staff was also fantastic. I hear my staff using Catherine’s strategies to close more calls and consultations. They are also taking more initiative to implement the strategies Catherine customized for our practice. If you have plateaued or if the gaps in your processes are costing you, Catherine can help. She’s worth every penny.”    Michael Ciaravino, MD – Houston, TX EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET IN THE PLASTIC SURGERY PRACTICE CONSULTING PACKAGE First of all, this isn’t like any other cosmetic surgery practice consulting experience you may have had. There’s no fluff or filler – just real-life tested tactics and strategies that are working right now to grow your own multi-million-dollar cosmetic surgery practice. When you say YES to my on-site practice assessment and consulting services for the next 60 days, we immediately get down to brass tacks so you see exactly what to do, how to do it, and why. And it’s easy to consume. I come to your office for a full-day on-site practice assessment. You and I meet first to go over your objectives and vision. We then map out the exact systems other plastic surgeons personally use to increase their marketing ROI 4-10X and increase their conversions up to 30% within 60 days. I then meet with your staff to ensure you have the right players and then I train them personally to convert more callers and consultations. I do a walk-through of the patient experience to identify the “practice gaps” costing you thousands of dollars per year and I devise a plan to plug up the holes, cross-sell ALL of your services AND get your staff working together as a revenue-generating team. You and your staff get 60 days of support to ensure strategies are executed and old behaviors are replaced with new behaviors so you reach your goals. IT’S ABOUT MORE THAN JUST ATTRACTING NEW PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS. You can use the structure we map out for you to not only get more leads coming into your practice; we’ll also set up a framework and train your staff to increase their conversions by at least 15%. Here’s what you can expect: 10% Increase in Call & Consult Conversions: That’s an extra $630,000 per year when your staff is properly trained. And, it covers my fees easily. So, as I said, there’s more to this time we spend together, “just” consulting. Here’s a fraction of what you’re getting…. •	How to get the phones ringing with your “preferred” cosmetic surgery patients who would gladly pay more for your services even if your competitors are cheaper; •	You need more leads, right? Wrong! Discover the 3 closing statements that actually convert the leads 10-20% more often. •	5 Phone Fixes to convert up to 30% more callers to booked appointments. •	How to hold your staff accountable for promoting you professionally without micromanaging them. •	Where to find cosmetic patients ready to say yes to you NOW. •	How to eliminate the uncertainty of your financial success by having a “practice dashboard” in, so you KNOW for a fact how you’re doing. •	4 Things your coordinator should never say when trying to convert a new cosmetic surgery patient. •	What to do if your staff is not converting consultations and should be following up. Yes, that’s a tremendous amount of strategies to attract more quality cosmetic surgery patients. Here’s What I Want You To Do Next I have made the costs of my consulting services easy for ANY plastic surgery practices to take advantage of this offer by using an “easy pay plan” of only $5K down, $5K at 30 days, and $5K at 60 days. My team and I will go into stealth mode to research your Website, mystery-shop your office and check out your online reputation (the improvements I make from this alone will more than pay my fees). We’ll then set up a strategy call to prioritize your concerns and identify what’s holding you back from all the success you deserve. Then we’ll get a date on the books for my on-site visit and block the time out to work ON your practice. CLICK HERE to get started Oh, and just in case you’re wondering… This is the REAL DEAL I know there are many other consultants out there offering their services for much less. But in this case, you do “Get What You Pay For.” You get solid, proven plans, structures, frameworks, and proven training strategies to execute and profit from NOW…..NOT Months or Years From Now. Time is of the Essence. Here’s why: Your cosmetic practice is unique. You have your unique personality and approach. Your patients and staff also have their uniqueness, so I can’t use a cookie-cutter system. You need a customized approach from someone who has consulted with every type of practice since the Year 2000. That means a ton of hours go into this on my end. However, I have many clients already and I travel a lot for speaking and consulting so there’s only so much of me to go around. So, it’s simply a matter of supply and demand. To give you the personalized service you’re paying for, I can only say yes to the first 3 practices who place their order now by clicking here. After the first 3, I will start a waiting list so you can start a month or two later. Oh…one more thing. You’re also getting a full 30-40 page assessment along with deliverables.

10,Cosmetic Patient No-Shows Are a Problem,business," Cosmetic Patient No-Shows Are a Problem It can be frustrating to watch your staff stand around waiting for cosmetic patient no-shows, and you are also left in a “holding pattern,” which isn’t good for your mood or your pocketbook. There are lots of reasons why cosmetic patient no-shows are happening in your practice: •	We live in a crazy busy world, so patients forget about their appointment and then are too embarrassed to call back; •	They had every intention to show up, but something else came up, so they didn’t bother to let you know; •	They got lost, couldn’t find your office easily, and just gave up. However, when I interviewed patients to learn why they didn’t show up for their appointments, the #1 reason given was… ….they didn’t know you or have a relationship with you, so they didn’t feel an obligation to show up if something else came up or if they changed their mind. My guess is these are Internet Stranger Patients, rather than your current patients with whom you have some type of relationship with. There is just too much chatter out there to “assume” these prospective patients will show up even though they said they would. Of course, there is a lot more you could do at the front end, such as: Send Welcome Packet The more the patient “feels” as if they know you, the more likely they are to show up. So mail or digitally send your “Get to Know Us” that includes a warm welcome letter, before/after photos of other happy patients, patient reviews, thank you notes from grateful patients, information on easy pay plans, directions to your office, and so on. Pre-Consult Call Have your coordinator start the relationship-building process ahead of time by making a friendly and informative call to the prospective cosmetic patient. They can introduce themselves and pre-frame you, the surgeon, as the best choice. Send Reminders Technology has made it easier for you to automatically remind cosmetic patients via email and/or text; however, the human touch will never go out of style. I lay out plenty more strategies in Converting Callers and Converting Consults tools. CHARGE A CONSULT FEE TO AVOID NO-SHOWS? The quickest way to find out how serious a prospective cosmetic patient is - is to charge them a consult fee. Of course, there is a chance you will lose some of these callers who refuse to pay a consult fee; but the ones who do pay it are typically serious enough to respect your time. All you can do is test it. For one month, charge a consult fee and track the following: – How many prospects called or emailed? – How many of them converted to the consult? – How many of them showed up? – How many of those consults said YES? Now check those numbers against your usual numbers when you DON’T charge a consult, fee and there’s your answer! How do you keep cosmetic patient no-shows to a minimum?"
11,"Flackable Kicks Off Marketing Vendor Search, Selection And Intermediary Program",business," Flackable, an award-winning public relations agency representing financial and professional services brands nationwide, today announces a marketing vendor search and intermediary service as part of its latest service expansion. This program, available exclusively to Flackable clients, is designed to support brands with pivotal marketing verticals that are underperforming, neglected or non-existent. The process, led by Flackable founder and president Brian Hart, begins with a detailed marketing audit followed by a diligent search and selection process to onboard the proper marketing freelancer, consultant, agency or provider to fit the unique needs of the client within a predetermined budget. Flackable continues to work as an intermediary between the client and vendor throughout the relationship, conducting periodic evaluations and offering recommendations to serve the best interest of the client. “Many small businesses will hire a novice graphic designer or search engine optimization specialist because that person is a friend of a friend of one of the partners. Those projects can quickly go off the rails,” said Hart. “I’ve seen firms cycle through two or three different website designers over the course of a year, burning time, money and their sanity in the process.” In conjunction with Flackable’s credibility marketing training program unveiled last week, Flackable now offers comprehensive, structured solutions for financial and professional services brands lacking the marketing personnel, experience or infrastructure to translate public relations success into game-changing marketing outcomes. “Hiring one or more marketing vendors can be overwhelming, especially when that responsibility falls on ownership or a single in-house marketing manager. And the decision is often quite consequential,” said Hart. “Given my dynamic marketing knowledge and experience, I can cut through a jargony sales pitch and evaluate the substance and value a marketing vendor can offer. Most importantly, I establish clear expectations and hold them to it.”"

15,The Truth About New Cosmetic Patient Leads,business," The truth about new cosmetic patient leads is that there is nothing fast, easy, or cheap about them for plastic surgeons today. While you do have many options to get noticed from your Internet efforts, new plastic surgery leads are going to cost you either time or money….or both. For example, ➢ You redesign your plastic surgery Website (again), so it’s state-of-the-art. That cost you $10K-$50K. ➢ But now you need to pay your Website folks at least $1K per month to maintain and host it. ➢ Then you add another $1K = $2K per month to continually “SEO” it so you can get found when prospective cosmetic surgery patients google terms such as “breast aug” or “facelift.” ➢ However, if it’s true, SEO is dead. You need relevant, consistent, and informative content that is valuable to your viewers and compels them to click over to your website to learn more, so you outsource your blogging and articles, and that’s another $1K – $5K per month. ➢ Social Media and videos are typically separate from content, so you add another $1K per month to outsource that, BUT, there’s a huge drawback to all of the above efforts. It takes time to build up your credibility, exposure, and authority status for prospective plastic surgery patients to know about you. How much time? Months and years, but you’re impatient for results so…. ….you skip all of that and just “Pay to Play” by throwing money at Google Adwords to run plastic surgery lead ads and hope prospective plastic surgery patients click on your ad that costs you $5-$100 PER CLICK. This route can cost you $5K – $250K per month depending on how competitive your area is and how much your competitors are willing to outbid you. So you spend a bucket load of money to get incoming leads, and the question is…… “What happens next?” I THINK YOU’LL BE SHOCKED AT THE STATS FOR COSMETIC PATIENT LEAD FOLLOW UP: – 48% NEVER Follow Up – Average First Follow Up is 72 Hours Later – The likelihood of contacting a prospective patient decreasing 10X between 5-10 minutes – Chances increase 900% if the prospective patient is contacted in the first 10 minutes How crazy is it to spend a fortune on lead generation but not spend any (or enough) time on the back-end process? How frustrating is it to throw money at plastic surgery patient lead generation that should be building your practice but you’re not sure if it’s a good investment or a waste of money and staff time? WHY DO SO MANY PRACTICES FAIL AT COSMETIC LEAD GENERATION FOLLOW-UP? The truth about new cosmetic patient leads is that your staff may not be following upon them. When I ask staff why they don’t follow up on plastic surgery leads, here’s what they tell me: • Too many leads • Don’t know what to say • No concise plan • Not Required • Not organized • Afraid of rejection • Social Training (don’t be pushy) • No commitment to excellence Let me be blunt here. These excuses are costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars but you don’t see it because it’s the invisible No’s you are getting from bad management of leads. You have got to see new cosmetic patient leads through in a systematic way, or they fall through the cracks, and you just pour more money into the top of the bucket only to have it flow out of the holes at the bottom of the bucket. My Advice: Fix Your Leaky Bucket! 3 WAYS TO TURN YOUR PLASTIC SURGERY LEADS INTO PAYING PATIENTS There’s a huge opportunity for those practices that follow up consistently, strategically, and professionally. Did you know that only 3% of prospective patients searching the Internet are actually ready to move forward NOW? That means you’ve got to be there when the patient is ready, and you stand out as the best solution FIRST – before your competitors jump into the ring. Here’s how: #1) Call-to-Action Options Be convenient to do business with. Patients come in all shapes, sizes, and generations. Let them communicate the way they are most comfortable communicating. Some patients want to pick up the phone and call you, so have your phone number on EVERY page of your website; Other patients want to text you so provide a text number; Still, others want to email you so provide a personal email;  And some prospective patients will fill out your web form but don’t ask for too much on this first encounter. Stick with the basics on your opt-in Web form: • Name • Cell phone • Email • Procedure interested in #2) Collapse Time The 1st to follow up has a 248% greater chance of converting that lead vs. the 2nd or 3rd who followed up. Be in a hurry to help, so you are the first one there when patients are ready. That means getting a practice cell phone that is manned by staff live from, let’s say, 7 am – 11 pm and an app that alerts you when someone fills out your Website form or calls your practice after these hours so you can respond first thing in the morning. Better yet, auto-text them immediately to let them know you received their request, and you’ll get back to them first thing in the morning. Even better, you will get back to them, but in the meantime, here’s a link to check out your YouTube videos to get to know you better, and you look forward to speaking with them first thing in the morning. The bonding process begins the second they reach out to you, so use today’s technology to make it happen. #3) Follow Up Scripts for Hot Leads Does your staff know what to say when following up on incoming cosmetic patient leads that lead to booking a consult? If not, this should help…. Staff needs to “mind their mindset.” Don’t treat this call as a “sales” call. Treat it as a “customer service” call. Said another way, you are NOT SELLING. You are SERVICING a prospective cosmetic surgery patient who wants to look good and feel great. Remember, this prospective patient found you on the Internet, checked you out, and reached out to you. That’s a massive step towards a surgical procedure, so be prepared to handle it professionally. Ask questions and listen during that initial call. For example, “Hi, this is Sue from Dr. X’s office. I am calling you back about your recent inquiry and wanted to see how I can help you. What questions can I answer for you?” Now listen to what they want and learn why they want it. Let them talk! The more they talk, the more you learn, and the more comfortable they get with you. Here are other questions to help you bond with the cosmetic surgery patient caller: – What do you want exactly? – How long has this bothered you? – Why do you want it NOW? – Has anyone you know had it done? If so, what was their experience like? – Have you done much research? – What’s most important to you when choosing a surgeon? Now give them a couple of dates/times they can visit with you and let them pick one. Easy Breezy. So, the truth about new cosmetic patient leads is that it takes work to turn them into paid procedures. Give your patient coordinator the training they need to convert more leads."
16,How the Truck Driver Shortage is Affecting CPG Brands,business," The truck driver shortage has been widely publicized lately as the domestic supply chain still grapples with the post-COVID fallout. As demand for freight services continues to mount, the supply side is having difficulty meeting the needs of shippers. This imbalance has left CPG brands feeling the pinch as more volume enters the freight market than can be reasonably transported. However, a driver shortage is nothing new to the freight market. Industry experts claim that the issue has been persistent in trucking for decades. But the impact of the global pandemic brought the topic directly into the public consciousness as consumers have begun to face out-of-stocks and other supply chain challenges more regularly. As the pandemic winds down, will the truck driver shortage continue to affect the industry? Let’s explore some of the reasons for the demand imbalance and how it is impacting CPG shippers. Truck Driver Shortage Exacerbated by COVID-19 Demand Trucking is a massive industry responsible for hauling the vast majority of goods that make it to the end consumer. Nearly every consumer good rides truck at some point in its journey from manufacturer to destination. According to the American Trucking Associations (ATA), 72.5% of all freight in the US was transported by the trucking industry. That equates to close to 12 billion tons of goods. As a result, the industry is valued at a little over $790 billion. Despite its size, the industry runs notoriously lean. Very few carriers employ excess drivers, and resultantly, disruption can drastically impact the market. With the increased volume brought on by COVID-19, industry forces struggled to keep up. Demand far exceeded supply during the second half of 2020, and we continue to see similar issues. Basic economics dictates that this misalignment will have an upward price pressure, primarily the reason for rate increases that hit freight in 2020. Currently, trucking is over 50,000 drivers short of demand. Recently, the ATA reported that the industry would need to hire approximately 1.1 million new drivers in the next decade to offset strain. That equates to 110,000 drivers per year. And as the current workforce continues to age, the median age for a trucker continues to climb. Why Is There a Truck Driver Shortage? Labor shortages have been a hot-button issue as of late, but this has been looming for quite some time in trucking. Fewer drivers are entering the profession, which is mainly responsible for the shortage. There are several principal reasons for the issue. Let’s explore a few further in-depth. An Aging Demographic The industry is reliant on an increasingly aging segment of the workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average age of a commercial truck driver in the US is 55 years old, suggesting that retiring drivers are not replenished quickly enough. Many believe that because the federal government requires all truck drivers to be 21 or older, the industry fails to attract younger drivers who graduate high school and begin other professions, never giving trucking a second thought. This age requirement makes it difficult to accommodate an increasingly greater demand for freight services from a growing population. Work/Life Balance for Long-Haul Drivers The lifestyle of a truck driver is not as appealing to new generations as previous ones. Rookie drivers often receive difficult long-haul routes that keep them on the road for days and even weeks at a time. The job commands long hours away from home, which can be difficult, dangerous, and stressful. These factors have contributed to fewer participants in the labor force choosing trucking as a profession. Dangerous Occupation Extended hours are not the only cause of driver stress. The job is inherently a dangerous one. According to The Journal of Commerce, truck driving is the eighth most dangerous job in the US. The fatality rate is six times greater than the country’s average, which can narrow its appeal to new applicants. Compensation Struggles Despite its danger and required hours, pay for truck drivers is lagging. The recent boom has raised wages, but not enough to compete with warehousing or other general labor positions. The annual turnover rate for drivers is near 95%, according to recent reports. Almost all drivers leave their job after a year, making it difficult and costly for carriers to fill their seats. Regulatory Environment Regulations in recent years have made trucking less appealing to the workforce. Things like hours of service and drug-testing programs have cleared out their fair shares of drivers. Roughly 55,000 drivers have been barred from the industry since new substance-use laws went into effect in 2020. What the Truck Driver Shortage Means for CPG Shippers There are current efforts underway to decrease the driver shortage; however, because it is a complex situation with many causes, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. As demand for trucking services continues to grow, companies will need to address the issue. Autonomous solutions may one day resolve some of the challenges, but those are more aspirational than practical at this time. Current conditions may persist for quite some time, and as CPG industry experts forecast more of the same on the demand side, shippers can expect to deal with higher rates. Brands may eventually see some capacity relief to close the year. Currently, demand for driver school has increased substantially, as has truck production, which will allow carriers to hire and seat more drivers. Until then, it will benefit shippers to work with a dedicated logistics partner to ensure conditions do not jeopardize profitability. A true freight partner can help your organization accurately forecast costs and find more favorable pricing through consolidation or mode optimization practices."

Companies that operate in this segment must think about developing their own production of this type, first and foremost."
18,Finding a niche to promote,business," Finding a niche to get involved in is as easy as going along to your local supermarket and looking at the magazine stand. Here you will see what people are interested in and paying money to read. I did just that and have compiled a list of specialist magazines which caught my eye, they are: Classic cars Property Boating Hunting Firearms Healthy eating Parenting Running Home renovating gardening These are all general niches. People who purchase these magazines are interested in a niche of a niche; for example, classic car fanatic may be interested in a particular type of classic car. A gardener may not necessarily be interested in growing veggies but rather a particular type of plant such as herbs, ginseng, daffodils, roses, cactus plants or pot plants. Many TV programs cater for niches. One just needs to look through the TV guide of your local newspaper or magazine with TV listings to see that cooking and do-it-yourself building projects are currently two niches featured on TV. Travel and religion are two others which are featured. The fact that these kinds of niches are  made into TV shows is proof enough that there are millions of people worldwide who are interested in such niches when you consider the cost of screening these shows. Another way to find possible niches to promote is to obtain a list of clubs and organisations from your local council or public library. This will give you a sense of what others are interested in. Your local library notice board may give you some ideas as may the notice board at your local supermarket which usually has ads for local organisations. People will prioritise spending in order that their passions will be catered for, therefore it is important to cater for a person's wants rather than their needs. Take a stroll down the main street of your local street and you will see this is the case. You will find shops which cater for niche markets. Then there are the classifieds in many of the magazines which cater for niches. It all gives you a clue as to what niches others are making money from. If sellers are spending money on advertising every week then it just goes to show that the advertising is working and there is a demand for what they are selling. Once you have chosen a niche it is then time to plan a strategy on how to make money from it. It is by no means necessary to just focus on the internet in order to make money from certain niches. Having an offline presence can be useful in bringing money in while developing your online business. Gardening is a great offline niche. In my home town of Greymouth with a population of 11,000 there are several stores where one is able to purchase plants. It shows that there is a lot of money being spent in this niche."
19,Do you need an operating agreement for your Florida LLC,business," ​Most businesses formed in Florida over the past decade or more are limited liability companies or LLCs. Thus, the question often arises as to whether these LLCs need an operating agreement. History of the LLC in Florida Before the LLC, the options for business owners were the partnership or the corporation. Partnerships offered little to no liability protection for the owners. Corporations offered liability protection, but only if certain corporate formalities were respected like documented shareholder meetings. Few small businesses complied with those corporate formalities simply because they had only one or maybe two shareholders. As a consequence, many corporations lost the liability protections of the corporation. The LLC was created to fill the gap between the two and to provide business owners with liability protections without so many corporate formalities. An LLC is essentially a hybrid between a partnership and a corporation. LLCs were specifically authorized under Florida law in 1999 and those laws were updated in 2013. The effect of the Revised LLC Act of 2013 that applied to all LLCs in Florida after 2015 is that taken together those statutes act as an operating agreement but they also impose on business owners the default choices made by the legislature. To weigh which entity is best you might view my article titled Which is better the Inc. or the LLC. ​ How much does an LLC operating agreement cost An operating agreement is really the contract between the members or owners of an LLC. These kinds documents are known as corporate governance documents. It regulates decisions like whether and how LLC members can leave the business, whether new members area allowed to join, and how to value a membership interest.  But the expense of an operating agreement prepared by a business lawyer is not necessarily required for every LLC. LLCs can be divided into two categories; single-member and multi-member.  While a well-crafted operating agreement is never a detriment to any LLC, it may be one that a single-member LLC can save, depending on the circumstances. In order to reduce the costs involved, I utilize a questionnaire that I created to collect the information I need to create the first draft. This eliminates one interaction with the client and saves you money while still giving you a draft that we discuss and edit at the time. The result is a customized operating agreement in less time for less cost. ​ What are the considerations to weigh in deciding whether to have an operating agreement In the case of a single-member LLC, an operating agreement may not necessary because there is just one person making the decisions anyway. In the single-member LLC, an operating agreement can act as a Will for the business though making it easier for a beneficiary to dispose of the assets. This is not necessarily a bad idea because the beneficiary can sometimes sell the business or its assets while they still have value as opposed to waiting for the probate process which can result in the business or its assets deteriorating with you as the owner at the helm. In the case of a multi-member LLC, an operating agreement may be a very smart business decision. If the owners do not agree on what will happen in certain instances, like the death or departure of a member, a dispute can easily evolve between the members. Those disputes are commonly called corporate divorces. Without an operating agreement defining what was agreed to happen, a Florida court cannot easily resolve the corporate divorce. ​ Should I just get an operating agreement off the internet Another consideration is whether to buy a fill-in-the-blanks operating agreement online or hire a good business attorney to prepare the operating agreement. While that choice is purely a business decision, an operating agreement that is not made for the unique needs of your LLC will never address your unique needs very well. One size fits all operating agreements rarely do the trick. They are simply too broad and generic and often leave important questions unanswered because there simply was no one there to ask them. From my many years of experience, I can say that the savings realized by purchasing a pre-formatted operating agreement online always results in increased expenses later when a dispute develops. ​ How safe is my LLC membership interest In 2010, the Florida Supreme Court said that the membership interest in an LLC was a property right subject to judgment enforcement, even if the judgment had nothing to do with the LLC. In other words, back then, you could lose your LLC membership interest if someone got a judgment against you from something like a car accident that was unrelated to the LLC. The Florida Legislature then amended the LLC laws to say that only a member's distribution from a multi-member LLC could be attached with a judgment. The Revised LLC Act expanded that to all LLCs so now only the distribution can be affected with a judgment. So, now your LLC membership interest is more protected than it used to be. ​ Conclusion Smart business owners research decisions before they make them. The time and expense of speaking with a seasoned Board Certified business lawyer to help you decide if you need an operating agreement for your business is worth it. The cost of not doing so will be far greater later if a dispute arises among the LLC owners that could have easily been covered by a good operating agreement."
20,How do I best avoid legal problems in business,business," ​The best way to avoid legal problems that can plague a business and drain its resources is prior planning. Running a business of any size requires business acumen and planning.  Savvy business owners regularly review marketing plans, inventory, and customers to adjust to market changes. Important business documents must be part of that review. ​ Should I review my business legal documents with my lawyer Too often business owners convince themselves that their contracts, non-competes, and other legal documents are fine.  The adage of ""if it ain’t broke"" . . . does not apply well to legal documents. Only the trained eye of an experienced business lawyer knows whether the documents are working as they were intended. So scheduling a review with your attorney of the legal documents you use in business is a smart way to reduce future problems. ​ Another series of documents to review with your corporate attorney are those that your company might receive from other attorneys like demand letters or notices to preserve data and documents. The litigation hold notice as it is called must be reviewed by counsel to determine whether the demand mandates a response and responsive action. As to the ramifications of inaction my articles on what documents a business needs to keep and what eDiscovery is all about are helpful insights into the subject. What should I review with my lawyer An important legal concept to discuss with your business attorney is your liability exposure. Insurance can cover many areas of liability, but self-insuring may be economically advantageous. Discussing premises liabilities during a walk-thru with your business lawyer allows that person to suggest ideas like installing cameras at certain locations. That small cost may save your business thousands of defense dollars later in a baseless slip and fall claim. Likewise, involving your business attorney in planning transactions ensures that the documents address all the important issues. For example, a client of mine has a proprietary weight loss system for large businesses. Most of my client's customers want to know how they achieve such a high degree of success. If my client disclosed that information there would be a possibility that the larger business would try to replicate the process. For that client, I suggested and developed a multi-step program that allowed them to present their information without the risking a catastrophic theft of their trade secrets. ​ Conclusion Low cost planning with an experienced and responsive business lawyer is invaluable. It ensures future success and reduces liability exposure. Savvy business people know that planning and review leads to business success. Legal document review must also be a part of your business planning cycle."

1,Which is better the Inc. or the LLC,business," ​If you Google whether you should choose the Inc. or LLC for your business, you will likely find scores of blogs and articles on the topic. The corporation denoted by Inc. and the limited liability company recognized by the letters LLC are very close. Basically, the LLC is easier to manage in many respects, but which one fits your business depends on several factors. Put another way, the question of whether to LLC or not to LLC is not an easy one to answer, but any sophisticated businessperson will research the issue as you are now doing. ​ What is the history of the Inc. and the LLC Historically, people entered business ventures through partnerships. An easy example is, I have a horse and you have spices, let us take them on the road to sell the spices and split the profits and so forth. But then larger ventures with multiple partners like voyages to the new world required a vehicle more efficient than the common partnership giving birth to the corporation. The first corporation as we comprehend the concept was the English East India Company that was incorporated on December 31, 1600. The difference between an Inc. and the partnership is that a corporation is managed by a board and owned by shareholders whereas the partnership is owned and managed by the partners. Legally, the partnership offered almost no protection to the partners whereas the corporation was a separate legal person insulating the owners and managers. In modern times and in response to changing conditions, back in 1999 the Florida Legislature adopted the LLC as an alternative to the partnership and corporation under Florida law.  The LLC is basically a hybrid in that it appears akin to a corporation but acts like a partnership in many circumstances. Until Florida’s LLC Act was revised in 2013, which applied to all Florida LLCs after 2015, the statutes lacked many default provisions that existed in the corporate and partnership laws.  Fortunately, the Revised LLC Act of 2013 significantly improved on the old Act and serves as an operating agreement if the LLC owners choose not to have one. ​ What are corporate governance documents like operating agreements The entities like the partnership, corporation, and LLC, can be regulated by their internal documents or by the statutes if none exist. These documents are called the governing documents of the business because the do exactly that; they provide guidance for when certain events occur like the death or departure of an owner. For a partnership the governing document is the partnership agreement. For the LLC it is an operating agreement and corporations use bylaws and a shareholder agreement. From that you can recognize that one document is cheaper than two, which is why many businesses select the LLC in Florida because you only need one document as opposed to two. ​ What are some advantages of the LLC With the advent of the LLC in Florida, the partnership has largely fallen out of favor. In the 1990s there were revisions to the partnership laws that tried to bring partnerships closer to what became the LLC, but partnerships simply do not offer the level of protection that LLCs and corporations do. Further, when business owners look to the courts to resolve internal disputes between the owners, they must recognize that few active judges practiced at a time before the LLC, therefore, it is more challenging for them to resolve disputes in partnerships than with LLCs. Judges today are more familiar with LLCs from their time in private practice so using the LLC increases the chances that a dispute will be correctly resolved. ​ How do I decide if I need an operating agreement So while the choices seem to narrow to the LLC or the corporation for most, if after consulting with a qualified business lawyer you opt to use the LLC, the next choice is often whether to spend the money on an operating agreement at all or to have one prepared by a business attorney versus downloading one from a website. Naturally, as a Board Certified expert business lawyer, I am partial to the professionally prepared option, but not because of the financial benefit but because generic online documents rarely if ever fit the unique needs of any business and normally cannot be modified or modified to fit those needs. The old saying of penny wise, pound foolish applies here. Those who try to save a small amount of money by buying a generic governing document later incur much more money in legal fees to fix a problem. As one who has litigated and tried many of these corporate divorce disputes as they are called before judges and juries, I can attest to the fact that the amount to remedy and resolve the dispute far exceeds the amount that it would have cost to have proper governing documents like an operating agreement prepared by a seasoned business lawyer. ​ Conclusion In sum, whether to choose the LLC for your business as opposed to the corporation or partnership is a decision predicated on many factors that is best made after a brief consultation with a good, solid business attorney. Also, whether you need an operating agreement now or can do that later is a business decision that you make after you collect the facts and educate yourself on the options as a sophisticated and smart business owner."
2,Trademark your business logo,business," Marketing and advertising are a critical part of the success of any business. The unique logo or trade name that a business uses is integral to those efforts. Given the time and money that a business puts into developing and promoting its logo it is wise to protect that with a trademark. Benefits of trademarking your business logo Trademarking in Florida is a simple process by which your business can take advantage of the protections provided under Florida law. A trademark communicates that your logo is registered and protected. Trademarks are regulated in Florida by Chapter 495 of the Florida Statutes. Contrary to popular belief a trademark does not prevent another party from copying your logo. What a trademark does is give the owner a greater ability to combat any infringement by availing itself of the benefits put in place in Florida law. Without a trademark a business would have more to prove and would have to overcome defenses of fair competition in most cases. With a valid registered trademark the business need only prove that another party used its protected logo, symbol, or name without its permission to be entitled to an injunction and damages under the statutes. In addition to providing protection to your business logo, symbol, name, or catchphrase a trademark gives your business the flexibility of licensing its protected mark to other businesses for a fee under a licensing agreement the Firm prepares. This can enhance the mark, provide added visibility and recognition for the mark, and increase its value and that of your business. Likewise if you trademark your business logo, symbol, name, or catchphrase that can add value to your business should you later sell the business or the assets as the protected intellectual property is an important asset of the business. How do you trademark your business logo in Florida Registering a trademark in Florida is a relatively simple process using the form provided on the Sunbiz website. The form explains how to properly complete the registration. The current cost is $87.50 per class and the registration is good for five years. The trick to properly completing the form is to disclaim any trademark to common terms or symbols. For example the logo of the Law Office of David Steinfeld consists of a courthouse and the letter ""e"" with computer code embedded in it. That electronic ""e"" represents that the Firm is all digital and leverages technology to provide a more efficient service particularly in the area of electronic discovery. But the trademarked logo is the combination of those two components because a business cannot trademark a courthouse or the letter ""e"" by themselves. Without disclaiming any interest to those components the trademark application would fail. So this is something to bear in mind when you consider applying for a trademark for your business logo or name. What is a service mark versus a trademark Basically a service mark is designed to protect a service your business performs and a trademark protects a product your business sells. In practical application arguably the trademark is more commonly recognized but if your business provides a service it can use either the SM or TM marks once approved and registered with the State. Under Florida law a service mark is defined as any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, used by a person to identify and distinguish the services of such person, including a unique service, from the services of others, and to indicate the source of the services, even if that source is unknown. Titles, character names, and other distinctive features of radio or television programs may be registered as service marks notwithstanding that the person or the programs may advertise the goods of the sponsor. A trademark as defined in the Florida Statutes means any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, used by a person to identify and distinguish the goods of such person, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods, even if the source is unknown Should I register nationally, locally, or both State registration in Florida entitles a business to use either the TM or SM marks on its logo, name, or whatever it successfully registers. The circle ""R"" symbol - ® - is only allowed for logos or phrases approved by the US Patent and Trade Office that regulates federally registered marks. The difference between the two is that marks registered in Florida are afforded the benefits of Florida law whereas marks registered federally are protected under federal law in every state in the union and territories in which federal law applies. But registering a mark with the USPTO costs much more than $87.50 per class and takes longer than registering with Florida. There are attorneys that specialize in intellectual property with whom the Law Office of David Steinfeld works. The Firm litigates intellectual property disputes such as trademark infringement but does not register the marks. It is often easy enough for a business to register with Florida and the Firm recommends IP transactional attorneys to clients interested in registering at the federal level. David Steinfeld can guide your business as to whether a trade or service mark is right for you and whether Florida or federal registration will provide an appropriate level of protection for your company. Conclusion Some attorneys occasionally give advice that they do not follow themselves but the logo of the Law Office of David Steinfeld is trademarked in Florida. This is denoted by the small “TM” at the bottom right of the logo and communicates that the Firm follows advice it gives to its clients. The logo or catchphrase of any business is something into which a great deal of time and energy is often placed and a source of pride for the business. Trademarking your business logo, symbol, name, or catchphrase is an easy process in Florida and allows the business to take advantage of the protections afforded under Florida law."
3,My Speaking Trip to Saudi Arabia,business," My speaking trip to Saudi Arabia was a lifetime experience, and I am grateful for the memories. I spoke at the Jeddah Injection Boot Camp in Jeddah. Check out the photos on Instagram and Facebook. They welcomed me with 5-star accommodations (business class, limos, and the Ritz) and treated me like royalty. A couple of interesting facts include: •	Jeddah is where our conference was and is considered the most “liberal” city compared to other cities like Riyadh; •	More than 50% of the people work for the government and are well taken care of; •	Many of the doctors I met studied at Mt. Sinai in NY It was fascinating to learn more about a culture so different than mine. And, at the same time, learn that we are not so different after all… Here are 3 ways the Saudis are similar to us when it comes to cosmetic rejuvenation: That surprised me since the females are covered up in black burqas, hijabs, and abayas, and the men wear colored headscarves and white robes, but once again, the saying, “Vanity knows no bounds” is still true no matter where you live. And just like us, they like big full lips, plump cheeks, wrinkle-free skin, and hair! They also like breast augs and liposuction. I visited a popular cosmetic clinic where one waiting area was full of women completely covered in black burqas wanting injectables and laser hair removal, while another waiting area was full of men in white robes and headscarves wanting hair restoration. Who knew? As in any marketplace, the increase in consumer demand also increases the supply of cosmetic providers. That’s why these conferences are happening throughout the Middle East. The doctors want to learn the cash side of medicine and cater to the demand, so they get hands-on training. Several doctors I spoke with are currently working in a government hospital but have a goal of going private. Sound familiar? A famous plastic surgeon who has been in practice for 25 years attended my branding and marketing presentation, and he was telling me how much things have changed dramatically within the last few years. He was always very busy and lived off of word-of-mouth and very little advertising. However, the younger doctors are entering the marketplace and using Instagram to attract patients, so he is losing to them. So, he was at the conference to learn and grow. Good for him! By the way, they all know the Kardashians and credit them for increasing the demand for cosmetic services! I told them to start their own “Real Housewives of Saudi Arabia,” so we’ll see Suffice it to say, this was a magical trip, and it was a pleasure meeting everyone. I thank them for their hospitality and friendliness."
4,Top Ways to Attract More Plastic Surgery Patients in 2021,business," In order to get your fair share of the cosmetic rejuvenation revenues, here are the top ways to attract more plastic surgery patients in 2021. But as you will see, it takes more than just plastic surgery leads to grow your practice. GET MORE PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT LEADS IN 2021 Of course, new leads are the lifeblood of your plastic surgery practice, but where are they coming from? Are you counting on free organic search for new patients to find you? If so, you may be disappointed since organic SEO is no longer the “go-to” search rankings strategy. It’s not so easy to get ranked organically because there’s a good chance The Aesthetic Society and American Society of Plastic Surgeons websites will rank over you because they are considered authority sites. And you can’t compete with this as a solo practitioner in one city. So maybe you’re putting a lot of money into Pay Per Click Ads but losing to your competitors who are willing to outbid you. Google Adwords is an expensive game to play because you are attempting to grab the attention of the 3% of those who click on those ads are ready to move forward. The other 97% are still in research mode. The secret to advertising is to go where others are not, so you have a better chance of grabbing the attention of would-be patients. This year, the emphasis is on social media, and the strategy is focused on lead generation versus lead fulfillment. So, rather than spend a fortune on Google Adwords to go after the 3% who are ready, you use social media ad campaigns to go after the 30% of the market who COULD be ready. But once you get those plastic surgery leads, then what? Here are more top ways to attract more plastic surgery patients in 2021: FOLLOW UP ON INCOMING PLASTIC SURGERY LEADS As mentioned above, only 3% of prospective cosmetic patients are ready to move forward NOW? And another 30% “could” be ready to move forward if nurtured? But look at the stats when it comes to staff following up on leads: ✓48% NEVER Follow Up ✓Average First Follow Up is 72 Hours Later ✓Only 25% of practices make 2 contact attempts ✓64% of practices do NOT have an organized way to follow up on leads But it’s not your staff’s fault. They have not been given the tools, tips, and strategies to follow up professionally and consistently. For example, it takes at least 8 points of contact to get someone’s attention; however, most practices give up after the 1st or 2nd attempt. STAFF MUST CONVERT PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT CALLERS AND CONSULTS Every practice’s success is limited by their staff’s ability to convert callers to appointments and appointments to paid procedures. It is way too competitive to be mediocre at this stage of the lead process. Be honest. Do you have the right person representing you on the phone? If not, it doesn’t matter what you do or how much you spend to get new plastic surgery patients if they can’t get past your gatekeeper. Or maybe you have a great receptionist, but you’re not sure about your coordinator because the conversion rates are low…So you wonder: Is it your coordinator? Is it the patients? Is it something else? To ensure your coordinator is NOT the problem, please be sure they are trained to: •	Position you, the surgeon, as the BEST CHOICE; •	Qualify the patient to prepare them for the quote presentation; •	Present with confidence to get the patient excited about moving forward; •	Move them closer to choosing your services; •	And, ultimately, ask for a decision. Most coordinators don’t ask because they haven’t been trained to do so comfortably and professionally, so don’t make that mistake. And lastly, STAY IN TOUCH SO YOUR PLASTIC SURGERY RETURN AND REFER Just because prospective patients don’t say yes right away, doesn’t mean never. They may simply be saying “not yet,” so nurture that relationship. Because there are all sorts of reasons, prospective patients delay and procrastinate. Life could have gotten in the way, so when you keep in touch, you stay top-of-mind, so they call you rather than your competitors when they are ready to move forward. There is even more leverage and opportunity right under your nose to double your results when you also stay in touch with your established patients who already know, like, and trust you and who would gladly return and refer if prompted. As a matter of fact, the new year mantra is: Retention is the 2021 New Patient Attraction Strategy that costs very little time and money but adds up to easy profits. Many of those patients would gladly return and refer if given the opportunity. But when you take them for granted, they feel neglected and go to someone else who takes better care of them. That’s bad because cosmetic patients have endless needs…especially as the aging process continues. Think, “Patient for Life” since that’s where all of your leverage is since you spent a fortune to attract that patient to you, and it takes minimal cost and effort to keep them. Check out my new report, Cosmetic Patient Attraction Plan for 2021, to get the details of other top ways to attract more plastic surgery patients in 2021."
5,STAY OF EXECUTIONS UNDER CAMEROON PENAL LAWS,business," At the end of a trial, a convict can be given an imprisonment sentence or a pecuniary sentence. An imprisonment sentence would mean loss of liberty and the maximum is life imprisonment. The parties equally have the right to apply for a stay of execution of the court order. A stay of execution is a court order to temporarily suspend the execution of a court judgment or other court order. The word “execution” does not necessarily mean the death penalty although it can; it refers to the imposition of whatever judgment is being stayed. It is similar to an injunction. A stay can be granted automatically by operation of law or conventionally, when the parties in a civil or criminal case agree that no execution shall occur for a certain period. If a party appeals a decision, any judgment issued by the original court may be stayed until the appeal is resolved. GROUNDS TO STAY EXECUTION The primary role of the courts is to do justice to both the contending parties and the society at large. After all the evidence is taken and addresses done, it is critically important that the judgment should inspire societal confidence. The best test of this is where both litigants and the ordinary bystander go away feeling that justice has been done and not otherwise. The quality of the judgment is naturally the exclusive basis for determining whether justice has been rendered the parties in a specific case or not. This being the case, the judge both trial and appellate must be scrupulous and conscientious in writing his judgment . Nothing should be left to chance. By section 37(2) of the Constitution 1996, the judge is obliged to be guided only by his conscience in deciding a matter before him. In some cases the judge may have to stay the execution of the judgment. This may be as a result of certain considerations or reasons. The reasons for stay of execution are examined below. 	False identity of the convict The court may stay execution where the person convicted is the wrong person or is not the person who actually committed the crime. According to Section 10 of the Cameroon Criminal Procedure Code , where in the course of the investigation or trial, it is established that a person has usurped a civil stains or has been convicted under a false identity, the proceedings shall be stayed until such identity is rectified, at the instance of the Legal Department which shall, to this effect, and as the case may be, refer the issue to the competent judicial identity service or to the court whose decision contains the error on the identity of the convict. In the case of Lorence Acha Mbah and Oben Luis Oben Vs. The People of Cameroon , the court held that the Legal Department cannot refuse to execute a court order merely because they are aggrieved by it and so the order can only be suspended where there is a false identity. 	In case of pecuniary sentence In the case of Nduh John and Mudang Johnson Vs. The People , the court held that there are two reliefs available to a convict against whom an imprisonment warrant has been issued. First he may forestall or terminate the execution of the warrant by payment of the pecuniary sentence. Secondly if the warrant has been executed and he is incarcerated, he may suspend execution of the warrant by furnishing a surety guaranteeing payment of the pecuniary sentence within 2 months from the day following the signing of the recognizance by the surety. Section 561 of the Criminal Procedure Code  is to the effect that the President of the Court of First Instance of the place of execution of the warrant shall rule in chambers on the application, after hearing the convict and the proposed surety. Such a ruling shall not be subject to appeal. Where the application is granted, the President shall explain to the surety the consequences of his recognizance and shall request him to sign a document by which he shall undertake to pay the debt or failing that, to be subjected to imprisonment in default in place of the convict on expiry of the time limit provided for in section 560  of the same code. After the surety has read and signed the recognizance, the President shall cause the debtor to be released forthwith. Notice of the ruling shall be served forthwith on the Superintendent of Prison and a copy each shall be forwarded to the President and the Legal Department of the court that issued the imprisonment warrant. 	Where a civil claim is attached to a criminal action According to Section 59(1) of the Cameroon Criminal Procedure Code, the commission of any offence may lead to the institution of criminal proceedings and as the case may be, to a civil action. The institution of criminal proceedings aims at procuring a sentence or a preventive measure against an offender as provided by law  and civil action is intended to provide compensation for damages resulting from an offence . In Cameroon, Criminal proceedings shall be instituted and prosecuted by the Legal Department. They may also be instituted by any government department or by the injured person under the conditions laid down by law . And so according to Section 61 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a civil claim may be made alongside a criminal action before the same court so long as they arise from the same offence. It may also be brought separately from a criminal action. In the case of Nkweta Paul & 2 Ors Vs. The People & 2 Ors , the court held that a civil claim may be made alongside a criminal action before the same court so long as they arise from the same offence. And that anyone who alleges that he suffered injury as a result of the commission of an offence may make an oral or written application for damages in court. The application for damages by a civil party shall be made before the end of the proceedings otherwise it shall be inadmissible. And in such a case, the court seized of the civil matter shall stay proceedings until a final decision on the criminal action has been pronounced. In the case of withdrawal of a civil claim the situation is different. The withdrawal of a civil claim may not stay criminal proceedings except otherwise provided by law . 	In case of an application to set aside a judgment Once the court has delivered its judgment, it can be set aside. Section 427 of the Criminal Procedure code is to the effect that with the exception of the Legal Department, any party to the case may file an application for the setting aside of a judgment in default. However, if a civil party has been duly served but does not appear in court or does not submit or is not represented at the trial and does not sufficiently excuse his absence, he shall be considered as having abandoned his civil action. In such a case, he shall not be allowed to apply for the setting aside of the judgment delivered. If prosecution was commenced by the defaulting civil party, the court shall limit itself to the criminal proceedings after the submissions of the Legal Department. In case of any application to set aside a judgment in default, the execution to the judgment shall stayed. However, the warrant issued by the court or the award granted in accordance with the provisions of section 392  shall remain enforceable . The application to set aside a judgment in default may be limited to the criminal or civil aspect of the judgment . In case of an application to set aside a judgment in default, the court that delivered the judgment shall have jurisdiction to try the matter de novo . (2) If the convict has been arrested by virtue of a warrant of arrest issued by the trial court that delivered the judgment in default, the matter shall be listed for the next hearing or at the latest within seven (7) days of the application to set aside the judgment, failing which he shall be released on bail, if he fulfils one of the conditions provided for in section 246 (g) . The time-limit for applying to set aside a judgment shall be ten (10) days from the day following the date of personal service of the judgment on a convict who resides in Cameroon . It shall be three (3) months as from the day following the date of personal service of the judgment on a convict who resides abroad . If service of the judgment was made in accordance with section 57, the time-limit for the application shall be ten (10) days with effect from the day following service . Where within the prescribed time-limit there is an application to set aside a judgment in default and appeal against the same judgment, the application to set aside the judgment shall be dealt with before referring the matter to the Court of Appeal . If, however, the Court of Appeal has begun hearing the appeal before the ruling is made on the application to set aside the judgment, any interested party may draw the court's attention to the existence of such application. In such a case, the court shall stay the hearing of the appeal until the application in dealt with . 	In case of an appeal Every judgment including that delivered by a Military Court, shall be subject to appeal, unless otherwise provided by law  and according to Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, those who have the right to appeal in a case include a) the convict; b) the person vicariously liable; c) the insurer, if he has been a party to the proceedings; d) the civil party; e) the State Counsel; f) the Procureur General at the Court of Appeal; g) the government department which commenced the prosecution as provided for in section 60 of this code. Section 453 of the Criminal Procedure Code is to the effect that all appeal shall stay the enforcement of the judgment. However, all custody warrants shall remain enforceable and the provisional awards made to a civil party in accordance with the provisions of Section 392 (1) shall be paid to him. When it comes to appeal, there is an exception. That is, where an appeal would not have the effect to stay the execution of the judgment. Section 503(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that “An appeal to the Supreme Court shall not stay the execution of a judgment; in particular: (a) any warrant either issued or upheld by the Court of Appeal shall continue to produce its effects; (b) measures of judicial supervision ordered or confirmed by the Court of Appeal shall continue to produce their effects; (c) where there is an acquittal or suspended sentence or a fine by the Court of Appeal or where the term of imprisonment is less or equal to the time spent in detention, the appellant in detention shall be immediately released, subject to the provisions of section 393.” Subsection (2) goes further to state that, however; the accused may apply to the Supreme Court for suspension of the measures of judicial supervision, or the cancellation of the warrant. Section 505(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code is to the effect that the laws in force relating to stay of execution of civil awards shall be applicable before the Supreme Court and subsection further provides that “The President of the Supreme Court or the President of the section that he delegates for this purpose, shall decide alone on the application for stay of execution of civil awards referred to in sub-section (1) after receiving the submissions of the Procureur General.” 	In case of an application to review a case According to Section 535(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, a review of criminal proceedings may be applied for in favour of any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanour in the following circumstances: 	When, after a conviction for murder fresh evidence is adduced to prove that the alleged victim is still alive; 	When it is found, after conviction, that the person convicted was innocent even if he was responsible for the error that misled the court; 	 When a person other than the person convicted admits before credible witnesses that he committed the felony or misdemeanour and confirms such admission before a judicial police officer; 	When, after a conviction, new documents or facts have come to light and are of such a nature as to establish the innocence of the person convicted. Section 535(2) of the same code is to the effect that an application for review shall be admissible only when the judgment has become final. Section 536 of the same code provides that “The enactment of a new law shall not constitute a ground for review.” The right to apply for review shall be exercised by:  the Minister in charge of Justice ; the convict or, in the event of his disability, his legal representative ; any person interested in doing so, in the event of the death of the convict or his having been judicially declared absent . Section 537(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that “The application for review shall not be subject to a time-limit.” The application for review together with a copy of the judgment appealed against and any other supporting document shall be submitted to the Procureur General of the Supreme Court, who shall prepare the case file and submit it to the court . According to Section 541(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, when the court finds that the application is admissible but is not ready hearing, it shall, by an interlocutory ruling, order all necessary measures of inquiry. In such a case, if the sentence has not been executed, its enforcement shall be stayed or suspended. CONCLUSION A stay of execution is a court order to temporarily suspend the execution of a court judgment or other court order. A stay can be granted automatically by operation of law or conventionally, when the parties in a civil or criminal case agree that no execution shall occur for a certain period. There are challenges faced in Cameroon when it comes to the dispensation of criminal justice. The challenges are both procedural and substantive. The procedural challenges have to do with the challenges faced by litigants during preliminary investigations; that is police investigations and the preliminary investigations by the Examining Magistrate. The substantive challenges have to do with the challenges faced by the litigants in the enjoyment of their rights during and after the trial. The procedural challenges include the lack of practice directions, illegal detentions and substantive challenges include the lack of judicial independence, politicization of the criminal justice system and the undue delays of certain criminal proceedings in court.

6,How Plastic Surgery Marketing Will Change in 2021,business," Wow, the world of advertising is changing and how plastic surgery marketing will change in 2021. Not very long ago, it was enough to update your website, use keywords, and backlinks, and search engines found you. Not anymore. The Internet has gotten too crowded, and Google has gotten a lot stricter about who gets ranked. For example, if you do a Google search, “liposuction surgeon,” you will most likely see The Aesthetic Society and American Society of Plastic Surgeons come up first way before you’ll see a solo plastic surgeon’s website. That’s because the big boys have authority over solo plastic surgeons. So what do you do to combat this? When you understand how plastic surgery marketing will change in 2002, you’ll want to do this to get new plastic surgery patients to find you: MULTI-CHANNEL MARKETING FOR PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS There is no one thing you can do in today’s world to attract new prospective patient surgery patients. It takes all sorts of different communications, all working together to get the attention of would-be patients. That means you must have a multi-channel marketing plan that includes at least these channels: •	SEO •	Pay Per Click •	Content Marketing •	Social Media •	YouTube •	Banner Ads •	Directories The more channels you use, the better off you’ll be. Yes, this costs money, time, and effort like everything else that is worth pursuing; however, be smart about it and work with the pros. So you and your staff don’t get bogged down in the details. OPTIMIZE PLASTIC SURGERY LEAD CONVERSIONS Internet Advertising is becoming more and more expensive. The only way you’ll be able to compete is by optimizing your conversions of the leads you do get. Prospective plastic surgery patients are clicking like crazy due to the insane amount of information coming their way. So even though they may have clicked on your website or social media platforms, that doesn’t mean they are ready to call you. There’s a good chance they need nurturing. So they feel comfortable enough to go to the next step. So back-end marketing funnels are going to be more important than ever before because it’s tough to get prospective patients to engage right out of the gate. Just like any relationship, they need to be courted. You need to build familiarity with that prospective patient so they get comfortable enough with you to actually call and visit. INCREASE A PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT’S VALUE It’s almost impossible to “burn and churn” through your plastic surgery patients…it’s too expensive and exhausting to constantly find new patients. The smarter way to grow a plastic surgery practice is to creatively encourage your current patients to return more often, spend more at each visit and refer their friends and family. That doesn’t happen by accident. Everyone is too busy and focused on themselves to care about growing your practice so they need your help. Stay in touch with these patients so they become your sales ambassadors! Want to learn more about how plastic surgery marketing will change in 2021?"
7,Patient Consultations are NOT Converting!,business," I often hear from surgeons like you, they have a nice office and great staff, but their patient consultations are NOT converting. For some reason, the problem is in getting new prospective patient consultations to say yes to surgery, but you don’t know what to do differently. You may be spending up to an hour with the prospective patient, and then your coordinator spends time with them, and they still don’t book. Ugh! So, you have a full day of consultations, back-to-back who do NOT book surgeries or other big-ticket procedures. What a waste of time and energy! Plastic surgeons tell me regularly how their consultation conversion rate used to be in the high 70’s, but many have fallen to 20-35%, so they ask themselves…. “Why aren’t we booking more consultations!?!” THE QUALITY OF YOUR PATIENT CONSULTATIONS To answer that question, the first place to start is with the quality of the prospective cosmetic surgery patient you are attracting. Remember that computer term, “garbage in – garbage out,” and I don’t mean anything bad about the patient as a person. I’m only referring to their quality as a cosmetic surgery patient….big difference. By that, I mean how mentally, physically, and financially prepared are they to move forward with cosmetic surgery? Don’t you want to know that BEFORE you spend your valuable time with them? If your patient consultations are NOT converting, here’s what you want to consider BEFORE meeting them: WHERE DID YOUR NEW PATIENT CONSULTATIONS COME FROM? Where a patient came from is your first indication of the quality of that patient. If they came from their girlfriend or sister who got fantastic results from you, you are as close to getting a yes as you can be. If they came from your killer before/after photos and your 5-star online patient reviews, that’s pretty good too. However, if they came from the Internet – beware. The Internet has created short attention spans and click-crazy would-be cosmetic patients, so it’s tough to get their attention. And even when you do, you can lose it just as fast when they run across your competitors, and now they vacillate and change their minds. DID THE NEW PROSPECTIVE PATIENT BOND WITH YOU BEFORE THEIR VISIT? If your patient consultations are not converting, it could be because there is no connection. Your coordinator needs to be seen as the patient’s “aesthetic advisor” so they are comfortable enough to open up to the coordinator and tell them what they want and why they want it; along with other important personal information. Several poignant questions need to be asked to help ensure this patient has the mental and physical health and the financial wherewithal to move forward. IS THE PROSPECTIVE PATIENT INFORMED? It may feel counter-intuitive but the more informed a cosmetic surgery prospective patient is at their consultation, the more likely they are to book. Most surgeons I know like to use their time with the patient educating them since it helps them bond with the patient; however, that can also work against you. While the patient appreciates the information, this could be new to them, so they are going to have the dreaded response….. “I gotta think about it.” So they don’t book their consultation. They go back to the Internet to research even more, and you may never see them again. A great way to avoid that is to prepare a private page on your Website and name it your Patient Resource Center. This page includes a Welcome Video from you telling the patient you’re excited to meet them and inviting them to check out your FAQ, videos where you personally explain the procedure and address the common objections you get. This way, the patient is more informed when they meet you and has intelligent questions to ask you that they have already thought a lot about. So when you address those, you are that much closer to a yes. You also save a lot of time. Are you seeing how much detail goes into the consultation process? I can help simplify that for you and your coordinator with my latest work to help you convert more consultations. INTRODUCING……THE CONVERTING CLUB FOR PATIENT COORDINATORS This is a private club where I train your coordinator(s) to convert more consults by at least 15%. When your patient consultations are not converting, you need the competitive edge, so your staff is professionally trained to educate them, so patients choose you as the BEST CHOICE. Here’s what The Converting Club includes: •	Video Training Library of me personally explaining strategies for each step of the process; •	Quizzes to help your coordinator retain what they learn •	Monthly Q&A Calls for added motivation and strategies that work •	Weekly Metrics for accountability •	Coaching Calls to go over metrics and fine-tune their process Contact me for more information!"
8,"7 Amazing Ways to Save Money on Exhibition Stands, Secret made easy with Creative Roots",business," Looking for a budget exhibition stand in the UAE? As an exhibitor, your exhibition budget will be one of your primary concerns, no matter whether you're a first-timer or long-time veteran. It is important to monitor your expenses when exhibiting because if you don't, you will soon lose your budget along with your prospect of a good ROI. However, there are some areas where we could save some money, such as exhibition stand designs and display stand designs. Ideally, an exhibition stand should reflect a brand, appeal to a specific audience, and provide a memorable experience. Often, all these requirements may not be affordable as a package, so how can we save money without sacrificing quality and design? If an exhibition stand is properly planned, even a small exhibition stand can reap more benefits than a large one that has no planning. Many exhibitors make wrong budgeting decisions because they don't account for all the variables in an exhibit. When planning a budget exhibition stand, it is crucial to identify the factors that could impact your budget. Here, we have compiled a handy list of tips to help you manage your exhibition finances effectively. Listed below are the 7 best tips we have put together: 	EXHIBIT EARLY 	START MODULAR 	RECYCLING AND REPURPOSING 	RATHER RENT THAN BUY 	EDUCATE STAFF 	SEEK OUT THE BEST EXHIBITORS 	LESS TECHNOLOGY MEANS LESS COST EXHIBIT EARLY The best way to save on your exhibition costs is to plan well ahead of time. Ideally, you should allow 9 to 10 months when planning your exhibition, although ""too early"" is never the answer. Your options will be more flexible if you have plenty of time to explore all of them. With more time to explore all of your exhibition costs, you will enjoy more flexibility. Also, you can take advantage of early bird offers from the organizers. Businesses that leave it too late to arrange their exhibition often incur extortionate rush fees. Early planning gives you time to find value-for-money suppliers and services and to negotiate better rates. Using a modular exhibition stand, you can easily customize the dimensions to fit various exhibiting spaces, so you can utilize it for multiple events. Although you may have to spend more initially, you will undoubtedly save on new stands over time. Consequently, you will be able to plan and design the flexibility for your graphics and stand structure from day one. As a result, you can use the same stand at every conference or exhibition no matter how different your space is from show to show. RECYCLING AND REPURPOSING Exhibition stands are expensive for one-time use. It is still worth considering using a reusable stand, even if you do not have any further shows scheduled. A reusable stand will have a longer life than just one show. Exhibitors often overlook the fact that modular exhibition stands provide more ROI than custom stands that are built to be used only once. However, many companies inflate their modular stands' re-usability when they're not. Your exhibition stand does not have to look exactly the same if you use it again. You can repurpose your exhibition stand by talking to your designer, and they can create a stand that is unique every time you exhibit. RATHER RENT THAN BUY It is significantly less expensive to hire an exhibition stand instead of purchasing one. By renting a custom stand, you can achieve your goals while avoiding the extra costs associated with purchasing and storing stands. Alternatively, renting a stand can be a great option if you plan to exhibit at multiple events but want a different design for each show. This can be accomplished by changing the layout according to each event. EDUCATE STAFF Your exhibition staff is your most effective marketing asset, and they can speak for your exhibit. As a result, you'll need to budget for staff expenses. Besides paying your staff, you should also consider training them. Since your company and brand will be represented at the event by the people who work at your exhibition, it is essential that you invest in the right staff. SEEK OUT THE BEST EXHIBITORS Choosing an exhibition company that does every aspect of your exhibition in-house is without a doubt the most cost-effective method of exhibiting. Any exhibition company outsourcing stand design, graphic design, and printing to third parties are essentially paying them to do it and adding a markup to the cost. An alternative would be to find everything else yourself and use the exhibition company's in-house services. If you hire more individual services, your exhibition will be more expensive. Any good exhibition will take care of all aspects of your exhibition stand process, without any risky sub-contracting any service to outsiders. This not only means you don’t get charged an unexpected markup on prices but also guarantees quality control for your exhibition. For more information, please visit Exhibition stand Designs. LESS TECHNOLOGY MEANS LESS COST Any exhibitor who has ever participated in an event knows that many hidden costs are involved, including the electrical costs. Due to the fact that you have to book these services directly with the show's electrics contractor, the rates you pay are not in your exhibit stand designer's or builder's control. But it is always a good idea to discuss electrical costs with your exhibition company at the quote stage. With fewer technology requirements at your exhibition, you will need less electricity and pay less. Reduce your electric costs by using fewer non-essential appliances and using fewer outlets. A large AV display and interactive technology will certainly strengthen a stand, but if your budget does not allow it, then we recommend leaving them out of your exhibition package. Using the tips in this guide, you should have been able to make considerable savings on your budget. Therefore, you will be able to invest extra funds in designing exhibition stands that will attract attention at the show. Being the most trusted exhibition stand designers and builders in Dubai, We at Creative Roots offers an unbelievable and extensive selection of unique design ideas and features that will help your exhibition stand out and draw prospective customers."
9,Disruptive Business Model: Bangladeshi Perspective (Chapter 1),business," The world is continuously changing But the core benefit remains the same. Though the presentation of the product or service has changed and more development is going on. Once Letter was the only means of business communication but now businesses are using email as it is more efficient than the previous mediums.

10,How to Increase Productivity Using Live Chat Bot Support,business," If you need a chat support team for your website, then live chatbot support is just what you are looking for. Bot support is just another way to increase productivity, without having to hire another team of workers, or paying for additional IT staff. The ability to use chatbot support services has made them quite popular amongst webmasters. This is especially true with businesses that do not have a dedicated department devoted solely to working with chatbot support solutions. However, it is important to decide whether or not to hire chatbot support professionals. If you choose to do so, you will be making a life-changing investment that will serve you well into the future. There are many advantages to using live chatbot support. These include: An advantage of live chatbot support is that you can easily determine when your chat customer is gone. You can determine whether they have clicked off, and thus the chatbot can transfer their messages to the support team over again. This reduces the need for having to search for your customer every time your customer needs help. When your customer leaves your website and no longer returns, you do not need to contact them to find out where they are located. Live chatbot support takes the stress out of purchasing tickets for your customers. This means you can spend more time focusing on other aspects of your business. It also means you will not need to run out to the store several times during the day to collect your tickets. Since all of the transactions occur automatically, there is no worry about forgetting an item and then having to go back and re-purchase it. With live chatbot support, you can get the items you bought from your wholesaler or manufacturer in a matter of minutes, and then place your order with the tickets online. As long as you have internet access, you can place your orders right away. Using live chatbot systems allows you to improve the efficiency of your company. Bots can process hundreds of ticket requests in a short period. Having these systems in place also allows your customer service department to be freed up so that you can be dealing with other customers. You will not need to spend extra time with your representatives trying to deal with customers who have questions. Using a live chatbot system also helps you save money. Rather than being forced to hire additional staff members to deal with customer queries, and then training them how to handle customer complaints, live chatbot support will handle everything for you. You only pay for the amount of time your bot spends chatting with your customers. There is no additional pay for employees to perform this task either, meaning that your costs for setting up this solution are almost nonexistent. You simply need to make sure that your bot is set up properly and is capable of receiving messages. Using live chatbot support will increase productivity because it allows you to offer a wide range of products to your customers. By offering more products and services, you will also increase customer retention rates. Customers want to be kept in the loop as to how they are receiving their product. If you offer them options regarding multiple shipping options, delivery times, and other aspects of your product, you will entice them to purchase more, which will increase productivity even further. Why Live Chat Support Is Important For Service Providers? The popularity of live chat support has grown over the years as more companies realize the benefits of using it as a customer support solution. Live chat support is often provided by phone support operators, or by live chat service providers who have a dedicated team to provide this service. Some companies may use a single telephone number for all their customer support purposes, whereas others will have a mixture of telephone and live chat services. Other companies may use various methods of telephony as well as live chat support. In the past, customers used to report long hold times when trying to get hold of a live person to assist them. This has now been reduced to a very short period, which is quite normal. An important consideration is that an inquiry is usually done via telephone. Therefore the customer does not face any communication barriers as they would if they were inquiring about a web form. If a customer has difficulties with an inquiry, they can call a live chat support operator on the telephone to have a better understanding of how they should go about making a query. In many cases, people find that live chat support can save them a great deal of embarrassment when calling the customer service desk of a business. For example, an online shopping store may be having a problem with a particular element of its website. An inquiry form may be taking too long or they may not be able to correctly input the information required. A live chat operator would be able to clarify any problems and may even be able to offer suggestions to improve the functionality of the site. There are several different types of live chat support available. This includes voice, video, text, and audio options. Each type offers different capabilities based on what the customer is looking to achieve. There is no need to pay more than $10 for an hour of assistance; however, there are some instances where it may be worthwhile to pay more for premium services that are aimed at improving the customer support experience. When using live chat, the customer must know they are being supported by a live chat operator. For example, when an online shopping site is experiencing a problem they may call the customer support center but a live chat operator may be able to solve the problem quickly and more importantly more accurately than the website owner. If the caller is unsure whether they are speaking to a live chat operator or the website owner they may find the answer on the chat system. Many customers also find that they can ask more detailed questions during the chat session which allows them to obtain more information that may otherwise not be possible. There are several other reasons why live chat support is important for businesses. First, an online merchant can receive valuable feedback from their customers. The live chat operator can listen to what the customer has to say and then provide them with the necessary help and information. This allows them to improve their service levels so that they can maintain the confidence of their customers. When doing this they can also make the online merchant aware of any changes which may be required as well as re-arranging customer orders. Secondly, the live chat operator can provide valuable customer support. This is very important because it enables the customer to report problems and get quick feedback. Furthermore, the live chat operator is also able to provide answers to customer questions and negotiate with the customer to resolve any problems. Furthermore, the live chat support can provide valuable information such as product specifications, technical specifications, instructions, and customer testimonials."

12,How to Use ChatBot As Customer Service Tool,business," In this Review, discuss everything you must know regarding a customer service chatbot. Then go directly to the section that interests you most: Definition of customer service chat script. The importance of selecting an ML-enabled and AI-enabled chatbot for customer service. When are they better? How can we tell if a chatbot is good enough for our company? Today, the use of chatbots for customer service has become common. It can be seen in almost all kinds of businesses such as real estate businesses, insurance businesses, medical offices, marketing companies, and even social media sites. This is because companies realize that these are effective ways of automating most business procedures. This type of technology allows users to interact with agents and executives in a completely natural manner. With the advent of social media, more businesses are using automated systems to serve customer requests for updates and inquiries. To explain it more simply, a chatbot is a machine that responds to customer requests in the same way as it would in real life. With the help of advanced artificial intelligence, the bot receives data from a variety of sources and combines it into useful patterns. This process extracts the core elements from each conversation and analyzes them to provide its own unique response time. This response time is then translated into a personalized customer experience. Unlike most customer interaction tools, such as phone assistants or web assistants, a chatbot is very attentive and interested in its customers. It never loses its interest or attention even during long conversations with hundreds of customers at a time. This is because it has learned from past interactions and taken the necessary steps to make sure that each customer interaction is an exceptional one. Chatbots have also been used in other fields to provide similar levels of automation, such as with finance and banking. In these types of businesses, the automated nature provided by chatbots allowed banks to save thousands of hours each year that would have otherwise been spent sorting through paper records. These savings enabled faster transactions and a more efficient system for handling customer requests. Unlike a chat assistant, which usually has a predefined set of instructions and phrases, a bot can continue to follow customer conversations on its own. The bot chooses relevant conversations to respond to and is also capable of following its internal dialogue. The combination of these two features makes it a great solution for businesses that want to improve customer satisfaction and cut back on redundant tasks. Bot software also makes customer service representatives jobs a lot easier. Often, support teams will spend a lot of time interacting with customers live on the phone. Since most people who call do not have English as their first language, there can be a lot of cultural issues when it comes to interpreting what is said, as well as the inability to properly convey any technical difficulties that may occur due to poor English skills or a lack of understanding of how to use the product properly. By using a chat bot, however, support team will be able to continue working as they always have, but with the added benefit of being able to effectively communicate with their customers in a common language. ChatBots are also much less likely to forget common questions that can arise during customer calls. One of the best ways to use chatbots effectively is to allow the bot to ""self-manage"" itself and keep an updated record of all of the information it needs to give the best customer service possible. Many of these programs will already have built-in FAQs, so all that the user has to do is create a bot account and add any questions it might have into the database. These chatbots will then be able to answer questions about the product, or services the customer might be having difficulty finding answers to. If a customer has a question that is not understood by the bot, they can click on the ""contact us"" link that will be shown on the bot's screen and the company will be able to resolve the problem with the support team. Can I Use ChatBot As A Sales Agent? You've probably seen the use of chatbot as a sales representative before. This is a type of artificially intelligent chatbot, also known as the ""virtual assistant"". They are sophisticated programs that can both speak and write automatically to some degree. These programs have been programmed by companies to be able to handle sales calls and handle customer service calls with great success. They are very good at picking up the nuances of human language and are even able to fool people into thinking they are one person. In many ways, they are like virtual personal assistants. The program itself is designed to be very easy to use. Anyone who wants to use the chatbot can do so pretty easily. There are guides on the website that teach users how to set up the program to use it for their sales needs. You will be able to adjust settings, add in passwords, and use various options like messaging voice, and even statistics. Most programs allow you to customize many aspects of the experience, especially concerning how your messages are delivered. In many cases, it is possible to completely customize the experience for your own specific needs. This includes the way you talk with the sales agents. You can choose how you want to talk to them, what you want to say, and what you want your message to be. Chatbot has a built-in messaging system. It's very simple to set up and can be accessed with a simple click of the mouse. This allows you to communicate with your sales agents effectively. It's important to remember that these agents are part of your sales team. You need to keep them motivated, and this tool can help with that. If you are wondering how to use a chatbot as a sales agent, then the first thing that you will have to do is create a profile for your business on the website. When you create your profile, you will be asked to provide some basic information. This includes your name, business name, address, phone number, email address, and much more. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for potential clients to contact you. They can then use your business name or your business address when contacting you. Another thing that you will need to do is tell the world exactly who you are. You want to make sure that the people that contact you are aware of who you are, what you sell, and how to contact you. You also want to make sure that they know your voice, and exactly how you would talk to them if they were a customer. Chatbots are excellent at answering any questions that they may have about buying from you, so don't be afraid to use this aspect of your profile. Once you have your profile established, you will then want to start looking for leads. You can use the bot to find leads for you, which makes it very easy to market to people that you know. If you have a site that has plenty of content about your product or service, then you should be able to easily find leads that are interested in what you have to offer. Using the bot, you will also be able to sell to those people without having to deal with cold calling or the hassle of having to meet the person face to face. Now, if you are worried about not being able to monitor what the Bot is doing, then worry no more. You will be able to keep an eye on it and know exactly how effective it is working. By setting up an account with the program, you will be able to get notifications whenever a new user registers with the bot. You can then follow up with them to make sure that they are interested in becoming a sales agent. The best part is because ChatBot is automated, you will not have to spend hours each day monitoring it, because the program will do that for you!"
13,Disruptive Technology Machine Learning in Project Management,business," Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of machine learning that aims to teach a machine how to recognise and understand language and text, in this case evaluating project task commentary submitted via email and automatically assigning a RAG status. It has been used in a variety of domains, where NLP serves as a link between artificial intelligence and humans, integrating languages, computer science and automation. As the field of Deep Learning NLP has advanced, it is now appropriate for use in project management reporting, making it a valuable tool for process improvement immune to cognitive biases and misclassification.  This article examines how this technology can be used to automate project risk classification by employing a trained DL NLP model to review, comprehend, and assign risk classification based on commentary submitted to the project manager or project management office in conjunction with office applications. Machine learning, as opposed to intelligence programming, is the process by which a program learns on its own with the help of data and statistics. As more data is fed into the model, it learns to implement the most logical outcome. Large data sets, years of successful and unsuccessful project scenarios, such as inputs and outputs relating to risk, can be analysed by ML models to learn which input scenario will result in which output with the greatest degree of certainty. Evolution of RISK classification An industrial automated control system includes a human–machine interface. Consider programmable logic in automated industrial systems that use a defined sequential logic as an example. If A and B occur, C is triggered, and conditions are realised based on predetermined, proven factors. The system is optimised to produce the desired output in the most efficient way possible. The human machine interface is only used when intervention and control are required by design. We can now use the same logical framework based on textual commentary NLP models, instead of digital and binary conditions or mechanical gates we can utilise contextual data. Deep learning NLP models can be trained on large data sets containing years of project RISK data. Not only can the NLP models understand and associate textual inputs with outputs, but they can also understand context to analyse and classify textual scenarios based on historical knowledge. In this example, the Project Manager serves as the Human Machine Interface, with NLP serving as the automated process for project risk classification reporting and escalation. As in the previous example, the HMI/PM should not be required to intervene unless required as an output of logic, such as a RISK classification or an unacceptable threshold of uncertainty, which would then trigger a subsequent sequence of controlling events forcing intervention. The slow data transfer from human to machine, to human, and back to machine is the bottleneck in the preceding example. The risk of cognitive bias and misclassification in data transfer is high. By automating various processes, the Project Manager or PMO will be able to shift away from cognitive reasoning, which is susceptible to human error, within specific areas of the project management framework and instead function as an overarching, strategic controlling mind, essentially an optimised project manager. The future As we move towards the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” Artificial Intelligence can be used more extensively at a basic level to optimise project risk classification and mitigation, resource scheduling and utilisation analysis, project performance reporting with advanced projections, and KPI analysis. From the ground up, we investigated the fundamental implementations of a single subset of Artificial Intelligence that is process driven. The array of possibilities presented by this fundamental deep learning concept should have opened your eyes to the change transformation that is on the horizon. Taking a more strategic and scalable approach, let us now investigate how Artificial Intelligence can have a strategic impact on the project management industry from the top down. How will it affect the industry from an organisational standpoint, and will we establish new methodologies, processes, and frameworks as a result? Will AI create a unified toolbox of tools and utilities to assist a project manager or PMO? The impact of AI in project management will be truly disruptive on a large scale across all industries, fundamentally redefining project management practice. Risk analysis, mitigation, and forecasting are generally practices that accumulate as a project progresses, with the risk register being somewhat predefined to a minimalist level and updated reactively. RISK is inherently uncertain, and without the ability to predict the future with 100 percent accuracy, this will remain the case. Nobody can guarantee project completion on time, within budget, within scope, and with agreed-upon quality; it is not yet possible. Risk, on the other hand, can be modeled on an endless application of historic data, machines can learn to calculate and forecast risk with incredible accuracy more so than any human counterpart. Building this function into the project management industry as standard will be a core evolutionary step. Learning is essential; however, the industry is failing to learn from previous projects and processes, adopting what worked and avoiding steps to failure. This process must be implemented on a regulatory level so that Artificial Intelligence can model all industry data to provide a standardised risk, management, and control index that learns and evolves, allowing for better project management practice that is automated, controlled, optimised, and risk averse. The next evolutionary step is for Artificial Intelligence to be used to address critical industry flaws; projects should be integrated not independent."
14,3 Impactful Ways To Highlight Your PR Success In The Office,business," The pandemic forced offices across the United States to pivot to a work from home model, but as the nation and the world slowly bounces back, more and more businesses are making the shift back into the office. Be it hybrid, fulltime, or somewhere in between, the fact of the matter is that a return to in-person work means business owners will likely be taking client and prospective client meetings in-person, too. With in-person client meetings and work structures around the corner, business owners must prioritize finding new ways to showcase their credibility within their office space to make a lasting impression on any visitor who comes through their office doors. From learning how to order plaques and reprints, to hanging your accolades up on office walls, here are several tips business owners can use to highlight their public relations success throughout the office. Showcase Your Feature Articles Has your business been featured in the press? Being featured in a newspaper or magazine is an effective way to build credibility because it is a form of earned media, meaning you didn't pay for the recognition. It shows the public that you’re credible and a trusted figure in your industry or community. By leveraging media features in your office space, visitors including clients, prospects, job candidates and business associates will have evidence of your credibility from the moment they step foot inside. One way to leverage articles you have been featured in is by ordering reprint stacks for visitors to take with them. Additionally, business owners should frame and hang their top feature articles on office walls, or even purchase them as plaques. Some publications allow you to order reprints of articles directly from their websites, while others do not. For example, the American City Business Journals offer self-service options for ordering reprints and plaques through their website, as well as the option to work directly through their sales team. Even if the publication your business was featured in does not offer framed reprints or plaques, there are third-party services to consider such as That's Great News. Display Trophies And Award Plaques Trophies and awards commemorate hard work and success. Displaying awards, trophies and other accolades helps create a lasting impression on visitors to your office space and shows that you’ve been recognized among the best in your field. Showcasing awards not only establishes your expertise and authority, but it also fosters a sense of trust in prospects and visitors to your office. Awards are a perfect way of reminding anyone walking into your office that your business is credible. Displaying recognition in industry awards, business awards, community awards and similar accolades gives your visitors a glimpse of what separates you from the rest. It’s common for organizations behind the awards to give out trophies or plaques to winners or make them available for purchase, but that’s not always the case. Some award programs do not offer tangible trophies or plaques. Fortunately, even if the award given is not a physical token, you can order a plaque or trophy from suppliers such as Edco Awards & Specialties as a way to still showcase your recognition within your physical office space. Show Broadcast Video Montages And Photos Television appearances have huge implications in building your business’s credibility and leveraging broadcast success in the office is equally important. If your business or its executives have frequently appeared on TV, consider displaying a montage of clips from those appearances on a lobby TV. Business owners should also frame and display photos of on-air coverage, back-stage photo-ops or other memorable photos from their broadcast appearances. Appearances on TV can dazzle clients and prospects, adding an element of celebrity behind your brand. They show that you are a status above competitors and recognized as a trusted expert in your field.  By leveraging your broadcast appearances in your office, you establish credibility and offer visitors an impressive and unique experience. Leveraging your business's public relations achievements in the office can be as important as important and impactful as earning the media in the first place. For employees, clients, prospective clients, and other visitors, your office space is one of the first ways to make a lasting, meaningful impression. Business owners engaged in public relations should take advantage of the many avenues to acquiring things like reprints of feature articles, plaques commemorating an award, or montages of broadcast appearances to ensure they are securing the trust and respect of anyone who comes through their doors."
15,What Are the Main Chat Bot Benefits For Online Sellers?,business," There are many chatbot benefits for sellers, and I'm not just talking about the bots themselves. There is a whole lot of software that can be written to handle these tasks for any seller, but none of them have the depth and flexibility that a chatbot does. With a chatbot, you can simply install it, set up your business account with the banks or other reputable companies that you will want to work with, and then let it work its magic for you. Of course, most of these programs come with a one-time fee that allows the buyer to use it on a trial basis. But if you haven't yet checked out what's available and how affordable it is, you might be missing out on one of the biggest opportunities in selling on eBay. The first of the many chatbot benefits for sellers is that it is very easy to set up. That's what it sets out to do from the beginning, right? It is not a difficult program to write yourself, and you don't even have to know anything about computers to use it. All it takes is a few minutes and some free time to get things rolling. Plus, most of these chatbots are pretty easy to use, and they have the added benefit of being able to be customized to include all sorts of fun features that can attract buyers, like making a real person to talk to you. Many of these chat Bots are voice-driven, so you can speak to the bot as if you were the actual buyer. Another of the chatbot benefits for sellers is that they can target specific markets. This makes it very easy for someone who sells on auction sites to find buyers based on their location, hobbies, or interests. Say, for example, that you own a company that ships out laptop computers to people all around the world. If you use a chatbot on the regular auction sites, you would have to filter through listings on the individual websites and possibly send someone out who could be an international vendor without a problem. On the other hand, if you decide to use a chatbot on eBay, you can target buyers based on the language they speak or based on the country where they are from. Say, for example, that you want to target Hispanic consumers. You can do so by adding -SEO as a keyword in your chatbot options. These kinds of options are only available in some of the latest chatbot versions, but if you use a current bot version with the right tools, you can add these features with little effort. The real draw to chatbot benefits for sellers is the fact that they are much more versatile than a real person would be. Because the software is virtual, it can be used to perform tasks that an actual human may be unable to do - like responding to inquiries or making sales. In addition, the software can be given new commands if it detects certain behavior. For example, a chatbot can be programmed to greet a buyer as he/she enters the store. A chatbot can then give the buyer directions on how to get to the payment section, or call the customer service hotline to handle customer questions. If the potential buyer orders an item, the chatbot can be taught how to handle the transaction online. It can enter information into an online form and then send an email to the seller to finalize the order. And if a potential buyer contacts the seller directly, the chatbot can respond to queries or return messages. To make the most out of chatbot benefits for sellers, it's a good idea to train the chatbot, so that it behaves consistently and helpfully. This will help the seller to achieve the goals he wants to achieve in his business. The best way to train a chatbot is to use the chatbot builder software that is included with some newer versions of the bot. Using this software, a user can program the bot to do anything that a real human would if the owner were still online. However, for many business owners, chatbot benefits for sellers aren't enough. Some want their bot to do even more. They might want their chatbot to find a buyer or send messages to sellers when the bot responds to an inquiry. Others might want their chatbot to deliver virtual goods, like CDs, DVDs, and other digital items. Benefits of ChatBots Software Nowadays, more businesses are turning to chatbot technology.

16,Reasons why BRAC is the most successful NGO globally,business," Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) is one of the largest and fastest-growing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the world specializing in microfinance lending and combating poverty through providing an integrated package of services for the poor rural and urban communities in Bangladesh and other third world countries. It is the first and now the largest microcredit lender in Bangladesh even overtaking Nobel laureate Dr. Mohammad Yunus’s Grameen Bank. The article analyzes how BRAC has set itself apart from other NGOs by balancing two things successfully: running it as a business and maintaining its mission to alleviate poverty. It has proved that a relatively unknown institution from one of the poorest countries like Bangladesh can outpace famous Western charities in both scale and scope by making its activities accessible, relevant, and adaptable. BRAC started out in 1972 to support the victims of a deadly cyclone in coastal Bangladesh. Its founder and architect Sir Fazle Hasan Abed made BRAC as the pioneer in recognizing and tackling the many different realities of poverty for creating a world free of any form of exploitation and discrimination (Phase 1 of strategic management process: Goal setting). It has successfully maintained its vision over the years, set objectives and also crafted strategies to attain its vision and mission. To better compete in the globalized world, it came up with a new strategy aiming at outpacing other Western NGOs by making its administration leaner and by making it a low-cost provider. At first, BRAC tried financing itself internally without any external assistance by pulling resources from the savings of its members. This strategy proved ineffective, and after careful evaluation, a new strategy was adopted (Phase 5 of strategic management process: strategy evaluation). The management started running BRAC as a business, attaining economies of scope and scale and diversifying itself into an internet service provider, establishing a university, primary schools, tea plantations, handicraft marketing, retail stores, and so on. Currently, BRAC earns 80 percent of its finance from business operations. Its microfinance wing disburses about US$ 1 billion per year. Much like a business firm, BRAC pays a lot of attention to research and continuous learning and adaptation. In conclusion, BRAC has diversified successfully and transformed itself into a business entity in order to better attain its vision of creating a just society that is free from discrimination, exploitation, and exclusion of the poor. Learning from Bangladesh, it has expanded its operations into other third-world countries and has already become the largest NGO in Afghanistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The challenge now is to replicate its success in Bangladesh in other Third World countries. BRAC has raised the success bar for other NGOs and charities dedicated to alleviating poverty by empowering the poor to bring about changes in their own lives. How long the ‘first mover’ strategy taken by BRAC lasts and serves successfully in recognizing and tackling the many different realities of poverty across the world is the crucial imperative at present.

17,Leadership Beliefs about CSR at lululemon Athletica,business," Corporate social responsibility is defined as a commitment of the organization to act in accordance with what is right and wrong, thus serving both its own interest and the interest of the society (Schermerhorn & Wright, p 68). Lululemon Athletica, a Vancouver-based sports apparel manufacturer, is the epitome of organizational commitment to society and the community it serves. Today, the market value of the company is over $220 million, a sharp contrast to established notions that corporate profit-making are incongruent with corporate social responsibility. The following leadership beliefs channel the corporate social responsibility at lululemon Athletica: alternative criteria to measure corporate success, emergence of the company and its corporate culture, core values and vision of the company, training, and development of its stakeholders, and, finally, community-oriented activities of the company to create awareness. First, the personnel at lululemon have come about alternative methods of evaluating the success of the company. Instead of following the classical view of defining success: management’s only goal is to maximize profits, lululemon has followed the socio-economic view of management’s responsibility which includes broader social welfare, not just corporate profits (Schermerhorn & Wright, p 70). To look at lululemon's success requires looking at the improved level of the communities it serves. For example, company CEO Chip Wilson welcomes and promotes the analysis of the improved health and well-being of the people in the communities in over 40 locations it serves worldwide (lululemon case, p1, para1). Second, the emergence of the company and development of its corporate culture is based on the belief of serving the customers with athletic wear that is better fit and provides better value to customers. The lululemon phenomena started its journey in 1998 when it recognized an increase in the number of women taking part in yoga and other athletic sports. It came up with a strategy to design and develop athletic wear that were both better quality and better fit compared to competitors. It manufactured new and innovative sports apparel made with technologically superior fabrics that are long-lasting, better fit, and comfortable to wear. For instance, the company has succeeded in creating a brand image and a culture of customers who earnestly believes that wearing the products would help them achieve their athletic goals, lead a healthy, balanced lifestyle and feel better about self (lululemon case, p1, para2). Third, the core values of the company, its mission statement and its vision for the future also strive to promote its socially responsible practices in the company and are an indispensable part of its leadership beliefs. The mission of the company is to provide the components that help people live longer, healthier and fun-filled lives (lululemon case, p1, para3). This mission is impelled by a set of core values promoting the high quality of its products, the integrity of the company, and the distinction that health, family, and work are inseparable in a person’s life (lululemon case, p1, para3).. For example, the company endorses a commitment to a yogi lifestyle based on the belief that every being on this planet are codependent and interconnected with each other. The company attempts to increase awareness of the benefits of yoga on our bodies and mind. For the millions of people who use lululemon products, and practice yoga, the company has provided them with a lifestyle trend, not just a fashion trend. The company also has a manifesto that it lives by – this public declaration of intent is displayed in each of its stores. It consists of a number of statements that provide support and empowerment of its educators and guests (lululemon case, p2, para2). Fourth, Training and development of the educators and guests in order to provide them with the best possible shopping and product experience is high on the agenda of the organization. The leadership at lululemon believes that training the stakeholders including educators and guests is the best possible way to enhance their store and product experience at lululemon.  For example, in order to enhance its shopping experience, both educators and guests are given the opportunity to take part in yoga classes in-store, educate people to know more about yoga, and recommending off-site yoga studios. The educators are also urged to put their own individual influence on the store display (lululemon case, p2, para1). Finally, the company is deeply rooted in promoting ethical business practices, maintaining a healthy, entertaining environment in the communities it operates in. For example, the Charitable Giving Program at lululemon has been established to raise awareness of charities in the communities it serves. Guests of the store are the ones who choose which charities should receive donations. The store then selects eight out of the list of charities which would receive donations and support. Lululemon is also involved with the Centre for Integrated Healing – a charity organization dedicated to the prevention of cancer (lululemon case, p2, para 3). The five mentioned corporate leadership beliefs have guided the company’s global success and will continue to promote the company’s commitment towards corporate social responsibility in the foreseeable future.

18,Product Analysts Explained: Product Development in the Era of Digital Transformation,business," Digital transformation is challenging companies all around the world. It targets all of a company’s main business and operational processes and creates a lot of turmoil and uncertainty within the in-house teams. To drive digital transformation changes in the right direction, you need capable professionals, including analysts. Three years ago, one of our business analysts shared her insights (https://auriga.com/blog/2018/business-process-automation-a-big-no-to-routine/) on the basic objectives of a business analyst on a project. Now it’s another one of Auriga’s business analyst’s turn to tell you about his job as a product analyst. Tech companies’ products are their primary source of income. Therefore, the successful digital transformation of the product development cycle is one of the main goals. Product analysts are usually in the midst of a project, be that web or mobile app development. It’s hard to overestimate their contribution to the development of products (and the owner company’s business). This article sheds some light on their role in digitalization and how one can automate product analysis processes. Product Analytics: The Path of Growth Digitalization helps companies to become more effective, which usually leads to cost reduction and bottom-line growth. IT expenses become investments accompanied by measurable NVP and return ratios. However, trimming internal process costs is only one of the constituents of net profit. Another is the company’s revenue. B2C and B2B companies put lots of effort into marketing their digital products (websites, marketplaces, mobile applications, and portals) so users can seamlessly interact with them. Spending the budget on digital product development and potential customer acquisition without investing in product development analysis dramatically reduces the return on investment. Defining Users’ Paths The modern digital product development methodologies based on the Agile principles imply constant transformation and product adaptability to rapidly changing market needs. Before making changes to an existing product, it’s vital to define what needs to be changed. If we take the internal accounting systems where users (employees) strictly follow the instructions, the reason for making changes will be a business process change. Meanwhile, in digital products where users (potential or current customers) don’t have to follow any instructions, users’ behavior and interaction with the product are based on changes. A product analyst knows how to define customer journeys and user preferences for consecutive analysis and product modification. Enhancing the Product and Market Relationship In practice, a product analyst is responsible for the following tasks: Search for growth hypotheses (defining advisable changes in digital products); Assessment of changes’ impact on business metrics (potential growth prognosis); Introduction of options for quick hypothesis test (defining ways of quickly adopting changes to confirm the changes’ positive influence on the metrics); and Verification of the effect of the hypothesis’s realization (change adoption) and suggestion of further changes. By completing these tasks regularly, companies can quickly respond to market changes. For decision-making, a professional analyst uses the data-driven approach instead of depending on the prejudiced opinions of concerned parties who constantly generate various hypotheses, playing Russian Roulette. A product analyst makes and tests the product improvement hypotheses by relying on actual user behavior data. Improving User Experience: Stages First, one must define and document the metrics and conversion funnel hierarchy, serving as the main criteria for the digital product success assessment. The final user’s transaction (the purchase) secures the product owner’s profit. The user ends up purchasing after several intermediate conversion actions (for instance, registration on the website, placing items in the cart). These actions must be recognized and recorded. After defining the metrics, the analyst needs to deploy user activity tracking tools to collect data about the customer journey and how customers use the product at each funnel stage. The analyst defines all possible user paths and critical events that lead to the desired transaction at each stage. Tracking systems allow data to be collected from the first user contact (for example, a Google ad) to the conversion transaction that profits the company. Collected data is used as an input for the next stage – the analysis. At the analysis stage, a product analyst defines the user path up to the final successful transaction. As stated above, unlike in-house business processes regulating employees’ actions, users can perform various (and sometimes unforeseeable) actions. Their journeys from the first contact to the conversion transaction vary dramatically. An analyst analyzes different aspects of these journeys: the average journey length, users’ actions, number of “lost” users who didn’t make a transaction and thus brought no profit. A product analyst uses the cohort analysis tool to reveal dependencies and meaningful insights between user characteristics, acquisition channels, behavior, devices used, season, etc. The analysis is performed to create growth hypotheses or changes to be applied to the product. Not all hypotheses are to be realized; every one of them needs to be prioritized first. To do that, a product analyst assesses the impact the planned changes might have on the product metrics, for instance, by implementing the impact mapping technique. However, this doesn’t guarantee growth. Any hypothesis is just an idea, and only through testing can its effectiveness be proved or disproved. An analyst decides how to implement changes and track the outcome quickly and efficiently. Analysts implement minimal modifications to the product to verify a hypothesis, and the fewer resources spent on it, the better. The main criterion here is to capture the actual effect of the modifications confirmed by the customers’ behavior. To assess the effectiveness, analysts compare the newly acquired data with the previous period’s results or introduce changes only to a specific user type and compare their results with those of a control user group for whom the changes weren’t implemented (A/B test). After the analysis is performed, the hypothesis is either rejected or confirmed. Then it is passed on to the engineering team to become part of the product’s new functionality. Why do companies need product analysts? The constant process of making changes with reasonable effort and efficiency monitoring allows you to deploy and maintain continuous digital product development and quickly respond to market changes. The product analyst can get involved in the development process either before launch or when customers are already using the product. Usually, the product development team needs a product analyst if there are specific tasks to be completed: User retention; Product adaptation to market expectations (target audience); Development of a lead in the field; and UX enhancement. If your company needs a product analyst and you are considering searching for one, I recommend you pay attention to the following qualities of the candidates: Knowledge of modern automation tools. A product analyst works with big datasets. The ability to process raw data as well as choose the right tools is an absolute advantage. Strong analytical skills and knowledge of algorithms and statistics. Automation tools are handy, but they cannot replace the human mind. It is not enough to know how to get the results – one should know how to interpret them and determine the underlying conditions. The ability to set achievable goals and choose meaningful metrics. An analyst should be able to identify the mission-critical characteristics of the product and measure them without being paralyzed by perfectionism. The ability to create hypotheses. One of the analyst’s tasks is developing and testing hypotheses to make decisions on the necessary product modifications. Surprisingly, many analysts struggle to create and test ideas. Excellent communication skills. The analyst has to interact with many different people with diverse roles and backgrounds, so finding common ground is crucial. If all of the information mentioned above sounds quite tricky and you need an analyst right now, you should contact a company with product analysts on staff. Auriga is a custom software developer that employs developers, test engineers, business analysts, product analysts, and data analysts who are ready to get involved in your project. Not all hypotheses are to be realized; every one of them needs to be prioritized first.

19,Easy and Common Way to Design a Flash Header,business," Creating sensational designs and graphics, as well as animations, is very profitable to one's website. There are a lot of sites where the designs are similar to each other. What differentiates these sites from the rest is the animations and effects. A Flash header, text, or image on a web page is the most important element. It is these effects that people remember the website the most. In fact, there is a rule in advertising which says that the only thing people remember about a commercial is the message that was conveyed through the message. They also tend to forget about the taglines, visuals, colors, graphics and other factors that made the commercial a commercial. In short, users remember only the message, and forget the process that was involved in sending the message. In addition, you cannot overlook the importance of animations and effects on your website if you want to have a good ranking on the search engines. The search engines love flash and animation when they are combined with your content. In addition, if you are just starting out, you will want to create a high quality header so that people would remember you and your website. Making a Flash header can be a tedious job. It can also be a very easy job. In fact, the following will explain you the easy way to make a Flash header that would have you creating a good header on your website. A common way to make the header is to use a template with the message written in it. In order to add a message, you simply copy and paste your message in the blank space of the template, then fill in the rest of the template with your content. For example, I am planning on starting a website marketing a new product which I think will be hot. You see, I want to start a website and make a header using this template. I see that the template has a message which says ""Get FREE Information"". I would fill this message in so that it says ""You are about to be redirected to our website, please click here to go to our homepage"" then fill in the template with my content and save the header. After you have finished making the header, you need to fill all of the logos in the template. In addition, you need to use your logo and all the images in the website with your theme color. If you are not using any templates, you can use your own photos. If you are using templates, you should stick to your template. For example, I will be using the wordpress template. If I want to use a different photo or an image instead of the logo, I should find out what the theme of the template is and use that instead. In this way, you will have no problems choosing any colors or graphics for your header."
20,How to start affiliate marketing - complete guide for beginners,business," Affiliate Marketing , Starting a new business is hard. It takes a lot of time and effort, and even if you have the skills to be successful, getting customers is always a challenge. One way to stand out from the pack quickly is through affiliate marketing. When your website or blog features links to products or services that you recommend for other people who visit your site, it becomes an affiliate link. That means when those visitors buy those items through your links, you earn commission as their sales associate rather than as their product manufacturer! In this article we'll talk about what affiliate marketing entails and how to start it up with or without made up products. First and Foremost Affiliate marketing and internet promotion  are done by utilizing your everyday computer skills. When you read online, type on your keyboard, watch movies, play games online, use the internet... these things are all ways to generate traffic to your site. You can make money blogging or writing articles or guest posting for other websites as well as making apps which you can sell (i.e. making a money making app). The more you do online the faster you'll have a lot of company that will want to promote you or your affiliate site. You can build an affiliate site with or without products to sell. If you have the money, creating your own products is a great way to get set up in business quickly. However, if you're just starting out, it will cost too much money at the moment. There are plenty of companies that offer digital downloads for commissions on every sale that they make that you can sign up for. Some benefits of affiliate marketing, Affiliate marketing has become a popular way for people to make money online. It is an easy way for anyone who has a blog or website to monetize their content. The great thing about affiliate marketing is that there are many ways to do it. You can leave your account inactive or just simply start clicking on ads when you find them throughout the day, letting advertisers buy the advertising space on your site. All you need to do is keep your website or blog updated and then start visiting and clicking on ads. It's that simple and easy. If you want to make more money, however, there are other ways you can do so. On your own website or blog, put affiliate marketing links in the content of the pages and get paid when people buy whatever it is you are promoting through your link. You can also get sponsors for whatever it is you're promoting and get paid by them to promote their product. Another thing that can be done with affiliate marketing is where you simply provide the audience while another company effectively does all of the work for their specific product or service. Some cons of affiliate marketing, Affiliate marketing has always been one of the most profitable methods out there for making money, so it's understandable that so many people are turning to it. But is it really all good? Today we're taking a look at the disadvantages of affiliate marketing so you can see what you might be getting yourself into if you take this route. Before we do that, though, let's start with an overview of what affiliate marketing is. Basically, if somebody clicks on your link to buy an item online and then follows through with their purchase (i.e., they don't just skim through your article and hit back), then you're awarded a commission for referring them to make that purchase. Obviously, the more people you refer and the more money they spend, the more commission you'll receive. The problem is that affiliate marketing is one of those things where people think it's a get-rich-quick scheme. If you're not careful and know your stuff, it can be a great way to make money, but there are other ways to do so without having to take such a risk with your life and credit ."

1,CLAMP MOUNT MIXER GUIDE,business," Clamp Mount Mixer Guide In the product mixing world, moving from the kitchen environment to the small industrial environment can be intimidating. The goal of this article is to take some of the mystery out of small industrial scale mixing. What Are You Mixing? Is the product thin like water, or thick like paint? A typical way to measure how thick a product is; is by measuring the viscosity of the liquid. The following chart gives real life examples of viscosities. Viscosity	 	Examples (CPS)	 	Approximate Viscosity 1	 	       Water, Milk, Solvents 100	 	       Olive Oil, SAE 10 Motor Oil 250	 	       Castor Oil, SAE 40 Motor Oil 500	 	       Paints, Glucose Solutions 1000	       Ketchup, Glycerin, Heavy Paints Direct Drive 1750 RPM or Gear Reduced Drive 350 RPM? Liquid to liquid mixing is generally straight forward. Thin or low viscosity products (under 250 cps) can be mixed with either direct drive mixers at 1750 RPM, or gear reduced mixers at 350 RPM. The 1750 speed does impart more shear into the product than gear drives, so particles can be broken down a bit. If this is a problem, then select the 350 RPM gear reduced unit. Are solids being mixed in? Do they dissolve easily? Do they get wet easily? If they do, then one can generally be less concerned, and select the mixer based on fluid viscosity above. Below 250 CPS, 1750 RPM direct drive mixers are generally chosen. Above 250 CPS, then go with 350 RPM Gear Reduced Mixers. Note however, if solids do not mix in very well, then faster mixing is needed, and a 1750 RPM mixer is often better. What are Tank Turns? Some people like to talk about tank turns. Tank turn is simply Gallons Per Minute (GPM) divided by the capacity of the tank in Gallons. A 5” propeller spinning at 1750 rpm pumps about 600 Gallons per Minute. If you have a 200 Gallon tank, then 600/200 = 3 Tank Turns per Minute. Somewhere in the range of 2-3 is good for mixing! On a side note, an 8” propeller at 350 RPM also pumps approximately 600 Gallons per Minute. Where Should I locate the Mixer? When clamping the mixer to the tank wall, try to keep to these three rules of thumb. First, try to locate the propeller a full “propeller’s” diameter off the bottom. If you have a 5” propeller, locate it 5” off the bottom. Second, try to keep the propeller off center. The rule of thumb is 1/6 of the tank diameter. If you have a 30” diameter tank, then the propeller should be 5” off center. Finally, try to keep the shaft between a 10-15 degree angle. A larger angle can harm the mixer shaft, and that would be bad! WOW! Mystery Solved! 	You learned about fluid viscosities. 	You learned about direct drive motors, and gear reduced motors. 	You learned about tank turns. 	You learned where to locate your mixer. Not bad for one day!"
2,#1 Reason Cosmetic Patients Choose YOU,business," The #1 Reason Cosmetic Patients Choose YOU is an emotional one. So the better you understand the cosmetic patient, the more likely you are to bond with them and make them feel comfortable to move forward with you. You and your staff spend up to an hour with a prospective patient talking with them and showing them your social proof. You explain the procedure and then go over the quote and then what happens? The majority of the time, you get the dreaded, “I gotta think about it.” Ugh! It makes you feel like you’re spinning your wheels and wasting your time, doesn’t it? HOW A COSMETIC PATIENT THINKS To help you understand the inner workings of the cosmetic patient’s mind, I interviewed cosmetic patients to figure out why they said yes to one surgeon and no to the others. The results were compiled into my book called, Your Aesthetic Practice/What Your Patients are Saying. The majority of those interviewed were females with the medium age being 44 years old, and they were scattered throughout the US. My objective was to determine trends and commonalities, so here are some of my key findings: •	90% of the time, the confidence in the surgeon’s ability and positive staff interaction were more important than price; •	75% went on multiple consultations before deciding. The majority of those who went on one consultation did so after a glowing recommendation from their friend, family member, or colleague; •	Long waiting times and feeling hurried were reoccurring complaints that hurt the relationship; and •	The better the staff, the less time the surgeon had to spend with the patient during the consultation. COSMETIC PATIENT SURVEY FINDINGS While the above responses were interesting, it was apparent I needed to probe further to see if I could come up with some generalities that could define what made up a good practice that prospective patients said YES. But, this is what I learned instead.  The aesthetic patients’ preferences varied greatly. These aesthetic patients are consumers who think very differently. And, their perceptions were so varied such as: •	While some thought an aesthetically gorgeous office indicated pride and success; others thought it was over the top, intimidating, and made them feel uncomfortable; •	While some thought the surgeons did not spend enough time with them and felt rushed. Other patients thought too much time with them made them wonder why the surgeon wasn’t busier. And While some thought the surgeon was so thorough explaining the various procedures available, others felt overwhelmed and confused with so many options. So when I probed further and asked, bottom line, why they chose that particular surgeon over the others, there was a consistent answer that came up again and again…. WHY THE COSMETIC PATIENT CHOSE YOU The #1 reason the aesthetic patient chose you was that the patient felt a “connection” with you, your staff, and the overall vibe of the practice atmosphere. It was the FEELING they got when interacting with everyone at the practice. Their “intuition” was telling them this was the right surgeon, staff, and practice for them. They had developed a rapport with people in the practice and trusted that that particular surgeon understood them and would give them the best possible result. So What is Rapport? If a rapport is so vital, it’s important to understand it. It’s difficult to define, and you either have it with your patient, or you don’t. Rapport is that bond you build with your prospective patient.  It’s the single most important personality skill cosmetic surgeons and staff need to be successful. You build rapport through words, tone, and gestures as well as commonalities since: •	     7% of what is communicated is through your words •	     38% through your tone of voice •	     55% through your body language HOW DO YOU CREATE RAPPORT WITH A COSMETIC PATIENT? The aesthetic patient wants to feel special – period.  When a patient is spending their own money and time on elective cosmetic enhancement, they want to be treated respectfully, professionally and kindly by every person they encounter in the practice. They also want to be heard and understood.  There is an old saying that says, “Before you can be understood, you must work to understand” and that is truly the case here. You build rapport by giving a cosmetic patient your undivided attention. They have to feel like you are interested in them and what they have to say. That starts with a smile and good eye contact. The key is to look at the patient more than at the computer or your paperwork. The point is to show interest in the prospective patient as a person first; patient second. Find something on the patient intake form you have in common that helps break the ice. Perhaps it’s the referring patient you both know, or maybe your kids go to the same school. Another way to build rapport is to ask questions and then listen to the answers. There’s a study that says surgeons interrupt patients within16 seconds, and that cannot happen if you are trying to connect with a cosmetic patient who’s trying to determine if you are “the one.” Let them talk.  Not only will the patient give you the vital information you need to know to decipher if they are a good fit for you, but the patients will also feel like you understand them. That’s when you have developed a rapport and bonded with the patient who now sees you as the best choice. The point is to look at the consultation as a 2-way dialogue rather than as a 1-way presentation, so you build rapport with the prospective patient who says YES to you! If you want to learn more about what cosmetic patients want from you, for a limited time, you can get a FREE COPY of my book called, Your Aesthetic Practice/What  Your Patients Are Saying. Enjoy!"
3,3 Easier Ways to Increase Aesthetic Revenues,business," There are 3 easy ways to increase aesthetic revenues, and they don’t cost a fortune. The first thing you think of to increase your aesthetic revenues might be to increase the number of patients coming to your practice, right? But that poses a challenge… Where do you put your advertising budget? Is it better to invest in PPC, Organic SEO, FB Ads, Directories? And let’s say your advertising is getting you leads. The next challenge is converting them. Are they serious or price-shopping? Do they have the money or good enough credit? These challenges take up a ton of you and your staff’s time and mental capacity. And while it’s necessary, there are easier ways to go about it. HERE ARE 3 “EASIER” WAYS TO INCREASE REVENUES: There is a saying that goes, “The Second Sale is Always Easier,” and it’s true for our industry as well. Once you have spent the time, money, and effort attracting a patient to you, it takes minimal effort to keep them. Here’s how: Increase the # of times your patients return to you While there are vendor loyalty programs available, they can be complicated for the patients and the staff to figure out, so here’s another idea. Have a loyalty program that is super easy for everyone to understand. Give each patient a simple customized card that gives them increased savings each time they visit. On their 4th visit, that card is used up, so they get a new one. Easy Breezy! Increase the amount they spend at each visit I call this, “Do you want fries with that?”. A majority of your patients don’t look at you as a retail outlet, so they spend hundreds and thousands of dollars per year at the department store cosmetic counters or Sephora and Ulta because they don’t know better. But rather than pressure them into buying your products, make it easy and comfortable for them to choose to buy your products on their own. For example, •	Use your products on them during their treatments. •	Offer a beauty bar where they can sample your products. •	Have a bowl of skincare samples at the check-out counter so when they have their wallet out, it’s the perfect time to ask: o	Did you want to add sunscreen to your visit today? Or o	Do you need any skincare product refills today? Or o	Did you need a quick gift? While pointing to your eye-catching gift display. Increase the # of referrals they give you Each of your patients has, on average, a circle of 150-250 people they know (family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, gym buddies, and so on.) Make it easy for them to talk about you AND refer you to them. Have customized business-sized “Get To Know Us” cards printed with a special offer to experience your services for the first time. These cards should be distributed everywhere possible: •	On your checkout counter •	On checkout counters of your alliances •	In nearby gyms, salons, retail shops •	Mailed to your current patients to pass along, and so on. However, due to fee-splitting laws, you cannot tie a cash reward your patients get for referring new patients to you but you can thank them profusely. BUT…..Don’t Bother Doing the Above Until You Read This: No matter how many creative strategies you come up with, nothing beats customer service for patient satisfaction, retention, referrals, and 5-star reviews. Cosmetic patients with credit cards want to feel cared for and cared about. I am still surprised how often I spend thousands of dollars on injectables or lasers and never hear a peep out of anyone afterward. Nobody checks in to see how I’m doing. It makes me feel like they don’t care. Your patients feel the same way. If you don’t care enough about how their treatment went, they are not going to care about you when it’s time to spend more money on cosmetic rejuvenation or surgery. Have a protocol in place to email/call/text the evening of treatment to be sure all is well. There’s a chance you’re saying right now, “I’m not looking for trouble” but there’s a different way to look at it. Trouble would be the unhappy patient who silently disappears to your competitor and tells all of their friends. That’s the reverse of referrals… it’s the new patient deterrent problem. It’s much cheaper and easier to make a patient happy than to replace them with another new patient, so take care of your patients, and they will take care of you. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Note: If you still think new patients are the way to go, but your coordinator is having trouble converting these new patients you’ve spent a fortune to get, have her join me at The Converting Club. I guarantee they will convert 10-15% more consultations once they learn how to professionally represent you as the BEST CHOICE. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
4,Attract Affluent Plastic Surgery Patients,business," Here is the reality…you can charge twice as much as your competitors when you attract affluent plastic surgery patients to your practice. This would allow you to either double your revenues with the same amount of patients or work less for the same amount of revenues. For example, let’s say your competitors charge $5K for a bleph, so you charge $10K. The math is easy….your competitors need to attract and serve 200 cosmetic patients for a $1M cosmetic practice while you need only 100. What would that mean to you in terms of time, money, and energy focusing on the needs of only 100 patients versus the 200 “generic” patients that everyone else is attempting to attract? Focusing on the 100 affluent patients versus the 200 “anybody’s” makes very good business sense so let’s look at how you make it happen. IT’S NOT ABOUT YOUR SKILLS AT THIS LEVEL This will be counterintuitive but important to grasp: It’s not about being 2x better at a bleph to charge 2x more. Board-certified trained plastic surgeons do a nice bleph. That’s true, or you wouldn’t be board-certified. And this isn’t about supporting your higher price simply by creating better value propositions. That works well for the “mass market” but not for the upscale, affluent market. Because this assumes everybody is a value buyer, and that’s not the case when you go up the food chain. The masses buy for all sorts of other reasons, but the affluent pretty much DON’T buy for value. The further up the ladder they are – the less “needs-driven” they are. So it’s all about what they WANT to do – not what they NEED to do. So they think differently than the average patient. Attract affluent plastic surgery patients by understanding their needs and wants. They are not buying by need and function so they are not buying by price and value. It’s more about the intangibles and what this purchase means to them that is driving their decision. THE MIND OF THE AFFLUENT PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT Affluent patients pay more because doing so makes them feel more like the person they either wish they were or envision themselves to be. To see what I mean, check out www.HighSnobiety.com and www.RobbReport.com for a glimpse into the world of luxury. At this level, you are hardly talking about the surgery. It’s the intangibles of the surgery that attracts affluent patients to you. The affluent patients are looking for superior service providers….even if it’s based on perception. They believe they deserve the best, so they want the best. This group will pay to buy certainty. By the way, trust is the single most important issue because the affluent patient wants to feel like they are getting the best. HOW TO MAKE PRICE DISAPPEAR FROM THE EQUATION So, knowing that what are the things that make price disappear from the equation and YOU the only choice for affluent patients? The answer is YOU. It’s more about you than your product. You stand out from the crowd by doing what others won’t do or can’t do. The quickest path in today’s world is to either marry one of the housewives on Bravo TV or at least be their go-to plastic surgeon. But if that’s not possible, here are 3 other strategies that help make the price go away: Peer Recommendations The affluent are reached more through peer referral than any other avenue. This group of cosmetic patients values trust more than anything else, so they turn to others they trust. Knowing that - you’ll want to identify them in your own practice. Give them an excellent result and an exceptional patient experience. Now make them part of your VIP Club, where you have private events they can invite their friends to. To make it special, add a charity component to it and invite the media. It’s the exclusivity that gives the affluent patients the feeling of status they want and expect. Be The Expert Although you are well versed in all sorts of surgical procedures, the affluent patient wants to go to the BEST. They want the surgeon who specializes in blephs, has done 10x more blephs than the average surgeon, and who has tons of social proof of hundreds of other happy bleph patients. It would also be helpful if you are considered, “The Eye Guy” because you have been interviewed by the media and you even train other surgeons on your innovative bleph techniques. Use Social Media to Connect with Affluent Plastic Surgery Patients Social media has made it possible for you to develop your fan club quickly and easily. Regularly post before and after photos of your bleph patients and tell their stories. Shoot short Instagram video stories answering bleph FAQs. Respond to anyone who comments on your posts and find out if they are social media influencers who also have a healthy following. The point is after enough communication, familiarity, reinforcement, and proof. The affluent patients now have sufficient trust in you to reach out. CONCLUSION To attract affluent plastic surgery patients takes a different way of thinking. If you believe you are worth double what your competitors charge, in terms of customer service and skills, set your practice up to cater to the affluent patients that are attracted to your higher prices because, they too, believe they are worth it."
5,The Differences between French and British Pocket Watches,business," Here is a strictly personal and mainly non-technical view of the differences between French and British pocket watches from say the mid-18th century to the earlier 20th. Do please note that this article contains some VERY broad generalisations. It is a rough guide only. 18th century – the verge is king A balance bridge basically means that the ornate piece of brass sitting on top of the balance wheel is secured by screws at both ends. A balance cock only has one screw and foot securing it, as it projects out over the balance wheel. Note that some Dutch and German makers made their pieces and signed them with an English name and “London” but they still used a balance bridge. Pair-cased pieces are slightly more unusual in France than the UK. French pieces have an adjustment screw to help make easy fractional changes to the crown wheel and pinion. British pieces usually don’t and use instead a brass stent/plug. Some purists argue this makes French watches of the period technically superior to British – you can debate that one at length! While there are of course exceptions, French watches tend to be mainly smaller. British watches start to become larger towards the end of the century. 19th Century - verges Until around 1830-40, both countries are still largely making verge fusees. France also starts making some chunkier, heavier watches from around 1820. These are called “Campagnard”. Some French watches start to be fitted with snap-on rear cases rather than the previously more commonplace hinged solutions. This is less commonplace in the UK. Styles start to diverge more significantly in the period 1815-1830 and the end of the verge epoch. In the UK, watches are becoming larger in diameter, heavier and their cases (often pair-cased) are becoming much weightier in terms of silver or gold content, than their French counterparts. The silver in most French watches is far thinner. It’s not clear if this was a practical design consideration to keep weight down or a reflection of the more rapidly growing wealth of the British middle class versus their French cousins. Whatever, most French watches from 1830 onwards start to feel much less substantial in the hand than British pieces, though they may have been a little easier to carry around. 19th century – death of verges After several centuries of good service, the verge starts to become obsolete from around 1830 onwards. This transition happens faster in France than the UK. However, in terms of men’s watches, France moves almost universally to what’s called the “cylinder escapement”. By the 1840s-50s, most French watches are even smaller, lighter and thinner, due to this revolution. The silver content of their cases also reduces. In the UK, cylinders start to become more commonplace being often imported from Switzerland or France, however, these are largely restricted to women’s watches. The UK makers recognised the end of the verge but mainly adapted for men’s watches, a different escapement. That was called the “English Lever” though to begin with, it was still combined with a fusee and chain. From around 1840 onwards, you can’t easily tell at a glance whether a woman’s watch (often called a ‘fob’) is French, Swiss or British. By contrast, men’s watches are typically very different between the two countries. In the UK, it seems clear that many men still demanded very large, chunky and solid 'statement' watches. Pair cases are still commonplace and dial or casing decoration is comparatively rare. US watches also start to make a favourable impression. In France, men’s watches are typically much smaller, lighter and more likely to carry engraving on the case and dial decoration of one sort or another. 20th Century By the earlier years of the century, the verge fusee has almost entirely gone from the UK and pretty much is now long-dead in France. The cylinder sweeps all before it in France in the late 19th century but it is starting to see increasing challenge from the escapement that will soon become predominant – the “Swiss Lever”. Many but by no means all pocket watches are now stem-wound in the UK and France. During WWI, pocket watches start to lose ground to wristwatches too and by the 1940s, they have largely gone, though even today they continue to be made. French watches (many were in fact mass produced in Switzerland) continue to be smaller, lighter and thinner, than British. Their cases and dials remain more ornate on average. Many also reflect the design impact of Art Nouveau and later Art Deco. The use of silver declines and it is replaced by cheaper alternatives such as argentan (an alloy) or steel. In the UK, the English Lever escapement loses ground slowly to the Swiss Lever and some cylinders. However, stylistically, many British watches for men continue to be larger, heavier and more overtly masculine in style than French. Far more are in silver than was by now the norm for mass-market watches in France. In the UK there is also a trend during the 1920s-30s towards thinner and finer watches for men and of course, Art Nouveau and Deco both have an influence on some cases and dials. Yet on the whole, British makers targeting the mass-market continued to produce very conservatively-styled pieces that would have been recognisable to their grandparents 80 years before – with the exception of the stem wind. Summary – which is best? We’re speaking here mainly about visual appearance and style, not the technical merits of different escapement types. So, this is about opinion and personal inclination – meaning there can be no answer! For women’s watches, there is a mid-19th century convergence meaning that they have a very similar appearance across both the UK and France. Many, cases and movements or movements only, were made in Switzerland. It’s really only in male watches that you see very significant divergence in styles and apparent tastes, which is starting to become visible in the 18th century but which became much more pronounced around 1815-30. If you like a feel of solidity, plainness and a “this watch will last a lifetime”, sensation, then you’ll probably be drawn to British watches. By contrast, if you incline towards a little more elegance, design flair and self-expression, then you might smile more upon French watches. Another factor some devotees of French watches cite is that they don’t feel like they’re a brick in your pocket which is likely to pull your breeches down! In the end, they’re all wonderful things. Enjoy them – wherever they were made."
6,How to Increase Sale Conversion Using ChatBot Software,business," One of the best chatbot technologies that I have seen in a long time is called ChatBots. What are chatbots? They are programs that will make business for you by providing you with answers, suggestions, statistics and so much more based on their natural language processing abilities. These chatbots are becoming more popular because they can provide excellent customer service based on the decisions that they take based on their analysis and interaction with the clients. In this article, I will show you how to increase sale conversion using chatbots and other chatbot technologies. After reading this article, you will understand why chatbot is one of the best options to choose for your online business. If you haven't used chatbot technology before, you might not realize how powerful it is compared to regular emailing. If you send emails with product information, updates, and news-making with your products and/or services, you will receive tons of replies from different people who will probably either give you good advice or not even respond at all. With a chatbot, you can easily interact with these people, ask relevant questions, give useful information, and then get back to those who have expressed interest. Apart from being very effective, this system of selling is also very affordable. Before you invest in a chatbot system, you should check out how much it will cost you to set up an account and use it to market your products. The total cost can range from free to thousands of dollars. Since there are many chatbot technologies, you can easily find something that will fit your needs within your budget. There are different kinds of chatbot software for different kinds of purposes. For instance, there are those which are designed to help market physical products. There are also those which are designed for online selling and networking. Chatbot software is now preferred by most marketers because of its numerous features. Its artificial intelligence makes it able to store large amounts of information, make a quick research on market trends, and make use of all available communication channels to make the most out of every transaction it initiates and receives. Knowing how to increase sale conversion using a chatbot is only half of the story. To truly take advantage of this bot, you need to know how to properly use it. You should never rush when interacting with the bot, as your actions will have a significant impact on how the sales conversion happens. Be patient when learning how to use the bot and learn as much as you can about the system. Make sure that you can answer any question that your bot might throw at you. The third most important thing that you should know about chatbot software is that it is a very versatile piece of software. There are various versions of chatbot software that are available for different purposes. This means that you can use different versions for different purposes. For example, if you are into online selling, you can buy the most appropriate bot that matches your needs. If you want to use it for social networking, then you can get the chatbot software that best matches your requirements. There are various versions that you can choose from, and you must choose one that is perfect for your needs and goals. With how to increase sale conversion using chatbot software, you should always keep in mind that it does not work for everyone. If you think that you have found the best possible bot, then make sure that you are conversing with real people and not computer-generated artificial intelligence bots. It might be a good idea to test a demo account before actually purchasing the product. This way, you can practice what you have learned. In this way, you can determine how well the chatbot works and whether you have achieved the results that you have aimed for. Apart from knowing how to increase sale conversion using chatbot software, you must also learn how to choose the best product or service. You will be able to determine this by browsing through the various products that are available on the market. You must ensure that it is suitable for your business needs. Remember that these chatbot programs are not difficult to use. Many people today are relying on these programs to help them increase their sales. Therefore, if you do not want to miss out on this opportunity, then you must learn how to use a chatbot program. The advantages of using a chatbot solution for an online business are many. First of all, you have the advantage of making your business more personal and interactive. As opposed to a chat system that can be impersonal like a voice message or a generic message board, your chatbot will be able to respond to specific queries and requests. In addition, your bot can also be more personalized by incorporating graphics or images into the message itself. A good chatbot solution will be able to integrate a wide variety of messages into one that is tailored to the needs of your prospective customers. There are several chatbot solution providers available for you to choose from. These programs can be set up as standalone businesses, or you can use them as part of an affiliate marketing program. Either way, the end result is the same - you'll be able to make more money from your online business with less effort than you would if you tried to manage it on your own. There are two basic types of chatbot solutions out there. Some of these programs are text-based, while others are web-based. Text-based chatbot programs are typically less expensive to use, but they tend to lack some of the cool tools that web-based chatbot programs have. The biggest downside to using a chatbot solution is that you won't be able to personally see what your customers are saying if they don't sign up for your list. Fortunately, most chatbot systems include customer support in their features. Before you can choose which chatbot solution you'll use, you'll need to know how to create one in the first place. The process is pretty simple, but it does take a bit of practice to get it just right. All you have to do is sign up for a free account on one of the chatbot providers' websites. Once you've done this, you'll be given the URL of the page where you'll plug in your details. You'll also be given a unique Chatbot ID, which is what the bot will use to handle your messages. There are two main types of chatbot solutions. These are known as consumer and enterprise. Consumer programs are more flexible than enterprise ones since they were made to give the average user a chatbot experience without having to shell out any cash. Consumer chatbot solutions can be used for text chats, voice chats, and even video chats. These programs are available for both Macs and PCs. If you want to purchase your chatbot solution, you may have to do a bit of shopping around. The best programs are usually sold in bundles, which means that you'll have to look through a long list of products to find one that's suitable for your circumstances. This can be very time-consuming and will likely require that you buy from a reputable provider. Don't forget that you'll need to make sure that the chatbot solution you purchase is compatible with the OS and browser on which you'll be using it. To get the most out of your chatbot solution, it's also important to keep it updated. Many of today's programs are designed to automatically detect chatroom file changes, and send them to you automatically. To ensure this doesn't happen, be sure to purchase an update for your chatbot solution at regular intervals. This will ensure that you're always up to date on the latest features and enhancements. Not only will this help you stay competitive, but will also help you keep track of any changes that may occur in the future."
7,How Do Chat Bots Work?,business," There's no doubt that chatbot technology is changing the way business is done online. Companies who understand how do chat Bots work can use them to improve their customer service, make sales, or find new customers. There are many different types of chatbots, each designed for a certain need. Bot developers have written programs for hotels, restaurants, airlines, banks, dating websites, video game developers, and even telemarketers. A chatbot is an automated or self-learning AI system programmed to conversate automatically with clients through an online application, message board, or social media platform in a manner that closely mimics a real human conversation. The latest chatbot technologies combine a wide range of artificial intelligence, such as language understanding, pattern recognition, image recognition, and the ability to mimic conversation characteristics, into one single system. ChatBots work best for conversations where client requirements are clear and specific. This means that a developer looking to sell software must first determine what kind of chatbot they need before they can install it. Bot developers who want to provide chatbots for e-commerce websites should look towards tools that are flexible enough to handle any conversational content. They should also have a suitable algorithm that is designed to accommodate natural conversations. These algorithms are generally developed using ML or supervised learning. A good example of this kind of software is the e-study software that e-commerce companies like Amazon use. Bot developers looking to improve upon traditional chatbot systems should look towards tools that are capable of generating appropriate responses, taking patterns from past conversations, and understanding and manipulating language patterns. Such tools are usually more complex than basic chat Bots and, therefore, cost a bit more money. The tools that achieve the desired result are more expensive than basic chatbots. But, if you're willing to pay the price, you'll be getting an excellent product that can do the kinds of work you need it to. Unlike ordinary chatbot software, those designed to handle conversational tasks are designed to adapt to the types of conversations they will be participating in. For instance, those who are interested in selling items over the Internet will want a bot with conversational intelligence. If the bot has a context-appropriate response, then the same contextual response will be used no matter what type of chatbot user is participating in the chat session. These is called context-aware chatbots. Another example is an automated social network that allows users to create profiles and provides the appropriate response if the user is logged in or not. To understand how chatbots work in this way, it's important to understand the difference between natural intelligence and conversational ai. Natural intelligence refers to how a computer program behaves without any knowledge of its surroundings. Chatbots, however, are designed to provide the appropriate responses in specific situations by analyzing and understanding the words or conversations being conducted. Conversational I, on the other hand, refers to how a chatbot understands human language. One way how chatbots work is to use what is called artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a piece of software that uses what is called a generative framework. An artificial intelligence system is designed to generate a variety of responses by using the knowledge and data it is given. This information is then processed through several layers of artificial intelligence or ""neural networks"" to form a richer and more complete response. In most cases, the generated responses are generic enough that they can be understood by most people, but the developers of chatbots take it a step further and ensure that the conversations being participated in are suitable for the application. If you are looking for tips on how to sell your service with a chatbot, then you have come to the right place. I will go over in this article how to sell your service with the chatbot, and how it can help your business. A chatbot is selling services and products with chat Bots software tools that utilize artificial intelligence to talk with clients on the phone. While an average text campaign launch rate is only at about 15% to 25%, some chat Bots now hit up rates of over 90%. These chat bots are capable of providing prospects with the needed information on demand. For example, if someone calls you and needs a shoulder lift, your chat Bot will call up a supplier or a car dealership and provide them with what they need. It takes no extra time, but rather just minutes of your time. When it comes to generating leads, this method is one of the best available. How to sell your service with chat Bots has been around for quite a while. The first chatbot that was ever developed generated leads at a rate of about 10%. This was back in the nineties. Since then, many businesses have found several uses for these chat Bots, and today they can generate hundreds and thousands of leads a month. Some businesses are using chat Bots for lead generation alone! Unlike other lead generation systems, the type of system used by chatbots is completely automated. Therefore, there is no more need for you to do any work to set it up. Most of them can be set up in less than ten minutes. The software required for chat Bots is relatively inexpensive, however, so it makes it easy for even new marketers to get started. The system used by chatbots is based on two separate sets of scripts: A web-based script and a series of conditional logic programs that run in the background. In simple terms, the chatbot sends out ""cold calls"" to potential customers, and the program analyzes the responses. Based on what it learns from the response, the bot forwards that information to the owner of the lead. By using these two different sets of programs, a chatbot can identify a specific business, set up a conversation, and generate leads at a much higher rate than if you were trying to do the same thing manually. However, to use a chatbot for generating leads, you need to know how to sell your service with chatbots first. Simply put, it's a necessity because, without it, your bot is essentially useless! This article will go over what you need to know to make your bot an important tool in your arsenal for generating recurring revenue. One way how to sell your service with the chatbot is through Facebook's fan page system. If you have a business page on Facebook, you can add a button to one of your Facebook pages that automatically starts the conversation flow on your bot. This is very powerful because not only is it an effective way how to sell your service with chat Bots, but it also provides an opportunity to drive traffic directly to your website. You can easily set up a schedule for when your bot will start conversations based on demographics like age, gender, location, and so on. Furthermore, you can use Facebook's fan page system to build lists of businesses that already use chatbots, or you can use this as a way to drive traffic to your website while providing your bot with a list of businesses to follow up with"
8,Mistakes Plastic Surgeons Make,business," The mistakes plastic surgeons make cause confusion, chaos, and frustration, but it doesn’t have to be that way. When running your plastic surgery practice, the simplest things are the most overlooked. However, those simple things can make a BIG impact on your bottom line. You are so busy running your practice, attracting new patients, and keeping everyone happy, that it’s easy to miss what’s NOT working. See if you are making any of these mistakes that can derail you and your revenues: MISTAKE #1: NOT KNOWING WHO’S REALLY ON YOUR TEAM The team you surround yourself with can make or break your aesthetic practice – period. Getting the right team players on board is difficult and ever-changing but vital to your success. So, do you have the right team in place? And, do they know their main job is to promote you and your services, which starts with impeccable customer service? Is your staff helping or hurting your practice? In my travels as a business and marketing consultant to cosmetic practices, I’ve seen a lot…. •	Staff is charming to the doctor and witchy to everyone else; •	Patient care coordinators refer the patient to the competitor because she thought they did a better job with that procedure; •	The receptionist sends the patients to the internet to buy products since they’re cheaper than those sold in their office. And it goes on and on. It’s imperative every staff person who works for you knows exactly what is expected of them. So, I ask again, do you know you have the right team in place? If you’re not sure, here’s one thing you can do to find out… Hold a friendly staff referral contest. Keep it short and simple. Give your staff refer-a-friend cards with their name on them so you can track their efforts. Use business-size cards since they are inexpensive to print, and your staff can conveniently carry them with them during their daily lives. Now for the next 30 days, they refer their family, friends, hair salon stylist, gym buddies, club members, etc. Whoever has the most referrals come in for an appointment within the 30 days wins the grand prize which should have been on display in the lunchroom the entire month to keep them motivated. You want to make this a great prize such as an iPad, flat-screen TV or whatever. But here’s the point. You’ll find out who the team players are, and if you have staff that didn’t bother to participate, I suggest you find new staff. MISTAKE #2: IGNORING YOUR CURRENT PATIENTS Do you know the #1 reason patients never return to your practice? It’s not that they didn’t like you. It’s not that they didn’t get a good result. It’s your indifference! Since you didn’t stay in touch, they most likely wandered off to your competitor, who did keep in touch. Persistent and consistent communication keeps your name in front of your patients, so when they’re ready, they call you!  How do you keep in touch, you ask? Use direct mail and email marketing to let your cosmetic patients know what’s new with you, your office, and the world of aesthetic enhancement. Now, before you close your mind to direct mail because you believe it’s way too expensive, consider this. The world is getting fragmented today with so many new media outlets for your patients. They get their information from a huge variety of internet sites, cable TV stations, and satellite radio. That means you can’t count on one newspaper ad anymore to reach them. You need to be more strategic. Direct mail is making a comeback and can be the cheapest form of advertising today because it’s so targeted. Since the patient receiving it knows you already, it’s more likely to get opened and responded to. The point is that it is always easier, cheaper, and more productive to stay in touch with patients who already know, like, and trust you than it is to constantly attempt to convert total strangers to your practice. And, here is another way to keep in touch with valuable patients who have given you money…. Use patient seminars and events to build relationships. The more face-to-face time a patient has with you, the more likely they are to stay loyal to you. Holding in-house seminars and events where your patients discover new information and get to interact with you one-on-one is what solidifies your relationship and their loyalty. It also gets them talking about you to their friends and family, so be sure you always encourage them to invite a friend to your office. Let’s see what other mistakes plastic surgeons make that are hurting them… MISTAKE #3: ASSUMING YOUR PATIENTS WILL REFER Let’s consider the value of just one of your patients. Every one of your patients has, on average, 150-250 people in their circle of influence. That includes family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, hairstylists, gym buddies, etc. Can you imagine if every one of your current patients referred only one of them to you? That would double your patient database and, hopefully, revenues very quickly! So how do you get referrals? You set up systems that happen automatically as part of your processes. For example…. Patient Photos Give your patients their photos! That means you have a process in place where you are taking photos every time. And making them available to your patients. I guarantee they want them because I asked them in my book and I learned that: •	82% wanted their before/after photos •	76% would have shown them to others if only they were made available to them. But, it’s all in the presentation. At their post-op appointment when they are the happiest with you and the most excited about their result, hand them a handwritten note card with their photos enclosed that says, “Thank you for your trust” and be sure your name, telephone number, and website address are visible. By the way, this is not just for surgical procedures. I recommend using this same process for your injectable procedures as well. Gift Cards Be sure to offer gift cards and gift certificates and make a big deal of it. So many of you offer them, but it’s a big secret in your practice. How do you change that? Simple. Using your own customized gift bags and tissue, set up a gorgeous display at checkout with an eye-catching sign that says, “NEED A QUICK GIFT?” It’s the timing that’s so important because they are standing there at checkout with their wallet out, credit card in hand, and yes, they may need a quick gift. Not only does that increase their order size for the day, but it also introduces a new patient to your practice. Patient Testimonials/Videos In today’s world, trust is harder to come by than ever before. The aesthetic patient is trying to figure out if you are the right choice for them, so they need your help, but how? The answer is to offer proof. The more proof you can provide to the patient who’s considering your services, the more likely they are to move forward. I think we all know it’s so much better when a patient tells a prospective patient how great you are than when you tell them how great you are, so set up a process for that as well. Whenever a patient is happy with you and gushing about their result – ask them for a testimonial right then and there. You can have them write it out a notecard or, better yet, have an iPad handy and let them tell their story straight from the heart. Then be sure to add these to your testimonial books, run them on your website, and use them as social media posts. Thank Them! And, by all means, thank them for supporting you! Everybody wants to feel appreciated when they do something nice, and your patients are no different. You don’t want to assume your patients know you appreciate their referrals; set up a system that acknowledges their efforts. And make a big deal about it because behavior that is rewarded is repeated. Send them a handwritten note, call them personally, and thank them again the next time you see them. You may even want to send them a small gift and or give them a little extra Botox at their next appointment. MISTAKE #4: ONLY WORKING IN YOUR PRACTICE AND NOT ON YOUR PRACTICE In today’s crazy competitive world, it’s more important than ever to get the fundamentals right. That means setting up predictable systems to attract the right patients to your practice, convert the callers to appointments, convert the consultations to paid procedures, collect more testimonials and increase word-of-mouth referrals. Just like in sports, it’s getting good at the fundamentals that win the game – not the one fancy move – isn’t that right? So please meet with your staff regularly to hone their skills and your processes for that constant, never-ending improvement in each area of your practice. This is what builds your credibility, your reputation, and your revenues. MISTAKE #5: NO PLAN IN PLACE As they say, “If you fail to plan, you plan to fail” It costs you too much to acquire a new cosmetic patient to be sloppy about it. Here’s what I mean… The top cosmetic practices realize it’s not one email. It’s not one newsletter. It’s not one event. The secret is to regularly keep your name in front of your current as well as new cosmetic patients so they choose you over all the others when they are ready for cosmetic enhancement. Because circumstances change, life changes and people change, that means those who said NO before were saying NOT YET OR NOT NOW, so when they are ready, they’re going to the surgeon they are most likely familiar with, and hopefully, that’s you. But how do you stay in front of prospective patients? Annual Marketing Plan Put a plan in place with an action date and a staff person who is accountable for seeing to it that it gets done. You have protocols set up for everything else in your practice so do one more for the process of promoting your cosmetic services. Here’s an example: January •	Theme – New Year – New You •	Email to Entire Patient List with Jan Specials (Karen) •	Social Media Posts – 3x per week (Sandy) •	Add B/A Photos and Testimonials to Website (Ken) •	VIP Cards Sent to Best Patients to Use This Year (Sophia) •	Coolscuplting In-House Event (Karen) Now each practice team member owns their part of the practice promotion so they are focused on practice building and not just their day-to-day tasks. Once you fix the mistakes plastic surgeons make, you will see your practice run more smoothly, and isn’t that what you want? If you could use some help fine-tuning your practice to run on all cylinders, let’s talk about consulting so I can show you how other successful practices are set up to succeed. We can talk about where you are now, where you want to be and the roadblocks in your way"
9,Plastic Surgery Email Marketing,business," This may be hard to believe, but the email marketing stats show that plastic surgery email marketing is still one of the top plastic surgery marketing: what’s working now strategies, and it’s here to stay. Not only does the number of emails sent every year continues to grow, but so does the number of email addresses created. EMAIL STATS So, who’s sending and reading all of these emails? Here are email stats worth considering: It turns out, in the U.S. alone, more than 90% of people over the age of 15 use email. And all of us (well, 99% of us) check our email every day, even before social media. And email has a longer shelf life since you can read it now or later. Email also has a larger footprint, so you have the space to get your points across with more copies and images. So, staying in front of your cosmetic patients regularly with well-thought-out promotional and compelling emails keeps them coming back. It also keeps you top of mind with your cosmetic patients. YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR EMAIL LIST A very big reason to build and nurture your cosmetic patient email list is that you control it. You own your patient email list, and nobody can take it away from you. Do you realize you have ZERO CONTROL over the social media platforms you use to market your practice? They own that data. You do not. Social media platforms come and go. They can disappear overnight, and with it goes all of your followers and time you spent building that following. And sites like Facebook and Instagram can delist you if you do something they don’t like. Since you never actually own your account, that means that your profile could also disappear so nobody can see you. And these social media apps determine who sees you organically (free). You will see less and less since these platforms want you to pay to get a larger reach. YOUR PATIENT EMAIL LIST IS AN ASSET Think of your plastic surgery email list as a money-making asset. This is the highest quality list of prospective cosmetic patients you have. They already know, like, and trust you. How do you know that? Because they chose you and gave you money. And they will give you more when you reach out to them in a compelling way. That means you have a valuable asset now. And that is worth a lot if you stay in touch. HOW TO USE YOUR EMAIL LIST TO ATTRACT NEW PATIENTS Here’s the biggest secret to making plastic surgery email marketing. You use your plastic surgery patient email list WITH social media to not only grow your exposure to new patients, but you use social media to grow the patient list that you now own forever. This takes technology and know-how, but it’s a profitable combination when done right. For example: FACEBOOK LOOK-A-LIKE AUDIENCE If you want to attract new cosmetic patients by placing a Facebook ad, you’ll get much better results when you use your patient email list as the audience. You’ll then create a lookalike audience based on your current patient email list. A lookalike audience is a targeting audience where Facebook finds users who have similar attributes to the patients in your list. Not only will your current patient list see and, hopefully, respond to your ad, but you’ll also reach new prospective patients who could also want your cosmetic services. Lookalike audiences give you a way to reach a cold audience beyond interest or behavior targeting. The thought being, if your current patients like you, consumers like them will like you too, so this gives you a warmer list to target. RETARGETING FROM YOUR EMAIL LIST Most consumers are not ready to say yes to you when they first find you. Take your website visitors. 97% of people who visit your website for the first time leave without buying anything, and then they’re lost forever unless you can bring them back. Think of retargeting as your automatic follow-up system. When consumers visit your website or like your Facebook post, for example, you can add a little code called a pixel, and it will follow that consumer on the Internet and show them your ads. You can also retarget using your patient email list. You’ll most likely get a better response since these cosmetic patients already know you, so they’re more likely to notice and act. Compared to other forms of advertising, retargeting is an inexpensive way to stay in front of prospective cosmetic patients using repetition. TIPS TO GET YOUR EMAILS OPENED Due to the sheer number of emails showing up in inboxes, it takes strategy to get yours delivered, opened, and acted upon. These tips will help: Killer Subject Lines You can have the most incredibly written email nobody ever sees if they don’t open your email! It all starts with the subject line. The subject line must spark interest to compel someone to click to learn more. Here are examples of cosmetic patient headlines that work well because they pique the curiosity of cosmetic patients who care about their appearance: •	Look 5 years younger without surgery •	Did she have a facelift? •	How to lose your belly fat once and for all… To better understand this, go through the promotional emails you get and figure out what made you open certain emails and not others. Personalize You will get a much better result when you personalize your emails. The easiest way to do that is to use your patients’ names. People love to see their names. It automatically gets their attention. Here is how you send emails: Add each patient’s name to the subject line like this: •	Karen, did she have a facelift? And, embed the patient’s name in the copy of the email like this: This strategy will increase your open rates by 5-25%, so be sure to use it. Compelling Copy Your cosmetic patients are busy, so they need a compelling reason to open and read your emails vs. ignoring them. Or worse, unsubscribing. You need a way to show them progress towards something, so they look forward to seeing their results. This strategy works well…. Let’s say you have a KiSS Rewards Club where they collect KiSSes for every dollar they spend. Your email copy includes their KiSS balance. The patient is excited to learn what their balance is. So they see how much more they need to get the prize. This example of email marketing is personalized with their name AND customized with their balance. That will bump up the open rate dramatically. Plastic surgery email marketing should be a staple in your annual marketing plan, so use the strategies above to get the best results."
10,Make It Impossible for Patients to Say No,business," Make it impossible for patients to say no to you by using Nordstrom’s risk reversal strategy. If you buy anything at Nordstrom, you know that if anything goes wrong with it or you are unhappy in any way, they will take it back…no questions asked. In fact, Nordstrom’s guarantee is what built its iconic business. The confidence of knowing that they will take back anything is what sets your mind at ease buying from Nordstrom. And, they are definitely not the cheapest place in town, and they are not offering discounts at every turn. What consumers really want is to make a smart buying decision. We all have “stuff” we bought and wished we hadn’t, or we felt pressured into, and now we’re stuck with it and live with regret. That makes consumers wary of doing it again and wasting money. This fear is huge in cosmetic rejuvenation. It’s a much bigger deal when your body is at stake, so cosmetic prospective patients are afraid to make a decision. They’re scared they will not get what they want and then regret it. So, they’re on the fence for years, deciding if they should or shouldn’t move forward with plastic surgery. And then once they decide they should now they have to decide “who” to choose to perform the procedure. So knowing that about consumers, it would behoove you to figure out how to calm their fears, so they choose you. The more you remove the risk (called risk reversal), the more consultations you will convert because you are lowering the hurdle of entry (which is fear) for the cosmetic patient. There is an interesting psychological factor with humans. They want you to be more at risk than they are. Cosmetic patients are scared of making the wrong decision.  And if you overcome that concern, you win over your competitors. The best companies and marketers out there use risk reversal to make it easy for the consumer to buy. But transferring the risk from the patient’s shoulders to yours is a very touchy subject for plastic surgeons. Most surgeons think they will go broke if they offer some sort of guarantee, so hear me out. Think about what you currently do when a patient comes back to you after a procedure and is livid and upset by the results they got. You, too, can see it’s not the optimal result, and this patient isn’t crazy, so don’t you do a touch-up? Or even go back in to perform a revision at no charge? Or, if it escalates, don’t you even refund them their money after they sign an agreement not to disparage you? So if you would do it anyway, why not get credit for it and use that risk reversal to convert more consultations, especially when the patient is deciding which of you or your competitors to go with? Most plastic surgeons are scared to give guarantees because they think their patients will take advantage of them. Well, it will happen on occasion. But most cosmetic patients are honest and ethical if you choose wisely. And those patients that take advantage of you would have done the same thing even if you didn’t have a guarantee. By the way, you are not advertising your guarantee. You are only using it in the consultation with the patient who is on the fence and close to making a decision. But the fear factor is preventing them from saying yes. HERE ARE A FEW PARTICULARS ABOUT RISK REVERSAL Take time to show your patients what results they should expect. Walk them through it and carefully explain and educate them on the emotional and physical benefits you offer. Here is a sample script: “If you don’t look at yourself in the mirror and feel more confident and secure after this procedure, then I want you to come back and ask for a refund. That’s how strongly I believe this procedure will work for you.” Since cosmetic results can take months and even up to one year for the final results, make sure the patient is aware of the time frame. Interestingly, the longer amount of time you make your guarantee, the lower the number of refunds. Watch Your Numbers After Instituting Risk Transference When a practice begins assuming the risk for the patient, it is not uncommon for them to see double or triple the amount of scheduled surgeries. With those kinds of numbers, it makes the handful of people who take you up on your guarantee well worth it. You will have a whole lot more cosmetic patients use your services because of this unique feature. Look, if you are confident in your abilities like I know you are. And you are selecting patients that make sense. Then they should be getting the results and outcomes they want. State your guarantee in the strongest possible, legally permissible terms. As prospective patients are weighing their options and comparing surgeons, think about the difference your guarantee will make in their minds. If you want to help propel uncertain patients “off the fence” this will do it. When you use this risk reversal strategy, the revenues you gain in booked surgeries will far surpass the revenues you will lose.

11,Tips to develop an excellent corporate website,business," Regardless of the industry and business scale, being online is more important than ever. Why? Today, customers tend to search for the services and products without leaving their homes – online. That significantly facilitates their decision-making process, so most shoppers would buy an item they’ve seen on the web. Also, when online, companies have more chances to expose their services and products compared to real-life settings. That’s why the web has much more potential when it comes to marketing and advertising campaigns. However, the role of a corporate website remains of the utmost. Having a high-quality website is key to excellent business performance. First of all, a business website is representative number one, where you can easily display your company’s culture and introduce your business to the market. Also, it’s a powerful tool for highlighting your business and bringing brand awareness to a higher level. With the help of the corporate website, it’s also easier to gain customers and build trust within your potential clientele. In a nutshell, a corporate website is a web platform that is aimed at representing the company as a whole. It is a place to demonstrate the brand's mission and values. And everyone who arrives at a corporate website should get a clear understanding of the company’s reputation and achievements. For that reason, such websites usually display data concerning the company’s operating, different success reports, and statistics. That drives trust and credibility, allowing the company to attract not only customers but also partners and investors. Developing a corporate website from scratch might be difficult. How to make the website appealing and avoid overloading it with a flat narrative of the business cores? The answer is to employ a proficient web design and development agency. There are numerous web design and development London companies that work with any scale projects. Another path to choose is design upon a theme. WordPress suggests a vast number of themes that help its customers to create excellent corporate websites for their businesses. And if you have a small budget, the WordPress theme is the best option. However, regardless of the path chosen, there are several points to remember when crafting a corporate website. These points will help you to create both functionally and visually enhanced platform that will be able to appeal to and impress visitors: Employ the basic set of pages Each corporate website is unique, but there is a set of pages that are integral. The About page is aimed to introduce newcomers to your business. Usually, this page includes brief information about the company, its history, the team, and the main areas of the company’s work. Another important page is the Contact page. Here you place the contact details, including your email address and the actual address of our company. Also, you may create a Social proof page, where the potential customers will be able to get to know your reputation. Provide only relevant content A corporate website is the means of communication between your business and the public. And to make that communication happen, it’s critical to sort out the content you publish so that it will be relevant and comprehensive. Don’t place too much advertising or self-promotional information – this can alienate the visitors. Make sure you present the data consistently and do not overload your website. Apply the design and proper branding Design is critical, especially for a corporate website. The platform should look consistent and holistic yet impressive. To achieve that, you may use sophisticated color palettes and design elements. However, keep a close eye on it – incomprehensive designs can deteriorate your performance. Also, try to use simple layouts that are easily perceived by average users and don’t confuse them. Sometimes, simplicity is key. As for the branding, you need to ensure your website is properly branded. Users tend to trust established brands rather than faceless businesses. Here, you need to place your logo and adhere to the brand color scheme. Also, make sure you have a brand mission and values highlighted on the platform. These steps will give you an opportunity to stand out and make your website eye-catching. Include social media links For better saturation of your business, you need to employ social media networking as well. Social media is an excellent way to share your content and build more awareness. Enable your corporate website with links to your social media accounts. It will allow visitors to share your content and discover your services beyond the website. Optimize the website for mobile usage Half of the overall traffic comes from mobile devices, and that is the main reason to make your website mobile-friendly. Make sure your website loads well regardless of the device and the screen resolution. Also, don’t forget to optimize all the content on your website for better speed performance. Following these tips, you will be able to create a great corporate website. That will also help you to drive more traffic to your business website and urge newcomers to linger on it and delve deeper into the essence. Ultimately, a corporate website is the face of your business. And thinking about it in advance may help you to escape any significant failures in the future."
12,Separating pain from addiction,business," Addiction is a different kind of prison and drug addiction is not only about heroin, cocaine, or other illegal drugs. You can also get addicted to prescribed narcotic pain medications, also known as opioids, which are now a major crisis in most countries, accounting for 0.5 million deaths related to opioids. Tim Peara is the Finance Director and President of Bridge Therapeutics, which is a company that is well-positioned to provide a safer chronic pain alternative to combat and help curb this current opioid crisis. ‘BizTalk with Massimiliano Sulpizi’ is an innovative arena to pitch your venture idea. It was designed and is conducted by EquityMatch.co for its community who are seeking the opportunity for fundraising for startups. This initiative was launched to provide an opportunity to all the founders in search of seed investment for their startups and share details about their venture with the founder of EquityMatch.co via a video conference. Bridge Therapeutics have been working with a drug called buprenorphine, which is both safe and effective for both pain and addiction. This greatly reduces the time cost and risk of FDA approval. Buprenorphine is as strong as fentanyl, which is the strongest opioid for pain relief. Fentanyl is about 35 or 30 times stronger than morphine and has an overdose risk of about 50 times worse than morphine. Even though buprenorphine is like fentanyl, the risk of overdose is zero. Since, buprenorphine is generic, it requires barriers to entry to protect the products. This is achieved through several methods, which include a delivery system called Zydis, marketing exclusivity, patented products, and improved versions. Although Bridge Therapeutics does not have the patent for this delivery system that they use, it is well-known, well-used and significant. Hence, it has become the first and the basis for building an economic barrier around what they do. When it comes to the accomplishments, Bridge Therapeutics designed a delivery method two years ago and filed their first file with the FDA, known as an Investigational New Drug (IND), last year. Thereby, Bridge Therapeutics is working in the field of pharmaceuticals to separate pain from addiction and resolve the opioid crisis. EquityMatch.co is founded by Massimiliano Sulpizi, an avid entrepreneur, venture capitalist, merchant banker, and executive. He is the Founder and Managing Partner of HSMI-Corporate Advisory, where he has advised clients in the infrastructure, fashion, real estate, and tech, totaling transactions for over €100M, and fundraising over €50M. He currently serves as an advisor and a board member to numerous EU/HK healthcare and technology startups and growth-stage companies. EquityMatch.co helps founders to find their ideal match for startup funding. It is a platform that encourages startup investing. It also provides an opportunity to search for the right investor by creating a profile with their information and by broadcasting their innovative thoughts via video streaming. It is designed to serve entrepreneurs seeking seed-stage funding through to the pre-IPO stage, without the hassle of recreating a company profile at every stage of the funding process."

14,Fix Your Follow Up for Plastic Surgeons,business," How frustrating is it to spend a ton of money, staff time, and resources on internet marketing for new cosmetic patient leads only to have those very leads come in as prospective patients and leave as prospective patients….STILL. You can’t afford to waste any more time or money on marketing if you are not converting these leads….It’s too competitive, it’s too crowded, and it’s too expensive NOT to do everything within your control to convert these Internet leads into paid procedures. Here’s a typical consultation scenario… Hmmm…. You thought you had a great consultation with your prospective patient, Sara. Sara had a good consultation with you and your staff, and she asked lots of questions, and you had a good connection…at least you thought you did. But then you find out from your coordinator, Sara ended up saying, “I gotta think about it” and walked out the door. Now what? Maybe your staff emails or calls them, and then they are dropped in the “dead leads” file. You move onto the next consultation that you hope converts, and the cycle of waste continues… Why Don’t Patients Book? Since cosmetic rejuvenation is a very personal and emotional decision, there are all sorts of reasons why prospective patients don’t book…. •	Maybe they have other consultations lined up •	Maybe they don’t have a comfortable way to pay for it •	Maybe they’re confused about something you said, so now they will research it more before deciding to move forward Or maybe….. They received the bad news that morning or They got flack from their family when they told them about meeting with you; or They have a million things going on in their life; Or a dozen other benign things could have happened that had nothing to do with you. It could have had everything to do with the patient’s frame of mind at the time that prevented them from moving forward. The point is people change, their moods change, and their circumstances change, so you can never assume anything. What Do You Do When You Can’t Convert Consultations? Let’s say you did everything right, and now you are stuck because you don’t know how or even if you should follow up for fear of looking as if you are chasing the patient.  Use these strategies to follow up professionally and close the procedure: Follow Up Protocol Develop a follow-up protocol to follow every time to follow-up on revenue-generating consultations that didn’t book….YET. Otherwise, it’s too easy to never got around to following up because there are a million other things to do. The protocol takes the emotion out of it, and it becomes what you do automatically… no matter how busy you are. Collapse Time Time is your enemy in the follow-up process. The more time that goes by without the prospective patient hearing from you, the more distant you become. Collapse time by following up quickly, repeatedly, and often. That’s how you differentiate yourself from your competitors who follow up weeks later (or never). Add a Sense of Urgency to Your Follow Up Since it’s human nature for prospective patients to put off making a big decision, you want to counter with a sense of urgency to get the patient off the fence. Give them very compelling reasons to stop procrastinating. For example: Your schedule is filling up quickly, so book now, or you’ll have to wait Your prices are going up next month If they can have surgery on a Wednesday next month, they get a $500 price reduction If you want it done before [wedding, summer, etc.], they need to take into account the recovery time (IE., even though the downtime is less than 7 days, they are still a bit limited in an activity like swimming and dancing,) so they’ll want to get it done before this [date]. You need to customize these to your liking and use them in your standard protocol, so you get comfortable telling the prospective patient WHY they need to make a decision now rather than later. The most successful cosmetic practices have systems in place to follow up quickly, strategically, and consistently. They spent a lot of time, money, and effort attracting prospective patients, so they do all they can to see it through to a YES. These fix your follow-up for plastic surgeons strategies “pave the way” for your staff to do all they can to confidently convert these valuable consultations. If you need help with your follow-up, go to www.catherinemaley.com for the details, and let’s do a call to determine if it would be helpful to outsource this part of your lead generation plan since SOMEBODY needs to follow up on your leads."
15,What is Office Dilapidation: When Do You Need It?,business," There is no doubt that the pandemic has brought a tremendous impact on businesses. To cope with the situation, companies are now adopting the work-from-home setup. This move is not only helpful in eliminating the possibility of virus transmission, but it also keeps businesses striving while waiting for the time that everyone can go back to their offices again. Since many changes happened, many are also looking for ways to downsize or use a more flexible approach in how they run their business. Many owners and employees have embraced and enjoyed the benefits of working from home. Thus the need for a physical office is becoming less important. While for others, especially for businesses whose work-from-home setup is not suitable, a larger or redesigned office is needed to embrace the new normal. If your business is to adopt a work-from-home set up or move to a larger or smaller office space, now is the best time to have all of the works done. To start, you will need to undergo office dilapidation. What is office dilapidation? Office dilapidation is the process of performing repairs and other required works to return a commercial space to its original condition.Before moving into your office, you may have made a few changes to the workspace to make it suitable for your business needs. As your leasing term ends, your landlord might require you to take off all the changes you made and return the space to its original condition so you can retain your deposit. Whatever changes you have made in your leased commercial space, whether it is structural or cosmetic, you need to adhere to the dilapidation clause stated in your agreement before returning it to your landlord. Suppose you have been leasing a commercial office. In that case, you might need to get office dilapidation sooner or later, as your lease comes to an end. How dilapidation is done As your lease nears its end, your landlord will appoint a surveyor to assess the property’s condition and determine the type and extent of the dilapidation to be performed. If the dilapidation work is not as extensive and requires only a few repairs and redecoration, you can decide to handle the process in-house. However, in many cases, you might need professional contractors to carry out the work. As the end of your lease approaches, give yourself or the contractors enough time to perform the dilapidation work. This will ensure that the process is performed correctly, with as minimal to zero mistakes as possible. Office Dilapidation Services At Wallace Contracts, our team of office dilapidation specialists has years of experience in working with different sizes of dilapidation projects. We’ve been in the trade for many years, and we guarantee top-notch services that you can rely on. https://wallacecontractsltd.com/"

The Secret to Attracting New Cosmetic Patients? It’s to go where others are not….yet. Here’s what I mean… TV, Print, and Radio Ads have been replaced by social media ads –because that’s where all the eyes went. Social media advertising is the single biggest opportunity in the history of advertising. Because, for a fraction of the cost, you can target WHO sees your ads. That’s powerful. But that means the ad design and copy are crucial to get a click. It’s got to be eye-catching, engaging and it must offer the consumer cosmetic patient something of value, so they respond. Because the ONLY thing that counts at this stage is to encourage a prospective cosmetic patient to take the next step. And that is to click on your ad. Otherwise, you are spending money on leads that aren’t making you money, right? But here’s the kicker…Leads are only one part of it. These leads need to be converted, so let’s keep going… Practice Gap #2: Weak Follow Up on Incoming Leads Most plastic surgeons suffer from profit loss every day, every month, and every year from this silent money-waster. I think you’ll be surprised at the stats when it comes to staff following up on leads you spent a fortune to get in the first place: ✓48% NEVER Follow Up ✓Average First Follow Up is 72 Hours Later ✓Only 25% of practices make 2 contact attempts ✓64% of practices do not have any organized way to follow up on a lead But it’s not your staff’s fault. They have NOT been trained on how to do it professionally. How crazy is it to spend a fortune on lead generation but not spend any (or enough) time and effort converting them? How frustrating is it to throw money at new patient leads that should be building your practice but, instead, it’s money down the drain because they don’t close? Your staff will now have access to a simple sales lead platform, scripts, and processes to follow up on patient leads that increase your conversions by 15%. That will be a game-changer for you and a way to dominate your market when you follow up faster and better than your competition, but there’s more… Here’s the next practice gap…. Practice Gap #3:  Staff Can’t Convert Callers or Consults Every practice’s success is limited by their staff’s ability to convert callers to appointments and appointments to paid procedures. It’s way too competitive to be mediocre at this stage of the lead process. Take the phone leads… Almost every office is challenged by this… Phone trees, answering machines, indifferent or unfriendly staff, or new untrained staff, and on and on. Phones are taken way too lightly because it’s not enough to have a friendly staff person answering the phones; they also have to be skilled. Otherwise, you lose money. Look what happens WHEN (not IF) you lose 1 caller per day worth only $2,000: That adds up fast: An easy fix is to give your receptionist the scripts, and training they need to keep you busy with booked appointments. It’s time and money well spent. And what’s your coordinator’s converting rate? The prospective patient who calls you schedules an appointment and shows up is a Hot Prospect! They have already decided to move forward to find a solution to something that bothers them, or they wouldn’t have gone to this much trouble. Your patient coordinator needs to be a well-trained professional with proven scripts, strategies, and tools to get the patients to a yes. For example, does your coordinator know how to: – Position you, the surgeon, as the BEST CHOICE? – Qualify the patient to prepare them for the quote presentation? – Present with confidence to get the patient excited about moving forward? – Move them closer to choosing your services? – And, ultimately, ask for a decision? Most coordinators don’t ask because they haven’t been trained to do so comfortably and professionally. CONVERTING TRAINING INCREASES CONVERSIONS BY AT LEAST 15% I will give and equip your receptionist and patient coordinator with ALL THE TOOLS they need to get good at converting callers and consultations. Because nothing else matters until the patients say yes, and give you money. Until a transaction is made, a lead is just a lead. We need your staff to move them along the buyer journey. And convert them! Your receptionist and coordinator will now be equipped with ALL THE TOOLS they need to get good at converting callers and consultations. They will have 24/7 access to The Converting Club for Receptionistsand Coordinators to increase their conversions by at least 15%. Here is what’s included: •	22 Training videos on key strategies •	Quizzes to ensure the information is retained •	Actual scripts and processes to follow •	Weekly behavior metrics to hold your staff accountable •	Coaching calls to and keep them motivated and engaged And there’s one more deadly practice gap that’s costly you patients and procedures and that is… Practice Gap #4:  You Ignore Patients Who Would Return and Refer Your #1 practice asset is your list of patients who know, like, and trust you. Many of these patients would gladly return, and refer if given the opportunity. They are not as price-sensitive, and they are way more likely to say yes to you than an “internet stranger patient.” And, we all know a majority of your new patients come from your current patients, so this is the new mindset you need to adopt to survive in today’s crazy competitive world: RETENTION IS THE NEW PATIENT ATTRACTION STRATEGY Because when you take your patients for granted and/or ignore them, you open the door for your competitors to steal them away from you. Please remember, cosmetic patients have endless needs… Especially as the relentless aging process continues. Your cosmetic patients need your services now, a month from now, and a year from now, and so on. When you partner with us, we go into stealth mode to nurture your current patients so they return and refer their friends and family. DATABASE MARKETING IS EFFECTIVE How do we do it?

So let me ask you… Do you believe, you too, would get at least 5 to 25 more procedures per month from this plan focused on new patient attraction, conversion, follow up and retention? It is worth it so if you don’t want to do it, outsource it because SOMEBODY should be doing this type of high-end, strategic promotion to grow your cosmetic revenues and keep a steady stream of cash-paying patients coming to you. Recap of Practice Gaps Okay, I covered a lot here so to recap- HERE ARE THE PRACTICE GAPS AFFECTING YOUR BOTTOM LINE THE MOST: •	You need MORE Cosmetic Patient Leads because Prospective Patients Can No Longer Easily Find You Organically •	Your Staff Can’t Convert New Callers or Consults •	You Ignore Patients Who Would Return and Refer So here’s a question for you… WHAT IF….. What if you could easily turn on a new patient lead generator AND plug up the practice gaps that are costing you time, money, and effort and have it handled for you, so you didn’t have to hassle with it?

And that is to focus on patient care, and that is what leads to: – Happy staff – Satisfied patients who return and refer – 5-star reviews to attract more new patients – New cosmetic patients who convert When you outsource patient lead generation, follow-up, conversion, retention as well as sales training, you have a well-oiled machine working for you.

That gives you control over your day, so you are more profitable and productive, and you have peace of mind knowing you get back time and achieve better results. This is how you strategically compete and gain market share. So, if this all-in-one solution makes sense to you, let me and my team execute it for you and hand you the leads when they are ready to book an appointment. THE COMPLETE COSMETIC PATIENT FLOW PLAN This plan consists of several platforms and a dashboard that: •	Gives you the certainty you need knowing you have a plan to predictably and reliably keep new cosmetic patient leads coming in month after month; •	Provides an automatic system that allows you and your team to focus on patient care while my team and I focus on getting you more leads and more patients; •	Includes a proprietary formula of More Patient Leads + Nurture + Follow up + Conversion + Retention = A Healthy Cosmetic Practice! This is what keeps a steady stream of leads and revenues coming to you consistently for your peace of mind knowing you have a marketing machine working in the background. Here is what we need from you: When you say yes, all we need from you to get started is for you to: – Decide on the procedure you want to focus on; and the ad spend investment you want to make (the minimum is $2,000 per month but the more, the better, of course); Then we do the rest by going into stealth mode. Design your unique ads, emails, posts and customizing your patient lead. Follow up with the platform, and we track all results and do everything possible to turn that lead into a fully booked consultation for you – without wasting you or your staff’s time. MY GUARANTEE TO YOU I can’t tell you all that goes into our “secret sauce” because others would try to copy us and you would lose your competitive edge. Instead, I’ll give you my guarantee to do everything I laid out in this report to transform your practice and if you’re not satisfied with your results within the first 60 days, you can cancel at any time because there are no long-term contracts to sign. I want you happy and busy…period. AND TO SWEETEN THE DEAL SO YOU DON’T DELAY, IF YOU PARTNER WITH US NOW, YOU’LL RECEIVE: BONUS #1: Save $1,000 on Customization Fees Since you read my report to the end, I want to reward you for partnering with me, so I’ve reduced the Customization and Implementation Fee from $1997 to only $997. Just so you know, a ton of work goes into the backend of this system to set up not only the lead generation. But also the follow-up process of email, text, phone calls, reporting, and more. We track important metrics so that you know your investment is worth it. BONUS #2: Free Consulting with Me I truly want to see you succeed. So I will personally be available to you for catch-up calls, so we can discuss whatever is on your mind…staff issues, competitor problems, should you buy new technology, and whatever else is bothering you. I have consulted with hundreds of practices and am a wealth of information and resources that you now have access to using my personal cell and email. Bonus #3: FREE KISS Rewards Loyalty Program There is one more practice gap you most likely have in your practice. And that is the lack of a loyalty system for patient retention. As they say in marketing, it’s 16x more expensive to find a new patient than it is to keep a current patient, so you need to put “golden handcuffs” on your patients. So they stay loyal to you, return more often, refer their friends, give you great reviews, have surgery with you and approve the use of their before/after photos. It costs too much to attract these patients to you – only to lose them to your competitors who steal them away from you. A Cosmetic Patient Retention System is necessary, and we have the perfect solution for you. FREE! KISS REWARDS LOYALTY PROGRAM (VALUE $8,340) Consumers love and will pay more to use a service business like hotels, restaurants, and airlines because of the points and perks they get for their loyalty. It makes perfect sense to use a loyalty program in our industry as well, doesn’t it? It builds repeat business which, in turn, leads to growth through repeat visits and referrals. And that grows your patient database organically as well as your bottom line. But the problem with most loyalty programs is that they are too darn complicated! KISS Rewards Program is as straightforward as you can get. It’s easy for the staff to record, and it is fun for the patients to collect points towards free services. The platform is customized for you and set up with your specifics, and all is tracked on a cloud-based platform with easy reporting, and reminders to keep your patients engaged. How easy is that? IS THIS DONE-FOR-YOU PLAN WORTH IT? The bottom line is always “will you make money” and grow your practice working with me? Here’s the answer. When you improve your processes by just 10% in each area that is currently losing you money, you give yourself a raise. Actually, a very big raise. That is a $900,000 raise when you partner with me so I can close up the gaps that are siphoning revenues from your pocket. It’s the compounding effect in action. When you increase the number of leads you’re getting and improve your phones, converting and following up skills and add a loyalty program your staff and patients love, it’s not just a 10% increase. Because of the compounding effect, its 10% x 10% x 10% x 10% = 39% Increase in Overall Revenues! CASE STUDY: ACTUAL RESULTS FROM MONTHLY PROGRESS REPORT: SO HOW MUCH IS IT? Well, you have two options. So let me briefly break it down. Let’s start with how much it would cost to do it yourself the right way as I laid out here. For the do-it-yourself option, if you would need to pay: •	Staff to write copy and design banner ads that get clicked on; •	Staff to set up ad campaigns & upload them to various sites, so they need to be Tech-Savvy to get ads approved and set up ad sets and campaigns; •	Staff to design strategic themed emails that get clicked on and go to a “call to action” customized landing page; •	You also need to pay vendors to record and monitor calls and track results; •	Then you need staff to follow up on leads via phone calls, emails and text so staff would have to write email copy and design professional follow up emails and send out as well as track their results; and •	You would have to come up with a Loyalty Program that works (that would be computer programming and many, many thousands of dollars) All of this work would take 2-3 staff members + several outside vendors and can easily add up to $100K in fees + salaries + benefits + sick days, AND you get to manage these vendors and staff members to be sure the job is getting done. One little thing (and by little, I mean big) problem? Most surgeons don’t want to manage more staff. Nor do they want to spend more than they have to. The Easier Way is to Partner With Me As for the second option… YOU COULD PARTNER WITH ME AND MY TEAM, AND WE’LL DO IT ALL FOR YOU. For this second option, We normally charge $5997 per month for all of these services charged separately. Because so much labor, creativity and technologies go into it; however, because you have read this to the end, I am offering you a special combination fee of only $3,997 per month* so you save $24K per year. This is a much better deal than the first option, wouldn’t you say? So for the price of a few wrinkle filler patients, you can have The Complete Cosmetic Patient Flow Plan bringing you patient leads predictably, week after week. *Plus your ad spend budget of $2K minimum HOWEVER, WE CAN ONLY WORK WITH 1 SURGEON PER AREA. Because our Patient Attraction Lead System gives you the competitive edge over your competitors, it would be a conflict for us to help you get leads as well as the other guys in your community. So you’ll want to act now to get an unfair advantage over your competitors. Go to http://www.ProspectToPatient.com, and let’s see if your area is available. And I want to mention who this is NOT for so I don’t waste your time or mine. •	This is NOT for you if you don’t have a patient database of at least 2,000 •	This is NOT for you if you’re not willing to invest in advertising •	This is NOT for you if your staff is not open to growing and helping you succeed and ONE MORE “GOOD NEWS” THING … You simply make an initial small non-refundable investment in the reduced customization and implementation fee of Only $997 and then you are not charged again until your first ads start running and your themed email goes out to get your phones ringing to convert more incoming leads so you are never “out of pocket” because you will make that money back in new revenues gained before your credit card payment is due. So let’s get started right away. Go to http://www.ProspectToPatient.com and let’s see if your area is still available. IT’S TIME TO MAKE A PLAN It’s time to stop the bleeding of lost profits from these practice gaps. The most successful plastic surgeons leverage their time, money, and resources by doing what is proven to work and getting it done in the least amount of time with the least amount of staff and hassle. Because If you decide NOT to move forward with The COMPLETE Cosmetic Patient Flow Plan Done-for-You Service, I laid out here… …what’s going to happen to your growth this year? You will likely continue to experience: •	Losing money on wasted lead generation that doesn’t get clicked on •	Keep losing leads to your competitors •	Wondering if your leads are being followed up on •	Listening to your staff complain they don’t have time, and •	Not knowing your true ROI from your advertising costs PLUG UP THE HOLES Let’s plug up the practice gaps by getting you more patient leads, giving you the tools to professionally follow up on your incoming leads, and converting those leads, so you and your staff focus on excellent patient care. Because we both know that: ✓Attracting and converting new patients to your practice has become a HUGE undertaking; ✓Lead conversion continues to decrease because it’s gotten so noisy in the marketplace which makes following up on those incoming leads crucial to your success; and ✓Using your limited resources to focus on patient care while outsourcing the rest is beyond important. Go now to http://www.ProspecttoPatient.com to see if your area is still available. Dedicated to getting you more patients and more profits – P.S. At the end of the day, this is NOT just another business expense. This is different. This is actually an investment in growing your cosmetic practice strategically with a strategic plan to attract new cosmetic patients, convert them, follow up with them and retain them, all while training your staff to professionally represent you. With that said, thank you for your trust in me. When we partner, I’ll do everything I can to get you more patients and more profits and train your staff to be converting rock stars.

18,Where To Get The free affidavit Form Online,business," Where To Get The free affidavit Form Online Affidavit information What is an affidavit? The affidavit is a statement of facts given under oath. Click here for a free affidavit ""Under oath"" means a lawful promise to be practiced in court or by another official institution (such as a bank) to confirm that the message contained in your statement is true and is based on personal knowledge or understanding. This document is also known as a: sworn statement statement under oath notarized statement Typically, an affidavit is used by an affidavit (the person whose declaration is being submitted within an affidavit): Verify that what they know is authentic (such as their identity) Formally presenting evidence in a court case (for example, describing the incidents that led to a motor vehicle accident) What is a Statutory Declaration? A statutory declaration is similar to an affidavit in that it allows a declarant (the person who signs a statutory declaration) to present facts that they think to be true. However, statutory declarations are typically applied outside of court to present statements or facts to specific government agencies, whereas an affidavit is more often used in court. A statutory declaration is also known as a/a: statutory declaration form State December Announcement affirmation What is the purpose of an affidavit? Affidavits are used to prove the truths. For example, people can be utilized to: Notify a third party of the death before the formal death certificate is received Verify your residence (the place where you live) or residential address Authenticate that you use a name that is revised from the one on your birth certificate (or confirm that your name has changed) Authenticate your identity in case your individual information is compromised Formally document aspects of your finances (such as assets and credits) for yourself or your company Verify that you own the assets of the deceased next of kin Verify that you or a third party admitted to another person with records (for example, divorce papers) How do I make an affidavit?

Yes, if you have papers, statements, photographs, or anything else that helps verify the information included in your affidavit (then referred to as ""display""), you can attach them to the end of your document. Huh. The standard method of attaching a document involves labeling each attachment (ie Exhibit A, Exhibit B, etc.) for easy reference. Who can sign the affidavit? In order to signify an affidavit, a person must be of the orthodox mind, which means that he or she has the mental ability (or ability) to explain the statement itself and to declare the document has implications such as perjury. Usually, the affidavit is signed by a person over the age of 18. However, there are no minimum age terms, and in some instances a minor maybe wanted to swear an affidavit, for example, to present evidence in family law proceedings... What is the penalty for misleading on the affidavit? Affidavits hinge on a person's submission of a statement of truth in the form of truth, which is why the court registers lying under oath very seriously. Lying in an affidavit is punishable by law. The seriousness of the charge may depend on the jurisdiction, but in some cases, it is recognized perjury, which is an illegal offense. Potential consequences for swearing a false statement can range from penalties to jail terms."
19,FPC flexible circuit board company Darlox Electronics: production orders have been scheduled to October,business," Recently, Darlox has received good news: In 2020, under severe market conditions, the company will still achieve annual sales revenue of 565 million yuan, an increase of 8% over 2019, bringing the full year of work to a full stop. At Darlox Electronics, production orders have been scheduled until October this year. Workers are working overtime to catch up with the deadline. Darlox Electronics is a national high-tech enterprise specializing in the production of FPC flexible circuit boards. Its products are mainly used in tablet computers, mobile phones, automobiles and other fields. . In 2020, in order to complete the annual goal, the company will play a major role in scientific and technological innovation, and cooperate with universities in production, education and research. During the production process, researchers found that traditional manual operation equipment is not efficient, and researchers have developed a new technology. Using machines to replace manual production can save labor by 60% and increase efficiency by 30%. Researchers have found that the traditional 50-to-50-micron circuit is relatively large, which limits the layout of the circuit board. After working hard, they developed 25 pairs. The new 25-micron fine circuit technology is the first in China and fills the gap in the industry. Driven by science and technology, Darlox Electronics has a strong momentum of development. Although it was hit by the epidemic in 2020, it still achieved the set goal for the whole year and achieved a perfect ending. The FPC flexible circuit is light, thin and compact, and the shrapnel microneedle module is a one-piece thin-film design. It has strong adaptability in the field of small pitches. It can cope with the pitch value between 0.15mm-0.4mm. The connection is reliable and does not get pin stuck. , Constant needle, effectively guarantee the stability of the test. After the FPC flexible circuit passes the test, it can enter the next process. In the face of the problems in the test, it is necessary to solve them in a targeted manner to better improve the performance of the FPC flexible circuit."
20,Turn Your Staff Into Revenue Generators,business," When you turn your staff into revenue generators, you finally get the peace of mind you’ve been looking for to stabilize your practice revenues. Because you now have certainty knowing you have a team backing you up to help promote and build your practice. When it comes to growing your cosmetic practice, the number one complaint I get from plastic surgeons is they have great staff. But they are just not skilled enough when it comes to promoting you to your prospective cosmetic patients. So, you hear callers hang up without scheduling an appointment and watch prospective patients walk out your door without scheduling plastic surgery procedures. That is a clue things are not as good as they could be. Cosmetic patients are a fickle group. Their experience with you and your practice starts and ends with your staff. Anytime a prospective patient calls and visits your office, the amount of interaction with your staff gives them an impression about you and your practice - good or bad. It is frustrating because you pay all of this salary overhead for staff to work with your cosmetic patients so you can focus on what you do best. But, you come to find that only that 2 or 3 out of 10 of the prospective patients who came in for a consultation decided to wait, or worse — decided to go to someone else! Your staff can make or break your practice – period. Nothing is more important to your success than the patient relations skills your staff has or doesn’t have. Your patients will spend more time with your staff than with you. Frankly, you may not even get the chance to meet new prospective patients if your staff doesn’t have the skills or interest in getting them in the door and through your processes. EVERY MINUTE YOU’VE SPENT AND EVERY DOLLAR YOU HAVE INVESTED IN PROMOTING YOUR PRACTICE WILL RELY ON YOUR STAFF’S SUPPORT TO SUCCEED. The reality is your staff may be unknowingly sabotaging your best promotional efforts because they don’t have the skills necessary to promote you. For starters, nobody will ever care as much about the success of your plastic surgery practice as you do. Your staff just doesn’t have as much “skin-in-the-game” as you do. However, that doesn’t mean your staff can’t be a huge asset to your practice-building activities. There is a tremendous amount they can do to promote you. But it starts with hiring the right people who WANT to help you grow. They are open and anxious to promote you, and your services. They go above and beyond to get you more conversions, more reviews and more referrals. So, do you have the right people on board? If so, did you give them the strategies and tools to promote you professionally? HERE ARE 3 EASY WAYS FOR STAFF TO GENERATE MORE REVENUES FOR YOU: #1: Train your front desk staff to pre-frame before giving out pricing. Prospective patients calling your office want answers, and one of them is typically about price. It’s difficult to avoid price, so I recommend giving a range or a start fee. However, your receptionist must pre-frame you before price. Prepare 2-3 facts about you that increase your value so the caller better understands why you charge what you charge. This also helps avoid sticker shock. You need them to quickly see that there is more to this than just price. For example, your receptionist can tell the caller: •	You have performed a certain number of surgical procedures with great results; •	You train other surgeons on your innovative techniques; or •	You were voted the Top Doc in your local social magazine. It’s imperative you have a well-trained receptionist representing you on the pho. #2: Reach out to old cosmetic consults who did NOT book These patients who did NOT book might have just been saying NOT NOW or NOT YET. You just never know. •	People change •	Circumstances change •	Life changes So circle back with these prospective patients to see if they are now ready to move forward. But here’s a tip: it’s always more compelling to make a call for a reason rather than say, “I’m just following up.” Instead, say something like, “Sara, it’s been a while since we last spoke, and you weren’t ready to move forward then; however, we have a new finance company that offers a 24- month 0% interest-free payment plan, and I thought of you. Does that sound interesting?” Now your coordinator needs to zip it and let the prospective patient answer. It might be just what they needed, or they may tell you the real reason they haven’t booked. It’s critical you have a well-trained coordinator able to convert your consultations. #3: Assign one team member to be the social media roaming reporter in your practice. Social media is here to stay, and it’s time to embrace it in a big way. You want to mix information with entertainment and a little promotion. But like anything else, it doesn’t just happen. You need a plan and one person responsible for executing it. Choose your most tech savvy-person that is a good writer and have them capture the ins and outs of everyday life in your practice. Their objective is to make you look good. They can snap you walking down the hall to meet a patient, consulting with a patient, scrubbing in for surgery, and so on. So here is the point… Your team either enhances your image and revenues or destroys them. They either add to your bottom line, or they don’t. Be sure you have the right team members in place, and they are trained for success, so they stay motivated and “plugged in” to help you grow your practice. If you need help finding and training staff to be revenue-generating rock stars, let’s talk since this is the easiest way to increase your revenues without hiring even more staff or throwing more at advertising."

1,The Plan for More Cosmetic Patients,business," Unfortunately, growing a cosmetic practice in today’s competitive climate is not easy, so you need The Plan for More Cosmetic Patients. It’s quite confusing and frustrating, isn’t it? Just because you throw thousands of dollars at Google AdWords or spend countless hours on IG and FB developing a following does NOT guarantee your success. Because doesn’t it feel like no matter what you do, it’s not enough? •	You get fewer leads than you expect. •	The prospective patients don’t show up. •	They show up, but they are NOT good candidates (physically or financially) •	They don’t convert and on and on. What is going on? The truth is it takes A LOT to turn a Stranger Patient into a Raving Fan. You can’t just attract them. You have to convert them. By the way, if you’re not happy with your results, there’s something you’re doing or not doing that’s causing them. It helps to go back to marketing fundamentals and think strategically. You only have so much money to spend and so many hours in the day, so planning wisely gives you the competitive edge. There are only a few key metrics that make all the difference to your bottom line, and here they are: COSMETIC PATIENT LEADS You want more leads. So the first place to start is with the leads you are now getting. Where are they coming from? Ask everyone who calls and track all Internet leads so you KNOW for sure if they are coming from SEO, PPC, directories, social media, YouTube, current patients coming back for more or word-of-mouth referrals. The results tell you where to spend more of your time, money, and energy. PHONE CONVERSIONS Is the lead being converted at the time they call? If not, why not? Be sure you have a professionally trained receptionist with the right attitude, phone voice, and scripts to convert these incoming leads. If you blow it here, that prospective patient is lost forever, and they will never even meet you. CONVERT CONSULTATIONS Does the patient say yes to surgery, or they dread it, “I gotta think about it” or “ I need to talk to my husband”? If so, your coordinator needs help and strategies to avoid those answers and keep the path clear to get to a yes. Because this is where the money exchange happens, and this is where the rubber meets the road because nothing counts until the patient hands over a credit card. Contact me for more information if you want my help setting up your automatic marketing plan for more patients."
2,How to Setup High Converting PPC Campaigns,business," There are several things that you need to know when learning how to setup high converting PPC campaigns. You must have a good understanding of the words 'bound' and 'convert'. These two concepts are very important when it comes to making sure that your PPC campaign is successful. PPC stands for Pay-Per-Click advertising. This is a form of online marketing where advertisers pay an online host for the right to send traffic to their website whenever a potential customer type in a search term. The keywords that you will be using in your PPC campaign must be relevant to your product or service. The words on your advertisement must also be the same as your keywords. This helps in bringing relevant traffic to your website. Your keywords must also be in the same category as your products. You cannot use the same keywords over. These keywords have to relate to your products. To get a higher click-through rate (CTR), you must have a good keyword list. The keywords must also be related to the service that you offer on your website. This is one of the most important aspects of any PPC campaign. If the keywords are not relevant, the traffic that you are expecting to generate will not arrive. In addition to this, if you don't offer good value for your PPC ad dollars, you will not get conversions. The design of the banner has to be eye-catching. Potential customers don't like to look at ads that have too many banners and links. They want to see a simple ad with relevant content. You can have a single banner for each product that you are selling. If you have more than one product, split them up so that each product is promoted properly. If you are new to PPC advertising, then you may want to consider using a software program such as AdWords. This will help you generate a decent amount of money. You can choose between pay per click (PPC) and cost per click (CPC). With pay per click, you will only get billed when someone clicks on your ads. With a cost per click, you will be billed every time anyone clicks on your ads. A good way to start a campaign is to test different ads on a testing platform. By doing this you will see what works and what does not. It also allows you to find any kinks or glitches in the system that you may have not tested for otherwise. This will allow you to create a system that will work for you and not cost you a fortune. You need to split test different ads. This way, you will know which ones are getting you the best ROI. Try and not lose or tie yourself to any one campaign. Let them run dry before switching to another one. Test different ads over some time. This will prevent you from losing all your money due to one bad campaign. One other thing that many people do not realize is to track where your traffic is coming from. With the data that you are gathering you will be able to tell where your ads are performing the best. This will enable you to fine-tune your campaigns so they will be effective. This will also enable you to know which keywords are bringing in the most traffic. With this information, you will be able to use these keywords to your advantage when starting your PPC campaign. How to set up high converting PPC campaigns is not rocket science. There are thousands of folks who have been able to make money using a very simple method. All you need is some guidance along the way and a willingness to learn. In addition, you will be able to save quite a bit of money on your advertising costs. When it comes to choosing an AdWords company, make sure that you choose one that has experience in the industry. The best ones have been around for quite a while and have a proven track record. If they are willing to stand behind their ads and guarantee their results, then they are worth a look. The Benefits of PPC Campaigns PPC (pay per click) advertising has changed the way that most companies advertise their products and services. The biggest beneficiaries are usually the bigger companies who can benefit from the low costs of running PPC campaigns. The benefits of PPC campaigns are the direct impact that they have on the search engine rankings for specific keywords and phrases that are related to their business. The amount of traffic that a company can drive to their websites also tends to rise with the increase of the PPC adverts that they have placed. The biggest benefit of PPC advertising is that you do not need to spend a lot of money to make sure that your ads are displayed on the first page of the results pages. The second biggest benefit of PPC advertising is the ability to choose which keywords you want to run your PPC ad campaign. There is a wide range of keywords available, which can be chosen from the likes of 'home', 'about us', 'company details' and many other relevant terms. These keywords are generally based on the products and services that your company offers to its customers. This means that you will have very specific ads and keywords that are designed to attract visitors to your site. Another great benefit of PPC advertising is that it is relatively easy to track the effectiveness of your PPC campaign. You can usually set a daily budget for the PPC campaign and you will be able to see an effective amount of clicks occurring during this time. You can then alter the ads slightly so that they are more effective in bringing in new visitors and converting them into sales. The clicks are also more likely to come from a broad range of people and the demographic of your visitors will also be taken into account. PPC usually works better when used alongside other methods of driving traffic to a website. A common use of PPC advertising is as complementary or 'ads apart' method to other forms of online marketing such as SEO and email marketing. If you are looking for ways to expand your business, PPC can help you achieve your marketing goals. PPC campaigns will not cost a lot of money to run but do require some maintenance. You should only focus on PPC when you have first explored the other options because there is a risk that you may not get many sales if you do not have a good landing page or ad copy. Once you have tested PPC, you should then look at expanding your use of digital media and exploring other avenues of marketing. PPC campaigns tend to work best with highly targeted audiences but you have to make sure that your audience is targeted. The best PPC companies will provide you with a list of potential customers who have shown an interest in your products or services and these are called 'qualified leads'. If you are using negative keywords, your ads will be rejected. Negative keywords will cost you money, but they are worth it because you will only reach the audience that wants to hear what you have to say. Using Google AdWords is much faster than using traditional methods of advertising. You can set up a PPC campaign within minutes and start seeing results within hours but if you do it right, you will not have to spend a lot of time. Setting up a PPC campaign can take up a lot of your time so it is better if you know how to do it right and keep on tweaking it to improve your results. If you can spend a few hours a week on AdWords campaigns, you will save a lot of time in the long term because it takes a lot of time to learn the various techniques and spend a lot of money on search engine optimization. The reason why you see quick results with PPC is that you will have very targeted traffic. It is not advisable to use generic terms like ""weight loss"" in your PPC adverts because these keywords will bring you only qualified traffic. The more specific you are with your keywords, the more targeted your potential customers will be. This will result in fast and quick results because these people will have searched for the exact keyword you are targeting, which means they are ready to buy."
3,Contest a Will,business," Have you been unfairly left out of a will? Have you been insubstantially provided for in a will? If so, can you contest a will? The laws of wills and estates are founded on the principle of testamentary freedom, meaning that an individual may distribute their estate however and to whomever they wish. However, a will is not indisputable. The law allows a person who has been unfairly left out of or insufficiently provided for by a will to challenge the will in court. This area of law is known as ‘family provision’. A successful family provision claim will override the principle of testamentary freedom and allow the court to vary the terms of the will to distribute the property, money and/or other assets held by the estate in a manner which rectifies the previously unfair provision. These ‘family provision orders’ will be treated as a codicil to the will. However, courts are generally reluctant to override the deceased’s testamentary freedom, and the opportunity to dispute a will only arises where the applicant is an eligible person who meets the relevant criteria. Who Can Make a Family Provision Claim? Family provision claims are only available for eligible persons. In NSW, the Succession Act identifies the categories of people eligible to make a claim.  This includes: The deceased’s spouse; The deceased’s de facto partner; A child of the deceased; A former spouse of the deceased; A grandchild of the deceased; A member of the deceased’s household; and Persons living in a close personal relationship with the deceased. When Will the Court Make a Family Provision Order? Provided that the applicant has established their eligibility to contest the will under the family provision legislation, the court may make a family provision order if it believes that the applicant has been left without adequate provision for their ‘proper maintenance, education or advancement in life’. This means the court can make an order where it believes that in the circumstances, the deceased should have made a provision or a more substantial provision than they did for the applicant. Consequently, you cannot dispute a will simply because you consider the will to be unfair. Family provision law does not seek to create equality or fairness between beneficiaries, nor does it attempt to reward or punish a person for their behaviour. The court will only uphold a challenge to a will and override the deceased’s testamentary freedom where the deceased’s will fails to meet the needs of those whom the deceased could be expected to provide for. What Will the Court Consider When Making a Family Provision Order? The Succession Act provides that the court is to consider the following factors when determining whether or not to make a family provision order: The nature of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased; The financial resources and needs of the applicant, the beneficiaries and any other person who has made a family provision claim; The nature of any obligations or responsibilities owed by the deceased to the applicant, the beneficiaries and any other person who has made a family provision claim; The age and health of the applicant; The value of the estate; Any contributions the applicant made to the estate or welfare of the deceased; The character and conduct of the applicant; Whether there are competing claims for the deceased’s estate; Whether the applicant was being maintained by the deceased prior to their death; Whether any other person is liable to support the applicant; Whether any provision was made for the applicant during the deceased’s lifetime; Any evidence of the deceased testamentary intentions; and Any other relevant matter. How to Make a Family Provision Claim? To make a family provision claim, applicants are required to file a summons and supporting affidavit in the NSW Supreme Court. If you think you are eligible to make a claim, it is strongly recommended that you obtain legal advice. When considering making a claim, it is important to take note of the following: Probate or Administration An applicant can contest a will after probate has been granted, but they are not required to wait for a grant of probate or letters of administration before commencing proceedings. Even so, the court will not be able to finally determine a family provision claim until after a grant of probate or letters of administration have been made. Validity of the Will A family provision claim generally assumes that the will is a valid will, however, an applicant may challenge a will on multiple grounds including challenging the validity of the will. If there is a challenge as to the validity of the will, the court is required to assess its validity and terms before it can consider a claim for family provision. Time Limit The Succession Act sets out the time limit to contest a will, providing that an applicant must commence proceedings for a family provision claim within 12 months of the deceased’s death. The court will only allow an application to be made out of time if there is sufficient cause. An extension of time to claim may be allowed in the following circumstances: Where the applicant was unaware of the deceased’s death; Where the applicant was not aware of their legal rights to make a claim; Where the applicant received poor or insufficient legal advice; or Where the applicant was unaware of the provision made for them under the will. Can You Apply For Family Provision When There is No Will? Where a deceased dies intestate, meaning without a will, their estate will be distributed under the intestacy rules. Essentially, their entire estate will pass to their closest relative. Dying intestate does not prevent the operation of the family provision legislation and it is still possible to contest the distribution of the estate under family provision provided that the applicant is an eligible person who satisfies the relevant criteria. Who Defends a Family Provision Claim? A family provision claim will affect both the executor and the beneficiaries of the will; however, the responsibility for defending a family provision claim lies with the executor. In this, the executor is required to oppose the application for family provision in court and/or to negotiate a compromise with the applicant. Who Has to Pay The Legal Costs? The costs of contesting a will in family provision claims are often paid out of the estate. Where an applicant is successful in their claim, the estate will generally meet the costs of both the applicant and the executor. However, this will not always be the case, and the court will retain discretion to make any costs order which it sees fit given the particular circumstances of the case. What Types of Family Provision Orders will the Court Make? If a will is successfully disputed, the family provision orders which the court may make include: An order specifying the payment of an amount of money (the payment may be made as a lump-sum or be paid in periodic instalments); An order granting the applicant interest in a property; An order requiring certain property to be transferred to the applicant; or An order that particular property be held on trust for the applicant."
4,Quick Summer Cash Surges,business," Summer can be tough in the plastic surgery industry because patients are soaking up as much summer as possible, and that could be keeping them away from your practice - so these quick summer cash surges will help. But it doesn’t have to stop altogether. You just need to be more creative in your marketing to keep cosmetic patients coming in. A good marketing tip is to “enter the conversation your cosmetic patient is already having in their mind.” So, if they are thinking about the beach, barbecues, and hot summer nights, use that in your marketing messaging. Here are quick summer cash surges strategies that work well: BEACH BUDDY BOTOX For one week only, when two people come in together, they get an instant $50 Gift Card towards a Botox Treatment + a Free Sunscreen. These can be 2 new patients or a current patient and their friend. Add a minimum of $250, so the patient gets a great result and comes back for more. You can even use their iPhones to take photos of them scrunching their faces and call them in 2 weeks to see how much they like their results and book them for their next treatment. SUMMER GOODY BAGS I don’t know what it is about us women, but we love goody bags. It doesn’t seem to matter what’s in it as much as simply getting it, so use that passion to heat up your revenues. For the rest of the summer, anyone who spends more than $300 during their visit gets a goody bag. The goody bag can contain your skincare products to help grow your skincare sales, a water bottle, baseball cap, or tank with your logo on it, or whatever else gives value AND promotes/cross-promotes you and your services. Also, include a $100 gift card for their next visit. BOTOX AND BARBECUE Hold a themed event called “Botox and Barbecue” for your current patients, their friends, your friends and family, your neighboring businesses, and their customers – basically invite everyone! It can be at lunchtime or 4-6 pm dinnertime. If you can - hold it in your parking lot to attract attention, or if not, serve catered barbecued food in your office. You are only injecting Botox at the event for a very special price, and walk-ins are welcome. Included with their receipt is a gift card to experience wrinkle filler. Add a tight expiration, so they return sooner rather than later. But you need to market these cash surge events. So patients actually show up. You do that with in-house signage, outside signage, Website banners, e-blasts, social media banner posts, paid social media ads, flyers, and good ‘ole word of mouth. Use these quick summer cash surges, and I hope the rest of your summer revenues sizzle!"
5,How to Target List Buyers For Your Internet Marketing Business,business," Many business owners have never considered how to target list buyers for their business. In today's market, list building is one of the most important aspects of business. Without a proper list, there can be no sales and no repeat customers. A quality list helps you build relationships with your prospects and also increases your revenue. When creating a target list, it's essential that you carefully consider what type of people you wish to sell to. People on your list should have interests that compliment your products or services. If you sell dog grooming supplies, you wouldn't want to sell to a group of pet lovers. On the other hand, if you offer professional landscaping services, you wouldn't want to target pet owners looking for advice on how to get their plants to grow properly. To find your target market, think about hobbies or pastimes they enjoy. This information can give you a better idea of people you should be targeting for your list. Once you've narrowed down your list, it's time to start contacting these list owners. Offer them a free newsletter or an e-zine that features your products and services. Make sure that your messages stay sincere and don't try to sell anything. You want to make sure that you only recommend things to which they may have some interest. Another way to generate sales through mailing lists is by offering a discount or free product to those who sign up for your mailing list. This can be a highly effective technique if you give away something valuable. For example, you could create a sweepstakes entry form for people who purchase a minimum number of products from you. This will allow you to gather the names of potential customers. Just be sure that you only contact legitimate buyers so that you don't end up wasting your time or their money. A powerful marketing campaign can also be developed around the mailing list. Instead of just pitching your products, as mentioned before, build a relationship with your subscribers. Send them informative newsletters with lots of great tips. The more that you interact with your list members, the more likely they are to buy from you in the future. How to target list buyers for your online business can be tricky at times. However, if you follow these tips and advice, you can get on the right track. In addition, you can begin to develop a targeted list right away so that it can grow into a loyal audience that you can continually market to. How to target list buyers for your internet marketing campaign. One of the most important factors when building a mailing list is ensuring that you only send email messages to those on your opt-in list. When building a list, you must work only with those people who want to receive your information. You want to ensure that you only email them with offers that they are likely to respond to. You can further enhance the effectiveness of your marketing campaign by only emailing your list once a week - a time which they are more likely to remember and act on. How to target list buyers for your internet marketing business. Building a mailing list is one of the best ways to drive traffic to your website and increase sales. When first starting in business, you don't have much money, but you do have a lot of time. With the right techniques, you can learn how to target list owners for your internet marketing business, making your business more profitable. How To Target Buyers Using PPC Before you start learning how to target buyers using PPC, you need to understand what PPC is. PPC or Pay-per-click advertising is a form of search engine marketing wherein advertisers only pay when their ads are clicked by visitors. There are many benefits of doing this kind of advertising over traditional search engine optimization such as link building and organic SEO. To help you out, here is a short guide on how PPC works: Create keywords and key phrases. You have to select keywords that would best describe your product or service. Keywords are important because these will be what people will type into their searches. Once you've come up with these keywords, use the appropriate keyword tool to identify which sites appear on the first page of search engine results. Your goal then, is to appear on the first page, right? These keywords will serve as your anchor texts or keywords that you will use in PPC ads. Advertise your site. You can advertise your PPC ads on other websites. There are sites like Google AdWords that let you advertise on other websites in return for only a few pennies. You only have to register an account with these sites to be able to post PPC ads. Optimize your site. Once your PPC ad appears on a site, your next goal is to make sure that your site will be found by as many buyers as possible. One way to do so is to optimize your site for search engines. The more links you will create to your site, the more chances that your site will show up on search engine results pages. Be strategic with your keywords. Keywords that have low competition are the best ones to use. Using them should always be the first thing in your list. But you also have to be strategic when choosing which keywords to use. Use them where it will be useful and relevant to your site. Build a network. You can also use PPC marketing to build a network of potential buyers. How you do this? You have to send your PPC ads to sites that will have your target market as possible. You can join groups or forums in your niche. Make friends or strike up relationships to increase the possibility that people will click on your ads or visit your site. Give away something free. You may not know this but using PPC marketing also means giving out free information. For example, if you are running a PPC campaign on Google, you may give people free PPC tools. People who will benefit from these tools are those who are very interested in buying a product. Keep your ads updated. You should be able to keep in touch with your audience by including their email addresses in all of your promotional emails. Make sure your website content is also updated so that readers will be encouraged to visit your site and sign up for your list. Keep your keywords in mind when choosing a domain name and web hosting company. These keywords will help you get a lot of traffic, but remember that PPC targets will matter. You can write articles about your target buyers, but remember that your article needs to focus on the benefits of buying a certain product. Using the wrong keywords will not only make it difficult for PPC ads to be seen, but your articles may not be approved either. Write articles on topics that will draw in visitors, but not necessarily lead them to buy. Make sure that the site that you are linking to has a good page rank. A.M. Best and Company ranks every single web page that is listed for a keyword on their website. This will help you determine what other sites owners have linked to when they are trying to drive traffic to their PPC ads. If the page rank is low, there are likely a reason and you should try to fix the problem. Analyze what your competition is doing. How are your competitors getting the most clicks? Where are their ads showing up the most? How are they reaching their target buyers? Find out what they are doing that works and use that to your advantage. You should always try to outdo your competition, so start looking at your competition's sites and find out what they are doing and what they're missing out on to be successful."
6,Cosmetic Patient Loyalty Program,business," INTRODUCING THE FIRST-EVER EASIEST “DONE-FOR-YOU” COSMETIC PATIENT LOYALTY PROGRAM THAT IS ACTUALLY A PATIENT ATTRACTION SYSTEM ON AUTOPILOT…..FOR FREE Announcing the “Easiest Cosmetic Patient Loyalty Program” designed specifically for cosmetic patients to …… •	Increase your cosmetic patient volume… •	Increase the number of procedures you perform on new AND existing patients…. •	Increase your patient referrals… •	Increase your arsenal of social proof with more B/A photos and reviews…. •	Creatively attract and convert NEW cosmetic patients….and more! Dear Surgeon, For years, I have been hounded to come up with a Cosmetic Patient Loyalty Program that was EASY to use for the patients and the staff, but I wanted it on steroids to become a new patient magnet system WITHOUT using discounts, as well as be a retention AND conversion tool. And also have it do what it is supposed to do, and that is to… …..Put “golden handcuffs” on your patients. So they stay loyal to you, return more often, refer their friends, give you great reviews, allow you to use their before/after photos, and have surgery with you. But most loyalty programs are so darn confusing they are not fun. Frankly, they are quite the opposite…. They’re annoying when the staff struggles with tracking and the patients are confused by the terms and rules. This is the solution you’ve been waiting for, and here’s why…. YOUR BEST COSMETIC PATIENTS ARE RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE Your current cosmetic patients are actually your best prospects for other cosmetic procedures and services. Really. And to illustrate this point, let me give you an example from the remodeling industry. Once a homeowner gets their kitchen remodeled - after a short time. They begin to notice the bathroom or some other part of the house really needs work. The new section only serves to highlight and contrast how much worse the other sections are. This same thing applies to cosmetic patients. So, if a patient has undergone one cosmetic procedure for a body part, it shouldn’t be a surprise they’ll start looking more critically at another body part that concerns them. This presents a perfect opportunity for you — but only if you keep in constant contact with your patients. And the best way I know how is through a patient rewards program that is easy to use. KISS© REWARDS IS ALSO A CLEVER NEW COSMETIC PATIENT ATTRACTION AND CONVERSION TOOL Not only will you retain the cosmetic patients you already spent a fortune to get, KISS© Rewards is used to attract new patients and convert the ones who met you but didn’t say yes……YET. We use texting, emailing, and done-for-you social media banners to post on your Facebook and Instagram accounts to spread the word about your practice to new patients. And, to convert more patients who are procrastinating, I’ll show you how to use the KISS© Rewards Club as a closing tool so they can’t help but say YES to you. INTRODUCING KISS© REWARDS LOYALTY CLUB This is NOT just a rewards club. It’s a full-on patient attraction, conversion, and retention tool to keep you busy and profitable. It also makes it impossible for your competitors to steal away your cash-paying patients. And it’s easy to use for your staff and your patients because it’s SIMPLE…. The patient gets a KISS© for each dollar they spend with you. Collect KISSES© to get free services. It’s Simple, Automatic, and Totally Pain-free to Use We get the ball rolling for you and handle the execution, so you don’t have to do any heavy lifting. Your patients are automatically entered into your KISS© rewards platform and we give them 100 KISSES© to get them excited and engaged. We keep them engaged with customized emails, text, and social media. And that spreads the word to new cosmetic patients who want to get in. When your patients visit and check out for the day, the amount they spent that day is recorded (even if they got a discount or used another vendor program). Once they reach certain tiers, they get a free area of Botox, a syringe of filler, or laser treatment. And, they get an automatic Free Botox Reward when they refer a friend, give you a review, and/or approve the use of their before/after photos to be used for promotion. This builds up your social proof to attract and convert NEW patients. Your patients will be kept engaged and encouraged to return via customized emails reminding them they are close to receiving a free service, text reminders as well as social banners. So they spread the word to their circle of friends. You get a monthly progress report showing you how profitable a rewards club can be when done right. WHY IS THIS THE BEST COSMETIC PATIENT LOYALTY IN OUR INDUSTRY? Because I’m NOT a big pharma company with complicated and bureaucratic red tape that doesn’t understand effective cosmetic patient marketing. I have one focus….to get you more patients, more procedures, and more profits. And, because it keeps you busy with more patients who want your services without you spending a fortune on outside mass advertising or wasting your staff’s time on confusing terms and rules or discounting your services. Smart cosmetic practices know that Retention is the New Patient-Attraction Strategy. This puts it on autopilot. It Stops Price-Shopping and Discounting That Hurts Your Brand Let’s face it…our industry has been commoditized, so it’s more difficult than ever to get cosmetic patients to pay a FAIR price for your expertise because they think they can get the same results cheaper elsewhere. KISS© Rewards stops that price-shopping mentality by rewarding them with a Free Service which is more compelling, and you keep your high-end brand image intact. It’s Easy to Use and Track Our proprietary software is the easiest to use. Since we have already entered your patients into the system, there is no need for registration and no hassle. And the software automatically keeps track of all usage, so you don’t have to. It’s Engaging One of the biggest challenges of a rewards program is to get your patients to use it, so we handle that for you. We keep your patients engaged with customized in-house signage, social posts, text, and encouraging reminder emails as they get closer to winning a free service. It Works Even if Using Other Vendor Programs or Discounts Even if you already use Brilliant Distinctions or another vendor program, No problem.

8,Fix Your Plastic Surgery Practice Phones,business," One of the fastest ways to improve your bottom line is to fix your plastic surgery practice phones. I consult with plastic surgeons who have one or several receptionists handling their cosmetic practice calls. Usually, one of these receptionists is excellent, and the others are ok but need help because they are losing callers. No matter how many times you tell them what to say, they will often say something random and lose the caller. Or you hear them say something like this: “We don’t have any openings this Friday.” and then click! They hang up! If the staff is properly trained, they would offer another Friday or suggest adding the caller to your waitlist. Then ask for the caller’s cell phone in case there were any last-minute openings. But instead, they didn’t get the caller’s information, so they are lost forever. Your Practice Phones Are the Key to Your Success Remember, all of your marketing strategies are for naught, and new patients are NEVER going to meet you if your receptionist can’t successfully convert these callers into appointments. Frankly, your receptionist may be unknowingly sabotaging your best practice promotional efforts, as well as your word-of-mouth referrals, simply because they don’t have the skill they need to promote YOU professionally. Every call into your practice not only affects your bottom line but also enhances or destroys your image. Your staff can represent you as a true professional or not – but the choice is up to you. During my staff training sessions, I often hear, “But I don’t know what to say when the patient says that.” Or, “What else could I have said that would have made a difference?” My answer is – plenty! Prepare your receptionist for success. EVERY PLASTIC SURGERY PRACTICE HAS EXPERIENCED “BAD PHONES” THAT COST THEM PATIENTS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUES. Here’s the good news: The solution to Fix Your Plastic Surgery Phones is simple but not easy. THERE ARE 3 ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS NEEDED TO TURN YOUR FRONT DESK INTO A PROFIT CENTER: First, you need the right person in that position; someone who has a cheerful disposition, a friendly and upbeat voice, and a great customer service attitude. They also have to be open to learning and growing. Constructive criticism is fine with them since they want to do the best job for you they can. They also look at the part and come to work with a professional image. Second, give them proper training to include scripts and strategies so they no longer “wing it.” They are confident because they know what is expected of them. And they know how to handle the frequently asked questions. So they get to their objective and that is to book callers to appointments. They are now more relaxed because they can concentrate on what the caller is saying rather than what they are going to say next. Third, you need to hold them accountable so they consistently perform well for you and BOOK appointments. They must be on their game 100% of the time and not just when you’re watching. It’s human nature to fall back into bad habits, so your receptionist needs regular training and feedback, as well as accountability, so they know you expect them to be on their game on every call. That’s how you turn your receptionist into a professional ambassador for your cosmetic practice who fills up your schedule. You equip them with effective responses, phrases, and questions to help them not only bond with and educate your patients, but close the caller to a booked appointment. Or, at least follow up on those callers who are not ready to book. With the right words to say, your staff will be so comfortable with the process and so prepared that they’ll look forward to phone calls and patient interactions because they’re confident, trained, and ready to convert appointments! Enroll your front desk staff in The Converting Club for Receptionists, and I’ll train them for you. Using training videos, quizzes, scripts, and mystery shopping, your staff will become professionally-trained rock stars."
9,Cosmetic Patient Events Don’t Work Anymore,business," The biggest reason cosmetic patient events don’t work anymore is because you are missing something in the execution. The reality is it takes time, money, effort, and strategy to pull off a great patient event; however, when done strategically, the benefits of a cosmetic patient event are numerous. It can be a revenue-generating event worth many thousands of dollars to you in a few hours. You solidify relationships with your current patients and start new relationships with prospective patients who came with them. The attendees can spread the word about you to their social media channels, giving you even more exposure to new patients. It creates memories to help the aesthetic patient remember you when they’re ready for cosmetic enhancement….even years later. To help you have a great event, here are three important areas to focus on to ensure a successful and profitable patient event: CHOOSE A THEME Answer the questions, “Why are you having an event, and then why should the patients come to your event?” Figure that out first, and it makes the rest easier to plan. For example, do you want this to be a “feel-good” event that shows appreciation to your patients for supporting your practice growth, or is this the sales event to bring in extra revenues? Personally, I suggest a combined event with “feel good” appreciation as well as the sales event offering your patients perks for attending. And proven themes that work especially well are: •	Girls Night Out (leave the kids at home and shop, socialize, sip) •	Annual Patient Appreciation Event •	Holiday Event (must be held early November before the Holidays start) Now you need very good reasons WHY your patients want to attend your event when they have so many other places they could be instead. For example: •	Raffle Free Products and Services •	2 Extra Raffle Tickets for Every Friend they Bring Along (who is new to the practice) •	Food and Drinks •	Goody Bag for all Attendees (Value $X) •	Special Pricing That Evening Only •	Vendor Demonstrations •	Make-up Artist •	Computer Imaging •	Photo Booth •	Fortune Teller •	Chair Massage •	Photo with local celeb, author, artist Now your patients are excited to come to your event since so much is going on. And, they want to bring their friends with them. MARKET YOUR COSMETIC PATIENT EVENT It takes a lot of marketing effort to spread the word, so everyone knows about your patient event. That includes email, direct mail, in-house signage, posts, website banners, and text messages. Of course, you want to invite your current patients, but you also want to invite THEIR friends, family members, and colleagues. Add “bring your friends” to all of your messaging. You even want to invite those patients who came in for a consultation but never booked and even long-lost patients interested in reconnecting with you. That is a great reason for them to re-engage with you. And, of course, use all of your social media channels to promote your patient event to prospective patients who follow you on social and would love the opportunity to meet you in person. PUT YOUR VENDORS TO WORK Profitable Cosmetic Patient events work best when you have support from your vendors who can be extremely helpful to you. Your vendors want to help you promote their products and services, so let them. Give them space to set up their displays, answer attendee questions, do demonstrations, and do the selling for you at the event. In return, they can help you with food, printing costs, product and/or samples, and gift baskets, so work with them. This way, you and your staff can relax and schmooze with your guests while the vendors do the heavy lifting of promotion. Now you see why cosmetic patient events don’t work anymore if you don’t step up and use these strategies. Have fun and make money!"

In addition, you can also expect to see increased sales as most of the customers will be willing to refer others to your brand. Overall customer experience: Lastly, chatbot technology can greatly improve the customer experience by making it easier for the customer to voice their opinions and feedback. This is because most of these chatbots have a voice recognition feature and can automatically record a customer's message and deliver it in a specified format. They can also identify the emotions expressed by the customer and deliver messages according to what they are feeling. This way, it becomes much easier for the company or brand to hear out their customers and hear what they want. All these improvements result in a more satisfied customer who gives back more to the company in terms of both feedback and recommendations. ChatBots are thus not only able to improve the customer experience but can also improve the company's sales and revenue. How to Engage With Clients Using ChatBot? Several companies are making a name for themselves by making successful and innovative use of chatbot technology. The companies have been able to use chatbot technologies to offer several features and conveniences to their customers. Customers are now able to engage with a company by way of a chatbot, a form of an online personal assistant. There are also chatbot consultants who help companies enhance their technological strategies and develop their software. A chatbot can be defined as a personal assistant that allows customers to conduct transactions with the help of a computer. The basic function of this is to deliver automatic responses to queries or requests. This makes it a very useful tool for companies in satisfying their customers using speedy customer service and communication. It allows them to save time because a representative will not need to interact with the customer. Here are some ways on how to engage with clients using a chatbot. The first step is to let your clients know about the existence of a chatbot. You can do this by having an official website for your company. Having a website shows your company to be sophisticated and shows potential clients that you are serious about establishing good relations with them. By creating a presence on the web, you are making yourself more accessible and your company's profile will become well-known. Also, the more information you give regarding your company, the more clients you get to contact. Another method is to create a free account for your company on a social networking site like Facebook.

Your presence will be established through word of mouth and you can use this to further engage with your clients. A third way on how to engage with clients using a chatbot is to use it as a tool for communication. Through this, you can easily update your clients about changes in your company or projects that you are working on. You can also inform them about any changes that you are planning so that they will be informed. In addition to this, it will also help you provide them updates on your company's activities. A chatbot is a special application that uses artificial intelligence to speak to a person using only text-based conversations. In other words, you do not need to type anything just to chat with the bot. It can understand words that you will type and respond accordingly. This will greatly reduce the time you spend on inputting things into the bot. The chatbot is also very advanced. It can detect words that may seem unrelated and can give appropriate responses accordingly. How to engage with clients using a chatbot also includes learning how to build and maintain the bot. This is because you will be using the bot to connect to its database. This will enable you to check information about clients. By doing this, you will know if the client is a good fit for your business or not. You can also check for any changes in the client's history. This will allow you to see what your client has done in the past so that you can avoid risky clients. When using a chatbot to reach out to your clients, there are many things you need to know. This is why you should know how to engage with clients using a chatbot before you use it. This will ensure that you will get the best results from this tool."

These programs can make a real difference in how you do business and it will be important that you know how to maximize their use. A chatbot is a computer program that can give your business an edge over your competitors. These programs can make it easier to give great service to your customers, which will result in higher sales. Learn how to increase sales using chatbot software and find out which of these programs will work for you. With this marketing strategy, you will be able to create campaigns that will bring you qualified leads that you can contact and close. By interacting with your clients, you will be able to see who is interested in your products or services and you can then follow up with these individuals at a later date. The goal of these chat Bots is to automate many of the tasks that are often overlooked by most marketers, and this means that the leads you get will be those that are looking for your products or services in particular. There are many ways that you can use a chatbot marketing strategy. One of the key things that all of these programs have in common is that they will allow you to reach your customers on a much larger scale than you could without them. The more people you can contact and communicate with, the more likely you are to have a successful campaign that will create a great deal of customer loyalty. When you have a high level of customer loyalty, it will be easier and faster for your business to grow. The chatbot can help you reach customers from all walks of life and this can help you tap into markets that you may have never even thought of before. Most companies that offer chatbots for marketing strategies to understand that it is very difficult to take the time to visit each website in the hope that a customer will find what they need. This is especially true with businesses that offer products or services through digital means, like e-books or digital audio recordings. Most websites that are meant to provide information will not have an opt-out feature built into them, so the process of persuading people to sign up or buy becomes extremely tedious. For most businesses, these repetitive tasks become too much work for them to handle, and this is why chatbots were developed. These programs were created to make this process much simpler for business owners. Unlike most chatbot programs, chatbot software programs designed for marketing do not have a pre-written script for making every interaction that the customer experiences with the business as smooth as possible. Many of these chat robots are designed with a strong artificial intelligence system that allows them to predict what types of questions may be asked, and then they can be built around these different questions. Many of the most successful chatbot programs use very specific artificial intelligence algorithms to make their responses to customers as natural as possible. The ability to predict what a customer might ask also gives these chatbots the ability to tailor their responses depending on the specific keywords that the customer has used to enter into the bot's database. These three factors combine to make chatbots excellent at answering extremely repetitive tasks. Because most chatbot programs are programmed by highly intelligent programmers, they can take these repetitive tasks and turn them into random data. Through their artificial intelligence systems, these chat bots are able to discern what type of question and answer patterns are likely to be typed into a chatbot database by a potential customer. This information is fed back to the user of the chatbot, who can utilize it to improve the overall customer experience and customer service. In other words, these highly intelligent chatbots are extremely good at solving extremely repetitive questions that end up causing customer frustration. Perhaps the most effective use of chatbots involves their use with personalized messages. Rather than having a customer service representative simply reply to every single inquiry that is put into their automated database, these chatbots use personalized responses that are geared towards addressing each specific instance of inquiry. For instance, if a customer enters the chatbot information for a query about a particular product, the bot will very specifically ask the customer if they have any questions. Once the appropriate personalized response is provided, the chatbot will then ask the customer a generic question, which was pre-programmed to match the specific language and needs of that specific customer. While these three key takeaways make a compelling case for using chatbot technology in increasing sales and customer engagement, the real secret is making sure that you purchase your chatbot. The quality of your bot greatly depends on the quality of the provider that you purchase from, so it is a good idea to shop around before making your decision. Many different online brokers sell chat bots, but not all of them have the same reputation or provide the same services. It is important to make sure that your bot is going to be properly supported, provides comprehensive account management and has an exceptional level of customer support. You should also inquire about the frequency at which your bot will execute custom messages."
12,Chat Bot for Online Business,business," Whatsapp chat Bots have become nothing less than oxygen for online businesses, both small and big alike. For those who don't know about chatbots, they are automated programs, mostly developed in the last decade or so, which enable users of the chat programs to have free and instant conversations with each other through a simple Internet connection. These types of chatbot programs have enabled countless people to connect, form new connections, find friendships, and form long-term relationships. Now, thanks to the genius of a group of highly educated computer scientists and software engineers, chatbots can be used to help increase sales. These chatbots will act as if they are real humans by engaging users in real-time conversations in a variety of applications. This will increase sales because not only will the customers be interacting with real people; they will also be engaging in business-to-business sales, making purchases, receiving answers to questions, and posting comments. Not only that, but the conversations will happen between the various bot users, not through a third-party service, such as a real human would. ChatBots are a software program, just like your word processing application, that allows you to run complex conversations, complete with text, using text-to-speech recognition and natural language processing capabilities. Because they are conversational applications, there is a built-in method of translation wherein a chatbot imitates the tone, pitch, and volume of what it is talking to make it sound as natural as possible. In other words, your online business chatbot will speak to your customer as if they were another person, and not through your generic web messaging application. Now, that is something that could seriously help you increase sales. As mentioned before, the chatbot can mimic almost any sound that it comes across. This includes speech, music, and even sounds of conversations that may occur in the office, on the phone, or anywhere else. If you want to use this feature for your online business, then you can purchase chatbots for specific purposes. For example, if you are a customer service representative, then you can purchase chatbots that can play music as your customer sits on hold. That way, when the customer service representative calls you back in the future, they already know a song that you probably know, and it's just a matter of selecting which one you want to be played when it's your turn to talk to the customer. Another example of a bot that you could use for your online business is called bots for researchers. These bot programs allow users to research specific areas, such as a specific disease, or maybe even a hobby and have the bot suggest an activity to do for a patient who is seeking information about that particular interest. These types of bot programs are extremely helpful for people who are suffering from a mental disorder or Alzheimer's because it trains them to perform certain tasks without necessarily having to think about doing them, which is a huge advantage over other types of programs that exist for patients with these conditions. Online chat Bots are used for many different reasons. However, the biggest reason is probably the convenience that they provide to business owners. There is nothing worse than being trapped in a long, boring, commercial conversation with someone who doesn't speak English very well. No one wants to be stuck listening to a conversation they don't care about, and the last thing a person wants to do is sit there and have to translate what they are saying because they can't understand it. These chatbots are equipped with a built-in language translator, which means that they can understand any language and translate it into whatever language it is that it is speaking. Therefore, it eliminates all the boring, long conversations, and replaces them with short, effective ones that both parties can understand. In addition, because these chatbots are internet applications, they can also perform tasks other than simple translation and interpretation of conversations. They can even act as personal assistants, making research, answering emails, and browsing the web, among other things. This makes it possible for users to multitask and get more done in less time. This is the biggest advantage over other kinds of communication tools, especially for online businesspeople. A good example of a conversational bot is SpeakBot, a completely automated program that can talk to a person on the phone. As you can see, these chatbots provide so much more than simple translation and interpretation of conversations. Indeed, most of the time, they are used to replace human support staff, because they are efficient, fast, and easy to use. For a lot of business people, they are better alternatives to live receptionists and live call center agents, because they can handle just about any type of conversation. Overall, these chatbots are an excellent investment, especially for businesses that cannot afford to spend their money on hiring human support staff or on purchasing office equipment. What Can the ChatBot For Online Selling Do? ChatBot for online sellers has been designed by technologically advanced experts. Unlike other chatbots, it can talk to a real person in a live chat session. This means that online sellers can have a real conversation with the bots they are buying from third-party sellers. The chatbot's owner can then monitor the chat sessions of his or her bot and sell the product or service that he or she is advertising on the chat platform. Through this, the owner can have a lot of information about his or her customers, which he or she can use for his or her business. This is how a chatbot for online sellers works. A business owner sets up an account with the chatbot using a credit card or PayPal account. After getting the bot, the business owner logs in to the chat bot's website using the username and password that he or she has established earlier. On the homepage of the chatbot, there will be a profile page. In this page, he or she can create a username and a picture. These are the factors that will make the bot remember the name and the image of its owner. Once this has been done, the owner can then select the different Facebook businesses that he or she is interested in purchasing chat Bots for. Through this, he or she can choose from among the available chatbots. Once these factors are set, the chatbots can now be purchased. There are now various types of chatbots that are available. These chatbots are usually enhanced with artificial intelligence and webcams. Some chatbots are specifically designed for Facebook. These chatbots are programmed to perform specific tasks that include posting pictures, commenting, and sending messages on Facebook. This makes it easy for Facebook users to interact with the bot. The chatbot for online sellers works similarly. This also enables the online seller to post items for sale in the chatbox. The main difference between the two is that the user can purchase the chatbot for his Facebook business from a website that offers the bot for sale. Other than purchasing the chatbot for online sellers, individuals can also use the chatbot for socializing. Several chat bots are programmed to join communities on various chat networks such as Facebook, Yahoo, and MSN. Through this bot, the user will be able to get to know other individuals who are part of the community. In return, he or she can learn about different things and strategies that they can use to succeed in the business. The chatbot can also introduce new people to the online selling process. One way how the chatbot for online sellers can be used effectively is through the program's ability to update the user with new songs. The robot can scan through the SD card in the user's computer and pick out the best song. When the user likes one of the songs, he or she can download it from the website and then insert the SD card into the chatbot. Within minutes, the new song will be played and everyone in the community will have to join in the fun. Although the features of the chatbot for online selling are amazing, it would be advisable to familiarize yourself with it before using it. This will make it easier for the newbies to get used to the functionality and learn how it operates within a short period. Newbies are advised to be patient when using the chatbot. They should also refrain from answering all the questions posed by the chatbot unless they are prepared to answer yes to all the questions."

16,How to Sell Your Products on Ebay,business," There are a lot of people asking, how do you sell your products on eBay. In fact, there are more questions than answers. The truth is, no matter how you choose to sell your goods on eBay, there are some ground rules that you will need to follow. This article will explain how to sell your products on eBay so that you know what you're getting into. By the time you've finished reading this article, you'll know how to sell your products on eBay. There is one thing that you need to keep in mind when you are thinking about selling your goods on eBay. You need to be able to receive payment for every sale. The good news is, this rule doesn't apply to everyone. We are talking about selling stuff on eBay which are less expensive or of less value to the buyer. However, you still need to be able to receive payment for every sale. So what's the secret to making selling your stuff on eBay a success? The first step on how to sell your products on eBay is to decide on a niche market. Pick something that has a low demand but has a high-profit margin. This is because eBay buyers are very picky when it comes to buying something that they want. A successful niche market is one which has a lot of potential buyers but not too many sellers. If you choose the wrong-sized market, then you won't get started on eBay right away. So what makes a successful niche market on eBay? Well, one thing is that there are a lot of buyers out there who are looking for the product you are selling. If you're selling something that has a high-profit margin but you're not reaching enough buyers to make a profit, then you won't get started on eBay. On the other hand, if you're selling something which every eBay buyer is looking for but you are not reachable by every buyer, then you will get started on eBay! You also have to make sure your listings are easy to view and understand. So, what does easy to view mean? Well, on eBay you have to give your buyers a reason to visit your listing. It doesn't have to be fancy graphics and awe-inspiring titles. You just need to give potential buyers a reason to open your eBay listing. Do you want every potential buyer to click on a ""buy it now"" button? An easy way to reach potential buyers is to set up a simple eBay store. A store is a great way to start selling your product because it lets you start off small and without much expense. Also, if you don't have any merchandise to offer yet, then using an eBay store will let you get started on your product line. Once you have an eBay store up and running, you can update your eBay store with similar items and then let potential buyers browse through the similar items you are selling. Your eBay account is the best way to build a positive seller reputation. Make sure all of your listings include pictures of your item, clearly state what the product is worth, and include a brief description of the item. Let potential buyers know that you take great pride in your merchandise and you only sell high-quality merchandise. This will help to build a positive reputation for you as an eBay seller and it will also help you sell more of your items. While eBay started out as an auction-oriented market for household goods and collectibles, it quickly transitioned into a general fixed-rate marketplace where people can buy and sell almost anything. It is today a fantastic place to sell brand new products. However, if you currently sell on eBay, you will want to take a look at some key points between selling on Amazon and eBay: The most obvious difference between the two online auction sites is that there are no cash transactions when you sell on eBay. You simply send your customers their money in the form of an electronic transfer and your old electronics and/or products are transferred to the buyer. On the other hand, when you sell on eBay, you must complete the transaction, even sending the money, by either mailing a check or completing the transaction in another way such as by phone or fax. This is one of the reasons why people who are just getting started in an eCommerce business might find it difficult to make a success of their selling on eBay. Another important distinction is the need to have an eBay seller account. Without an eBay seller account, it is not possible to buy, sell, or list any product on eBay. The seller account is required for all purchases and all listings on eBay. This is typically free unless you opt for a premium eBay fulfillment service. There are many ways for sellers to start earning money on eBay. Some begin by selling individual listings. This is actually the cheapest way for anyone to get started with eBay. As long as you properly categorize your items, provide good customer service, and keep your prices competitive, there is no reason you cannot make some decent profits. If you want a little more security with your transactions, however, you may want to consider signing up for an eBay seller fees account. These are typically provided by the larger selling sites and can offer added protection for both your buyers and sellers. Another common way for eCommerce sellers to generate money on eBay is through selling its digital products such as ebooks and other software and applications. With this method, the buyer pays a fixed price for the item, which then becomes the wholesale price after the shipping and handling fees are deducted. The difference between the wholesale and fixed price is your profit. Most buyers prefer to purchase things from a seller with a built-in fixed-priced system because they know they can trust that the seller will not give them an inferior product in exchange for the money they spend. However, if you want to sell on eBay without the assurance of a good and consistent flow of customers, you may want to try an eBay affiliate program instead. With an eBay affiliate program, you don't pay a commission directly to a seller, but to a marketing network that handles all of the backend operations for you. Once you have signed up for an eBay seller account, the next step to take is choosing the right product to sell. The first thing you should do when setting up an account is performing product research to find out what your potential customers are looking for. This includes information such as what they want to buy and how much they are willing to spend. This research can take some time to perform, so it's important to set aside enough time for this step. Once you have performed the initial product research, you can move onto the next step of setting up your eBay seller fees. There are two types of eBay business models available to you: the ""old school"" model, which still requires you to have active listings on eBay to get started, and the newer model known as"" eBay funnel"" or"" eBay warehouse"". The most popular of these models is the old electronics model which involves purchasing new products at an affordable price then re-listing them with your active listings for a fee. This is a relatively straightforward process, however, it does require some thought and effort on your part to find the best product to sell. The last  advice that I can give you in learning how to sell your products on eBay is to learn about an eBay advanced listing form. An advanced listing form allows you to create a larger database of potential buyers, and it allows you to easily change the prices of your items from various categories. You can also set up a monthly payment schedule for your buyers and add items frequently so that your listings stay current."
17,Why a Plastic Surgeon Should Write a Book,business," I think a plastic surgeon should write a book for all sorts of reasons: •	It makes you an authority •	It increases your notoriety and name recognition •	It gives you prestige and respect •	There’s a good chance you’ll get free PR •	And it differentiates you from all the other surgeons in the industry It also helps your organic SEO efforts, so you are more easily found on the Internet because you’ll be in more places. I say this from personal experience… My book, “Your Aesthetic Practice: What Your Patients Are Saying”  was a game-changer for me. It told my audience of plastic surgeons that I was serious about making my mark on this industry. I was interviewed by, The New York Times, Newsweek, ABC News, and I have sold thousands of them, so they are sitting on surgeons’ desks all over the US as well as digital copies all over the world. And my book is actually helpful and adds value to surgeons who want to “better their best” so it’s been a gift that keeps on giving. BUT HERE’S THE SECRET I didn’t just spew my brilliance and hope for the best. As the title suggests, I surveyed many cosmetic patients to find out why they chose you or your competitor and what you could have done to win over more patients. This way, I am seen as the cosmetic patient attraction specialist because I spent so much time and effort dissecting their wants, needs, and desires. That allowed me to help plastic surgeons grow their practices faster and easier because I gave them shortcuts and insights that made all the difference. You can do the same. Write a consumer book that is of value to the consumer who is interested in cosmetic rejuvenation. Here are 3 strategies that will make your book pop …. Write about one body part or one procedure. Be seen as an expert in one thing, and they will stay for more. And come up with a catchy title. So the readers know immediately if this is for them or not. For example: 5 Things You Need to Know About _____________ The Truth about ___________ The Secret to a Great ______________ Don’t Consider _________ Until You Read This Cosmetic patients want to see other patients just like them who have “experienced” you and your skill. The best way to “show off” your expertise is to show your skills through great before/after photos. And be sure to add a variety of demographics so the prospective patient can see themselves in these photos. Reviews are the next element that should be sprinkled throughout your book. What others say about you is infinitely more important than what you say about yourself. However, have your patients tell their stories. Everyone has one. Their story starts with the problem (pain) that was causing them angst. Then why they chose you over all the others (that’s why the reader will choose you too). Then what the process was like (hopefully, they will brag about how well you and your staff took care of them) and then have them end with how great their life is now that they finally took action. Writing your book is one thing but getting it in front of the right audience is another. You don’t need it to be a best seller. You need it to get in the hands of prospective patients who are looking for a surgeon to help them. Spread the word about your book using every media outlet you have access to AND where prospective patients go for information. Here is a partial list to get you started: •	Have a book signing event and take lots of photos and videos •	Invite the media – you never know. •	Send an Email invite to your current patients and have them forward to friends •	Post on your social platforms and have them share with their friends •	Add you and your staff’s email signatures with a link to buy your book •	Get invited to be a guest on popular blogs •	Get invited to be a guest on applicable podcasts •	Sell your book on Amazon and google books •	Give all of your consultations your book to increase your conversion rate •	Send out press releases (google press releases for vendors who can help) HOW TO WRITE YOUR BOOK EASY Now at this point, I’m sure you’re wondering HOW to write this book because it can seem like a daunting task. I get that. A big reason for this is because you don’t know what to write. But that’s the beauty (pun intended) of your book… You just write about what you do every day of your career. You meet with prospective patients. You listen to their story and what they want. You set expectations, so they understand results to expect. You do surgery and make them comfortable before, during, and after. You get them back in to see their final result and take before, and after photos. So your content is basically “The day in the life of a plastic surgeon.” Yes, it can be that simple. But it’s still not easy. You have to either put in your own time and/or pay others to get this book project completed, so here’s what you do: Once you pick one procedure or body part, it’s time to collect content, and this is the easy part. Using an iPad, have your staff videotape your consultations for that procedure with prospective patients. The prospective patients don’t need to be in the video because you are simply capturing what you normally say to explain the do’s and don’ts, the results to expect, the pros and cons, and so on for that procedure. You also want to capture the objections and questions the prospective patients ask. Because if they have those questions, so do other prospective patients. Also, record any tools you use to communicate with patients to help them understand. Maybe you are good at sketching or using computer imaging and so on. And, to help bring in the emotion and the human side of cosmetic rejuvenation, you want to videotape patients at different stages of the process such as: •	Those who are still researching •	Or the night before their surgery •	Or during their recovery •	And definitely at their post-op when they are looking good and feeling terrific! Now you need to put it all together and get it published and here’s how: You take all the videotape and audio you collected and hand it off to a transcriber such as rev.com or fiverr.com. Then hand the transcriptions off, along with your photos and testimonials to a ghostwriter (you can find one at www.upwork.com but be sure they have lots of 5 Star Reviews) and let them edit it into a readable format. Then you review their draft, make your final edits, and it is now ready for print. I suggest keeping this easy on you and your pocketbook and self-publishing. You can then have Amazon print and ship for you at www.createspace.com. And there you have it. That’s how you create your own book!

In exchange for this percentage, your attorney will provide their services. A sliding scale of percentages is used in some contingency fee agreements, depending on how much financial recovery you receive. The agreement will also contain information regarding who pays for administrative costs related to the claim. You will need to decide whether you will pay for travel expenses, filing fees and document reproduction costs. Or will your attorney cover those costs. If your law firm covers administrative expenses, you'll have to pay the rest out of the financial recovery. It is important to discuss with your attorney whether these costs will be taken out of your financial award or not. This can make a huge difference in the amount you receive after your case is settled. Hourly Fee Agreements (Personal Injuries Lawyers Usually Do Not Charge This Way) Many lawyers charge an hourly rate to their clients. Clients can quickly become frustrated by this type of fee, which often runs into the hundreds of dollars per hour. An attorney might require that the client pay a retainer fee if they bill hourly. A legal retainer is an upfront payment to secure the services of the lawyer for the client. For all work that is related to the client, the attorney will charge an hourly rate. Flat Fee Agreements Flat fee agreements are usually used when the attorney provides a specific legal service. These cases allow the lawyer to accurately estimate the work required to complete their service. Take, for example: Uncontested divorce filings How to draft a trust or will Filing a trademark, patent, or copyright request Responsible for residential real estate sales and closings Personal injury lawyers rarely charge a flat fee. As mentioned above, most accident lawyers work on contingency. This allows you to be sure that the final fee is fair and reasonable."
19,Why Advertisers Should Sweat The Small Stuff,business," 'Don’t sweat the small stuff' is good advice in many instances, but not necessarily in marketing. Keeping your focus on the small things frequently makes your advertising more effective. This is especially the case if you are marketing to individuals. That’s because marketing needs to be personal, relatable and specific if you want to influence your audience. Imagine you own a business selling energy-saving lighting products. You could run an advert which reads “Our products keep the country’s carbon footprint down.” A very worthy consideration but, apart from a few idealists, it isn’t likely to attract customers. Whether consciously or unconsciously, everyone wants to know ‘what’s in it for me?’ Our overriding interest is in our own welfare. The average consumer might agree the country should reduce its carbon footprint, but if you really want to catch their attention, you need to make your advertising about them. Your advert needs to be personal. “Our energy-saving light bulbs will save you money” is much better. It tells people that there’s an individual benefit to them. We’re not finished yet though. It also has to be relatable. A promise of saving money is a bit too vague. We need something more specific if we want it to be real to the reader. A shampoo advert doesn’t say the shampoo will make your hair ‘better’. It gives specifics. The shampoo will make your hair shinier, thicker, easier to control. Being specific makes the benefit more relatable and thus more attractive. “Our energy-saving light bulbs can save you £50 a year” gives a specific sum. There’s now a concrete benefit, not a vague benefit. But we can go one better and make it even more relatable by showing what difference that money saving will make to the consumer. Your audience needs to know how it can make a difference. Charities are great at doing this. They don’t run adverts saying, “95% of children in XXXX live below the poverty line.” That would generate plenty of tsks from readers, but it would probably stop there. There’s nothing to grip the imagination, and most people would assume only a millionaire could help anyway. It’s too big. Instead, charities will use lines such as “7-year-old Burhaan hasn’t been to school for a year because he has no shoes to wear.” By stressing the small stuff – the individual – it makes it personal and relatable. Not only is it more effective at garnering sympathy, it also shows how even a small donation can make a difference, prompting more people to donate. Back to our £50 saving then and how to show our readers that it can make enough difference to their lives to make it worth switching to your product. Good writers and public speakers know to convert hard-to-imagine things into familiar objects or ideas. For example, describing the size of a new battleship in terms of how many football pitches or Olympic swimming pools would fit on it. Charities often tell you what can be purchased for specific sums of money. “£XXX will provide one village in XXX with clean water for a year.” For my own use, I usually convert cost savings into bars of chocolate. Not everyone shares my dedication to chocolate though. What we need here is a widespread expense which frequently worries people, where £50 would make a significant difference. “Our energy-saving light bulbs let you put away an extra £50 a year for your Christmas shopping.” Personal, relatable and specific."
20,Biggest Reason Cosmetic Patients Choose You Over Your Competitors,business," In this article, you will discover the biggest reason cosmetic patients choose you over your competitors so you can attract more of them. You and your staff spend up to an hour with a prospective patient talking with them and showing them what they can expect. You explain the procedure, and then your coordinator goes over the quote, and then what happens? The majority of the time, you get the dreaded, “I gotta think about it.” Ugh! It makes you feel like you’re spinning your wheels and wasting your time, doesn’t it? To help you understand the inner workings of the aesthetic patient’s mind, I did the research for my book, Your Aesthetic Practice: What Your Patients are Saying, where I personally interviewed many cosmetic patients to figure out why they say yes to one surgeon and no to the others. My objective was to determine trends and commonalities of cosmetic patients to you better understand them. Here are some of my key findings: •	90% of the time, the confidence in the surgeon’s ability and positive staff interaction were more important than price. •	75% went on multiple consultations before deciding (the majority of those who went on one consultation did so after a glowing recommendation from their friend, family member, or colleague. •	Long waiting times and feeling hurried were reoccurring complaints that hurt the relationship. •	The better the staff, the less time the surgeon had to spend with the patient during the consultation. AESTHETIC PRACTICE BOOK SURVEY CONCLUSION/FINDINGS While the above responses were interesting, it was apparent that I needed to probe further to see if I could come up with some generalities that could define what made up a good practice where prospective patients said YES. However, this is what I learned instead. …. The aesthetic patients’ preferences varied greatly. These aesthetic patients are consumers who think very differently. And, their perceptions were so varied such as: •	While some thought an aesthetically gorgeous office indicated pride and success; others thought it was over the top, intimidating, and made them feel uncomfortable. •	While some thought the surgeons did not spend enough time with them and felt rushed, others thought the surgeons spent too much time with them and made them wonder why the surgeon wasn’t busier. •	While some thought the surgeon was so thorough in explaining the various procedures available, others felt overwhelmed and confused with so many options. So, I probed further and asked, bottom line, why they chose that particular surgeon over the others; there was a consistent answer that came up again and again…. The biggest reason cosmetic patients chose you over your competitors was that the patient felt a “connection” with you, your staff, and the overall vibe of the practice atmosphere. It was the FEELING they got when interacting with everyone at the practice. Their “intuition” was telling them this was the right surgeon, staff, and practice for them. They had developed a rapport with people in the practice and trusted that that particular surgeon understood them and would give them the best possible result. So, what is Rapport? If rapport is so vital, it’s important to understand it. It’s difficult to define, and you either have it with your patient, or you don’t. Rapport is that bond you build with your prospective patient.  It’s the single most important personality skill that plastic surgeons and staff need to be successful. You build rapport through words, tone, and gestures as well as commonalities since: •	     7% of what is communicated is through your words •	     38% through your tone of voice •	     55% through your body language HOW DO YOU CREATE RAPPORT WITH COSMETIC PATIENTS? The aesthetic patient wants to feel special – period.  When a patient is spending their own money and time on elective cosmetic enhancement, they want to be treated respectfully, professionally and kindly by every person they encounter in the practice. They also want to be heard and understood.  There is an old saying that says “Before you can be understood, you must work to understand” and that is truly the case here. You build rapport by giving a cosmetic patient your undivided attention. They have to feel like you are interested in them and what they have to say. That starts with a smile and good eye contact. The key is to look at the patient more than at the computer or your paperwork. The point is to show interest in the prospective patient as a person first; patient second. Find something on the patient intake form you have in common that helps break the ice. Perhaps it is the referring patient you both know, or maybe your kids go to the same school. Another way to build rapport is to ask questions and then listen to the answers. There’s a study that says surgeons interrupt patients within 16 seconds. And that cannot happen if you are trying to connect with a cosmetic patient who’s trying to determine if you are “the one.” Let them talk.  Not only will the patient give you the vital information you need to know to decipher if they are a good fit for you, but the patients will also feel like you understand them. That’s when you have developed a rapport, and you bonded with the patient who now sees you as the best choice. The point is to look at the consultation as a 2-way dialogue rather than a 1-way presentation, so you build rapport with the prospective patient who says YES to you! If you want to learn more about what cosmetic patients want from you, for a limited time, you can get a free copy of my book called, “Your Aesthetic Practice: What Your Patients are Saying.” Enjoy!"

2,Data Literacy is Becoming Common Place is HR and Payroll,business," Payroll employees have long been the ones to fill out excel forms, the ones that insert and transform the data, but are rarely responsible for reading and seeing trends in the data that they work with daily. Many new jobs have come around data, even cool job titles such as those like “Data Scientist”. The problem is though, that payroll is becoming ever more automated and payroll/HR employees are finding themselves with less time running payroll, and more time doing other tasks. All parts of companies are becoming more and more tech ran, and this trend will only continue. ""Many payroll professionals were never really taught how to look at trends and truly understand data."" While attending a recent virtual payroll conference, many questions were asked in the Q&A on how to read data and access analytics as a payroll professional. This is because payroll professionals are once again, doing less payroll, and more analyzing data altogether. However, many were never really taught how to look at trends and truly understand data. Many have said once they are asked to present a certain set of data in their field, they often have to go ask the finance department or a data scientist, or maybe even IT. With the growth of AI, analytics, and big data, to work for a company that uses large amounts of data, you have to be able to read and learn from it in all parts of the company, including payroll and HR. LEARN ""PEOPLE ANALYTICS"" TO SEE PROFITS THAT ARE 82 PERCENT HIGHER THAN AVERAGE OVER THREE YEARS. The growth of data boot camps has become commonplace as well, just take a look on LinkedIn and search data boot camps, you can find not only camps themselves, but even companies that specialize in teaching data analytics as well. New majors are coming into colleges and universities, such as Data Science Majors, Data Analytics majors, and even AI and ML majors/minors coming into some universities and colleges. Improved HR analytics has been directly linked to productivity and profitability. One notable example comes from energy giant Chevron, which reported a 30 percent increase in productivity after overhauling its approach to HR analytics. They’re not alone, either – research has found that organizations using ‘people analytics’ to drive HR and business decisions often see profits that are 82 percent higher than average over three years. Big data is only encompassing more areas of information to cover, and with more information, comes more ways to use and learn from it."

4,Cosmetic Patient Attraction Plan for 2020,business," If you want a steady stream of cash-paying cosmetic patients filling up your schedule in 2021, this cosmetic patient attraction plan is for you. So many plastic surgeons complain that they are spending more than ever on advertising; yet, nothing they are doing is working as they want. HERE’S WHAT PLASTIC SURGEONS SAY ABOUT THEIR MARKETING EFFORTS: •	The inconsistent revenues of good and bad months are stressing them out. •	Social media is confusing and time-consuming, and they don’t know for sure if it’s worth the time and effort they are putting in, OR they outsource the social media efforts and have no idea if they’re getting a good return. •	They are spending a fortune on Google AdWords, but their staff complains they are bad quality leads, so they don’t bother following up. •	Their conversion rates have dropped, and they don’t know why. •	Their staff is not representing them professionally and on and on. If any of this sounds familiar, I have a solution that gives you clarity about what’s going on and how you can adapt to win. So, here’s what you will discover: • How the right advertising efforts attract your “preferred” patients who care more about your skills and expertise than saving a buck. • How to use social media strategically, so you KNOW you’re getting results. • How to pre-frame YOU as the best choice over your competitors. • How to convert more leads to appointments and consultations to paid procedures. • How to follow up on leads that don’t convert right away. This will show you how to get your phones ringing with patient leads wanting your skill and expertise. And isn’t that what you ultimately want? More leads, more inquiries, more conversions, more money, and more growth? PLASTIC SURGERY INDUSTRY UPDATE Obviously, the insane amount of competition is the big change, but so is the introduction of non-surgical treatments that can be performed by RNs, PAs, NPAs, med spas, laser techs, and even aestheticians. With so much choice empowering consumers to make decisions, prospective cosmetic patients are gaining complete control over the decision-making process. What do I mean by that? Well, patients are comparison-shopping like never before, thanks to the Internet. They’re taking a lot of time to research and evaluate their surgical and non-surgical options. That means attracting new cosmetic patients online has become a big expensive and confusing challenge for surgeons like yourself. This plan will show you how to transform your patient lead generation plan from: A lack of leads with poor conversion rates to… …a constant stream of new patients hungry for your services. This allows you to DOMINATE your market because you will be firing on all cylinders……while your competitors continue to run from one shiny object to the next, burning through time and money and then complaining nothing works! A smarter approach is to map out a proven patient attraction plan that you know works and then identify the ‘Practice Gaps’ that MOST hurt your bottom line so you can turn them into Money-Making Profit Centers. I am going to show you how to get up to a 5,278% PROVEN ROI from your efforts without… – Wasting time redesigning your Website (again) – Spending more on organic search to get ranked; or – Hiring more staff Just imagine…The peace of mind you’ll have once you’re able to identify the new patient lead strategies as well as practice gaps keeping you from…. MORE Patients | MORE Procedures | MORE Revenues 4 PLASTIC SURGERY PRACTICE GAPS COSTING YOU DEARLY Let’s start with the practice gaps MOST affecting your bottom line, and then we’ll talk about the quickest fixes to turn things around, so I’ll jump right in with… Plastic Surgery Practice Gap #1: You Need MORE Patient Leads New patient leads are the #1 priority in any cosmetic practice. New leads are the lifeblood of your Practice. If you want more cash-paying patients and surgeries, you need more leads. But, how do you find new leads, and how do you get a predictable and steady flow of them? You already know you have to “pay to play” in today’s marketplace. Why? Free organic SEO is no longer the “go-to” search rankings strategy. And, gone are the days of you being found “by accident” or just because you’ve updated your Website. Even social media platforms will only show your posts to less than 10% of your audience because they want you to pay to advertise, so the cards are stacked against Free organic anything. So the Secret to Attracting New Cosmetic Patients is to go where others are not….yet. Here’s what I mean… For the most part, old school media channels have been replaced by digital media channels: – Print replaced by FB – Radio replaced by podcasts and – TV replaced by YouTube So, you want to build a digital advertising strategy using these digital media channels because that’s where all the eyeballs are. Makes sense, right? It is About Demand Generation – NOT Fulfillment And this may surprise you, but the new trend in attracting cosmetic patients is this: Demand Generation is Greater Than Demand Fulfillment Here’s what that means. Only 3% of consumers who click on PPC ads are ready to buy (that’s demand fulfillment). That’s why it’s so expensive to advertise there…because you’re competing for the same keywords your competitors are. So it’s a contest of who can outspend everyone else. A smarter approach is to go after the much larger group of targeted consumers on social media who “could” be interested in your services (demand generation) if you make them interesting and compelling for them to make it a priority. THIS approach is cheaper, easier, and super-targeted, so you’ll get way more leads. The point being, social media advertising is the single biggest opportunity in the history of advertising because, for a fraction of the cost of TV, you can advertise online and target exactly WHO sees your ads. That’s powerful. But that means the ad design and copy of your ads are crucial to get a click. It has got to be eye-catching, engaging and it must offer the consumer cosmetic patient something of value, so they actually respond. Because the ONLY thing that counts at this stage is to encourage a prospective cosmetic patient to take the next step. And that is to click on your ad. But here’s the kicker… Leads are only one part of it. These leads need to be converted, so let’s keep going… Plastic Surgery Practice Gap #2: Weak Follow Up on Incoming Leads Most plastic surgeons suffer lost profits here every day, every month, and every year from this silent money-waster. I think you’ll be surprised at the stats when it comes to staff following up on leads you spent a fortune to get in the first place: ✓ 48% NEVER Follow Up ✓ Average First Follow Up is 72 Hours Later ✓ Only 25% of practices make 2 contact attempts ✓ 64% of practices do not have any organized way to follow up on a lead But it’s not your staff’s fault. They have NOT been given the tools or training on how to do it professionally. That is a game-changer for you and a way to dominate your market when you use proven scripts and strategies to follow up faster and better than your competition, but there’s more… Here’s the next practice gap…. Plastic Surgery Practice Gap #3: Staff Can’t Convert Callers or Consultations Every practice’s success is limited by their staff’s ability to convert callers to appointments and appointments to paid procedures. It’s way too competitive to be mediocre at this stage of the lead process. Take the phone leads… Almost every office is challenged by this… Phone trees, answering machines, indifferent or unfriendly staff, or new untrained staff, and on and on. Phones are taken way too lightly because it’s not enough to have a friendly staff person answering the phones; they also have to be skilled. Otherwise, you lose money. Look what happens WHEN (not IF) you lose 1 caller per day: $2,000 per Day x 22 days per month x 12 months per year. = $528,000 LOST Profits Per Year Due to Bad Phones An easy fix is to give your receptionist the scripts and training they need to keep you busy with booked appointments. It’s time and money well spent. And what’s your coordinator’s converting rate? The prospective patient who calls you schedules an appointment and shows up is a Hot Prospect! They have already decided to move forward to find a solution to something that bothers them or they wouldn’t have gone to this much time, effort, and trouble to meet you in person. Your patient coordinator needs to be a well-trained professional with proven scripts, strategies, and tools to get the patients to a yes. For example, does your coordinator know how to: – Position you, the surgeon, as the BEST CHOICE? – Qualify the patient to prepare them for the quote presentation? – Present with confidence to get the patient excited about moving forward – And, ultimately, ask for a decision? Most coordinators don’t ask because they haven’t been trained to do so comfortably and professionally. The point is to arm your receptionist and patient coordinator with the tools and accountability they need to get really good at converting callers and consultations. Because nothing else matters until the patients say yes and give you money. Until a transaction is made, a lead is just a lead. We need your staff to move them along the buyer’s journey and convert them! And there’s one more deadly practice gap that’s costing you patients, and procedures and that is… Plastic Surgery Practice Gap #4: You Ignore Patients Who Would Return, Refer, and Review. Your #1 practice asset is your list of patients who know, like, and trust you. Many of these patients would gladly return, refer and review if given the opportunity. They are not as price-sensitive, and they are way more likely to say yes to you than an “internet stranger patient.” And, we all know a majority of your new patients come from your current patients, so this is the new mindset you need to adopt to survive in today’s crazy competitive world: RETENTION is the New Patient Attraction Strategy Because when you take your patients for granted and/or ignore them, you open the door for your competitors to steal them away from you. Please remember, cosmetic patients have endless needs, especially as the relentless aging process continues. Your cosmetic patients need your surgical AND non-surgical services now and a month from now and a year from now and so on. So, you want to nurture your current cosmetic patients. So they return and refer their friends and family. You do that with strategic Database Marketing using segmented messages, themed emails, text, and customized social media banners. That way, you are connecting with your patients no matter where they are online. So let me ask you… Do you believe, you would get at least 10-30 more procedures per month from this plan focused on new patient attraction, conversion, follow up and retention? Obviously, it’s worth it, so if you don’t want to do it, outsource it because SOMEBODY should be doing this type of high-end, strategic promotion to grow your cosmetic revenues and keep a steady stream of cash-paying patients coming to you. If you want me to set up a customized patient attraction – conversion – follow-up – retention plan, check out the Cosmetic Patient Marketing Plan. I wish you much success in 2021!"

6,Gain respect and trust with the Servant Leadership mindset,business," Joining an organization where you are expected to manage an established team can be difficult. You are often battling bias, skepticism, and maybe even resentment. Not to mention, you may be competing with the glorified memory of the previous manager or are now managing a team member who also applied for your position. All that to say, that 9 times out of 10, the cards are stacked against you when you walk into a situation like this. So how do you overcome the beginning awkwardness and difficulties to create a cohesive team that wants to work with you? The first thing to recognize is that respect and trust take time to build. It will not happen overnight. It must be earned. And one of the best ways to do this is by adopting the Servant Leadership style of managing. This method can be an effective way to increase morale, collaboration, and productivity – by prioritizing the individuals rather than the company at large. Simply put, this approach can go a long way towards establishing the respect and trust of your team. The term Servant Leadership was first coined in the 70s and remains a relevant hot topic in today’s business world.  A great book that really goes into depth on this concept is “Leaders Eat Last” by Simon Sinek, and I highly recommend checking it out. But for now, here are 5 ways to implement this strategy: First things first – Only speak authoritatively on topics of which you have experience or knowledge. The “fake it until you make it” mantra is not a good one to have when you are joining a new team, especially if they have been working in the space longer than you. Remember that you don’t have to be an expert on everything (that’s why you have a team!). It is your job as a leader to understand each team member’s strengths, and by showing compassion and sharing your expectations, you’ll establish a solid foundation. You have probably heard the phrase “praise in public, criticize in private.” While this is an important tactic to adopt, it is even more critical that your team knows that you have their backs. Using language like “we” and “us” when presenting new directives or in taking negative feedback from the bigger organization will further enforce that feeling of togetherness. By fostering collaboration among the team members, you convey the message that “we succeed together, and we grow together.” The greatest way to earn respect and trust is by showing your team that you aren’t afraid to do the hard work. Break down the construct that leaders sit in ivory towers and only bark orders. Your willingness to work alongside them occasionally will further enforce the idea that you have their backs and that you understand the work they are doing. Empathy goes a long way in building a relationship. Sure, creating a positive environment directly leads to having a healthy team morale. However, it must be authentic and takes time to create. Team members want to feel supported, heard, and valued. This cannot be accomplished by simply bringing donuts in on Fridays and keeping a smile plastered on your face during each conversation. If the effort is disingenuous then every small act will be interpreted as a poor attempt to “buy loyalty” and have the team skeptical of your true motives. Finally, it is important to recognize the established culture of the team. It may be toxic or different than you are used to, and you may have even been hired to change it. However, it is important to understand the underlying reasons of the culture. Coming in and changing things too quickly can be perceived as an “outsider” trespassing in an area they don’t belong. This can create a wedge of “us” versus “them” mentality and undermine any progress or trust that may have started to develop. When it is time to implement a change, be sure to communicate the “why” behind the decision and gather feedback and ideas on how the change can be rolled out successfully. Remember, your team wants to feel included and heard. While there is certainly no singular way to manage, this is one philosophy that has been extensively researched in Forbes and adopted by major companies such as Google and Starbucks. Being a leader is often a delicate tight rope act and not for the faint of heart, as you may be dealing with multiple personalities and stylistic differences. It may be appropriate to change management styles, depending on the situation. However, mastering the art of relationship building and Servant Leadership is will prove to be beneficial in every job market."
7,How Much is an Antique Worth to an Antiques Dealer?,business," One of the saddest sights are those newcomer antique dealers who entered the market with such massive enthusiasm, only to be forced to exit it again after 2-3 years. They usually do so with massive debts and are frequently, by any definition, ‘bust’. Here we’ll examine the chief cause of this – paying far too much for items in the first place to offer any realistic chance of a viable profit margin. How do you value an antique? To be clear at the outset, the views here should differ between collectors and dealers. The collector will be prepared to pay whatever they feel right about to get the object. The professional can only pay a figure that allows them to sell on for a profit. If that sounds patronising, it’s an important distinction to make because it feeds into how one thinks about the value of an item. What is the market value? Broadly speaking, the value of an antique item at any given time is what you can sell it for - meaning what buyers are willing to pay for it at around that moment in time. Experienced and successful antique dealers, of which there are now only a very small number, know this well. Inexperienced dealers often do not and it’s why they fail. The problem is, many newbie dealers assume that an antique is worth what they paid for it plus their profit percentage. They sometimes even look up what other dealers are asking today for such items to support their valuation methodology. The absolutely key message is, THIS TECHNIQUE IS USELESS FOR ESTABLISHING THE VALUE OF AN ANTIQUE ITEM AND THEREFORE HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD PAY FOR IT! The reason for this is very clear. What someone else is asking only tells you that they haven’t managed to sell the item for that price so far. That should be a big warning - not an encouragement to match their expectations. How can you tell the potential profit margin of an item prior to purchase? This only comes about as a result of two things working in harmony: . years of experience, which usually leads to an instinctive feeling about the ease of a quick turnaround and a probable market-realistic price. Of  course, it isn’t instinct alone but something supplemented by extensive and ongoing daily research plus the monitoring of online retail operations and public auctions; . being able to source items VERY cheaply – in other words, well below the figure you’ll have in mind from the point above. Many inexperienced dealers operate on the basis of going to public auctions, buying items then assuming they can add 50-100% for a retail resale price. Do that and you might have the odd win but overall, you can be fairly sure that you’ll get burned badly and be bust in 2-3 years. How should it be done? Let’s assume you’re a dealer looking for stock. Buying stock you either won’t be able to sell or only sell at a loss, is a total waste of your time and money. You may get a buzz at beating other dealers to it but that high will be nothing but a very distant and sour memory when you’re still looking at the item on your shelf in 2 years’ time. So: . ignore what other dealers are asking for their items; . by contrast, be sure before going out to buy, that you’re armed with extensive credible market research giving actual sale values over a sensible time period of perhaps the last 12-18 months. Use those to give you a rough average realistic resale value; . subtract from that price, about 75% AT LEAST. That will give you the maximum figure you’ll be able to pay for the item to cover your costs, taxes and to leave even a small profit margin. You’ll need to be around 75-150% lower if you want a decent profit margin. DO NOT pay more than that for the item because you got into a bidding war with other dealers – you’ll regret it if you do. Easy it is not! Other top tips to achieve profitability when selling antiques Here is the painful reality. The single biggest factor driving antique dealers out of business is essentially that there are simply too many dealers in the marketplace and this badly affects the prices being paid at source for items. In some European countries, there are now 5 times more antique dealer businesses registered than was the case as recently as 2019 – even though vast numbers have gone bust over the same period. That should be a very sobering thought. Add to this the current ‘fashion-swing’, meaning a relative lack of retail buyer interest in many antique domains, and you have a case of supply vastly exceeding demand. If that’s not bad enough, the excess supply of antique dealers engaged in all-out war with each other to try and secure stock is driving wholesale prices up and up at a time when retail prices are declining in most areas. In fact, it’s very often the case now that prices at what were once wholesale source are actually higher than a realistic achievable retail price would be for the same item. The Top Tip to avoid disaster is therefore - whatever your business model is, you need to be aware of this background and be sure to avoid being sucked into the spiral of overpaying for your stock."
8,The 5 Experts You Must Have On Your Team,business," Whether you are self-employed, managing a small team, or in charge of a large-scale operation, you will know the value of teamwork to your business. While every company is likely to need a wide range of specialists, there are some fields that you will require help with time and time again. In these areas, having those with specialised knowledge on your team will often lead to greater efficiency, better customer service, and substantial savings in time. But which are the five types of service professional in hottest demand? Here, we take a look! Compliance experts help to ensure that everything about your business is secure, efficient, and up to industry standards. Being up to code can include taking care of health and safety factors, such as ensuring adequate fire safety practices are in place, or making sure you qualify for certain jobs by having the relevant professional accreditation and certificates, and more. Compliance experts are not only about helping your business to look legitimate and desirable in the eyes of your clients, they also ensure that things are working smoothly and efficiently within the business itself. All these things are essential to running a business successfully, but they can become complex and time-consuming too. That’s where a compliance expert can help. They can stay on top of deadlines, prepare essential paperwork, and keep up to date with all the developments and requirements of your industry so you don’t have to! Bid writers and tendering professionals can save companies substantial amounts of time and help to significantly boost their profits. This is because they not only prepare the materials and utilize the persuasive writing that is essential when creating a bid, but can also identify the best opportunities to bid on. This can be extremely helpful if you are in an industry where you must identify tenders and compete for work, but are finding that searching for opportunities to bid on just isn’t for you. This is when it’s a great time to hire bid and tender professionals instead. Professionals in this field can rapidly compile a list of the best opportunities, write the materials needed to make the bid, and help you better meet the requirements of the contract being bid on. It’s no surprise then, that the best bid and tender professionals can win their clients millions of pounds worth of extra work. Some business owners are still unaware of the power of SEO — despite the fact that many people now find the businesses and services they want through online search engines alone. Ensuring that your website and written content is fully search engine optimised can be crucial for your business, as it can greatly increase the amount of traffic to your website, and thus the amount of leads and potential new clients you’re generating. It is specialised work, however, and needs insider knowledge of web design and online marketing best practices, along with clear and persuasive writing. It may not be an especially glamorous role, but effective and reliable accountants remain one of the most prized members of a business team. The best accountants can help to ensure that your business finances are functioning optimally, your cash flow is predictable, and you are paying the right amount of tax. They can also advise on permitted deductions and claimable expenses, so that you are ensuring your business is cost-effective. Whether small or large, all businesses will benefit from receiving sound financial advice. Social media is now (correctly) recognised as a powerful business tool. It provides a great way to connect with clients and customers, engage your audience, and communicate your values as a business. It is one of the most powerful forms of advertising in the modern business environment, and with the recent boom in e-commerce, this shows no sign of slowing down. However, social media is ever-changing, with new platforms and features emerging almost every day. That’s why many businesses are turning to experts in social media to ensure that their campaigns and content stay up to date and have the biggest impact possible. Social media is no longer an afterthought in business. It can be at the very heart of a company’s communication strategy — crucial to advertising, customer service, and post-sales support. By ensuring you have experts from all these areas by your side in business, you can help yourself to save money, win more work, and deliver better outcomes for your clients!"
9,A Quick Summary of Antique French Silver and its Hallmarks,business," France, like many European countries, has for centuries had a centrally-controlled system for marking silver items. These ‘hallmarks’ or “poinçons” (roughly “pwahn-son”) in French confirm a number of things about the item. What follows is a very highly summarized overview for those interested in antiques. What French silver hallmarks may tell you France has some of the world’s more complicated hallmarking systems and that hasn’t been helped by numerous changes over time. So, a good detailed guide is required to interpret them, particularly if they’re pre-20th century. Even so, and generalising greatly, they typically confirm: •	the purity of the silver. France historically recognised three levels: - 950 grade, 800 grade and some marks signify that the item is “at least 800 grade” (e.g. pocket watch casings): •	 possibly, for some 19th century items and earlier, where the item was assayed – i.e. tested and approved. This might include marks showing duty payments in various locations; •	who made it. Dating French silver hallmarks You can think of French hallmarks falling into a relatively small number of periods in terms of their characteristics: •	Ancien Régime – the royal system that prevailed for centuries prior to the French Revolution, culminating in the execution of Louis XVI; •	Premier Coq – the abandonment of royalist imagery and the adoption of republican images starting in 1798 and lasting until 1809. The coq is literally a cockerel in an oblong cartouche. This mark was used during the historic periods known as the Directoire and First Empire; •	Deuxième Coq – the shape of the cockerel was changed in 1809 and that lasted until 1819. This corresponds to the historical periods First Empire and Restoration of the Monarchy under Louis XVIII; •	Vieillard – the cockerel vanishes and is replaced by what is commonly known as the “old man’s head” but is technically the head of Michelangelo. This lasts from 1819-1838, thereby covering the historical periods of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Louis-Phillipe; •	Minerve – this is perhaps the most commonly encountered hallmark for silver collectors and dealers. The head of Minerva is now in the cartouche and this is stable from 1838 to the present day; •	Tête de Mercure – Mercury’s head was used on some French items made for export during the period 1840-1879 - so the periods Louis-Phillipe, Second Republic, Napoléon III, Second Empire and Third Republic; •	Miscellaneous – Since the 19th century, France has also used a plethora of smaller hallmarks recognising different circumstances. These are usually, though not exclusively, found on smaller and lighter items of silver. They designate things such as imported silver, silver items below a specific weight, items with a specific function (such as pocket watch cases) and so on. Just a sample includes the boar’s head, weevil, swan and quite a few others. These marks sometimes also indicate by implication, that the silver is less than 950 grade; •	925 – the standard international Sterling mark found since the 1970s on some French silver and now legally accepted. Identifying Ancien Régime marks These are usually identifiable at a glance. Space doesn’t permit a full description but there are some fairly good sources on line. However, look for: •	marks that are much more deeply struck into the silver than on more recent items – that’s particularly true for flatware; •	many (though not all) 18th century marks will have more flowing, organic and irregular boundaries or incorporate circular shapes; •	cartouches containing a single letter; •	royal symbols – notably the crown and/or fleur-de-lys. Be aware that French 18th century and earlier hallmarks were widely faked in the 19th century in both Holland and Germany on some of their silver pieces. These aren’t easy to detect unless you’re an expert and the items may be silver. Check with an expert if you’d like to be sure. Purity of silver If all other things are equal, 950 grade silver will usually be more expensive and valuable than 800 grade. After 1798, it’s usually easy to tell the purity of larger French silver items: •	if you look in the corner of the main cartouche, irrespective of what head it contains, you should see a tiny “1” or a “2”. As you might expect, the “1” equates to 950 and “2” to 800; •	if you’re struggling to read the number, which can happen, look at the corners of the cartouche. 800 grade silver uses rounded edges whereas the corners of 950 grade silver are canted (meaning in this context, clipped at an angle of 45 degrees).

10,5 Powerful Ways To Save Time In Your Business,business," Whatever your industry and the size of your business, you will know the value of time. In business, the familiar adage 'time is money' is truer than ever. Wasted time could mean wasted money, squandered opportunities, unsatisfied clients, and more. However, time management can quickly become overwhelming. If you are an entrepreneur, you are likely already fulfilling multiple roles in your business. But that’s where the ideas below come in. If you are keen to manage your time effectively and to maximise your energy levels, you need techniques and strategies in place to support you. With the following five tips, you can take back valuable minutes, hours, and even days’ worth of time — all of which will add up and make a difference! Intelligent, confident business owners do not think they know it all. On the contrary, they are the first to admit when someone else knows better — and they want them on their team! Hiring experts to cover areas where you feel weaker, less confident, or uninformed is a great way to save time. Rather than handling their own deliveries, for example, many companies know the value of hiring a professional courier to do it for them. Or if they’re concerned about an urgent legal matter, rather than attempting to absorb conflicting information online, most businesses will consult a qualified lawyer. While the initial investment is likely to cost money, the time and peace of mind you will 'buy back' will - more often than not - make the expense worthwhile. This is because experts can do things quickly and correctly for you by utilising specialist knowledge that may take you months or even years to acquire for yourself. When it comes to complex areas such as industry compliance, safety, accounts and more, do not risk fines and penalties if you are unsure! Simply hire an expert instead. Entrepreneurs are well known for their versatility. But just because you can fulfil a lot of roles doesn’t mean you should! Delegate simpler (or indeed, more specialised) tasks to appropriate team members or outside experts. Such tasks could be time-consuming but non-demanding, so that they do not require inside knowledge and could be outsourced if needed. Take an honest look at your to-do list — especially the tasks and processes that recur — and assess just how many of them could be delegated to others. You will then have the time and headspace to focus on the tasks that only you could do – including, but not limited to, creative processes, public appearances, and more. The ‘little and often’ approach describes attending to issues and tasks regularly, rather than, for example, annually, or only when they become a problem. This ‘little and often’ method can apply to tasks, business processes, and especially budgets — where regular reviews and check-ups can help to prevent an overwhelming task developing for the end of the business year. This is true of maintenance too. For example, by keeping your company car in good working order, you will save money as well as time. This is because a well-maintained car is more fuel-efficient to drive, meaning it will be better for your finances. The ‘little and often’ approach may at first appear to be taking more time out of your day — but the positive effect is cumulative. Overall, you will save yourself more time by preventing small issues and tasks from quietly becoming major problems in the long term. It is remarkable how many entrepreneurs and other busy people still overlook this tip — but automating processes is a major time saver. Regular tasks such as paying bills, sending invoices, or filing documents can all be automated. Devote the time to setting up automations — or at least simplified processes — and enjoy the time and peace of mind this provides! Switching between wildly different tasks can lead to greater mental exhaustion and ‘decision fatigue’. Going from an in-person meeting to working through emails and errands, and then making phone calls, for example, would be draining and inefficient. Instead, batch similar tasks - such as meetings and phone calls - together, then take care of light work such as emails and errands in the same time block, before working on deep, concentrated duties in their own dedicated slot. This will help to prevent the fatigue that comes from expecting your brain to make a sudden change - thereby helping you improve your time management and overall efficiency!"

12,Is Social Media Marketing right for your business?,business," Social Media Marketing (SMM) is an often misunderstood form of digital marketing, especially for businesses. Rather than seeing Social Media Marketing purely as a platform for vanity measures such as likes and shares, it  can help businesses of all sizes to spread awareness, build interest, convert leads and generate sales. Social Media Marketing– What is it, and how does it work? Even calling sites like Facebook and Instagram “Social Media Networks” is to disregard the true purpose of these platforms. They are intensive data driven marketing tools, where users actively share their personal interests, hobbies, likes and dislikes. This data is then made available to digital marketers. This data is used to “personalise” the user’s data feed with adverts that will interest them, that they are more likely to interact with. How many times have you discussed something, and then seen adverts about that exact product? These sites know extensive and copious amounts about their users. They know what posts the users interact with, which they ignore, how they interact with them, and who they share them with. They can even monitor your activity across the web as a whole, not just on their respective applications. This knowledge can be used to the advantage of your business. What are the main benefits of Social Media Marketing? Rather than waiting for customers to find you, social media marketing allows businesses to be proactive in identifying and targeting potential customers. You can then re-target interested prospective customers and accompany them along their digital journey to paying customer. Social Media paid campaigns offer large swathes of analysable data, giving you an insight into the online activities of your customers and prospects. How can my business use Paid Social Media Marketing? To build Brand/ Product Awareness — The most common use for social media marketing, however this is due to the ease of doing so rather than as a result of the effectiveness. Businesses are able to target users they believe would be interested in their product/ service/ business, and place the business adverts into the user’s news feed. The intention is to interest the viewer. Converting interest into Consideration — The middle stage of the conventional sales funnel. You can retarget users who have displayed an initial interest in your product/ service/ business, and tempt them with follow up adverts, such as product reviews, testimonials and demonstrations. Turning Consideration into Sales– When the potential customer is ready to make a purchase, SMM can ensure they come directly to you, rather than the competition. Retarget users who are reaching the buying stage with adverts with strong call to action’s such as Add to Cart, Get Quote or Get Directions. What are the key features of Paid Social Media Marketing? Targeting and Retargeting– The Social Media platforms collect valuable personal information about their users, which in turn they use to tailor adverts specifically to the user’s interests and hobbies. If a user changes their relationship status to ‘engaged’, advertisers can then deliver wedding related adverts directly into their news feeds. Your business can ensure that your adverts are seen by users with an interest in what you have to offer. Creative — On a platform dominated by memes, if your advert is boring and bland, it will be ignored. You need a way of ‘stopping the scroll’. One of the significant plus points of SMM is that you can tailor the advert to each user, so that it is in the form most likely to be interacted with. Some users like to watch an advert, some will listen, whilst others will read. You can tailor to all of them at once. Call to Action — If the user enjoys and is interested in your advert, you need to ensure you capture that interest there and then. The correct call to action (shop now, get quote, learn more etc) will ensure that hot leads are dealt with immediately. What potential pitfalls should I be aware of? Sometimes, Social Media Marketing is not the solution for a product/ service digital marketing focus. If the product is a mundane niche, it can be difficult to target potential customers, and instead your focus should be on making sure your customers can find you, via routes such as SEO. Overall, Social Media Marketing can be a powerful tool for small businesses to build their online presence and drive valuable actions such as e-commerce sales and lead generation, when done properly."
13,The Role of Psychological Safety in Diverse and Inclusive Work Environments,business," Abstract This paper will explore the role of psychological safety in diverse and inclusive work environments. I will discuss about psychological safety, its role and benefits and compare the different cultures and its characteristics for America, Europe and China. I will also discuss what comfort and psychological safety means for each culture in the work environment context. As part of the study on the cultural study and comparison, I will also compare the cultural difference for China, United Kingdom, United States and how we can logically categorize the characteristic of their culture diversity using the six Hofstede indexes. I will discuss the importance and inevitability of culture diversity in the current times where global and technological advanced workplace is a norm. The paper will conclude by sharing the benefits of creating psychological safety amidst diversity and inclusion and what must a leader do to drive psychological safety in work environment, through celebrating and embracing diversity and inclusion. Keywords: Collectivism, Cultures, Diversity, Inclusion, Hofstede, Power Distance, Psychological Safety, Restrain, Trust, Uncertainty Avoidance. The Role of Psychological Safety in Diverse and Inclusive Work Environments Introduction Psychological safety is the state by which individuals express and communicate their thoughts and ideas willingly without been intimidated or humiliated even if there are mistakes or errors (Edmondson, 1999). The idea of psychological safety at first came up with regards to workplaces that have complex degrees of human relationships particularly in the medical world where there is the need to take cognizance of the mistake of others as well as accommodate such mistakes instead of throwing verbal lashes at them for their errors (Edmondson, 1996). Psychological safety refers to the mutual understanding that interrelating with other people is safe (Edmondson, 1996; Carmeli and Gittell, 2009). In psychologically safe groups, colleagues feel acknowledged and regarded and subsequently, they are more confident that when they have a sense of security they are encourage to contribute more to their organization (Edmondson, 1999; Baer & Frese 2003). This experience certainly comes from shared regard and confidence among colleagues. Presence of psychological safety regularly unite a group, both in light of the fact that colleagues are dependent upon similar arrangement of underlying impacts and in light of the fact that these \are created out of unique shared moments. Psychological security has been distinguished as a significant reason in seeing how individuals work together to accomplish a common result (Edmondson, 2004), subsequently making it a basic idea for more findings. Importance of Culture Culture is the mirror of the community and it creates assumption of how the entire world functions. It describes the way of life of a set of people i.e. how they act, react and interact. Culture allows an individual have a sense of fellowship and belonging. Culture is pervasive because it confines someone into a particular society and provides direction for actions and reactions. Culture also creates incentive structure such that you are motivated to do something. It strengthens relationships and boost understanding unto performance. It enhances the quality of life and well- being of both the individual and community at large because it creates the platform for trust, tolerance, supports, cooperation, fellowship and rich understanding in the community of people. With globalization, technology and influence of multinational companies, we are interacting and working significantly more frequently with people from different cultures. It is ever more paramount today to learn, understand and respect about other cultures. The understanding of a certain culture can help you avoid misunderstanding, embarrassment, build relationship and trust between the team or community. This is a valuable skill in the corporate environment and daily life as we are living increasing in a multi culture environments. Secondly, learning other cultures can broaden your horizons. It is a good way to absorb new information, and view things from different perspectives. Last but not least, you probably will become more open-minded. When you make an effort to understand others, you will find it easier to respect and accept their differences. Cultural awareness has become an increasing important and essential issue. The consequence of not understanding and diverse culture is very serious. As an example, the current pandemic has seen increased incidents of racism, discrimination, and violence against “Asians,” particularly in the United States. Throughout 2020, reports of hate crimes, violence, racial slurs, wrongful job termination, physical violence, etc are well over 100 per day, Media and some US government official has made matter worse by stigmatizing and putting the blame on Asians for the Covid-19 pandemic. Culture Differences Cultural differences refer to the various way of life which includes the beliefs, norms, practices and customs associated to various people from diverse cultural background Bodley (1999; Lee, 2006). These diversities make the office more energetic and vibrant as well as encourage individuals to expose troubling issues or conflicts in any (Gurung and Prater, 2006). Cultural difference is the complexity in the manner with which several individuals from different culture live their lives. It is the homogenization of diverse societies. It refers to what exactly make a culture different from another. It is the uniqueness and assortment of persons or societies in a particular district, or in the world generally. A culturally diverse workplace boosts problem-solving capabilities and possibly increase happiness and productivity. It creates a better environment for talents and skills development as a wider range of expertise and ideas are generated from the a well diverse team. The different cultures have their uniqueness in relation to their way of life. While some culture will embrace a particular disposition or action, it might be considered highly rude or disrespectful to some other cultures. For example, some cultures believe that the colour a bride wears on her wedding day might bring good fortune. So, in the US, bride usually wear white while in China, the bride wears red (Peng & Nisbett, 1999). So in creating comfort within cultures, it is imperative for individuals to keep abreast of the norms of the cultures. An individual can comfortably live within a culture if it is fully understood. Work Cultures and Etiquettes around the World Culture is characterized by Lobby and Corridor (1990) as a framework for documenting and processing information. Public culture is set of qualities that are commonly accepted and practice by individuals from a country (Gurung and Prater, 2006). Culture describes the totality of individuals which includes family, households or individuals from diverse town, neighborhood, city or country. They are also individuals sharing similar ethnic background or work culture. Cultures are differentiated by their language, belief, history, food, and they greatly influence people in their thoughts and behavior. (Gurung and Prater, 2006). We have 195 countries worldwide with thousands of cultures. Having insights into some cultures will enhance our psychological security while appreciating diversity and inclusion. I will look into 3 key cultures, United States, Europe and Asia with the intent to compare and understand them and their differences. The US Culture The US is the third biggest country in the world having a population of in excess of 320 million. There United State actually has no official language (Clack et. al.,1997). There are many languages spoken in the US. English is the main language and some other languages that are spoken in the US are Chinese, Spanish, French and German. Most American are Christian and there are about 23% of American that are free thinkers. (Fussel, 1983). The US is broadly referred to around the hub in broad communications creation, including TV and films. In addition, US is a games – loving country, with a huge number of fans following football, baseball, basketball and hockey, among others. Numerous occasions are commended distinctly in the US which are Remembrance Day, Thanksgiving Day, Presidents' Day, Veterans' Day and so forth (Allen and David, 2002; McDonald, 2010). The European Culture There are exactly 160 socially distinct cultures in Europe with cultures (United Nations, 2009). The three biggest nations in Europe are Russia, Ukraine and France. Vatican City is the littlest country in Europe. Most European dialects have a place with either the Romance dialects, (for example, French, Italian, Spanish), the Germanic dialects (among them are German, English) or the Slavic dialects (among them Russian, Bulgarian, Clean). The five most communicated local dialects in Europe are Russian, German, French English, Turkish and Italian. A large portion of the European public is Christians (76%) and there are modest number of Muslims (6%), Jews and different cultures. Euporeans are well known to excel in the area of craftsmanship, engineering, film, music, financial, writing, and theory (Landry, 2006; Malloy and Gazzola, 2006). The Asian Culture Asia is the birthplace of human civilization. Many Asian American women feel a sense of obligation to maintain perfect appearances, excel in school and work, and find a marriage partner (Lowe et. al., 2012). They believed that practices like meditation and yoga will enhance the total well-being. (Witt and Redding, 2009; Whitley, 1999; Weller, 2010; Minkov, 2012).  Most Asia are very religious with as part of their upbringings with about 46% Christian, 15% Buddhist, 6% Hindu, and 2% Muslim (Witt and Redding, 2010). Work Etiquettes of Americas Greetings & Meetings Because Americans believe everyone is equal, their greetings are often informal. They greet you with a casual ""Hello"" or ""How are you?"" or even just ""Hi” and the usual response is ""Fine,"" ""Great,"" or ""Very well, thank you” (McDonald, 2010). Professional titles are used when introducing one another with eye contact while handshakes are brief and firm. They sit with one ankle crossed on the knee or legs crossed at the ankles or knees. They take punctuality serious (Adams & Pearlie, 2001). Decision Making They exhibit direct communication such as ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and do not use ‘maybe’. They avoid silence in social or business gatherings and are uncomfortable with silence. Their managers are saddled with the responsibility of making decisions and are seen as possessing high performance (Allen and David, 2002; McDonald, 2010). Organizational Structure They have a flat organizational structure and instructions are often very detailed. The managers are constantly giving feedbacks to the staff and customers. The organizational structures usually involve teams, they establish several teams or units that will carry out specific instructions and then report to the supervisor or manager. They encourage competition and reward high performance. Leaders or managers are often appointed from within the organization who has a good track record while few organizations employ managers from outside the organization. Human Resources System Employment is based on competence and not politics. Their communication is direct and they are keen for high performance. They are not gender bias but gives equal opportunity to both male and female. They ensure that he workforce is enthusiastic. Work Etiquettes of Europeans Greeting & Meeting When meeting someone, shake hands, make eye contact and say the proper welcome for the hour of day. Punctuality is very key except that for Southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal are special cases (Hervé et. al., 2013). Organizational Structure The organizational structure is similar to that of US. Appointment of managers is based on the person’s track record. The mangers are given the responsibility to make decisions after several deliberations. (Schneider et. al., 2010). Human Resources System They also work long hours but not as long as the US and employment is hinged on competence and ability while rewards are based on performance and quality output (Landry, 2006). Work Etiquettes of Asians Greetings & Meetings Punctuality is an absolute necessity on the whole business and social gatherings (McCormack, 1996; Li and Redding, 2013). More established individuals have higher status than more youthful, men predominantly higher social status than ladies and senior chiefs higher than junior heads. Title is highly vital when introducing people (Denoon et. al., 1996; Witt and Redding, 2009). Decision Making They encourage open discussion among members in a business meeting but they solely allow the manager or leader or someone of high status to make decisions that everyone would work by. Organizational Structure They do not have a flat organizational structure like the Americans and their management style is also different.  They exhibit higher work life balance which means that they adopt flexibility and control over their work life.  Due respect is highly given to those with high status. It is customary to send a supervisor of a similar position to meet with another partner of similar position. The emphasis of Title is vital is vital during business meeting (Denoon et. al., 1996). Human Resources Employment are based on competence and business is highly of political influence and connections. They rely primarily on family successor for the business rather than director or stakeholders. Their management or leadership style is that of a directive approach but in the 21st century, the young entrepreneurs are shifting from Directive Leadership Style to Empowering Leadership Style in order to build a more competitive leadership talent and formidable workforce (McCormack, 1996). Hofstede’s Cultural Dimension Theory Geert Hofstede developed a structure in 1980 to understand the cultural characteristic and differences around the world. The study will demonstrate the difference across each culture and how businesses are being done differently (Hofstede, 2001; Steers et. al., 2013). Hofstede recognized six categories that culture can be defined namely: Power Distance Index Collectivism vs. Individualism Uncertainty Avoidance Index Femininity vs. Masculinity Short-Term vs. Long-Term Orientation Restraint vs. Indulgence Power Distance This is the measurement of power relationships where people from different culture behave in environment where power is not distributed equally. It is a measure of how people in a lower power position accept and handle such imbalance among the individuals in society. Some cultures accept a higher degree of unequally distributed power than other cultures Individualism Individualism is focused on meeting personal goals and the rights and benefits of the individual. Collectivism focuses on the greater good of the team and often the decision will be based on what is best for the collective group instead of the individual. Masculinity Masculinity is a set of behaviors, roles characteristics that are often associated with courage, decisiveness and strength. Usually these are associated with men and some of these behaviors are more biologically influenced than socially constructed. Femininity are more often associate with trait nurturing behaviors, participation equality, environmental awareness, and personal satisfaction. Uncertainty Avoidance The Uncertainty Avoidance index measures the way cultures use rules, structures, and laws to make things predictable and less uncertain.  It is the extent to which individuals from a society or group relies on established procedures to avoid uncertainty. Nations with a low Uncertainty Avoidance keep lesser and more general set of laws and regulation while nations will high uncertainty avoidance will have specific law and regulation to minimize unknown and unusual circumstances Time Orientation This is the how a nation views the connection between the past, present and the future. It is the national preference toward past, present, or future thinking. Nation with high score on this measurement will keep long term view and interest while nations with low score is likely to have short term view with objective to make immediate returns and view long time cultural change with doubt. Indulgence Indulgence represents a society that allow free satisfaction of basic human gratification while restraint represents a society that suppresses the satisfaction of such necessities and control it through strict social practices. (Hofstede, 2001; Steers et. al., 2013). Cultural difference between China, United States and the United Kingdom Figure 1 : Cultural Comparison of China, United States and the United Kingdom Source: https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/china,the-uk,the-usa/ We will discuss the 6 different indexes of the Hofstede framework for China, US and UK Power Distance China has a Power Distance Index of 80. This means that the China society has a high tolerance of power imbalances among individuals. United Kingdom and United States has Power Distance Index of 35 and 40 respectively and this means that they are willing to interact with the authority and expect to be able to influence decision and policy in a less rigid system. Individualism With a low 20 index, China has a strong collectivism culture, where the huge majority of individuals act collectively for the good of the nation at the expense of the individual’s own benefits. Both UK and US has a high index of 89 and 91, which indicates that most individuals are only concern about their own interest and goals. The greater good of the nation is not of interest to the UK and US individual. Masculinity All 3 nations have medium score of 60s. This indicates that all 3 nations are masculine societies who focus on achievement and very driven by outcome. This is usually achieved at the expense of family line balance and personal rest and relaxation. This distinction between US and UK is that US show their masculinity early and in advance but UK pull surprises and shock you. Uncertainty Avoidance UK, US and China all have a low score in the range of 30s which means that these individual are alright with equivocalness and rely on less on regulation and policy. These individual will be ok with new plan and policy with new discovery of data. This is especially true of UK. For US, they love new ideas, inventions ranging from technology to food. Long Term Orientation China has a high score of 87 which means it will likely to value long term interest. It will not be so driven to drive short term benefit at the expense of the future generation. UK has a medium score which mean it balanced long term interest with short time goals. There must be intermediate achievements with a longer term goal in view. US individual are more short term focused. This can be observed in US listed companies with quarterly focused results.   Consequently, the way of life doesn't make most Americans down to earth, yet  they are practically-oriented and have the ""can-do"" mentality so focus on the short term interest. Indulgence With a low score of 24, China has high restraint as a society with strict social practices and control and to tend to skepticism and negativity. The UK and US has a score of 69 and 68 respectively. Being developed nations, there are significantly high amount of freedom for human gratification. There are higher quality and appreciation of life in these nations CREATING PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY Human beings are fundamentally creatures of relationship and no culture is inferior to another though there are seemingly diverse differences (Ford, 1994). In the 21st century which is advancing in technological and thus making the entire world a global village, it is pertinent that we appreciate and embrace diverse cultures (DuPraw & Axner, 1997). This will promote a safer environment for the world and business organization to live and work in. There are 5 key success factors that will make team great as per shown in Figure 2 below.  They are psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact. Figure 2: 5 Key success factors for a great team Diversity can be characterized as attributes and qualities that make individuals extraordinary. It is the aggregate combination of contrasts and similitudes such as individual and authoritative qualities, social foundation and nationality, values, convictions, encounters, inclinations, and practices, age, sex, sex character, incapacity, strict convictions and instruction. It likewise incorporates qualities like proficient abilities, area, and beneficial encounters (Mayer et. al., 1995; Robinson, 1996). Inclusion involves setting up a secured, cooperative climate that underpins common agreement and alternate points of view. It is actions and accepted practices that guarantee individuals feel respected and welcome. Inclusion means appreciating each individual equally and allowing access to the same resource and opportunities regardless of their handicaps and capability. It is significant for organizations to advance development and affect the primary concern. Inclusion implies recruiting a different, skilled labor force yet in addition connecting with researchers so they become dynamic supporters of the organization (Vêlez, 2012). Inclusion is accepted to give a scaffold between relational contrasts and an individual's capacity to contribute adequately to the association (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998). Thus, experts frequently see strategies and practices that advance consideration as having the capacity to incorporate different individuals into work groups and associations, accordingly assisting groups with working all the more adequately, and advancing positive individual and hierarchical results (Roberson, 2006; Matz-Costa et. al., 2012). Below are some ways which a psychological safe environment can be created: High Team Engagement Demonstrate high level of engagement by showing positive body language (example: leaning forward, face the speaker and making constant eye contact. Everyone in the team discussion should be present and focused on the discussion. There should also be active listening and questions should be asked with the intention to understand and learn from each other experience and point of view. There should also be confirmation and validation of mutual understanding and clear acknowledge of subject of agreement and differences. Proactive solicitation input and opinions should be encouraged at all time from the team. Foster a Positive and No Blame Culture Always be available and approachable to ad hoc one to one discussion and express appreciation for contribution and input. Jump in and nip any negative comments in the bud from one team member to another. Stop any side conversation or personal conflict among the team With a no blame culture, the team should be encouraged to be open and creative and encouraged to take calculated risk. The leaders should also lead by example by demonstrating risk-taking in their own work. We can also encourage the team to challenge each other perspective and push back in a constructive manner. Vulnerable Leadership A vulnerable leader is willing to share personal struggle, perspective and even failures at work with the team. Exhibiting vulnerability is key for open and non-judgmental communications and can build strong bond and trust within the team. With trust, the leader can set the stage for the rest of the team to open up and feel psychologically safe to express themselves within the team. Recognize individual uniqueness and avoid individual stereotypes Each individual should recognize everyone for their own uniqueness. Consider that you might be similarly different to others as they are to you. Everybody has its own preferences, inclinations, thoughts, and mentalities—making them unique. It's just when you understand your own uniqueness that you can start to comprehend and regard the uniqueness of others (McCoy et al., 1997). If individual uniqueness is embraced, there will be respect, understanding and empathy of each individual and this is one of the key to creating and enhancing psychological safety. A stereotype is simply the way you see others and it is frequently the reason for bias and segregation (McCoy et al., 1997). Generalizations are by and large educated and arise in the predominant culture's mentalities toward those from outside that prevailing group. People shold not be generalized but they should be treated as unique individuals ((Takaki, 1993; Kaye & Wolff, 1995). Stereotyping associates a characteristic with an individual or group and often lead to a bias and affective reaction and impression. Preformed superficial impression will adversely affect creating a safe, objective and neutral environment. As an expansion of not generalizing any gathering, any unique individual ought not be considered as far as gathering attributes. Individuals are people first, individuals from a gathering second, and thus, some random speculation basically may not have any significant bearing to a person (Kaye & Wolff, 1995). Diversity can be celebrated at the workplace by encouraging involvement, creating cultural celebration calendar and initiating the company’s unique traditions (McCoy et al., 1997). Advantages of Cultural Diversity We will discuss some of the advantages of having cultural diversity in the work place. Innovation is increased due to the fact that there is diverse mindset and participation. Places of work with cultural diversity are known to record better performance.                                                                                                                            Community connection is enhanced and it gives a sense of belonging by allowing the individual to participate in a multi- society.  It brings about attraction and retention where several people are given hands off fellowship despite their difference. It also helps to retain company’s employees. It brings about growth and profitability in a place of work and helps employees to focus on their strengths while it is complemented by others. Job is often created for diverse people and the minority workers and with that the organization would have a wider pool of talents, which bring about healthy competition and spurs creativity and innovations. Disadvantages of Cultural Diversity While not executed properly, there cultural diversity can breed mistrust among people of same cultural background. Healthy competition will be good for the work environment however if it is harmful to the organization if toxic or political competition is created. Decision making could be difficult and slower since everyone would want to have his way. In an disorganized and not well managed environment with poor leadership, channels of communication could be distorted and this could breed eye- service employees and impact productivity and contribution. Benefits of a team who feels psychologically safe Study that shows an increase in 12% of productivity and increased employee engagement if there is psychological safety (Gallup 2006). Hence, we are certain that psychological safety was the most important factor in determining a team’s success. The creation of psychological safety benefits organizations and teams in many different ways. Psychological safety in team has a direct effect on learning behavior, which in turn affects team performance (Edmondson, 1999). A team who feel psychologically safe will be more open to learn and take moderate risk – taking, which includes speaking your mind, creativity and sticking out your neck out. It boosts employee engagement and improving team innovation. When a work environment has undeniable degrees of mental security, representatives are bound to remain in their positions instead of search for new jobs. A work environment with undeniable degrees of mental security can give representatives a better perspective and, likewise, better actual wellbeing. A harmful workplace causes them to feel exhausted which can progressively diminish their wellbeing. All things considered, they'll prescribe their working environment to companions who are searching for business. A group works best when everybody is conveying and teaming up appropriately. A work environment that has undeniable degrees of mental safety will energize more collaboration, correspondence and thought sharing for advancement (Delimonza 2017). Employees who have a sense of security in their work environments have higher performance and better efficiency when compared with representatives in harmful work environments (Edmondson, 1996; Nembhard, & Edmondson, 2006). Other benefits will also include improved correspondence, sharing of information, positive mentalities and levels of commitment and with that task execution, creativity and development is included. Due to the trust environment, there will be more openness to critical thinking and taking in and gaining from errors and mistakes. Conclusion The psychological safety cannot be exhaustive in a rapidly technologically driven world. Every individual and culture is uniquely different, gifted and such should be embraced and everyone should be held in respect and good high esteem. Psychological safety encourages inclusion in the midst of cultural diversity. Thus, ensuring that individuals that are termed “different” are given warm hands of acceptance which in turn results in a peaceful, prosperous and productive workplace. A workplace that has cultural diversity is at an advantage over others and such competitive advantage can be exploited towards achieving business objectives and higher performance. In a cultural diverse work place, there would be a pool of creative and talented workers whose weaknesses would be complemented by the strengths of others and this would be providing a cutting edge for the organization profitability and optimum performance. Leaders are instrumental to creating psychological safety. To do this, they must set clear goals that will meet the organization strategic goal. There must be consistent and clear communication to the team about these goals, especially when these goals are being changed to address new market or business direct. In the current globalized workplace, leader can leverage on the Hofstede’s 6 cultural dimension framework to help them select the correct approach in engage the culturally diverse work place. It is globally acknowledged by top organizations and senior thought leadership that psychological safety is the most important attribute to a high performance team.  To create psychological safety with the team, demanding goals and direction must be driven with the need of employing fear or power that may stifles trust and openness. The team must be allowed the room for learning and innovation, through an inclusive and diverse work environment. This creates a psychological safe atmosphere and structure without rigidity and encourage synergies, spontaneity and creativity, which allows people to feel safe taking risks, and yet without complacency, maintaining the competitive edge within the team.

Transformational Leadership and its Impact on Sales Performance Introduction Good leadership acts as the backbone of any organization's prosperity. The kind of leadership employed by an organization will facilitate how the organization's future will be attained. By good interpersonal relations and enable effective individuals to succeed at a higher level. Leaders must have leadership qualities because it is an important feature of management that helps to optimize productivity and accomplish organizational objectives. Therefore, governance is critical to the performance of every organization, and no establishment can function effectively in the exclusion of successful leadership. An organization is formed to pursue specific goals by a social group that becomes critical to monitor this person emotionally. The main objective of this paper aims explore the different kind of leaderships and how they impact organizations with emphasis on sales performance. With the deeper understanding of the different leaderships and motivation style, our goals will be to share how the pandemic has impact sales organization across the world and the approach a transformation sales leader can take to lead a high performance team in the post pandemic world. Transformational Leadership and its Impact on Sales Performance Work on transformative leadership has increased, with enthusiasm becoming the most significant construct. Max Weber is the social psychologist who coined the word likability to characterize a type of social authority, claiming that transformational leaders gain power from their actions and personality instead of hierarchical status, laws, or practice. Businesses and organizations are governed by leaders who have acquired skills from all various fields, which help them carry on with everyday activities. For the most organization to succeed in their daily activities, the top management needs to have specific leadership skills. One of the common kind of leadership which is present in our organization is transformational leadership. This kind of leadership is where the leaders are characterized by inspiration toward the workers to achieve more in the organization where they work for. Also, the administration is normally involved in encouraging one another. Transformational leadership has a great influence by setting the pace by defining a better example right from the executive level through the subordinate workers. Besides, culture stated and exercised by top leaders make the employees be part of the organization. At all times, transformational leadership has influenced the better performance of the organization. (White, 2018) Additionally, transformational leaders have the responsibility to enthuse their human resources while maintaining their leadership skills of not micromanaging the trust of their employees at all costs. Such leaders will have to take control of the authority each time they are making decisions. Furthermore, it is a kind of leadership that allows employees to have a free environment whereby they can develop new skills and build confidence repeatedly until they are in better positions in their job posts. Through the right procedure, transformational leaders are willing to change the entire mindsets of the company in the future, and the employees will be able to solve issues and make decisions that are most preferable by many. Employees on the leadership track will also be prepared to become transformational leaders themselves through mentorship and training. Transformational leadership involves using your abilities to foster leadership potential in others. As per Figure 1 below, there are four types of leadership, known as the four I's, that one is required to become a transformational leader (Breaux, 2021). Figure 1 : Psychological Foundations of Leadership - Mary Elizabeth Janzen, 2018 Idealized Influence Consequently, just like in another mode of leadership in transactional leadership, idealized influenced governance is characterized by finding highly respected leaders across the board in the organization by all of their team members due to the pattern they set for others. Furthermore, these kinds of leaders provide a very strong vision and a sense of belonging that inspire people to buy into the different strategic plans and helps everyone to accomplish their respective objectives. As a result, these people serve as effective leadership skills, and their subordinates mimic or mimic them as they strive to become leaders by following in their footsteps. Transformational leaders act as role models for their fans. Since adherents admire and admire the leader, they copy them and contextualize their values. Inspirational Motivation Leaders who use Inspirational Motivation in transformational leadership styles usually have two main goals in his/her mind, which must be achieved to serve the purposes. Firstly, the leader must be clear about his/her vision in the organization. Secondly, the same leader must be able to rapid his or her vision in a manner that excites and drives higher performance levels. To encourage and recognize others as leaders, one must first understand how to tap into the aspirations of teamwork. These types of leaders must exhibit the common characteristics are courage and recognizing that individuals want to do their work well. Successful leaders know that this is a natural need. Encouragement and demonstration of confidence in a person's talents contribute to his or her profession, often having an important influence. Transformational leaders simplified their vision the ease of communication to their teams. These leaders will also use inspirational motivation to instill in their members the same drive and determination to succeed. (Ray, 2021) Individualized Consideration According to transformational leadership, Individualized consideration may be considered to the degree of how much leaders tend to show attention to all of his/her followers depending on the needs one has. Most of the time, they have the responsibility to assume the coach's duty to the workers. Leaders need to listen to the employees' concerns. Some of the behaviors which entail this kind of transformational leadership may include deliberating and commiserating with the needs of discrete workforces. Additionally, making interactive influences with workers is another character of individualized consideration in transformational governance. Also, it involves offering support and encouragement to individual followers. In order to foster supportive relationships, transformational leaders keep lines of communication open so that followers feel free to share ideas and so that leaders can offer immediate recognition of the unique contributions of each follower. At all times, one must show genuine compassion with his/her followers to achieve a common goal. Eventually, encouraging professionalism, development, and personal growth of employees reached. Intellectual Stimulation Intellectual stimulation is one of the elements of transformational leadership, which is entirely characterized by a leader who is willing and motivated to encourage, innovate, and develop new kinds of creativity within an organization. Besides, the aspect of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. More so, this kind of leadership is more in the imagination world since employees are arousing and induced to follow their leaders. This allows them to simulate the abilities they can observe from their leaders. Most of the time, they have ended up having more skills in solving problems intellectually. Most people are more likely to be attracted by influential leaders who stimulate their curiosity, defy them at all times so that they can be able to think and have a chance to learn (Breaux, 2021). Therefore, the intellectual stimulation mode of leadership will inspire honesty to new, stirring ideas and options. These are some of the ingredients that are essential for the team and success of an organization. (Breaux, 2021) The Most Important Aspects of Transformational Leadership Not all leaders are considered equivalent. Even though some people are only interested in guaranteeing that everyone else beneath them obeys simple laws and achieves predetermined objectives, some choose to motivate as they lead. Many who are concerned with inspiring people to be the best they can be rather than maintaining guidelines are pursued the title transformational leadership. Thus, for one to be a transformational leader, he/she should have the following principles. Perception Formation Transformational executives must be more interested in creating some entire look for both the corporation and individuals more than focusing on the time-consuming task of tracking workers' everyday activities. Although the leader would determine that all those under their command obey the rules he/she establishes, this should not be his/her top consideration. Buy-In from Followers Effective leaders must rely on persuading those over them to believe in the leadership styles they use. By demonstrating to subordinates how the leadership style ones using. This will maximize the probability that others under his command are completely committed to the initiative in action rather than merely going through because they don't believe they have any alternatives. Trailblazer Direction Transformational leaders give transparent and comfortable direction to everybody who reports to them. Leaders who may not follow the transformational leadership paradigm, on the other hand, will effectively be penalty providers, carrying out draconian penalties to workers before stating clearly what they're doing during the first instance. This technique could be very difficult for workers who want to satisfy and will seek the leadership's direction if they had it. Transformational Leadership's Advantages and Difficulties Attributes are extensively studied and successfully affect subordinates on all stages. For instance, good leaders understand and reinforce the desires and ideals of their affiliates. On the other hand, bad governance may have several elements that dwell on the surface rather than the required level of commitment and approach leadership as a characteristic attribute but rather developed comportment; they do have the ability to abuse influence. Therefore, since leadership style encompasses so many facets of teamwork, there are no clear steps for management. It is an iterative method to become a successful transformational leader. This implies that a concerted effort is needed to follow a transformative leadership look. Transformational vs Transactional Leadership In every organization, the presence of high-performing leaders is a key thing that has to do with the kind of inspiration that will take place in an organization. Most of the worker's performance is more likely to rely on how well their leaders have the skills, passion, and leading mode. As a result, organizations have introduced various kinds of Leadership so that they suit the needs of the organization and the well-being of the employees. The existence of both transformational and translational leaders in the current business world is important to ensure prosperity and the ongoing dynamics. Figure 2 : Transformational vs Transactional Leadership - Sarah Murdoch 2021 As per Figure 2 above, most transactional leaders in an organization will make sure that all the duties assigned to the workers are done according to the standards and policies of the organization. On the other hand, transformational leaders will be willing to work with employees who keep on inspiring, instilling values that will bring out the best in them for the organization and a personal level. Therefore, the literal difference between the two leadership methods is that transactional governance is more concerned with the way tasks are completed perfectly. In contrast, transformational Leadership is structured to incorporate harmonization, communication, and collaboration through the motivation of employees. Furthermore, Transformational leadership models are critical to a small company's business successful implementation. Transactional leaders navigate all of the complexities that work together to create a good competitive edge while maintaining staff active on its front line. Consecutively, in most medium-sized companies, transformational personalities with leaders are at the helm set lofty expectations and will accomplish exponential growth, compelled by a leader's ambition and team-building abilities. However, transactional leaders have a unique edge in that they can resolve minor organizational information easily. Besides, transactional Leadership is a form of governance that uses incentives and penalties to motivate employees while strengthening the current organizational culture in a hierarchical setting. On the contrary, transformational leaders use optimism and passion to motivate employees. The followers' principles, beliefs, morality, and needs are prioritized. Moreover, changing the current corporate ethos on a visionary basis and in a comprehensive manner. (Surbhi, 2019) Transactional Leader's Qualities Transactional leaders monitor and manage the autocratic model of governance, which ensures they will not make adjustments or get interested if anything goes as planned. Besides, negative exclusions, such as missed revenue expectations or output efficiency targets, are dealt with immediately. This leadership style can be seen in varying extents of experience and varies according to priorities and purpose. Furthermore, the aspect of contingency's gains and incentives comes up often in debates of organizational commitment. Jobs understand that their compensation is dependent on them performing the assignments that have been delegated to them. As a result, the leader must establish reasonable requirements that the employee understands. In most cases, the leaders will be on the move to substitute the requirements of a leader for the needs of an adherent and accentuate growth in setting goals, directing them, and striving to control outcomes. For instance, military, large organizations’ Leadership tend to employ such kind of Leadership. (Silva & Mendis, 2017). Characteristics of a Transformational Leader Most transformational leaders are characterized by the four I's of Leadership and have high ambitions for their workers. For instance, they can do their best by encouraging, motivating, and teaching workers to succeed beyond and above their normal standards. Therefore, they are Idealized influencers and ready to share and exhibit essential standards and conviction. Also, they have inspirational motivation, which enables workers to convey self-assurance and sagacity of tenacity. Consequently, they tend to be more individualized and considerate, having well-connected feelings and needs toward other people. Lastly, they got intellectual stimulation whereby they give workers chances to learn and develop innovative ideas within an organization. (Kouni, & Panta, 2018) Extrinsic Motivation vs Intrinsic Motivation To be motivated is to feel compelled to take action. A motivated team is a productive team. Identifying internal and external motivators helps increase productivity, feelings of fulfillment, and growth and advancement in career. When it comes to what drives us, we all have different motivations that are either intrinsic or extrinsic, which some of them are shown in Figure 3. We will go further into greater details of both Extrinsic motivation vs Intrinsic motivation. Figure 3 : Extrinsic Motivation vs Intrinsic Motivation - Jurgita J 2021 Extrinsic motivation refers to individuals' actions to perform activities and acquire new skills when motivated by external incentives or the avoidance of punishment. In this situation, you indulge in acts not because you like it or find it attractive or rewarding, but because you want to get something in exchange or escape something negative. Extrinsic rewards are either tangible (e.g. a fancy car, popularity, money) or psychological (commendation or lack of critic). Employers find it easy to encourage and promote extrinsic motivators. However, this motivation does not last for long. Employers can encourage extrinsic motivation by allowing supervisors who supervise workers to reward them with pay raises, time off, promotions, benefits, and other tokens of appreciation (Kuvaas et al., 2017) Upper management should contemplate incentive structure. they should decide what can be given to staff, and what the organization can afford, or get innovative and come up with budget-friendly ideas such as pats on the back and words of gratitude, employee of the Month recognition, pay increases, and promotions to recognize a job well done. Appreciation days can be held every year, and bonuses at the end of the year. Extrinsic motivation should have expectancy, instrumentality and valence, to successfully motivate employees. To make an awarded work, workers must first assume that putting in more effort would result in better results. Second, employees must believe that improved performance will be heard and rewarded, and third, employees must genuinely want the promised incentive (Makki & Abid, 2017) Extrinsic motivation Extrinsic motivation has its challenges. It's unclear if working longer hours or focusing more intensely would improve results. It's not as easy as ""harder work equals more efficiency"" in a knowledge-based economy. If your work is highly interdependent and others aren't putting in the same effort, your results will remain unchanged. The majority of staff do not believe that improved output would be acknowledged. And, if it does, it takes too long. Many studies indicate a negative relationship between incentive pay and employee success or that workers have a strong desire for other types of compensation. Extrinsic motivation is challenging to leverage appropriately. As more leaders have realized this, the discussion has turned to properly harnessing intrinsic motivation to get people to do their best work. Intrinsic motivation Intrinsic motivation is defined as the act of doing something for no apparent external reward. When you feel motivated or energized to complete a mission because it is personally satisfying, you have intrinsic motivation. It is doing the task because of an internal drive rather than an external incentive or pressure. For intrinsic motivation, the incentive is the action itself. Intrinsic motivators can be tricky to work with: The sort of internal motivation that propels one employee may have no bearing on her coworker. Examples of inherent motivators in the workplace are; the need to finish a difficult task to learn and improve new skills, the need to prove to yourself, your colleagues, and your boss that you can handle complex projects. also, the various triggers to help you get ahead, such as the desire to feel important and desired, or the anticipation of a promotion and the desire to do your best simply because you love your work or want to support the business (Makki & Abid, 2017) Curiosity fuel people's desire to explore and learn solely for the sake of learning and mastering. Being challenged encourages people to perform at their best all of the time while remaining committed to achieving realistic goals. People have an inherent desire to be rewarded, so happiness becomes a reward in and of itself when their efforts are noticed and appreciated by others. Cooperation with others fills the need to be a part of something bigger. Since collaboration entails assisting others and working together for a common purpose, it also provides a sense of fulfilment. Cooperation with others fills the need to be a part of something bigger. Since collaboration entails assisting others and working together for a common purpose, it also provides a sense of fulfilment. To practice better intrinsic motivation, one needs to identify enjoyable aspects of the job and other hobbies or find ways to make tasks more enjoyable. Focus on your worth, the intent of a mission, and how it benefits others to find meaning. Set attainable goals that concentrate on mastering an ability rather than external gains to keep yourself challenged and help those in need. Instead of focusing on winning, enter a competition and focusing on the camaraderie and how well you do. Visualize a time when you felt proud and accomplished before beginning a mission, and reflect on those emotions while you strive to complete the task (Kuvaas et al., 2017) The two types should be used together in the workplace to achieve optimum results. However, extrinsic incentives should be used sparingly due to the over justification effect. When used inappropriately or too often, extrinsic incentives may detract from intrinsic motivation. If you reward an activity that was already intrinsically rewarding, the incentives could lose their value. Extrinsic reinforcement is often perceived as bullying by certain people. In conclusion, extrinsic motivation differs from intrinsic motivation in that extrinsic motivation is more about financial rewards, status, and recognition. In contrast, intrinsic motivation is more about personal development, a sense of obligation, and the glory of intent. There should be a balance of both types of incentives to keep all employees inspired to provide results. Leadership Impact on Sales Performance Behavior and Citizenship Salesperson performance is the ability to achieve sales targets individually or collectively. Sales performance can be evaluated through sales income, customer retention rate or set of new accounts. Organizational citizenship behavior is described as human behavior that involves voluntary action and mutual help without the expectation of remuneration or formal rewards. They are habits that sales leaders relate to sales productivity. Such behaviors include planning, making service calls, prospecting activities, preparing presentations and putting up promotional displays. Leadership skills and techniques have been proven to have a direct impact on sales performance behavior and organizational citizenship. Every sector and company have experienced unprecedented economic conditions. The majority of sales teams are confronted with situations they have never seen before. New company conversations are more difficult than ever before. Targets remain large, and redundancies have resulted in fewer people actually doing the job. The culture of a traditional sales team is numbers-driven, competitive, and achievement-oriented. Teams are constantly under pressure to perform at their best in order to achieve hourly and regular objectives. When you add in the effects of the financial crisis, it's easy to see why people are solely focused on short-term outcomes and their own success rather than the teams. Sales leaders and executives are still under duress. They are noticeable, vulnerable, and responsible for the results of their teams. Rather than encouraging individuals to make their own choices, they opt for a quick fix by telling people precisely what to do, which leads to mistakes and poor decisions. This type of behavior encourages unhealthy rivalry among teammates. Leader’s ability to develop and communicate a captivating vision determines sales performance. Employees will be able to relate to a clear and concrete vision on an emotional level. It is critical to an organization's survival plan in these difficult economic times. Leader’s ability to develop and communicate a captivating vision determines sales performance. Employees will be able to relate to a clear and concrete vision on an emotional level. It is critical to an organization's survival plan in these difficult economic times. An example will be Frank Pacetta, Executive Vice President of Xerox who took over Cleveland district when it was in disarray. He is able to motivate, provide a clear vision to his team and turn around failing operations. He thrived when conditions were unfavorable, using unconventional tactics to bring in more sales and turning the them into high performance team People must understand what is expected of them and how their actions will lead to the vision's realization. This will ensure their dedication and participation through gaining an awareness that, while short-term goals are essential, they must also focus on the future, their growth, long-term consumer relationships, and creativity in a sales environment. Walmart announced a $2.0 billion consolidated net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, which ended on January 31, 2021. However, operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion, with overall sales of $152.1 billion. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, operating income increased by 3.1 percent year over year (YOY), while overall revenue increased by 8.6% percent as per Figure 4. The net loss in the fourth quarter was partially due to a $1.4 billion deduction for income taxes, as well as a $1 billion. This performance is associated with poor management and Covid 19. Figure 4 : Walmart Q2Q revenue – Walmart filing To keep employees focused on achieving high results, sales leaders must challenge them. Although sales teams are known to be difficult, leaders should encourage employees to collaborate more and share best practices and lessons learned on a regular basis. Individuals may be challenged by being encouraged to make their own choices and find solutions to their own problems rather than relying on their leader or boss. Support is the third main leadership action, which is often in short supply among competitive sales teams. Sales leaders who focus on ensuring that the service they provide is tailored to the needs of each customer provoke higher sales performance. They must comprehend how different individuals are affected by the pressurized climate. Leaders must provide adequate assistance to salespeople under all conditions. Apples drop in sales and profitability in 2018 have been attributed to poor leadership. Apple currently predicts sales of $84 billion (£66 billion) with a gross profit margin of 38%, down from $89 billion to $93 billion previously. Apple made US$88.3 billion in the same period last year, with a gross margin of 42 percent. Many of Apple's other companies will be ""constrained"" because of the App Store and iTunes, which accounted for 14% of sales in fiscal 2018. This includes Macs, iPads, Watches, and, of course, iPhones, which accounted for 62.7 percent of overall Apple sales in 2018, up from 63.4 percent in 2016.Apple have reported a gradual increase in revenue since 2013. The Company had experienced a decrease in growth in 1990 after Steve Jobs’ resignation as CEO. Jobs rejoined the company in 2001 and launched iPod and iTunes bringing in more revenue. The company’s’ revenue increased by $14.2 billion between 2019 and 2020 despite the current Covid 19 pandemic. The graph below shows revenue movements for apple between 2013 and 2020 Figure 5 : Apple 2013 to 2020 Annual Revenue – Company Filing Motivational and developmental feedback is also important. People like to know what they've done well and what they can do better. Rewarding effort and hard work is a form of motivation that has worked effectively on many organizations.  Both are essential for peak efficiency. A feedback-hungry climate must be fostered by the sales leader. Support can take many different forms, ranging from preparation and development to one-on-one success coaching. As an example, Jim Jensen, CEO of Grantree Furniture Rental Company and Thousand Trails, Inc brought great success through coaching and supporting of his sale team. He allowed new sales recruits to observe him in the field, feedback on their weakness and found solutions for them. Organization citizenship and behaviors are highly valued by leaders because they improve personal productivity, unit performance, ability to recruit the best workers, and ability to adapt to a changing environment.  For example, a sales leader's personal productivity can increase when salespeople support each other with work related problems. It enables the leader to devote more time to more productive activities such as strategic planning, enhancing business processes, and safeguarding valuable resources. They are diligent because they free up a leader's time, encourage the leader to assign more responsibility to them, and need less supervision. Furthermore, it is a display of sportsmanship, since a leader's time isn't wasted on minor grievances. This system of leadership has been broadly used by Amazon for sustainable growth. Leaders must take measures to avoid causing difficulties for coworkers, as this helps the leader to avoid the pit of “crisis” management, and make positive recommendations for enhancing unit efficiency to the degree that they are eventually implemented. Organization behaviors are indicators of attitudes that contribute to the company in other ways. For instance, good citizenship, a positive attitude, maintaining good relationships with coworkers, and cooperating lead to overall organization performance. For example, Walmart have been able to maintain steady sales over the years through intensive training and development programs for their salesforce (Chinomona & Mofokeng, 2017) Mary Kay created a large organization - Mary Kay Cosmetics with over 200,000 sales people and sales managers. She achieved over US$300 million sales in a month by inspiring the team through company through clear visions and transformational sales leadership Covid 19 have significantly impact the firm’s ability to repay loan balances as indicated by the Figure 6 below. As per Figure 6, we can see large organizations have deeper pockets and they not need to take too much loans. Hence they are not too impacted in their ability to pay loans. We can see the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Agriculture, Manufacturing and the Services industries are the most hard hit in their ability to service their loan. They maybe capital intensive and as SMEs, they may not have the necessary funding and have to rely heavily on bank loan Figure 6 : Firm’s ability to pay loans – S&P Global Intelligence In conclusion, people are an organization's most valuable asset, and as frontline salespeople continue to be the center of attention when it comes to meeting financial goals, leaders must step up to the challenge and assist them. Organizations cannot predict the entire work scope needed for target achievement except for the contractually defined minimum job descriptions, so organization citizenship behaviour is an essential component of employee productivity. Leaders should spend twice as much time on internal work as they do on coaching, and sellers should spend less than a third of their time selling. In this manner, teams will be able to implement the customer experience strategy quickly and efficiently with the help of preparation, coaching, content, and communication. Sales Leadership and Prospecting in a COVID 19 World Covid-19 has brought out a wide range of severe challenges for sales. Such challenges call for a structured  framework to assist sales leaders in understanding and responding to Covid-19. It is important to consider social and technical variables when studying organization change. The Covid-19 shocks have impacted different variables that also affect other sales variables. This paper discusses the structural, social and technological problems brought by Covid-19, their impact on sales and how leaders are responding to them. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the sales team is dealing with an increased number of health problems such as stress and anxiety. These problems have effected their ability and inclination to perform current tasks as well as gain new knowledge and skills. Sales leaders have reacted by reassuring, increasing accommodations, offering daily reports, and being more patient with the salesforce. Sales leaders have also responded by encouraging salespeople to mind their health by washing their hands frequently, exercising, meditating, and limiting their caffeine and alcohol intake on a regular basis. Some organizations have reduced the number of working hours for sales people. Additionally, some organizations are temporarily and permanently laying off sales workers to minimize costs while others are hiring new talent from the laid off workers of competitors (Dean, (2020). As an example, due to the sharp drop in passenger traffic, US airlines have requested more than $50 billion in federal assistance. According to IATA, airlines could lose 11-19 percent of global passenger revenues by the end of the year. Figure 7 below illustrates lay off of workers both permanently and temporarily. It is observed that large organizations and services industry are significantly laying off huge amount of workers temporarily. This is not surprise as organization move to reduce cost amidst the sharp decline in revenue and demand. Figure 7 : Human resource layoff across different sectors The Covid-19 pandemic is causing shifts in the pace and manner in which sales tasks are completed. Many salespeople are executing their tasks over digital channels. Due to social distancing and remote working spurred by the internet, digital networks have grown in popularity. Email receipt and sending, social media use, virtual selling videoconferencing are forms of digital communication being relied on. The changes in tasks have influenced the relevance of certain skills and abilities. Leaders are forced to modify their training program to include training on the use digital technologies. Such training is done through videos. Performing new tasks is equipping them with new relevant skills. Salespeople are also providing services such as updating customers on the status of their orders and changes in organization operations, altering product deliveries to meet new customer specifications, addressing redirected queries from other organization centers and explaining emerging challenges in logistics. Leaders are rearranging production tasks such as performing tasks planned in the future in order to optimize productivity. They are also altering working schedules to accommodate changes in the education calendar and performing previously deprioritized tasks (Hartmann & Lussier (2020). Sales leaders and their teams have had to alter customer preferences. This has brought changes to products receiving more sales effort, valuable products and value propositions. For instance, more effort has been put in identifying and managing customer risk, and concentrating on products with increasing demand and more prospective customers. For example, there is an increase in demand for medical equipment and supplies, need for privacy and security of information and a shift to low cost purchases to minimize expenses.  The success of this changes is highly dependent on the task force skills and abilities. Sales leaders are also having difficulty assessing sales force operations and determining who can receive additional assistance. Sales leaders depend on technology to assess the habits and needs of their teams, because it’s impossible to rely on personal observation and conversation. Customer management systems are used to track and assist salespersons and customers. Salespeople can also provide feedback regarding changes taking place. For instance, salespeople can forward feedback received from customers, to their leaders through virtual platforms (Hartmann & Lussier (2020). This has led to a rise in business for technological companies. Alibaba's Ding Talk, Byte Dance’s Lark, and Ten cent’s WeChat Function are examples of apps from other parts of the world that help people all over the world work from home. These app rankings were compiled by Sensor Tower, and all three apps saw a year-over-year increase in downloads from January to February 2020, namely, Lark (6085 percent), Ding Talk (1446 percent), and WeChat Work (572%). Ding Talk, an Alibaba-developed app, was released in 2020. Collaborative solutions such as slack and zoom have reported record breaking growth figures. Microsoft have recorded a monthly growth figure of 775% in March 2020 in Italy after the stay at home order. The Microsoft virtual company recorded a spike of 300%. The entertainment industry has also experienced a huge spike from individuals lock down. Netflix apps downloads increased by 60% in Italy,30% in Spain and 9% in US. Amazon prime video have also increased usage. Video games have also increased in popularity. The Verizon video game recorded a 75% increase in usage after one week of lock down. Digital game purchases increased by 11% The COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant structural changes. Quotas, workload goals and tasks, and incentives such as travel developed prior to the pandemic are often no longer valid in the current situation. This is frequently due to the fact that many of the aforementioned human and technological changes limit the performance, productivity, and effectiveness of the organization. Some prospective and current customers' availability, responsiveness, tastes, and buying appetite are being influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, some sales leaders and companies are revising targets, quotas, workload requirements and tasks, predictions, and benefits in response to concerns about retaining morale and improving salesperson wellbeing (Dean, (2020). According to UCTAD, Covid 19 has resulted in mixed fortunes for different internet media service companies and ecommerce companies. A few ecommerce companies like Shopify, Amazon, Alibaba and Zoom (not in the chart below) record 40% to near 100% increase in revenue in a Covid hit economy, other internet service companies, relating to travel and lodging recorded a decline in revenue. Uber recorded a 10.9% decrease, Expedia -65.9%, Booking holdings -63% and Airbnb -37% as illustrated in the Figure 8 below. Figure 8 : Revenue comparison for online / ecommerce companies During the crisis, there have been rethinking about what sales success is and entails. Of course, such a move will have an impact on the job and human component, causing salespeople to calibrate their behaviors, experience and abilities to what is recognized resulting in both expected and unintended adjustments. In addition, sales leaders are emphasizing the development and implementation of new processes to ensure that documentation and details that would otherwise be shared physically and face-to-face are now exchanged digitally. Companies are now under growing pressure to develop continuity of operations plans in the event that one or more senior executives or sales leaders are unable to fulfill their responsibilities (Hartmann & Lussier (2020). In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic have created challenges for salespeople forcing organizational leaders to come up with new ways of coping to maintain sales. The pandemic has caused remote working, important meetings have been postponed, and travel restrictions across borders put in place, mental health issues. This have led to shortages of inventory, breakdown of supply chain and logistics issues. The management have turned to technology in an attempt to resolve some of these problems. Conclusion In summary, in the same organization, all forms of leadership styles can be required to neutralize one another and help accomplish developmental goals. Transactional leaders ensure that the team works seamlessly and delivers results now, while leadership styles encourage creativity and think forward. This kind of Leadership heavily affects the performance of the organization. Executive management needs to ensure all mode of Leadership is incorporated with the entire organization and distributed evenly to ensure that a balance emerges within the organization. Considering the importance of all sales personnel in an organization, organizations ought to value the leadership models in sales marketing sections to achieve the intended business objectives.  During extreme conditions such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, sales may go down. Still, the resilience of the leaders and innovation will keep the organization moving forward, and finally, the entire objectives of the organization will be achieved.

15,How are Cryptocurrencies Shaping the Future of the Financial Market?,business," Abstract In recent years, the world has been introduced to digital currencies, cryptocurrency. Due to the growth of technology globally, cryptocurrency growth has skyrocketed to a higher height beyond the standard banking system we all know about. One fundamental and crucial reason for the development of cryptocurrency is the acceptance and adoption of digital currency in most significant corporations in their transactions. Therefore, I will be discussing the evolution of cryptocurrencies, different kinds of cryptocurrencies. I will explore the most common form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, among other upcoming digital currencies, has been in use, especially in the United States America. Furthermore, I will describe in depth about the block chain technology, crypto currency as a commodity, traditional banking, various demerits and benefits of using the crypto as a means of money exchange. Finally, the paper will check on the risks posed by the cryptocurrency developments. Keywords: anonymity, block chain, crypto, commodity, decentralized finance, digital currency, international payment, international business, pyramid, traditional banks, trading How are Cryptocurrencies Shaping the Future of the Financial Market? Introduction Cryptocurrency has been defined as a digital currency that can be utilized to purchase goods and services over the network and internet. The entire phenomenon makes use of an online ledger that is designed to have very firm cryptography mechanisms that ensure safety and protected business transactions over the internet. Furthermore, cryptocurrency security has increased the confidence among people compared to the traditional methods where one had to carry visa cards and a considerable amount of money in their pockets, putting them at more risk of being robbed. Also, cryptocurrency has been making free from centralized banking systems to decentralized ones making it accessed through many more channels, which are even safer than the centralized banking systems. The world economy and money market are currently forecasting the power of cryptocurrencies, which is universal across all countries. Thus, financial institutions need to reconsider endorsing cryptocurrencies in their transactions to bring the world's required changes about money. (KUMAR, 2020) The evolution of cryptocurrency has followed a well-defined route since the introduction in 2009. According to the world economic data, cryptocurrency has already built a smooth ecosystem that allows more and more forms of crypto to be introduced in the world's future finances. For instance, in the year 2017, more than 1000 different cryptocurrencies were listed in the world financial market, which was already participating in the daily transactions. The number has risen; we have more than 5000 other cryptocurrencies that are operational. Besides, the transactions which take place over the crypto network, especially Bitcoin, have been on the rise with about 60 percent each year for the last five years. Due to its nature, infographic keeps on unpacking across the world of cryptocurrencies, encouraging the stakeholders among other key players across the finance sector to continue growing its significance to the world. (Neufeld, 2020) Furthermore, various key players have been involved in the development and advocacy of cryptocurrency around the world. To begin with, the sector has been at the forefront to advocate and structure cryptocurrency. To give an illustration, Institutional investors such as Harvard Endowment Fund and Crypto Hedge Funds are found within the world of cryptocurrency. According to Neufeld (2020), the technology giants such as IBM and Microsoft Corporation are participating in transactions that are channeled through crypto. Moreover, in the private sector, financial institutions and banks are now taking part in digital currency. Surprisingly, some of the countries are also involved in cryptocurrency. For instance, Venezuela is on the list which is involved in crypto businesses. Other central banks from China and Saudi Arabia have also invested in digital currency to enhance their economies. Overview of current block chain technology Block chain is a promising and revolutionary technology since it has been helping in reduction and risks, eliminates fraud and brings transparency in a measurable way for millions of users. For cryptocurrency to function according to its cryptographic mechanism, it has an underlying technology that uses block chain technology. Block chain technology can be defined as is a configuration that can store financial transaction records from the public in various databases via a network that is interconnected in a peer-to-peer manner. The fascinating fact about block chain is that it resembles the typical kind of database. It stores data in blocks that are then chained together, forming a long chain of data arranged in chronological order. Once one block reaches its maximum, it is immediately connected to the previous block, and a new block is added until it is fully occupied. In cryptocurrency, block chain technology is used to decentralize ledger records so that no single-use has control over the information. (CONWAY, 2020) Block chain is the backbone of cryptography as it allows transaction records to be entered in a very secure and memorable way. For instance, all the information recorded in the decentralized blocks is exclusively immutable in the manner that it cannot be undone once registered. For example, once a Bitcoin transaction has been submitted, it is visible to every user in the block chain, and the transaction history is permanent. Due to this feature, block chain is a way to store information transparently. Furthermore, the one benefit block chain offers is the security. It cannot be altered thus, keeping the blocks secure. Another attribute of block chain is that it is on away kind of information transactions. Currently, several block chain-based projects wish to implement block chain to help society other than just recording transactions.  (CONWAY, 2020) Due to its popularity and effectiveness, this technology was initially developed for financial transactions only, but block chain can be used in various fields. For instance, the healthcare sector is in the process of adopting block chain technology that will enhance the adequate storage of patient records in a safer manner (Kuo et al., 2019). However, block chain technology, just like other kinds of upcoming inventions, especially in the financial market, is faced with security concerns such as scalability. For instance, the number of transactions on a single block of data may have overwhelming information, which may hinder the entire block chain’s proper function in a given data center. Although, this problem can be solved in two primary methods. Storage optimization of block chain can be used to eradicate the storage issue associated with the size of the block chain. In the future, block chain technology may be redesigned to have a crucial block for the ledger and a micro block to store transaction records only. (Zheng et al., 2017) Furthermore, cryptocurrency is faced with privacy leaks due to the underlying block chain technology of transparency. Once a miner has initiated a transaction with another miner, the block chain private and public keys can only have an only certain level of privacy. To both parties, their actual balances will be visible to everyone, which from the recent research poses some privacy issues because this can be used to get other crucial information about the client involved in cryptocurrency transactions. However, even with these threats on the block chain and cryptocurrency clients, the problem can be solved with the mixing method aspect, which ensures that anonymity in transferring funds from source to destination. Digital assets can be send using multiple input addresses and received using multiple output addresses to create the desired anonymity. Another way to reduce privacy leak is by ensuring complete anonymous transactions whereby payments are separated from transactions to eliminate transaction graph analysis. (Zheng et al., 2017) In conclusion, block chain has a large number of applications in almost every industry. Ledger technology can be used to track financial fraud, securely share medical records among health care professionals and even act as an effective means of tracking intellectual property in business and music rights for artists. Crypto - Currency or Commodity An engaging and never-ending debate shall go on this topic because our traditional knowledge is limited to define what actually a currency or commodity means for the buyers and sellers. Similar to the situation raised a few years back when gold and silver was used as an exchange for goods and services, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have landed under the same questionable circle. Since the introduction of cryptocurrency in the world financial market, there have been various attempts to make cryptocurrencies commodities just like other physical common commodities which are traded. For instance, gold and crude have been in the foreign exchange market for more than five decades. Due to the value gauged against the most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum among others, it has been considered commodities by some of the world's power commodity regulators. Therefore, considering Lucking & Aravind (2020), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which resides in the United States, has been involved in regulating and mandated oversight of tangible commodities marketplaces some time in history. As technology keeps on advancing, more cryptic commodities coming on board in the market, such as futures (deliverables) and other intangible commodities such as cryptocurrencies transacted over the counter, have been deemed commodities. In 2015 CFTC, the first form of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was declared a commodity under the CEA in an implementation exploit. Since then, Bitcoin has been in the world market, especially in forex and other financial exchange forms where individuals invest for various reasons. This has created a platform where cryptocurrencies can be compared and traded against different types of commodities such as gold and crude oil, which have almost the same value as that of Bitcoin, for that case. In 2019, CFTC declared that the evaluation of other cryptocurrencies such as Ether which are doing well in the world financial market, be included in the commodity lists as it was done for Bitcoin. Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, closely following Bitcoin in digital assets. From the recent study, cryptocurrencies have been accepted in the commodity market, which shows the world economy's growth day by day. (Lucking & Aravind, 2020) Figure 1 : Comparison of Cryptocurrencies by Market Cap and the changes of Bitcoin value over time There are two main types of crypto, one for the purchase of goods and services and those that allow for the creation of smart contracts. Bitcoin and Ethereum comprise a large part of the cryptocurrency market as shown above however there is growth and growth. For example, there are over 1000 currencies currently in existence. More than 600 have a market capitalization of more than $ 100,000. (MAZER 2018) Some of the problem with cryptocurrency identification lies in the fact that bitcoin was originally considered a payment method, but now rarely carries the characteristics of dollars, euros or pounds. It is of little use as a valuable store because of its volatility, and is restricted as a way to exchange its slow network with high transfer costs. The growing bitcoin lending market gives clues to its behavior. Bitcoin lending provides credit lines for crypto companies that make money in currencies, such as payment processors or miners, looking to earn traditional money by paying for expenses. (Wilson, 2020) Also, traders who do not want to sell their ownership of bitcoin use it as collateral to borrow money for algorithmic or high-frequency trading use. For those who lend money, high yields are an attractive proposal in the era of the lowest rates. Key features of this market, such as the discovery of market-driven pricing and liquidity incentives, reflect that of product leasing, according to market players and economists. Thus, crypto has a currency and a commodity value. (Wilson, 2020) Finally, a wide range of secure transactions, currency exchanges, and unauthorized access, cryptocurrency has lifted barriers facing large and small industries who have struggled to hunt down investors for the project and their views. Coin by definition, means something used as a means of exchanging goods and services. On the other hand, the product is defined as a material that can be purchased and sold as well. Utilization of cryptocurrencies in the international business Crypto keeps on to drawing a lot of attention from investors, entrepreneurs, fund managers and the general public. Many recent public debates on currency exchanges have resulted in significant changes in their prices, claiming that the currency market is a bubble without any underlying guarantees, as well as concerns about the evasion of legal and regulatory oversight. . Figure 2 : Investment Spike in blockchain related companies Investors are get early access to the technology, and they can use it as they see fit. Startups have the potential to raise money without solicitation from private investors or project capitalists. In addition, chain-related projects have raised more than $ 1.6 billion through ICOs to date, while project capitalists have provided only $ 550 million to cryptocurrency companies for more than 120 contracts. (MAZER 2018) For so long, the entire world has relied on banking systems in transferring money and other commodities. Besides, international businesses have depended on the standard bank transaction to complete a deal on the table. Due to network connectivity with the involved international banks involved in the money transfer, the process becomes too slowly causing uncountable inconveniences to the receiving banks. According to Coppola (2021), to eliminate this menace, there came a technological improvement that made use of SWIFT messaging, which eliminated the delayed international payments that replaced the old postal and fax communications. Even after this critical improvement in global business payment procedures, there are still significant tradeoffs that are yet experienced in most international business transactions. For instance, the time spent making payments and the cost involved is always higher, hindering economic growth. With the introduction of cryptocurrencies in the forex market, international business payments have drastically changed. Currently, cryptocurrency has already by-passed the traditional banking systems whereby the transactions of funds across the world, central banks, and private banks have been made easier for businesses in the world as a whole. For to happen, technological developments have been deliberated, which has ensured the businesses funds have been secured from any kind of insecurity while in transit from one account to the other over a secure connection. The aspect of block chain and cryptography is also used to hide the parties involved in fund transfers. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies do not require any form of centralization. As with central banks, the transaction expenses are entirely very low as paralleled to central bank RTGS fees. International businesses should embrace the cryptocurrency digital currency to ease sending and receiving money across the world. If the companies are running different currency accounts, it is possible to run the same cryptocurrency account to facilitate the transaction delays and procedures. (Coppola, 2021) As of now, the most widely used kind of cryptocurrency in international business transfers is Bitcoin. Bitcoin has given rise to other cryptocurrencies such as Dash, Litecoin, Monero, and Ethereum, whereby each uses a different mechanism while engaging in international payment. For instance, Bitcoin and Ethereum make clones, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Classic, respectively. For the case of Ripple, it makes use of universal digital payments protocol as its innate cryptocurrency. Another essential fact about cryptocurrency and international business payments is that they can be used in cross-currency payments anywhere in the world. According to Coppola (2021), the amount of fee involved in forex market exchanging between crosses and cryptocurrency can reduce the expenses involved so long parties have agreed to use Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. Hence, cryptocurrencies have come to reduce the amount of money spent transferring funds from one international business account to the other. Consequently, international businesses are faced with numerous risks that the technology of block chain and cryptocurrency is yet to overcome. Firstly, the exchangeability challenge. Most cryptocurrencies will only allow exchanges with just the most popular currencies, such as the USD, GPB, and JYP, which are always at the top of the world market. Due to this phenomenon, the most minor used currencies lack the option of engaging in cryptocurrencies, especially in the developing countries where investors are willing to make transfers using any of the cryptocurrency mediums. As a result, most investors in these countries entirely rely on the traditional model of paying international business partners. Secondly, the rate at which cryptocurrencies volatiles may put the entire business into a standstill because of immeasurable losses incurred in no time. Usually, only a limited business will benefit from cryptocurrencies while making exchanges with international business partners. (Coppola, 2021) The traditional role of banks The goal of the banking system is to provide security and confidence in the economy. If banks were allowed to go bankrupt and consumers lose savings; it would cause great financial fear and many consumers would withdraw their savings and keep cash. If there was a withdrawal of money it could lead to a shortage of lending funds. This is why the central bank acts as the final solution lender. Traditional banking systems have been there for centuries now, whereby they all offer the same kind of survives to their customer across the globe. The most common function of all traditional banks, which all banks universally adopt, is accepting deposits from customers and giving loans. Commercial banks are primarily involved in obtaining funds from their customer, channeled into various account types based on their preferences. For instance, customers may have fixed accounts, current accounts, and joint saving accounts. Moreover, banks offer loan services to customers, which act as the primary income source to most traditional banks. Once a customer has been granted a loan, he/she must return the money with some added interest from which that bank can run its daily business. Most banks offer various kinds of loans such, cash credit, short-terms, and demands. Gjelsvik, M. (2017). If the account owner does not have enough money in his account, the bank may decide to give an overdraft to the customer on request. Traditional banking systems offer these services whereby the account owner who has been over-drafted is needed to pay extra interest, unlike the one who was granted a loan. Also, banks give overdrafts in the form of salary advances if the customer has shown the possibility of security in future engagements. Besides, Gjelsvik, M. (2017) states that traditional banks have been involved in offering discounts to customers upon exchange bills. Business owners and small-scale traders are granted loan advances based on the number of bills of exchange given be way before the time of maturity. Additionally, banks do offer investment funds depending on the business proposal one is willing to start. For instance, if one is will to invest in real estate, the bank will partner with him or her and finance all of the projects until their completion. Once it's over and commissioned, the bank will take back its funding and the number of agreed interests. The operation of traditional banks does affect the economy in various ways. During monetary intermediation, the bank can transform multiple assets and liabilities thus, participating in economic growth. For instance, fixed saving accounts are owned by individuals who already have a surplus in their financial circulation. The moment they keep the money in the bank, money borrowers who do not have enough money to set-up an enterprise are enabled when the bank accepts to lend them money. In the process, the economy keeps on growing to facilitate infrastructural development. Besides, the bank and the borrower will have to pay taxes to the national government, which is used to offer better services to the public and other investments. The traditional banks are used as an intermediary between the surplus money in the public domain and the economy in general, browsers, and the government. (Guru, 2021) In addition, traditional banking keeps on encouraging the public and investors to keep on saving on their money in that, in the future, they will be able to borrow more money from the same financial institutions if they wish to expand their businesses. From this, the government can correct more taxes, the bank earns more interest, and the business grows, having more profits. The business owner will need more labor force from the community around his/her business enterprise who will liquidate their money. In such a scenario, the economy is in a position to thrive better. More so, the bank has been on the front line in promoting the trade in investment and production by reassuring and encouraging the public to save by organizing assets in the public domain. Traditional banks have been helping to upsurge the collective percentage of investment in the economy (Guru, 2021) In summary, traditional banking systems has been there even before the introduction of cryptocurrencies. More improved systems and procedures need to be put in place to support the advancement in cryptocurrency. The advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrencies in an international payment Advantages Since the introduction of cryptocurrency in the world market in 2009, the world has enjoyed various benefits of having the unique kind of digital currency, which has taken to the sky due to its popularity and incredible value over other standard forms money. Firstly, cryptocurrency is fully supported by block chain technology, which uses cryptography mechanisms to safely guide the information and transaction details of the parties involved in the transaction. Cryptocurrency guarantees clients privacy. The anonymity deal with these mediums of exchange has increased the popularity of Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. According to the number of people who do not have the required documents to be allowed to own a bank account that is close to 1.7 billion people, crypto has made it easy for such persons. Especially in some of the marginalized countries, access to bank account is prohibited. With cryptocurrency, such people in our society now can have access to this form of exchange. (Neufeld, 2021) Additionally, the kind of efficiency has also advocated for the cryptocurrency to most of the business people. Crypto has reduced amount financial settlement as compared with the type of currency available in the forex and other money markets. It is believed that cryptocurrency choosing to transaction cryptocurrency instead of other currency forms enables customers to save up to 16 billion dollars in a single year. Besides, cryptocurrency has one of the most sophisticated security forms that will allow the clients to send an irreversible transaction that is fully traceable and transparent to the entire cryptocurrency network. Furthermore, the intelligent contract aspect, which is associated with programmable digital currency, has considerably cheapened the manual administration of work. Finally, smart contracts have now been utilized in the automation of government responsibilities, for instance, when pulling together taxes, giving out permits, forfeiting subsidizations, and managing local or nationwide elections by various government agencies across the world. (""10 benefits of paying with cryptocurrencies | Mobisun International"", 2019) Disadvantages A great deal of time has been spent developing and advocating for cryptocurrency and block chain technology in the money market. Apart from the benefits to international businesses, it also has drawbacks. As one of the cardinal and digital currencies, cryptocurrencies are also susceptible to underlying cybersecurity threats affecting other kinds of coins globally. For instance, hackers gain access to some of the clients using cryptocurrency and take advantage of the vulnerability. For the evidence recorded in recent future, numerous ICOs security has been broken and costing investors that lead to loss of millions of dollars to the affected cryptocurrency. Additionally, the digital currency does lack a better price instability controller. As a result, cryptocurrencies are forced to lack a better inherent value regulated according to overall money values. However, adoption should of the crypto upsurge customer assurance and reduce irregular volatility. (Boukhalfa, 2019) Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are currently facing the challenge of scalability. According to the rate at which digital monies are being and adoption by the money market. The amount of transaction which is received in every second has been affecting the effectiveness of international businesses. Additionally, the turnaround time for a single transaction involving cryptocurrency is relatively slow compared to other forms of payment methods. For example, MasterCard and VISA have one of the most real-time transaction turnaround times in the world. Until the substructure conveying this expertise is enormously mounted, the issues will not be solved as required. Therefore, such regression is multifaceted and problematic to do effortlessly to the international business. Other apprehensions that do interfere with cryptocurrency technology are varying procedures. These practices have been made necessary because they take place whenever technology is being upgraded. Depending on the amount of time it will take, the international business procedures get affected. (Boukhalfa, 2019) Until recently, a 51% attack on bitcoin seemed unlikely. Increasingly, however, the attack, which involves hackers gaining control of multiple systems on the bitcoin network and changing operations on its blockchain chain, is becoming a reality. The latest proof of this comes from bitcoin gold, a bitcoin fork that started trading in exchange last year. According to a post on one of the currency exchange forums, the hacker is targeting an exchange that trades bitcoin gold. Thus, a thief may try to double the stolen money from an exchange by converting it into a fiat or other crypto currency and using the same coins from his wallet to buy more crypto. Thus, it is believed that the thief stole $ 18 million worth of gold. (SHARMA, 2018) Impact of the broader use of cryptocurrencies in international business and on the future of financial markets Since the introduction of cryptocurrency, the world has introduced new ways of conducting business across different corporation situated worldwide. Future market places will have more methods of transferring and converting currency from one place to the other in a simpler manner. According to the statistic on the global market, the inspiration of cryptocurrencies on the International Monetary Marketplace yet remains relatively small compared to other kinds of commodities that have been participating in the world market for a longer time than that of cryptocurrencies. Having that in mind, it is still essential to understand the route that cryptocurrency has taken on the global world market and international businesses. Currently, cryptocurrencies have impacted international business from a much broader perspective, proven by the various international business players in the worldwide market. These key contributors include the standalone financiers worldwide, several worldwide corporations, and the governments globally that are entirely striving to begin better policies that concern cryptocurrencies. It has been noted that all three stakeholders work independently, but at the end of the day, they come together to facilitate economic growth. (Simonovsky, 2018) Based on standalone financiers' work, the introduction of cryptocurrency has so far shown how it has been used for two main commitments.  Firstly, cryptocurrencies are currently put together to expand selections either as a means of conjecture or as a border that is contrasted with a large-scale fiscal predicament. This technique has been usually used while trading some of the high-valued commodities such as gold and crude oil. Nowadays, cryptocurrencies do not directly interact with consolidated currencies traded in the old-fashioned stock exchanges. For instance, some professionals have articulated apprehensions that volatile cryptocurrencies' insertion into differentiated assortments discloses international marketplaces to more significant dangers in the incident that cryptocurrency prices smash. As of today, cryptocurrencies have remained a small portion of the world's financial assets, which are believed they cannot affect the worldwide financial market even if they fall apart. (Simonovsky, 2018) Secondly, cryptocurrencies have impacted changes in the adoption whereby companies are currently openly trading stocks. The positive thing about this is that the global market is giving the best benefits to these companies. Therefore, cryptocurrencies are have already been considered by most of the people in the world as one of the most cutting-edge technologies that are demanded by most of the forward-looking corporations that want to prosper together with cryptocurrency. So, the financial market in the world has been impacted companies and their involvement in cryptocurrency. Thirdly, the effect of cryptocurrencies on worldwide financial markets has been affected by how the governments across the world based on how they have been reacting. Furthermore, different nation-state worldwide has been showing concerns about the cumulative significance of cryptocurrency rejecting or adopting combined technology into their identifiable financial systems. (Simonovsky, 2018) In international business transactions, XRP is used in transferring of currency from one bank to the other in settlement between banks networks in the world. XRP make use of Ripple network while performing such transactions. For instance, most banks convert the currency first in US dollars since it us the common currency for exchange in the world but it takes not less than three days before money arrives to the desired bank. For XRP, one is required to convert currency in XRP before transferring whereby exchange fee is eliminated and money is received within minutes. Thus, XPR simplify transfers of money between different currencies. (Marr, 2020) Stellar Lumens (XLM) network is one of the cryptocurrency technology which is powered by block chain technology systems that provides the platform that sustain execution of instantaneous payments. XLM Operates on DLT that make it to be independent from underlying banking regulations across the global. But the current banking systems eliminate instantaneous transactions in the present financial structure is due to disintegration. Therefore, Stellar network currently revolutionizing traditional financial payments across counties. Also, Lumens transaction fees have continues to be a fixed price of $0.00001 XLM and the transaction process takes place within seconds which has encouraged people to opt for cryptocurrency during transfers. (Lokhava at el., 2019) Furthermore, New Economy Movement block chain is powered by XEM cryptocurrency that required one to verify currency transfer using unique protocol known as proof-of-importance (POI) algorithm. The advantage of NEM is that it make use of Two-tier architecture the connection to the rest of the block chain network thus speeding up the transactions speeds. (Mason, 2021). On the contrary, ENJ is a sequence block chain gaming platform that focuses on the creation of digital collection objects that are user-owned. The platform provides ways to create digital assets called ERC1155 signals for use in a variety of Video Games. Their use includes the art of collecting or even store coupons. Gaming chain allows players to have real ownership of their game items and sell them for value. The ENJ platform uses Block chain technology because of a wide range of technologies that include Real Product Ownership, Easy Exchange of Value, Savings Value, and One Wallet for all items. In addition, the ERC-1155 signal level is the purchase of many shipping activities and services that save on costs. (Michael, 2021) VetChain is a block chain platform designed to improve business processes. It aims to simplify the processes and flow of information on multi-supply management through the use of distributed ledger technology. In addition, VeChain is a business blockchain platform that aims to provide full corporate feedback by separating information from data storages. Currently, VetChain plans to be a leading platform for the issuance of native currencies (ICOs) as well as operational activities between the Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices. In addition, VetChain's goals are to create an ecosystem that will be trusted to facilitate open flow of information, real interactions, and rapid rate transfer. (FRANKENFIELD, 2021) Chainlink VRF recently went live on Ethereum's mainnet, and the PoolTogether game is the first project to adopt it. A proven track record is very important, and it is important for the development of many programs because it serves as a predictor to create predictions. As a result, Randomness is a key factor in game play and security usage and difficult and unpredictable environments, and giving unpredictable player awards like looting drops. It also creates a fair distribution of tariffs and resources, such as providing judges for cases or auditors with the companies under investigation. This solution can provide increased levels of reliability and transparency in basic process processes, which even developers cannot change. (Brown, 2020) Chainlink is an underrated oracle network that provides real-world data for good deals on block chain. Smart contracts are the aforementioned agreements in a block chain that automatically evaluates information and implements when certain conditions are met. LINK signals are a digital asset symbol used to pay for services on the Internet. This process, along with more secure equipment, eliminates reliability issues that may arise if you use only one source. The process starts on a block chain enabled by a good contract when a good contract requires data. Such a good contract provides an information request. (""What Is Chainlink? Oracles, Nodes and LINK Tokens | Gemini"", 2021) Tron block chain technology is a promising block chain platform dedicated to a dedicated web and its infrastructure. In addition, it works with the TRON protocol, which they claim to be the largest chain operating system in the world. The key factors that drive TRON are its support for high-quality, high-level, high-level access, and support for TRON's rational language validity agreement in (Ethereum). TRON has slowly grown its platform infrastructure making it easier and better for developers. Some of the benefits of Tron chain technology enable the creation and deployment of imported software, and their web site TRON assists in making the process easier. RON has continued to promote the environment and has attracted more developers and users. TRON has 500 million smart contracts and over 2 million user accounts. Their system of development has also changed. Only time will tell if they will take on existing players. (""Tron Blockchain Technology - An Overview of Tron Smart Contracts"", 2019) In conclusion, future business transactions will heavy rely on the upcoming methods of transferring currency from one form to the other which will contribute to the global economy. Risk of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency is faced with various challenges which has been crippling its utilization. Due to the advancement in technology, cyber criminals has found another area where they can keep on experimenting their ill motive practices. Crimes Just like any other financial products and services which have been in the market for cryptocurrency and block chain technologies has featured the possibility of posing risks that may be used in propagating crime activities that mess up the entire world if not controlled and stopped with immediate effect. For instance, some money laundering activities have been confirmed to be fueled the cryptocurrency technology, which is hard to trace the source of the illegal transaction of money. Also, due to the anonymity nature of cryptocurrency transactions, terrorist financing has been shifted to this. The financier can send colossal amount money in the form of cryptocurrency without being detected, and there receiving terrorist withdraws the money in privacy. Unlike in the traditional banking system, where one is asked to the source, intentions of the money one wishes to transfer. (KEATINGE et al., 2018) Furthermore, cryptocurrency has been involved in criminal activity. The recent one is the use of Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies, having attracted monetary controllers, policymakers, and the general public to social media platforms' power. It has been noted that the sophistication associated with block chain and cryptocurrency, especially pseudonymous and the aspect of distribution of digital currencies, has been found to have some loopholes which need to be rectified before more damage happens. For instance, the subsequent struggle of mapping out payments has been confirmed to facilitate criminal bustle, which includes but is not limited to terrorist financing, money laundering and cybercrime, and other illegitimate manipulation. (Teichmann & Falker, 2020). Due to technological advancement in this digital currency sector, a criminal has gotten an edge whereby they can take part in underhand ways to wash out their illegally obtained money since most of the money does not need to be in the bank or near the regulatory bodies. Crypto, a possible type of financial pyramid scheme. There have been allegations pointing out that cryptocurrency is based on a pyramid scheme. The pyramid scheme is a business organization whereby top-level members going down the hierarchy level of monetary pyramids earn profit directly from members under them. For instance, the topmost member in the pyramid will get the largest share of the finances contributed by the new members who have joined the scheme. The pyramid is that it acts as a syndicate that does not offer any services or product, making it completely irrelevant. For instance, as more and more people join the crypto market, the prices get higher, only benefiting those at the topmost and those who pioneered the crypto. According to statistics, about 1,000 individuals currently have about 40 % of the whole Bitcoin market. Therefore, for cryptocurrency, there have been similarities that resemble those of the pyramid scheme. (""Is Cryptocurrency Just a Big Pyramid Scheme? 2021) This phenomenon has been brought about by the behavior of those who have already associated themselves with cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin; Ethereum encourages others to join the market through a link that is connected to their accounts. According to cryptocurrency reports, there used to be Crypto Offerings in the cryptocurrency market, no longer available to the clients. The entire market lead by the best crypto, Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum, has reduced the offering by 50 percent, making it look like it is a scam. Most of the digital coinages in circulation have lost most customers due to the implications and lack of transparency. Additionally, there are massive swings in the world market where cryptocurrency is being traded. Only the hedges have the power to control the market and have the advantage over small and new traders. (""Is Cryptocurrency Just a Big Pyramid Scheme? 2021) Consumption of energy Since the rise of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from marginal technology, the current widespread cryptocurrencies, the world has experienced tremendous benefits from technological improvements on secure transactions to clients' engagement on contracts. As a result, an international and individual business owner has made histrionic wealth, with most taking home millions of dollars across the entire world. At the center of the cryptocurrency, a multi-billion-dollar industry has been commissioned, which was inspired by its revolutionary distributed technology. However, the industry has caused the world to suffer due to the effects of the amount of energy used by the underlying computer networks. (MAZER 2018) Miners compete to ensure continuous and profitable operations, using special equipment and cheap electricity. This competition helps to ensure the integrity of the activities in the money market For instance, at a single model, the amount of energy required to operate the entire cryptocurrency and the block chain technology can be used to power the whole of Argentina. According to Cuthbertson (2021), analysis from the University of Cambridge shows that Bitcoin alone requires no less than121 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year to power all its networks. Therefore, more need to be done on the risks which has been caused by introduction of cryptocurrency in the world. All key stakeholders need to take part in figuring out the most appropriate ways to methods to reduce the risks with cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Block chain has a large number of applications in almost every industry. Ledger technology can be used to track financial fraud, securely share medical records among health care professionals and even act as an effective means of tracking intellectual property in business and music rights for artists. While traditional banking systems has been there even before the introduction of cryptocurrencies can revolutionize the whole global financial industry as they are democratized and decentralized currencies that are not controlled by any government leader, nor subjected to sovereign borders or taxation control. It can be especially beneficial for nations like Africa, who do not have stable fiat currencies. Cryptocurrency allow the clients to send a secure and irreversible transaction that is fully traceable and transparent to the entire cryptocurrency network while significantly reducing the traditional financial settlement charges. Future business transactions will heavily rely on the upcoming methods of transferring currency from one form in the global economy. With all that said, cryptocurrency is a double edge sword. Measures will need to manage the down side like money laundering, terrorist financing, massive amount of energy consumption from mining activities. At the point of this writing, cryptocurrencies are highly unstable with high pricing volatility ranging from 10 to 50% daily, and very often manipulated or schemed by hedge funds or even by the creators themselves. Cryptocurrency’s future is very much uncertain at this point of time. Even while there are limitless potential and already proven strong application use cases where cryptocurrency is a viable and revolutionary option, much depends on individual governments’ willingness to embrace it, taking into account of its own sovereignty interest.

16,5 Biggest Frustrations for Plastic Surgeons,business," Since working with plastic surgeons since the Year 2000 to grow their plastic surgery practices, I’ve identified the 5 biggest frustrations they continuously face when striving to get to the next level, and here they are: FRUSTRATION #1: “NOTHING IS WORKING.” You’ve tried tons of different tactics (mass advertising, internet marketing, social media, you even bought the new technical gadget) only to find that you keep experiencing more chaos, confusion, and frustration. The key question here is: “Is it possible to go from the feeling of nothing Is working to experiencing predictable success, profit, and enjoying your practice once again?” FRUSTRATION #2: STAFF You’re frustrated with your team. You can’t seem to find the A+ level of players that so many ‘consultants’ talk about or books like “GOOD to Great” preach. Key question: “Is it possible to move from extreme frustration and almost a feeling of giving up on your staff to actually being able to identify and/or train your staff to become A-Players who promote you successfully?” FRUSTRATION #3: PROFIT Simply put, no matter what you do, there’s not enough. Not enough to put money away for a comfortable retirement, not enough to hire the A-players, and maybe even not enough to cover your overhead some months. You may have moments of secretly questioning whether you chose the right profession or not. Key Question: “Is it possible to go from NOT being able to take home more, even though you are trying everything, to experiencing bigger and better profits than ever before?” FRUSTRATION #4: THE CEILING Your growth has stopped- plateaued. No matter what you do, you can’t seem to break through and get to the next level. How frustrating is that? You feel overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next. So here’s the key question: “Could it be possible that there are some real-world unknown strategies that would make your life simpler, scalable, efficient, and profitable?” FRUSTRATION #5: YOU DON’T KNOW WHERE TO TURN! This is a key frustration for so many surgeons since they don’t have anyone to talk to about their frustrations. You can’t talk to your staff since they see you as the confident leader. Your spouse typically doesn’t understand the pressures of running an aesthetic practice. You certainly can’t discuss this with the competitors in your area, so who do you turn to for direction and clarity? The key question here is: “Is it possible the answers to your biggest frustrations are right in front of you…you just haven’t been shown them yet by someone who understands you?” The answer to all of the Key Questions Above is a resounding YES! It’s just a matter of knowing where to turn for answers to take you to the next level, and I humbly believe I have many of those answers to the questions you have. Once you address the 5 biggest frustrations for plastic surgeons, you will enjoy your practice again and set it up. So it’s profitable and running smoothly. I’ll show you how just like I did for other surgeons around the world."
17,Internal Marketing Strategies for Plastic Surgeons,business," The easiest decision for your cosmetic patients to make is the one made AFTER their initial decision to choose you for cosmetic rejuvenation. So, focus on internal marketing strategies for plastic surgeons to cross-promote ALL of the cosmetic services. In other words, if they have already said yes to you, they are much more likely to continue to say yes if offered additional plastic surgery or non-surgery services. This one concept can increase your revenues from 10-30% without you spending one extra dime on marketing. It just takes strategy and creativity. Do your patients know ALL you have to offer? If you have ever heard a patient say to you, “I didn’t know you did that,” it’s time for you to review your internal marketing strategies because you are not getting all you can from your plastic surgery patients. A cosmetic patient who wants to look their best (and feel great) is open to all sorts of procedures and treatments you offer, but they have to know about them so cross-promote all cosmetic services you offer. Here are 3 easy ways to cross-promote your plastic surgery and non-surgery services: Help them Heal When a Botox/Filler treatment leaves bruises, offer to do a quick laser procedure to help minimize the bruising and speed up the healing. Not only are you showing you care, but you’re also cross-promoting your laser procedures. Signature Treatment Devise your own signature treatment that turns back the clock for your more mature patients who want rejuvenation but are not yet ready for surgery. Combine several different services into one package with a special combination price. Show how much it would cost separately, so they see the savings. Not only will they get a better result, but they also cannot pull the package apart and price shop it with your competitors. This also builds great patient loyalty because they’ll get a great result and come back for more. Thank You Gift Cards Oftentimes, your patients come to you for one procedure but go elsewhere for others. They might not have a good reason for doing that other than it didn’t dawn on them to choose you for other procedures. In today’s crazy busy world, you can simplify your patients’ lives by becoming their “one-stop-shop” for all of their cosmetic rejuvenation needs, and that’s where internal marketing strategies are important. Next time they visit, hand them a thank you card with a gift certificate to try a new procedure they haven’t had before. For example…. – Skin Care patients get a gift card to experience Botox – Botox patients get a gift card to experience Filler – Filler patients get a gift card to experience skin tightening and so on. You can even offer a gift card towards a bleph or liposuction for those patients who purchased the non-surgical laser and fat reduction treatments before but are now ready for a more permanent result. I recommend you implement the above internal marketing strategies for plastic surgeons right away and brainstorm as a team for additional ideas to cross-promote all cosmetic services because you want a patient for a lifetime. It helps your patients look great while you increase your bottom-line revenues, so it’s a win-win for everyone."
18,2 Deadly Sins: Bad Phones and Weak Consultations,business," Converting new plastic surgery leads IS getting more difficult for all sorts of reasons. You most likely are paying pretty hefty monthly fees to your SEO/hosting company, your digital marketing agency, your directories that help you get found, and so on. They, in turn, send you leads of prospective plastic surgery patients wanting your services. And that’s where the trouble starts….. Your staff complains these leads are awful - They are not serious about moving forward. They are wasting their time. Ever hear that? Sometimes it’s true. Some of the leads are a waste of time. When you put your message out there in the Universe to millions of people, it’s a crapshoot that comes back to you. You have to take the good with the bad. If you aren’t happy with the leads coming your way, look at what you are doing to attract them. The quality of the leads is dependent on your marketing message, and media used to attract new patient leads. The goal of marketing is to attract serious plastic surgery candidates to you and repel those who are not serious. But let’s say you know you’re doing a good job marketing YOU. You make videos, post on Instagram, answer questions online, and you pay to advertise. Why aren’t these leads you’ve spent a fortune to get NOT converting? Thanks to the sheer amount of marketing messages, stiff competition, confusing information about cosmetic procedures, and fickle consumer patients are three big reasons you are struggling. That’s what is leading to a waste of your valuable time and holes in your surgery schedule. Not to mention the anxiety you and your staff feel when your efforts go to waste. But after working with plastic surgeons since the Year 2000, another huge part of it is what happens to that lead. When it comes to lead conversion, the 2 deadly sins are bad phones and weak consults. I’m sorry to point the finger at your staff, but the good news is, it’s easy to fix, so let’s break it down: DEADLY SIN #1: BAD PHONES A big mistake that’s ruining your marketing efforts is having bad phones. Here’s the scenario…. You have spent a fortune re-designing your website to ensure Google and its rules don’t ban you from the Internet, and you work with a company to get your SEO in shape so prospective patients can find you online. You are most likely spending advertising dollars on Real Self, Google Adwords, banner ads, and directories which isn’t cheap. Next, you tackled your physical office by spending another small fortune designing your office to cater to cosmetic patients who have the disposable income for your services, so you give them a nice atmosphere when they visit… Then, you conquered the world of social media. You’ve hired a team to blog for you, write content, and update your FB page regularly. You even assigned an internal staff person to be your “social media ambassador.” This is costing you time and money, but you’re sure it’s helping. So, the stage is set, and you are ready for new cosmetic patients. And all your efforts are working!! Prospective cosmetic patients found you online, they learned enough about you, and they are confident you are a great choice to help them with their needs. They eagerly call your office with anticipation knowing you are a first-class practice ONLY TO HEAR…. “Doctor’s office. Please hold”…. Click and now waiting? A disinterested receptionist with no enthusiasm? A friendly receptionist who doesn’t know anything? This WAS NOT the image or the experience your callers expected. That “incongruence” between your image portrayed to the prospective cosmetic patient is lost when that image is not carried through to your receptionist and how they handle new callers on the phone. What a waste to lose that cash-paying patient before you ever got to meet them. DEADLY SIN #2: WEAK CONSULTATIONS Let’s say you have a great front desk staff, and they booked the new patient consultation. The patient comes in and is greeted by that friendly front desk person. The visiting patient now goes through your consultation process of completing paperwork, having photos taken, and meeting with you, the surgeon, to discuss your recommendations. So far, so good. Now your patient coordinator takes over. Her job is to present the numbers, answer additional questions, and book surgery. But is that what happens? How often do you hear they walked out the door without booking, never to be heard from again? When asked, your coordinator tells you things like: – They were just price shopping – They can’t afford it – We (you) oversold them and on and on If that really true? I guarantee at least 15% of those consults were lost due to your coordinator not being experienced enough to convert them. Your patient coordinator can be a game-changer for your bottom line so choose carefully. Just be sure you have the right patient coordinator representing you who looks, acts, and feels the part. For example, your coordinator must have a process set up to bond with, and qualify the prospective patient by asking powerful questions. They need to discover what the patient REALLY wants, why they want it, and what it will take for them to say YES. Converting plastic surgery consultations takes confidence and skill to ASK FOR A DECISION. This one skill makes the difference between 25% conversions and 75% conversions. But like anything else in life, it’s a learned and practiced skill. If your staff could use professional plastic surgery converting training, check out www.ConvertingClub.com for the strategies, practice, and accountability they need to help you grow. By the way, it’s a lot faster, easier, and cheaper to fix these 2 deadly sins than it is to throw even more money at advertising that doesn’t result in more plastic surgery procedures. Just saying…."

The good thing about Laravel is that it can be used for any project of any size. The sky’s the limit, and one of the advantages of using it is that you’re able to start off small and scale up your Laravel build as and when it’s needed. Laravel is like most other content management systems in that it essentially underpins your site and provides you with a base that you can build from. It’s no more or less suitable for big projects than something like WordPress or WooCommerce, and so it’s really a case of choosing the best platform for you. If Laravel ticks all of your boxes, it’s a no-brainer. The Benefits of Offshoring Development We could write a full post on the benefits of offshore development because there are so many different advantages available. Different companies are looking for different things from their offshore development companies, but just a few of the main benefits for people to tap into include: Scalability: One of the biggest advantages of working with an offshore development company is that they can bring in new resources at speed to scale up and down with your company. And you don’t even have to worry about paying them a salary! Lower costs: Because they’re typically located in cities and countries with lower costs of living, offshore companies can usually save money on their operating costs and pass those savings on to their customers. Specialist expertise: Many offshore development companies specialize in working on a certain kind of build, whether that’s ultra-secure builds or whether they pride themselves on speed or their ability to work in certain industries. Offshore Software Development Costs: Rate Comparison Offshore development companies tend to have a variety of different rates, just as you’ll find if you look at domestic companies and compare their prices. Still, as a general rule, you should be wary of any company charging less than $10-15 per hour, while once you get to $40+/hour, you’re getting pretty close to what you’d pay for a local agency. And of course, remember that you get what you pay for. So sometimes it can be worth paying a little more if it’s going to have a positive effect on the service you receive. How to Choose an Offshore Software Outsourcing Company There is a range of different factors that you’ll want to consider when choosing an offshore development company. Of course, most people immediately think of the potential cost savings, because outsourcing to an offshore company can mean that you can work with companies where the cost of living is lower, but cost isn’t the only factor that you’ll want to think about. For a pretty good starting point, you can take a look at the list of benefits that we shared and identify which of those benefits are the most important for you. If scalability is a factor, for example, then, cost might take a backseat so that you can focus instead on those companies that can bring in the most additional resources to work with you. One final thing to note is that you should never underestimate how important it is to find a company that can offer stellar customer service because that’s often the first thing to go when they’re trying to keep their costs down. The problem is that you can’t put a price on customer service, and so it’s worth finding an outsourcing company that offers reasonably good support as a bare minimum. Why choose Zfort group as a software development company? Zfort Group is an obvious choice when you’re looking to outsource your software development because they tick all of the boxes, which is why we ranked them first on this list. They have a strong history of delivering software builds on time and budget, and they also offer pretty good customer service. In fact, unless you have some specific need that calls for a specialist agency, they probably offer the best overall mixture of price versus quality, and they have the testimonials to back that up.

And the best part is you have a lot of control over how many reviews you get along with the quality of those reviews. HERE ARE THE STEPS TO FOLLOW TO GET GREAT PLASTIC SURGERY ONLINE REVIEWS QUICKLY: Patient selection and timing are crucial. Catch your patient when they are gushing about you and their result. Most likely, that is at their post-op appointment when they are looking good and feeling ECSTATIC about their result. This is when YOU, the surgeon, ask them for a review in a comfortable way; i.e., “Susan, I’m so glad you’re happy with your result. Can you please do me a favor? You know how important online reviews are for others who are also looking for a good result. Would you mind writing a review? Karen can give you a tool to make it fast and easy for you? I’d really appreciate it.” Detailed Instructions Now your staff meets with your cosmetic patient to go over the contents of the review tool kit. There are many online review sites; however, I would focus on Google since they own the internet. Find out if your patient has a Gmail account set up. If they don’t, offer to set up an account for them. So they can then write the review at home on their own computer. Or, better yet, have them write the review right now, in your office, from their cell phone. So, the plastic surgery patient online review kit contains: -Introductory heartfelt letter -Instructions for posting a review -Starbuck gift card* *While you never want to pay anyone for a review, you can certainly thank them for their time in a small way. WHAT IS A GOOD PLASTIC SURGERY ONLINE PATIENT REVIEW? One of the biggest reasons your happy patients don’t give you a review is that they are busy. You are asking them to stop their day and write something that will go out to the world. Help them help you. The introductory letter includes starter sentences for them to complete since a good review tells a full story; i.e., I wanted to improve ___________because ________ I chose Dr. Smith because _____________________ My experience with the doctor and staff was _________ How I feel about my result _____________________ Follow Up If your patient does NOT upload a review within 48 hours, have the same staff person who walked them through the review kit call them and say, “Hi Susan, Dr. Smith and I are looking forward to your review and haven’t seen it yet. Is there anything I can help you with”? Most likely, that will prompt them to do it now. Thank Them! Thank them in any way that really shows your appreciation. That could be a simple phone call, a handwritten letter, a little extra Botox at their next visit, etc. There is a saying, “Behavior that is rewarded is repeated.” Just be sure your patient knows how much you appreciate their support. This strategy works. A plastic surgery practice followed these instructions and handed out 12 packets, and within 21 days, they had 7 new plastic surgery patient online reviews. Please get together with your team, and come with a process to get you more Plastic Surgery Online Patient Reviews. It’s that important to your success."

4,Plastic Surgery Word of Mouth Referrals,business," Word-of-mouth referrals for a plastic surgery practice are absolutely the best form of advertisement you can get to grow as quickly as possible. It’s also the cheapest form that you can invest in, and it takes so little time, money, and effort. The best patient for your plastic surgery practice is the referred patient. It is golden when a friend tells another friend, family member, or colleague about you in a positive light. Because the referred patient is pre-sold on you already, they are not as price-sensitive and much more likely to say yes to your recommendations. So, word-of-mouth referrals increase closing ratios, decrease external marketing costs, and grow your practice. Compared to other plastic surgery marketing strategies, word-of-mouth referrals are cheaper, easier, and painless – you can’t ask for more than that. Word-of-mouth referrals work so well because they are passing pertinent information in a trusting, informal, person-to-person manner, rather than by mass media or advertising. It is highly valued because it’s so credible. People are more inclined to believe word-of-mouth referrals than more formal forms of promotion because the communicator (your patient) was satisfied by the services you provided and is unlikely to have an ulterior motive (i.e., they are not out to sell something). Also, people tend to believe people they know. A PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT’S INNER CIRCLE Think of it this way. Each one of your patients, on average, has an inner circle of approximately 250 people. That includes friends, family, colleagues, neighbors, etc. If each of your patients told only five of their inner circle about you and then they told five, and so on, and so on, consider how quickly you could grow your plastic surgery practice. When you first start out in practice, you do need to rely on more external marketing - so the community gets to know you. Advertising helps to build your brand and your name recognition. However, as your practice matures, 70% and more of your new patients should be referrals from your existing patients. SO, HOW DO YOU GET PLASTIC SURGERY WORD-OF-MOUTH REFERRALS? Word-of-mouth referrals must be encouraged and sought after using creative, subtle methods. Sure, you will automatically get some of them from your core group of cheerleaders in your practice. Every practice has that group of patients who love you and tell anyone who will listen how great you are. However, you also want referrals from the majority of your patients – not just the chosen few. Make word-of-mouth referrals a priority in your office. For starters, set up processes to help ensure you have your staff’s commitment to make patient satisfaction your #1 priority. Be sure they understand the importance of treating each patient with a warm and friendly attitude every time they are in touch with your practice. And then be sure the person answering your phones is asking how the callers heard about you, so you know who and what is growing your practice. GET PLASTIC SURGERY WORD OF MOUTH REFERRALS FROM YOUR DATABASE Spending time now developing relationships with your current patients will grow your prospective patient list later. If your patients like, trust, and respect you, they will be happy to tell their family and friends about you and may even brag about your great work to everybody else they know. Begin by speaking with your patients. Before you jump right into the medical reason, they are there to see you, spend a couple of minutes with them as a person. Ask them about their family, occupation, or anything else in their patient in-take form that strikes you as interesting. They will be impressed if you remember the name of their child or if you refer to something they told you on the last visit. The point is to bond with them personally first, so they know you care about them as a person first – patient second. When the patient is relaxed, they will be more likely to open up to you and talk about themselves. If you show a genuine interest in a patient, you would be surprised at how much someone will disclose to you. And, you will be surprised what you learn. Perhaps they are a member of the media, or they are the program chair this year for their businesswomen’s group. Remember that like-minded people associate with each other, and you want your “preferred patient” to be a referral from your existing patients. Be sure to tell your patients that you want more patients like them, and if they send you someone in their social group, you promise to take good care of them. USE WORD-OF-MOUTH COMMUNICATION TOOLS Use communication devices such as your practice newsletter, special event invitations, and email marketing messages, so your patients share information you provide with their friends, family, and colleagues. Any written communications coming from you should make a mention of how much you appreciate referrals. Add the phrase, “Bring a Friend” to your invitations, and “Send this to a Friend” on your website and email messages. Add a special note in your marketing efforts and have an eye-catching reminder sign in your reception area. The more your patients are reminded, the more they will remember you when they are speaking with their friends about cosmetic enhancement. LOOK AT YOUR ALLIANCES FOR REFERRALS Look at who you know in your community. Perhaps you are friendly with the dentist down the hall or other non-competing specialties who would be happy to refer their patients to you and vice versa. This can be done informally by exchanging business cards and handing them to the patients who need the services. A physician referral to another physician is powerful since it’s so credible. Or, perhaps your staff regularly visits a certain hair salon and retail store, or your office manager gets massages weekly at the new hip spa in town. You can turn those casual alliances into viable word-of-mouth referral sources by having your staff talk to them and then introduce you to the owners. If you hit it off, you can give them your business cards or a customized poster to display in their place of business. You can also consider participating in some type of cross-promotional event and invite both of your databases. You can gain instant credibility and prestige when your colleague introduces you as the expert to their patients and clients. It also gives you exposure to an entirely new group of prospective patients who also have their circle of friends, family, and colleagues they can refer you to. NETWORK TO INCREASE PLASTIC SURGERY WORD OF MOUTH REFERRALS I have watched physicians grow their practices quickly with networking. Remember the adage, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know”? Now it’s actually, “Who knows you” that is so important. If you are good at networking, you can tap into groups of people who can become your preferred patients. Attend events and connect with as many others as possible. Every person you meet should know who you are, what you do, and the services you offer. If nothing else, be sure your business card says it so you can at least introduce yourself and hand them a business card they can refer to later. Now follow up with an email or send them a small gift with extra business cards. Tell them it was a pleasure to meet them and how much you would appreciate their referrals to your practice. GET INVOLVED IN YOUR COMMUNITY Giving back to your community shows you care about others. Getting involved in a worthy cause makes you feel good, and it’s good for the community. If you don’t have a cause close to your heart and need to find something, think strategically. If you want to be known as the “facelift doc” in your community, perhaps you can offer your services to domestic violence victims. Or, if you want to get into the “in” social crowd in your community, work with the socialites in your area that give considerable time and money to a specific cause and get to know them. Become part of their crowd, and they will loyally go to you and send their like-minded friends to you as well. FREQUENT REFERRAL PROGRAM Reward, encourage, and acknowledge those special patients who offer multiple referrals. Every practice has those patients who just love them! They visit often, they know the names of the staff’s children, and they go to you for all of their skincare needs. They may live in the same neighborhood, and their kids may go to the same school your kids go to, they may go to your health club, or whatever. You have a special group of loyal patients who sing your praises all over town. Whenever the subject of cosmetic enhancement comes up, they are the first to jump in and tell everyone what they have had done, who did it, and how happy they are. They can give others your telephone number right now if they have a pen. And, if they don’t, they will email your name, telephone number, and address the next day- and they do it! It’s the 80-20 rule. Like everything else in life, 80% of the referrals will come from 20% of your patients. You can help those statistics by going a step further. Implement a frequent referral program but do it with caution. You do not want to get into the game of giving away services if your patients refer a certain number of people. Those patients who are trying to get “deals” from you by sending in their friends may be more trouble than they are worth. They may send you patients you don’t want and maybe in it for the wrong reasons. You want the patients who are truly ecstatic about you and want to sing your praises. COMPUTER TRACKING “So, how did you hear about Dr. Smith?” This is one of the most important questions your staff must ask every single prospective patient calling your office and walking through your door. You can’t really know who your advocates are unless you can track them accurately. It’s vital you have a computer system that automatically tracks referral sources, so you know who is really referring people and who just says they are referring. You also want to track who actually books procedures and which procedures they seem to be booking more of from the referrals you receive. Good computer systems will outline, in detail, who referred whom and the outcome in terms of revenues generated. DON’T TAKE PLASTIC SURGERY WORD OF MOUTH REFERRALS FOR GRANTED Acknowledge and appreciate your referring patients. Send a handwritten thank-you note for each referral you get from a patient. Or, if you send a computer-generated form, be sure you handwrite a special note on it, so the patient knows you truly appreciate them. The handwritten note visually tells your referring patients you sincerely appreciate their efforts. This indicates you acknowledge their support and value their friendship. You can also invite your best-referring patients in periodically for a complimentary, non-invasive treatment that your staff can perform and send them a small gift or card on their birthday and during the holidays. It’s the acknowledgment, more than the “freebies” your referring patients will appreciate and will prompt them to send more patients your way. THE GOLDEN RULE Patients have to be truly happy and satisfied with the service they receive from your practice to refer their friends. Please be sure every single patient has a “WOW” experience every single time they are in contact with you, your staff, and your office. This will make it much more likely for them to tell others how great you are."
5,How SMS Marketing Can Help Your Business,business," SMS marketing for business owners is one of the easiest and effective forms of advertising to implement. It does not require any upfront investment from your end and you will start getting measurable results almost immediately. Most business owners fail to realize that the most significant factor in their marketing campaign is the type of people they are targeting with their campaigns. By understanding what types of clients you are interested in, you can easily determine the right time and SMS messaging campaign that will specifically reach them. You will also be able to make adjustments on your end so that your message reaches as many potential clients as possible. There are several different ways in which you can market using text messaging. One common way is through SMS marketing for business owners. Many companies have text message archives that include previous ads, customer testimonials, and more so you can easily gauge which audience you would like to target with specific messages. You can then experiment with the different options available to make sure that you are creating the best possible campaign by selecting the right words or phrases. This will ensure that your message is as compelling as it can be. One of the key factors in creating a good text messaging campaign is the frequency with which you send messages to your customers. You need to set a time frame for when you want your customers to receive your messages and then stick to it. You should try and send at least one message every day to all your possible customers. If you can do this, you will soon start to notice a boost in the number of new contacts coming into your company. In addition, your existing contacts will enjoy receiving such messages as they are more likely to want to keep in touch. Another aspect of SMS marketing for business owners is to use the content in your messages to entice your customers. You should take great care in your choice of words and how you word your advertisements. Customers like to read positive messages and if you use jargon in your advertisements you may lose some of your potential customers. It's much better to use simple, easy-to-understand language and make your advertisements as clear as possible. Some business owners are wary of using SMS marketing for their businesses because they believe their customers will not accept unsolicited messages. However, this is not true. All mobile devices, including cell phones and PDAs, support SMS marketing. All you need to do is use your keyword as part of your campaign text and customers are sure to receive your message. As with any form of marketing, SMS marketing for business owners should also have a focus. You need to decide what specific groups you want to target. This will help to ensure that your efforts are focused and will produce the desired results. SMS marketing for instance should be geared at reaching out to your current customers. You can then use your messages to reward your loyal customers and remind others about your products and services. One of the key things to remember when utilizing SMS marketing for business purposes is that your message must be direct and to the point. If you send messages to potential customers that are vague, they are likely to ignore them. For instance, if you are opening a new store you will probably want to use an informative message. Rather than talk about how your store has something new to offer, use a message that talks about how your company is known for offering quality customer service. You want to send a clear message that you are sending a message of interest to a group of people.

6,One Time or Lifetime Cosmetic Patient,business," As a plastic surgeon, do you want a one-time or lifetime cosmetic patient? Most plastic surgeons focus on surgery and that creates a “one-and-done” mindset. Because as surgeons, they only want surgery, so they focus all of their efforts on finding prospective patients ready for plastic surgery. However, you can’t win today with that mindset. You will go broke trying to find enough “needle in the haystack” plastic surgery patients ready for surgery now. In today’s crazy competitive world, that should be only one part of your marketing strategy. When you change your mindset from a one-time patient to a lifetime patient, your world opens up new opportunities. This might help…. WHAT IS THE VALUE OF A COSMETIC PATIENT’S LOYALTY? Think of every single cosmetic patient as a $50,000 revenue stream. They are worth $50,000 when you consider what they themselves invest in your cosmetic services, but also what their friends, family, colleagues, and internet friends (fastest path post) invest in your services as well…..when done right. When you look at it this way, you realize you don’t need to spend as much time and money on “one-and-done patients” plastic surgery patients because you have a steady stream of patients who return, refer and review. For example, if your average surgical procedure is $8K, it only takes 125 of them to make $1MM, but you only need 20 patients when they are worth $50K to you. Do you see how exciting that is? Now you can scale to multi-millions of dollars per year because you are working smarter and not harder on these one-time hits. That sounds great, but how do you do that? How do you fill up your practice with more of these raving fans? The secret is to make them feel special because they are. Treat your patients like your family, and friends and they will reciprocate. But don’t leave this to chance. It’s not your patient’s job to nurture a relationship with you. It’s you and your staff’s job to treat these patients with friendliness, kindness, and respect and continue to nurture these relationships for a lifetime. Oftentimes, practices institute a loyalty program, and/or you can institute these strategies …. HERE ARE 2 WAYS TO BUILD LOYALTY WITH PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS VIP Status After a patient has had surgery with you, invite them back for their post-op visit and let them know you have a gift waiting for them. Also, let them know you’ll be taking their “after” photos and you would appreciate a video testimonial if they wouldn’t mind. Now present them with a VIP card that entitles them to special perks for the next year. Some perks could include: •	Valet Parking •	No-Waiting Botox Appointments •	Massage chair session in a private room •	20% Off all laser treatments •	Free Monthly Peel and so on VIP Events Hold fun catered events In your office after hours for anyone who had surgery with you AND they are to bring a friend to introduce to you and your staff. This way, the patients who had surgery can bond with each other about their experience, and their friends can bond with you and your staff and talk about the possibilities of surgery. Offer the guests a complimentary surgical consultation gift card to help track the results of this effort. The point is to spend as much time building your practice from the inside out as you do trying to attract strangers to you from the Internet. So now that you know more, do you want a one-time or lifetime cosmetic patient? Please say lifetime"
7,Attract the Best Patients with Target Marketing,business," The most successful plastic surgeons have discovered how to spend less to get better results and attract the best patients with target marketing. CHALLENGES MARKETING TO PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS There are too many marketing channels for plastic surgery patients to find you. SEO, PPC, Blog, directories, articles, billboards, print ads, social media, and YouTube, to name a few. That creates too much noise for a prospective patient to sift through all the marketing messages coming at them daily. We humans only have so much brainpower to process information, so to simplify things in our head we unconsciously acknowledge or ignore what we are seeing and hearing. There are also too many technology choices. For decades, invasive plastic surgery that included anesthesia, scarring, and downtime was the go-to path to looking your best. Now, a never-ending stream of non-surgical procedures and treatments are being introduced to the industry. This creates a huge demand for less invasive treatments. But this introduction of non-surgical procedures also creates confusion for the patient who now has to sift through these limitless options. That creates a confused patient and a confused patient is typically a patient who procrastinates and is paralyzed with indecision. And, if that weren’t enough, plastic surgeons also need to take into account the multi-generations they are marketing to, who can range from young patients in their 20’s to mature patients in their 70s and 80s. These generational differences must be taken into account when marketing to plastic surgery patients. Each generation has its preferences, biases, and marketing channels they use to get their information. So, what do you do to attract new plastic surgery patients? FOLLOW YOUR SUCCESSES FIRST Before you go off on a tangent and start new marketing campaigns, go back to your data to see what has worked in the past and who has given you money for cosmetic rejuvenation. Once you know that, you simply increase your efforts there. That’s how you attract the best patients with target marketing For example, pull a report called, “Revenues by Procedure” to determine which of your procedures are most popular with your patients. (You will also want to note which are NOT popular to help you determine if you should discontinue offering them if they are not making you money). This is an actual report of a plastic surgeon who has been practicing for 18 years. Facelift, Breast Aug, Tummy Tuck were his top three surgical procedures, while injectables and Coolsculpting were bringing in a huge percentage of his non-surgical treatments. So, it would make sense for him to market those procedures first since they are proven to attract cash-paying patients to his office. Another report to pull is “Revenues by Referral Source”. This tells you how these cash-paying patients are finding you, to begin with. This actual report indicated that while the majority of new plastic surgery patients came from the Internet, more than ½ came from word-of-mouth referrals and current patients returning for more. That is good to know when you are budgeting various marketing channels since you can’t be everywhere, so budget proportionately to your results. TARGET YOUR MESSAGE TO YOUR PREFERRED PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENTS So, know that you know your preferred procedures and where they are coming from, look closer at those patients’ demographics. How old are they? Are they stay-at-home moms or professional working women? Are they single or married? Are they homeowners or renting? Kids or no kids? Draft a message that most resonates with your preferred plastic surgery patients. For example, if your data shows that a good portion of your revenues is coming from Tummy Tucks on women in their mid-40s who are married homeowners with kids, the following marketing messages will work well: Or, let’s say you enjoy facelift procedures and a good amount of your revenues comes from facial rejuvenation. You also know your average facelift patients’ age ranges from 45-65 and they are married and live within 25 miles of your office. In this case, these marketing messages would work best: Think of target marketing as being a sniper versus a cannon. Rather than “spray and pray” to everybody, you pick one procedure – one target market – one message – one media channel. I guarantee with this approach, you will attract the best patients with target marketing. You’ll also spend less and get better results when you target market the smart way."
8,Creative Pricing Strategies for Plastic Surgeons,business," Creative pricing strategies for plastic surgeons help you charge prices worthy of your skills and expertise while attracting patients who understand you get what you pay for, and they care more about quality than saving money. Money is a funny topic for cosmetic patients. It’s emotionally charged and hinges on beliefs and perceptions of price vs. value. But here’s the thing, a cosmetic patient can feel one way but be swayed to feel a different way once they are presented with a new perspective. For example, they would never consider paying a consult fee until they dig deeper into your before/after photos and patient reviews and learn more about you on your IG page. Now, they see the value in paying for your time. We all do it. We balk at the price as a knew-jerk reaction until we have more to go on that changes our minds. Your prospective patients have too much information and choices which makes it difficult for them to choose you. So, here are creative pricing strategies to help your cosmetic patients make sense of the price and move forward. STRATEGY #1:  ENHANCE YOUR BRAND Although you don’t have a powerful brand like Coca-Cola or Gucci, you have a unique brand that positions you in the marketplace. Bump up your brand with an updated website that has a fresh look and feel. Show off all PR efforts with you in the news or “seen in” publications like this one shown in the airline magazines. It’s a “pay to play” strategy but a clever way to say you are the best plastic surgeon without YOU saying it. You can also show off your skills and personality on social platforms through photos, posts, and videos. Get in the habit of producing more content than others by including a blog post you regularly write for and/or a consumer book. STRATEGY #2:  GROW YOUR CELEBRITY STATUS Since you are probably not married to a Housewife on the Bravo Show, your next best bet is to have local celebrities in your community make you their go-to cosmetic expert. It can be anyone with a following of trusted fans such as a radio host, socialite fundraiser, Instagram influencer, or someone who owns a popular business in your community. Have such a good relationship with them that they are anxious to tell their audience about you and the great results they get. STRATEGY #3: SHOW OFF SOCIAL PROOF Since you offer intangible services, prospective patients can’t see how great you are. They can only go by your reputation, both online and off. Use your patients to attract new patients. Fill up your photo gallery of before/after photos showing off results of your happy patients. Show different demographics so prospective patients can see themselves in your photos. Be sure to upload online reviews consistently by your happy patients to drown out the 1 or 2 unhappy patients. Ask your post-op surgical patients to do video testimonials in your office telling others about their experience. STRATEGY #4: SPECIALS FOR SPECIAL GROUPS Anytime you can make prospective patients feel special, they will gravitate towards you. For example, offer special pricing for teachers in the summer, flight attendants, realtors, mommies in the community, army personnel, and so on. STRATEGY #5: OFFER BUNDLED PACKAGES To help your patients get optimal results and keep the decision-making easy, create specifically themed YOU packages. Themes can be a certain demographic or based on season or holiday. Be creative. For example, Your Signature Breast Aug package includes all fees + pain pump + post-op garment + goody bag to include Beauty Bucks for lip filler, CoolSculpting, and Botox. Now add up all the costs and offer the package for 10% less. Let’s say the entire package retails for $7500; however, you save $750 on this bundled package and get so much more value for your money. Now, the patient can’t pull this apart and price-shop it with your competitors because it’s no longer an apples-to-apples comparison. STRATEGY #6: PLASTIC SURGERY PATIENT LOYALTY PROGRAM Rather than slash your prices to compete with the countless med spas, institute your loyalty program that eliminates discounting but encourages your patients to return, refer and review. For example, The KISS Rewards Club gives the patient a KISS for every dollar they spend and they collect them for free Botox, fillers, and lasers. They also get automatic KISSes when they refer a friend, leave a great review, and approve the use of their photos to be used in your marketing. Use these creative pricing strategies to help your prospective patients consider more than just price when choosing a cosmetic provider."
9,Is Your Staff Helping or Hurting Your Image?,business," Do you know if your staff is helping or hurting you’re the image that you have worked so hard to build? The number #1 complaint I get from surgeons is they have a great staff; however, they are just not skilled enough to promote you to prospective patients. So, you listen to callers hang up without booking, and you watch prospective patients walk out your door without taking any action. But here’s the thing… Everything you do to promote your aesthetic practice will be a waste of time and money if your staff can’t convert your prospective patients. Most surgeons don’t realize just how much money is slipping through their fingers because their team isn’t prepared to handle patient inquiries effectively. Everything from how your staff answers the telephone to how a patient is treated once they arrive will have an impact on your bottom line. Think about it . . . You pay all of this overhead to salaried staff members to work with your aesthetic patients so you can focus on the medical side of your practice only to find that 7 out of 10 of the prospective patients who came in for a consultation decided to wait, or worse — decided to go to someone else! WHY SUCH A LOW CLOSING RATIO? You see your staff greeting the patients, and it looks like things are going well. You watch the prospective patients talk with your staff and look at your before/after photos. The staff introduces you, and you have a solid consultation with the patient, so you think you have a new patient . . . . . . Only to learn the would-be patient decided to wait or to “think it over” — never to be heard from again. If A Prospective Patient Leaves Your Office Without Making a Decision, You Have Only a 15% Chance of Closing Them Later The fact is your staff may be unknowingly sabotaging your best practice promotion efforts because they don’t have the skills or the training they need to close. I assure you — you would be shocked at some of the things your staff is saying to the patients that are making them run the other way. WHAT IS POORLY TRAINED STAFF COSTING YOU? Thousands of dollars that could have been yours fall through the cracks when the prospective patient doesn’t book. But it’s not your staff’s fault they are ineffective — They Need Help! Most likely, they are doing their best with the limited skills they have and would do better if they knew better. ”Are you 100% sure your staff has the necessary skills to promote you and close the prospective patient?” Every patient interaction is an opportunity to either enhance your image that gets the patient through your door or it can be a train wreck waiting to happen. Remember, your staff is your connection with the outside world. What impression is your staff having on your valuable prospective patients? Anytime a prospective patient calls your office or meets with your staff, they are making an impression about you and your practice. For years now, I have called and met with practices to “mystery shop” to see how patient inquiries are handled and how their coordinators convert consultations. Quite frankly, I’ve been shocked by what I have witnessed. No wonder prospective patients aren’t booking! If you give your staff the magic words and strategies, they will gratefully use them to make you more profitable!

First and foremost, you need to understand what exactly an SEO company or SEO agency does on a day-to-day basis. Infact, this is the very first thing you would want to know about an SEO company before you hire them. Since SEO could cost you several thousands of dollars, you should have a detailed look at the activities that your hired SEO comoany or agency will perform. To understand the activities of an SEO company in a crystal-clear manner, you should know what SEO primarily refers to. Chiefly, SEO involves – Creation of content Generation of links (or backlinks) Performance analysis and improvement While many SEO companies may claim to perform all these tasks for your business website, it’s easier said than done. Creation of content means creating high quality, relevant content on a consistent basis. Likewise, links that an SEO company generates for your site should be high quality. Most importantly, the SEO company you hire should have extensive experience in SEO analytics and reporting so that results can be improved over time. But then, that’s just the tip of the iceberg! A reliable SEO company performs a wide range of essential activities to analyze the current SEO of your website, develop an effective SEO strategy, implement it and then keep a close watch on the progress and tweak the strategy as required for better results. So, this is what a good SEO company will exactly do – Conduct an SEO audit Perform a competitive analysis Research keywords Initial optimization Link building/monitoring Outreach Blogging Ongoing reporting/analysis To make their tasks easier, your hired SEO company will also use a wide range of online (free or paid) tools. It’s important that your SEO company or SEO professional keeps you regularly in the loop and up-to-date with everything that goes on your site on a daily basis, on-page and off-page. Different Types of SEO Companies Every SEO company that you come across or that approaches you isn’t a good one. In today’s industry, different types of SEO companies exist. And the SEO results will only depend on who you choose to work with. The Company That Resells: These SEO companies don’t actually focus on SEO or have SEO as their core services. What they actually do is close deals with you and then outsource the work to their partners. Since they don’t do it themselves, it creates a lot of issues throughout the process. And you’ll never know who you’re actually working with and what their expertise is. The Company That Thrives on Buzz: They act like big SEO companies. You’ll find them on a lot of listing websites or directories out there. All they focus on is making good profits by showing short-term results. The Company That Lacks Up-to-Date Knowledge: There are many SEO agencies that will have a number of SEO reports to showcase. These providers are actually larger in size than those that thrive on buzz. They will have a list of some clever SEO tools to show you. But the minus point with these SEO providers is that they are not up-to-date with the latest industry trends and algorithmic changes. The Company Next Door: These companies continue in business because of their links with larger SEO firms. It’s due to some key marketing tactics that they keep on attracting clients. In reality, their knowledge of SEO is limited. The Company That You Should Work With: This type of SEO company believes in working according to a well-structured strategy. So, they’ll create a specific, clear-to-understand SEO strategy for your website or blog. They’ll provide you with real case studies and reports along with references from real clients. They’ll keep you in the loop right from the beginning while being flexible. They strictly follow the webmaster and search engine quality guidelines and are always up-to-date with every new industry trend and change in a search engine’s algorithm. Warning Signs of a Bad SEO Company Hiring a bad SEO company can be detrimental to your business website or blog. Bad SEO doesn’t only fail to generate traffic, but it can make your entire site go down. When choosing an SEO company, you should proceed with extreme care. There are some warning signs that can help you identify a bad one. These warning signs include – Guarantees: Google updates its ranking algorithm on a regular basis. For any good SEO company, it takes time to deliver results. If any SEO company promises that they’ll double organic traffic to your site in 3-4 months, you should quickly get suspicious. Likewise, any agency that guarantees a #1 ranking position for a highly competitive keyword overnight is probably trying to sell you a lie. Lowest Price: Modern-day SEO isn’t child’s play. Achieving success at today’s SEO takes extensive research and planning. If the cost/month an SEO company is offering you for their service is incredibly low, you should take it as a warning sign. There’s no such thing as ‘unbelievable deals’ as far as SEO is concerned. Vague Explanation: It’s extremely important to keep yourself up-to-date with what your SEO company does to improve the SEO of your site. Most importantly, you should have a clear understanding of all the activities being performed. If your SEO company fails at explaining what they’re doing or gives you an explanation that’s not clear, you should suspect their activities. Things You Should Remember When you’re looking for an SEO company and planning to invest in SEO for long-term business growth, you should always keep a few important points in mind. It will help you make the right decisions. SEO isn’t Just a One-Time Investment: If you think you’ll do SEO once and the results will be visible for months and years, you’re mistaken. Organic search traffic falls down over time due to multiple reasons – search algorithm updates, outdated content and increasing competition. SEO is a continuous process, and you should keep working on it for long-term success. SEO isn’t Cheap: Hiring a good SEO company isn’t cheap. Five or ten years ago, you could easily get a boost in your site’s rankings by stuffing keywords into the meta tags and content and submitting to 1000s of directories. Today’s SEO requires a completely different approach and adherence to Google’s quality guidelines. It’s the age of content marketing and natural link building. If an SEO company provides SEO services for as cheap as $200 or $300 a month, you can imagine how much time they’ll be devoting to your site or SEO project. Search Rankings Change: No matter how great your website looks, it won’t bring you enough business if it’s difficult to find via search engines. Every business website is in need of good SEO for increased visibility. If you think your website can do without SEO, you’re only helping your competitor’s business make more profits. Understand the potential of good SEO and invest in an effective SEO strategy so that your website can be easily found by your customers. Hiring an SEO company is Best: Even if you have good knowledge of SEO, you may not be able to devote the time that successfully planning, executing, and managing an SEO campaign requires. Hiring a good SEO company will ensure a higher quality of services and a greater ROI. Now that you understand what an SEO company can do for your online business and how to tell good ones from bad ones, you should not make any more delays in hiring a good one for your specific requirements. It’s time you stopped asking yourself whether or not you need the services of an SEO company. Instead, you should decide how much you’re willing to spend. As long as you choose a good SEO company, you can be sure of getting an incredible return on your investment."

13,How To Setup A High Converting Sale Page,business," How to set up a high converting sale page is a question that every affiliate marketer faces at one point or another. As an affiliate, your biggest objective is to drive sales and earn commissions. But you also want your visitors to come back. And, as much as you'd like to leave your visitors hanging, you have to put up a sales page. You need to know how to setup a high converting sale page to make your online business succeed. The first thing you need to do when learning how to setup a high converting sale page is choose a good product. What kind of product? That depends on your niche. If you're in a niche with many products, choosing a specific product would be a waste of time. Choose a general topic that covers almost anything that your visitors might be interested in. This will cut down on the number of products you have to offer and thus cut down on the amount of effort it takes to get people to your site. Once you have a general topic to cover, start researching for products related to it. Google Trends will help you get some ideas on what are the current hot sellers. eBay is another good place to look for hot selling products. These online auction sites often have an ""Auction Center"" section where you can browse through products and bid on ones that you think will sell well. You can even write your auction listing. This is an easy way to generate some buzz about your sales page and attract traffic to it. Your next step on how to setup a high converting sale page is to pick out the keywords that will best describe your product. Focus on long-tail keyword phrases that have less than five searches per month for them. Targeting these kinds of words will make it easier for your visitors to find your product because the search engines have a tough time finding good ones. As you think of good content for your product pages, try to avoid cramming it full of too much information. Keep it clean and simple. If possible, link to a product review website instead of an actual product link so that potential customers can get a more in-depth look at a product before purchasing it. It's always better to give people the benefit of the doubt by allowing them to make a good buying decision first. In addition to having a good title, you need to have a high converting sales letter to give visitors an idea of what you are promising them. Many marketers get caught up in the process of generating traffic to their pages. They forget that the most important aspect of any Internet marketing campaign is to convert visitors into buyers. So before you even start writing your sales copy for your product pages, you need to know how to set up a high converting sale page. Your conversion rate is the number of visitors you have, who immediately clicked on your link and purchased your offer. A good way to determine your conversion rate is to see which of your product pages has the highest click-through rate. You can do this by visiting the Google External Ads Submission Center and seeing which of your ads had the highest click-through rate according to your own data. Once you have determined which one had the best conversion rate, then you know which one you should focus your attention on. Of course, there are several different things that you will want to keep in mind when you are looking at how to create high-converting sale pages. For example, the headline of the page needs to make the reader want to read more about your product. There is no point in creating a great sales page if the product does not appeal to the reader. Remember that you will have to give the readers information about your product and this should be as easy to understand as possible. You may find that it is easier to write some of the content yourself rather than relying on your writer to do this and if you want to make the most of your writer, then you need to find someone good at interestingly writing articles. The information that you provide about your product should be clear and this means that you should always give the reader enough information about the features and benefits of the item that they are looking to buy. It is important to think about how the information is going to appeal to the reader and make sure that they feel as though they are getting some great value from the product that they are considering. You are also going to find that you need to use a few different elements to ensure that the page is successful. The first thing that you need to consider is the title of the article. You are going to find that the title of the article is extremely important and this needs to be made according to the theme of your entire article. The title should be catchy and it should give the reader hints as to what they are going to find within the body of the article. It can be difficult to come up with an article title but there are some tools out there that can help. You should also make sure that your keywords are included in your title and that these keywords do not appear too many times throughout the article. In addition to this, you need to think about the call to action in the body of your article. This is an element that many people forget about when they are writing their articles. You should always make sure that you are asking the reader to click on a link that leads to something or to sign up for a free offer. This is how to create a high converting sale page and if you do this correctly, you are likely to get a lot of traffic to your website. The next thing you need to consider is the navigation within your article. This is an important element in an article and it should be well arranged and easy for the reader to follow. The reader must know where they are at and how they are getting to the end of the page. This is something that will have an effect on the conversion rate of your page and you should think very carefully about this. If you are not happy with the navigation of the page, you are unlikely to gain much traffic. Your paragraphs should be logical, relevant, targeted, and natural. If you do not create a good flow within your paragraphs, you are likely to lose readers. If you want to know how to create high converting sale page, you should think about using sub-headings and bullet points. These will make it easy for people to scan the article and find the section that they are looking for information. To sum up, there are 3 things that you should think about when you want to know how to create a high converting sale page. You should arrange your paragraphs so that they are logical, relevant, and natural. Your paragraphs should also be targeted and relevant. Finally, you should also use sub-headings and bullet points.

However, if you are trying to sell any type of affiliate product, then it's a good idea to choose links that don't directly target the audience you are trying to attract. This will ensure that your visitors get the most benefit out of the link you provide."

With a simple search on Google for things such as “dog walkers forum” will give you a long list of results relevant to your niche. But just signing up for a forum and posting every once in a while, about your business isn’t beneficial, nor is promoting your business every day. Instead, actively contribute and build a rapport with the community, while keeping your business out of it. Passively promote your business by putting a link in your signature or mentioning it only when the context is appropriate."

16,PECUNIARY SENTENCE UNDER CAMEROON PENAL LAWS,business," TOPIC: PECUNIARY SENTENCE UNDER CAMEROON PENAL LAWS Ayuk Nkwa Pascal ABSTRACT Pecuniary sentences are recognized under the Cameroon Penal Code and other penal laws of the country. Once a person is sentenced to pay a fine, the convict must pay such an amount or serve an imprisonment term in place of the fine. The term of imprisonment would depend on the amount involved. This means that there is imprisonment in default of payment provided for under the Cameroon Penal Code. Section 556 of the Criminal Procedure Code is to the effect that the fines and costs shall be paid to the Registrar-in-Chief of the court that delivered the judgment. Before payment, the Registrar-in-Chief shall issue to the convict without costs, a copy of the judgment containing a break-down of the pecuniary sentence which he has to pay. The general objective of this paper is to assess how pecuniary sentences are enforceable in Cameroon. In Cameroon, there are problems faced in the criminal justice system. And so in order to better dispense justice in the country this paper recommends that Members of the Bar Council should be represented in the Higher Judicial Council and there should be a strict application of separation of power in the country. INTRODUCTION There are a number of theories of punishment that explain why a blameworthy conduct is punished. Some theories like retribution explains that the reason why an offender should be punished is because the offender deserves the punishment whereas other theories like the utilitarian objects of punishment justify punishment by looking at the future; and so according to the utilitarian objects of punishment, the offender needs to be punished so as to reduce the incidence of crime in the future. This means that there justifications for punishing an offender; this punishment can be by way of imprisonment and/or fine. According to the Black’s Law Dictionary  the word ‘pecuniary’ means something of or relating to money; monetary. The Black’s Law Dictionary  defines ‘sentence’, as the judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer. Pecuniary sentence therefore is the judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty to pay a certain amount of money known as fine. FINES UNDER THE CAMEROON PENAL CODE Cameroon’s Penal Code provides for three types of punishments; Principal penalties which include death penalty, imprisonment, fine, dissolution for corporations, temporal or final closure; accessory penalties which include forfeitures, publication of judgment, closure of establishment, placement under judicial supervision and confiscation of “corpus delicti” and alternative penalties which include community service  and reparatory sentence. And thus fines is one of the principal penalties prescribed for offences in Cameroon. According to Section 25-1(1) of the Cameroon Penal Code  a ‘fine’ shall mean a financial penalty by virtue of which a convict, natural person or corporate body, pays an amount of money, specified by Law, into the Public Treasury.  Pecuniary sentence is equally applicable to corporations operating within the territory of Cameroon. Cameroon has recognized the need for corporate criminal liability in specific areas of law. Such limited and marginal acknowledgement of corporate criminal liability, became necessary due to the development of new forms of crime and the necessity to fight such new forms of crimes especially with the development of modern technics of information and technology, the need for the protection of the environment and the fight against terrorism as such lead to the multiplication of legal instruments consecrating the criminal liability of corporations . And thus Section 25-1(2) of the same code provides that “The maximum amount of fine applicable to corporate bodies shall be five times that provided for natural persons.” Where a corporate body is guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment only, the fine to be paid shall be from CFAF 1 000 000 (one million) to CFAF 500 000 000 (five hundred million) . According to Section 92(2) of the Penal Code, where the offence is by law punishable with loss of liberty only, the court may substitute a fine of up to CFAF 1 000 000 (one million) for misdemeanour or up to CFAF 25 000 (twenty-five thousand) for a simple offence. The Penal Code in its Section 68 further provides that “The offender’s death shall not prevent enforcement of pecuniary sentences against his estate or closure of an establishment, or confiscation.” PECUNIARY SENTENCE UNDER CAMEROON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE Pecuniary sentence is provided for under the Cameroon Criminal Procedure Code  in its Section 556. This section provides that “(1) Fines and costs shall be paid to the Registrar-in-Chief of the court that delivered the judgment. (2) (a) Before payment, the Registrar-in-Chief shall issue to the convict without costs, a copy of the judgment containing a break-down of the pecuniary sentence which he has to pay as provided for in section 558 (2) a). (b) After payment, the Registrar-in-Chief shall: (i) issue to the convict a receipt from a receipt book with counterfoil and when the decision becomes final a copy thereof without costs; (ii) forward to the Legal Department a copy of the receipt and an extract of the judgment when it becomes final. (3) Civil awards shall be recovered at the instance of the party concerned from the date following the day on which the decision becomes final.” Any person who is not detained and against whom an imprisonment warrant has been issued for non-payment of the pecuniary sentence may either forestall or terminate the execution of the said warrant by payment of the pecuniary sentence . IMPRISONMENT IN DEFAULT AS A MECHANISM FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF PECUNIARY SENTENCE According to Section 557 of the Criminal Procedure Code , imprisonment in default of payment shall be a procedure which aims at compelling a convict to execute a pecuniary sentence pronounced against him or make restitution ordered by a court in a criminal case. It shall be applicable without prior notice at the instance of the Legal Department in the event of non-execution of a pecuniary sentence or non-restitution of property. It shall consist of a term of imprisonment during which the debtor shall be obliged to work. This therefore means that where a person has been convicted to pay a fine, such a person must pay the fine if not would be made to serve an imprisonment term and the number of months or years would depend on the amount involved. Where imprisonment in default of payment is ordered against a prisoner, it shall be enforced on expiry of the previous imprisonment unless he furnishes sufficient sureties to guarantee the payment of the pecuniary sentence within a period of two (2) months from the date of recognizance . The judgment shall fix the breakdown of the pecuniary sentence to be paid to the state or to the civil party, as well as the duration of imprisonment in default in accordance with the provisions of section 564 . (b) Where the pecuniary award is made to the state, an imprisonment warrant shall immediately be prepared and signed at the time of delivery of the judgment and forwarded for execution to the Legal Department . Where the award is for the civil party and the judgment has become final, an imprisonment warrant shall issue at the instance of the civil party who has not been satisfied . Any person who is not detained and against whom an imprisonment warrant has been issued for non-payment of the pecuniary sentence may either forestall or terminate the execution of the said warrant by payment of the pecuniary sentence . After the execution of the imprisonment warrant, the convict may request its suspension by furnishing a surety guaranteeing payment of the pecuniary sentence within a period of two (2) months from the day following the signature of the recognizance by the surety . Where at the time of his arrest, the convict has furnished a surety; the judicial police officer charged with the execution of the warrant shall hear the surety and include his statement in the report .  A copy of the file of the arrest shall be forwarded to the President of the court and another to the Legal Department of the court that issued the imprisonment warrant . The President of the Court of First Instance of the place of execution of the warrant shall rule in chambers on the application, after hearing the convict and the proposed surety . Such a ruling shall not be subject to appeal . Where the application is granted, the President shall explain to the surety the consequences of his recognizance and shall request him to sign a document by which he shall undertake to pay the debt or failing that, to be subjected to imprisonment in default in place of the convict on expiry of the time limit provided for in section 560 .  After the surety has read and signed the recognizance, the President shall cause the debtor to be released forthwith . The provisions of section 185 (1) (b)  are applicable if the surety cannot read and write . Notice of the ruling shall be served forthwith on the Superintendent of Prison and a copy each shall be forwarded to the President and the Legal Department of the court that issued the imprisonment warrant . Where a surety is not accepted, the convict may make new proposals as many times as he wishes . (4) Imprisonment resulting from failure of the surety to abide by his obligation shall be terminated before the expiry of the prescribed period, only when total payment has been made. In case of part payment of the debt, the duration of imprisonment in default shall depend only on the balance due . The period of remand served by an accused sentenced only to a fine shall be deducted from the duration of imprisonment in default. This deduction shall be made by the President of the court at the time he signs the imprisonment warrant . According to Section 564(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in matters of fines and costs, the duration of imprisonment in default shall be fixed as follows: 	Twenty (20) days for amounts not exceeding 10.000 francs; 	Forty (40) days, for amounts higher than 10.000 francs but not exceeding 20.000 francs; 	Three (3) months, for amounts higher than 20.000 francs but not exceeding 40.000 francs; 	 Six (6) months, for amounts higher than 40.000 francs but not exceeding 100.000 francs; 	 Nine (9) months, for amounts higher than 100.000 francs but not exceeding 200.000 francs; 	Twelve (12) months, for amounts higher than 200.000 francs but not exceeding 400.000 francs; 	Eighteen (18) months, for amounts higher than 400.000 francs but not exceeding 1.000.000 francs; 	Two (2) years, for amounts higher than 1.000.000 francs but not exceeding 5.000.000 francs; 	 Five (5) years, for amounts exceeding 5.000.000 francs. In matters of damages to the civil party, the periods provided for in sub-section (1) shall be reduced . Even though an imprisonment in default of payment can be passed on a convict who has failed to pay a fine, it should be noted by that an order of imprisonment in default of payment shall not be passed against a person less than eighteen (18) years of age or more than sixty (60) years old, or against pregnant women at the time of its execution . An order of imprisonment in default shall not be executed simultaneously against husband and wife even for the recovery of sums relating to different sentences . On the expiry of the time limit for prescription of the sentence, no imprisonment warrant shall be issued any longer for the recovery of fines and costs . No imprisonment warrant for the recovery of damages or for restitution may be issued ten (10) years from the date following the date when the judgment became final . The execution of an imprisonment warrant issued before the expiry of the period of ten (10) years shall be enforceable until the prescription of the debt . According to Section 569 of the same code, imprisonment in default shall not be pronounced against persons declared vicariously liable and insurers. In the case of Nduh John and Mudang Johnson Vs. The People , the court held that there are two reliefs available to a convict against whom an imprisonment warrant has been issued. First he may forestall or terminate the execution of the warrant by payment of the pecuniary sentence. Secondly if the warrant has been executed and he is incarcerated, he may suspend execution of the warrant by furnishing a surety guaranteeing payment of the pecuniary sentence within 2 months from the day following the signing of the recognizance by the surety. EFFECTS OF IMPRISONMENT IN DEFAULT Any person imprisoned by virtue of an order of imprisonment in default shall be subject to the same prison regulations as those convicted under the ordinary law . A convict who has been subjected to imprisonment in defau1t shall not be absolved from payment of fines, costs and damages, or from making restitution for which imprisonment in default has been executed . (b) The Legal Department or the civil party may at any time attach movable or immovable property of the convict up to the amount of the debt in accordance with the Procedure for the enforcement of civil judgments . The time limit for taking of the action provided for under subsection (1) (b) shall be thirty (30) years, to run from the day after the imprisonment in default has ended . When the duration of imprisonment in default has been served no other order of imprisonment shall be made for the same debt .

17,AMAZON AND GOOGLE VALUE BRANDS OVER PRODUCTS,business," As digital marketers and online retailers have realized, the manner in which people buy products has completely shifted over the last 10 years. We used to shop online for basic items sold from a commodity-positioned e-commerce site. Nowadays, those generic domains are being downgraded as authority sites due to Amazon introducing Branded Storefronts and Google Rankings which prefer brand domains over generic domains. This is similar to Google’s Rankings in regards to website searches. These powerhouses of the Internet are the #1 forces affecting the growing importance of developing a branded online shopping experience for your customers. Amazon brought branded stores onto their site in 2017, marking a change in thinking for the leader in e-commerce. Amazon is now making it possible for consumers to search based on brands, not just product types alone. There are also many opportunities for consumers to use an amazon promo code when placing an order, coaxing them to use the Amazon platform rather than purchasing straight from the brand, making brands more popular on Amazon. There is evidence that branded stores on Amazon are being organically ranked higher than generic product listings. Google has been favoriting branded website domains over generic names for quite a few years now. Exact match domains (EMDs) seem to be given a lower authority ranking by Google, whereas branded domains usually come out on top. Consumers who are typing “auto products” into their search bar will be given websites of brand domains that are specific and established long before they are presented with autopartproducts.com, for example. Google’s algorithm for deciding rankings is very complicated, which is why perfecting SEO is not an easy task. Because of this, many businesses opt to use things like Bigfoot Digital SEO Services to make sure that their site will receive the highest possible rankings on Google. In a recent article from WordStream, the author articulates that EMDs dropped in value on online search engines when customers started to become conditioned to distrust generic web domains. Using these market forces as indications of future trends, it is clear to see that brands are going to stick around. Creating a powerful online brand presence is still necessary to selling online and in retail. While digital development is advancing at a blinding pace, the impact of a strong brand remains the same. So the question is, are you forming a brand line of products and services, or just selling products and services alone like so many others?"
18,Accounting vs. Bookkeeping: What's the Difference?,business," If you're in a small business, it's important to understand the difference between bookkeeping and accounting. Bookkeeping is an administrative function that keeps track of your transactions. Accounting on the other hand is more detailed and includes things like income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow analysis (not just day-to-day transactions). Knowing which one to use can be tricky; this blog post will help clear up any confusion! What is the difference between bookkeeping and accounting? Bookkeeping is the process of tracking your everyday transactions and activities. Accounting, on the other hand, analyzes these same transactions to provide an accurate financial statement for your company. The major difference between bookkeeping and accounting comes in how they compile information about a business' finances: Bookkeeping is primarily concerned with managing day-to-day transactions and generating reports of cash-in and cash-out. Accounting, on the other hand, is responsible for compiling these transactions into financial statements that provide a detailed overview of your company's finances from month to month or year to year. What do you need for your business? No matter what your end objective is, the process will always need to start with bookkeeping.   Bookkeeping tabulates the sales and expenses and takes the records (that may or may not be in a disorganized pile) and creates organized and accurate reports. After you've gone through the process of categorizing, sorting, and reporting your bookkeeping information, it's time to turn to accounting. Accounting can vary in complexity - while every business will need to file their end-of-the-year reports for tax purposes - outside of this reporting requirement every business will have different requirements. How to select your professionals? Depending on the size of your business and the transaction volume you may or may not need a full-time bookkeeper (or team of bookkeepers) on staff.  The volume of transactions is as important to this need is more important than the total volume.  A business can do a million dollars in sales on one invoice, or thousands of invoices. A bookkeeper is someone you will work closely with, and they should be a fit within your business culture.  This person can be an employee, freelancer, or, business management agency. Your accountant is a key member of your team, and experience and knowledge are critical.  Remember, the cost vs. benefit discussion from a past post?  This applies here also.  A sole proprietor business will not have the same requirements as a seven-figure corporation, and therefore does not require the same professional.  Connect with a few different people to determine what qualities you value most, and who will be the best fit for your business. Can the same company do both? Absolutely!   A qualified professional should be able to provide a complete package of services that will bring your bookkeeping and accounting needs together.  This is what you're looking for because the best professionals in this field know how they can help streamline processes and make it easier for you as an owner. Bookkeeping and accounting are two different functions in your small business. Bookkeeping is the process of tracking your everyday transactions and activities, while accounting analyzes these same transactions to provide an accurate financial statement for your company.

20,How to create content efficiently,business," How long does it take you to create your content, from ideation, production, publishing and all the way to promotion? Hours? Days? Weeks? This is my guide on how to create content efficiently. The time invested in your content development is the reason that you should maximise its effectiveness. Reach more audiences, on more platforms, more often. The secret to efficient content creation. Take, for example, your strength in content creation. It might be a podcast, video or blog that you are currently creating; something at the core of your content development. You’ll go through your normal process to produce it anyways. But here is the secret. Don’t stop there. The worst possible thing you can do is move directly to the next project. It’s inefficient and wasteful. You will miss a whole new potential audience who use other channels as a preference to engage with content. Or, you will miss the opportunity to send frequent messages to those that are using your preferred channels. Maximise the value of all those hours you have sunk into your content by reusing that single piece of content. Or, turn one long-form piece of content into many short-form snippets of engaging promotional material. Why you should follow my advice? We have witnessed the shift of influential publications and talented content creators all vying for prime positions. It makes it far more challenging to break through the noise. Today, in order to reach the same number of people, you need to do much more. More channels, more often. It’s not all doom and gloom however, you can be smart and effective in the way you deploy your resources. We’ll show you how to create content efficiently. How to create content and maximise its value The main content formats are written video and audio. No matter which you start with, you can always get to the others formats and thereby – tripling the amount of content you produce. Reach new audiences and channels with your Podcast If you start with a podcast, we always recommend that you record your podcast with video. That way you instantly have a way to publish to video channels such as YouTube and Vimeo and reach an audience who prefers consumer content there. You will also have, engaging, visual promotional assets that you can edit and distribute across social media; short-form clips of great quotes and thought pieces from your guests. Your goal should be, not to necessarily grow your podcast, but to get your personal brand, company, or ideas in front of as many relevant eyeballs as possible. Transcribe your podcast and post the transcription for those trying to find content like yours on search engines. Take the transcription and turn it into thought pieces, blogs and articles, interweaving quotes from your guest to enhance its authority. You have 20, 60, 120 minutes of content every time you publish a podcast. Ensure that you maximise the time and effort you put into it by pushing it into new channels. Promote your videos beyond YouTube Video content is highly visual, so the process of turning it into written and audio content can be more challenging. Here are some ideas to make a video and turn it into a podcast. It will need to be tweaked in order to publish it as a podcast. Where visuals would have once provided context, you now need to provide add additional descriptions. Take your script alongside your storyboard and read both the voice over and provide descriptions when required. If you have a video in which visuals are central, your podcast can be a spin-off, taking fans through the production of your video giving great context to your audience on your methodologies. If these are not viable, you can always focus on written content with supporting visuals. Transcribe your video and upload it to your website with images supporting the copy. Your content is then searchable in full by search engines and can attract a new audience who would not have found you otherwise. The topics that your videos explore can simply be written as stand-alone pieces. It is far easier to write something that you are very familiar with, than an entirely new topic. If you have written a script for a video – write it as an article at the same time. You’ll find it an efficient process with all your research and supporting visuals completed. Clips of your video are suitable for all kinds of visual channels, such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube Stories and many more. Take your complete video and cut it down into snackable parts. Grow audiences outside your current channels with little effort. Turn your written content into audio & video Although many of us like to write, most social platforms are skewed to support visual elements. Long, structured, paragraphs can lose the interest of users quickly. Or, out of preference, they prefer to listen or watch content. Just like this written post for example – it does not need to stay in this format. Try reading this article aloud. It could easily be a perfect podcast. Can you see quote-worthy extracts that would be perfect as a short-form video? Absolutely! We already know from the above sections that it’s easy to take a podcast and turn it into a video. So, record yourself reading your article. You have long-form videos to publish on channels such as YouTube. You have video quotes of your articles to publish on social channels. You are not longer restricted to your website, but you can publish your brand and ideas everywhere. It should not be a matter of “if” you publish to other channels, but “when” and how regularly. That is how you grow a large audience and that’s how you become efficient with your time. Content Archival Revival The final thought is the most important on how to create content efficiently. Once you have hours and hours of content, what do you do with it next? If you transcribe your audio and video content in full (so you can maximise its value) you can store content in a searchable library. That means you can go back to that podcast episode you created 2 years ago where someone mentioned a topic or subject becomes relevant again and republish it. Boom! Hours of content already ready and waiting to be given a new lease of life. You’ve got a massive back catalogue of content, so isn’t it great that you can publish it without any effort. Reach more people, more often and with less effort."

2,Plastic Surgery Virtual Consultations,business," As the world becomes more digital, plastic surgery virtual consultations become more mainstream. It opens up new opportunities for plastic surgeons to embrace technology and new ways to connect with their prospective cosmetic patients through virtual consulting. WHY PLASTIC SURGERY VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS? If you are getting (or want) more patient leads that stretch farther than your own neighborhood, you will need to set up a process to accommodate them. For those patients really far from your office, it could be cost and time-prohibitive to visit once for a consultation and then schedule another visit for the surgery, so make it easier for prospective patients to get to you and your expert services virtually. And, frankly, cosmetic patients (local and out-of-state) are getting more demanding and may not want to spend their time visiting you in person when they would prefer to meet you online first to see if there’s a fit. Also, let’s remember what the plastic surgery consultation is all about… Years ago, I interviewed a world-renowned facial plastic surgeon, E. Gaylon McCoullough, MD from Golf Stream, AL since patients fly in from around the world to his 5-star resort practice and this is what he told me: “I asked the doctors who train with me, what is the objective of the consultation and most of them get it wrong.  The main purpose of the consultation is to establish a relationship.  Once you’ve done that, you won’t have to worry about the procedures, because the patient is comfortable and confident.  They trust you.  They know if there’s a problem, you are there to take care of them.” The virtual consultation is one of those steps to building that relationship and trust. TECHNOLOGY LIMITATIONS OF VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS Keep in mind the technical skills of you, your staff, and your patients. Not everybody is up to speed on the latest platforms, apps, and technical ways to communicate. For example, some practices have the patient email them photos and then do a FaceTime call with them; however, that’s got its limitations. Not everyone uses an iPhone (shocking, I know!) or has the tech-savvy know-how to email their photos. And, the cell phone screen size is limiting. You can also use Google Hangouts and Skype; however, the patient has to download the app and have an account set up so that’s an extra step and could confuse patients. And, if you make the patient feel stupid, that hurts your relationship before you even start, so keep it simple! DRAWBACKS OF THE VIRTUAL CONSULTATION The biggest drawback to virtual consultation is the loss of human contact. Since you cannot look the patient in the eye with a virtual consultation, you cannot build trust and confidence as you can live. In a virtual consultation, you cannot put your hands on the patient to help you bond with them and touch their particular concerns.  You also cannot look them in the eye to determine who they are as a person. And, cosmetic patients are not only drawn to you for your skill and cool website but also your interaction skills. The patient gets a sense of who you are as a surgeon by gauging how easy you are to communicate with and how genuinely interested and caring you are to their wants and needs. HOW DO PLASTIC SURGEONS DO VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS? Keep it simple! Here is what I suggest: Use a video conferencing platform like Zoom.us. They can record your call for future reference, and you can show your screen to the patient. For example, you can show other patients’ results or show your notes drawn on this patient’s photos. Send the prospective patient an email asking them a few pertinent questions about their desires and health history and save the rest for later. Let the patient take selfies and text their photos to your office cell phone. Most people know how to do that so make this as easy as possible. For now, you are just trying to establish a connection with the prospective patient so you can start building a relationship with them. Show them a graphic of how you want the photos taken. For example: Have your coordinator do a pre-consult call with them to learn more about their health history and so on and send them a simple Zoom link they click on to join the online meeting. Some practices have the coordinator meet with the surgeon first to review the photos and make an initial recommendation, along with a quote. That way, the patient is more qualified when they do get on a virtual consultation. Or, when you have completed your virtual consultation with the patient, your coordinator can call them back to go over pricing and scheduling then. Also, allocate enough time to the virtual patient so they don’t feel rushed. Tell them upfront you have set aside 20 or 30 minutes for the call so they know you are willing to spend time talking with them. Be sure to preface your recommendations with statements such as, “Based on the photographs in front of me and our initial online meeting, here are my recommendations; however, I cannot/will not finalize my plan until I see you personally.” FREE OR CHARGE FOR A VIRTUAL CONSULTATION? You can offer free or charge the same consultation fee as your live consultation or offer a discounted fee. Test it to watch for no-shows and who ends up converting more often – those who paid a fee or those who did not. Another way to look at it is you took as much time with the virtual as you did with the live consultation and you still have to perform a live consultation anyway, so these are double the usual time. DO VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS CONVERT? Just like live consultations, it depends. As a general rule, if you charge a virtual consult fee and look/sound good online, your conversion rates should be above 60%. But that also depends on your pricing and availability and how much you help these patients with logistics to make it easier for them to say yes. Virtual consultations are helping to weed outpatients who are simply shopping around so you will most likely see fewer consults; however, those you do talk to are much more likely to book. Frankly, the Internet gives you so much more exposure to prospective patients who would otherwise be reluctant to come in for a typical consultation, so virtual consults give the patient a comfortable way to get to know you and your staff. LOGISTICS Most virtual patients come in a day or two before the scheduled surgery so they can meet you meet face-to-face so you can have a meeting-of-the-minds to determine the game plan and finalize things and save them the second trip. Regarding the fee plan, after the virtual consult, they decide to move forward, you could have them put down ½ non-refundable payment to reserve the OR time and staff or have them pay in full before they arrive and then refund them ½ if it’s a no-go. Just be sure the patient understands you always have the final say-so in deciding if this virtual patient is a good candidate and if they have realistic expectations and that cannot be determined until you see the patient up close and personal. The bottom line is virtual consultations are going mainstream for all sorts of reasons so please embrace it and work out a process with your staff to keep it easy, yet effective.

4,The benefits of first aid training in the workplace,business," There are many good reasons to have first aid trained employees in the workplace; even in an office which can seem a very safe place there are risks. Accidents can happen anywhere and at any time, so it is best to be prepared. First Aid workplace training courses provide a wide range of practical first aid skills which would be invaluable in the workplace and are also very useful in domestic environments. First aiders need to have the ability and background knowledge to deal with a wide variety of first aid emergencies in the workplace. When selecting courses, specifically for workplace environments, they should meet the standards required for compliance with Health and Safety (First aid) regulations, this also helps ensures regulated and quality assured First Aid training. Businesses in the UK have a  legislative  imperative to provide adequate and appropriate equipment, facilities and personnel to ensure their employees receive immediate attention if they are injured or taken ill at work. ‘Adequate and appropriate’ will depend on the working environment. It is advisable for employers to carry out an assessment to determine whether first aiders are required and what first aid equipment and facilities are needed so they can implement the necessary first aid provision as required under the Health and Safety (First Aid) regulations 1981/1982 in the UK. So, other than complying with the UK’s Health & Safety Executive (HSE) regulations, what are the practical benefits of first aid provision in the workplace? Regardless of regional legislation, first and foremost, first aid treatment can save lives and the earlier the patient can receive treatment from life threatening injury or illness, the better chance they have of surviving, Therefore, having someone trained and able to take control of a medical emergency and administer first aid can prove to be critical for the injured party. Treatment of less traumatic illnesses or injuries can be facilitated by the correct use of a first aid kit, quickly, and on site by trained employees. Recovery time, if any is required, is often substantially reduced, allowing the employee to return to work with less disruption to business operations. First aid provision also makes employees more aware of potential dangers, helps to make them feel valued and gives them confidence and clarity if an emergency were to occur. There is a wide scope of First Aid courses available with varying programs, dependent on your assessment requirements. If you are unsure which course would best suit your needs go to training courses for further information about off and on-site training for your employees. First aid training can help employees deal with minor injuries or illnesses in the workplace or more serious  emergencies such as cardiac arrest. Specific courses for  Automated External Defibrillator Course (AED) will give attendees a deeper knowledge and the confidence they need to deal with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), show them how to administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and also the correct way to use the AED equipment. The benefits of First Aid workplace training and AED/CPR training far outweigh the cost, and of course the cost is nothing compared to its potential to save a life and ensuring a healthy workplace."
5,11 things a Startup can learn from Clarkson’s Farm,business," Some say he’s one of the most successful TV personalities and that he is a farmer now. All we know is that he’s called Jeremy Clarkson. Many people would recognise the name from Top Gear, the enormous international hit TV show. Apart from being known for Top Gear, he is also a journalist, author, host of ‘Who wants to be a Millionaire’ and many more things; with the newest being a farmer. After Leaving Top Gear, Jeremy and the core crew signed up to create the Grand Tour on Amazon Prime, a very similar show to Top Gear. Amazon Prime allowed Jeremy to be a bit more experimental and released Clarkson’s Farm in June 2021, documenting Jeremy’s efforts to become a farmer of 1000 acres that he owns. In typical Jeremy Clarkson fashion, he named his farm Didley Squat which is a bit tongue-in-cheek as he thought it was producing nothing. I recently finished Season 1; an entirely entertaining 8 episodes. I couldn’t miss an episode as each had the perfect mixture of entertainment, facts, beautiful cinematography and visuals. His sharp commentary and sarcasm made me laugh many times, and I was very entertained. I also learned so much about farming which I never imagined I would find interesting. It’s the perfect kind of documentary— highly entertaining and educational. After the show finished, I started searching for news on Season 2, but nothing sadly, nothing announced yet. After that disappointing search, I began to think about the other message or parable that I could take from the show. I could see Jeremy’s headfirst dive into farming as his own start-up journey. Through those eight episodes, we can learn how to apply what we see to a start-up building something new. We can see that Jeremy has the mindset of a start-up; he is confident and believes in his goals; he is not scared to dive into new challenges, he is willing to try and take learnings along the way; all of which are often highlighted by his frequent use of “I did a thing.” After the previous farmer retired, Jeremy thought to himself, “I can do that” and decided that he would farm the land. This is the same mentality that some founders have when starting. They get their idea and dive headfirst into their idea without doing their research, understanding the market, and making calculated moves. For this reason, 10% of start-ups fail in their first year, and a staggering 90% fail overall (StartupStatistics). In Jeremy’s example, he dove in headfirst but was lucky to have the significant financial backing of his own as well as Amazon behind him, which he makes clear in the last episode. Unfortunately, not all start-ups are in this position, and there is a lot at risk when starting on your own, especially if you dive in headfirst without looking into properly. “In my mind, then, farming would mostly involve leaning on a gate while munching pensively on a delicious Dagwood Bumstead sandwich, or enjoying a late-summer sundowner from behind the wheel of an air-conditioned tractor. It’d all be a festival of crusty bread, lemonade, fresh air and cider with Rosie. Followed by a cheery harvest festival and a big fat cheque from the EU. I’ve learnt, however, that all of it is back-breaking and difficult, that there’s never time for a ploughman’s in the sunshine, that there’s no cupholder in my tractor for sundowners or anything else and that to be a farmer you must be an agronomist, a meteorologist, a mechanic, a vet, an entrepreneur, a gambler, a workaholic, a politician, a marksman, a midwife, a tractor driver, a tree surgeon and an insomniac.” Another mistake that we can learn from Jeremy is what we have personally seen in some of the 35 guests we have interviewed in the DevReady podcast: having success in your career does not automatically translate to success as a founder of a start-up. Jeremy was very successful in his TV career with Top Gear and The Grand Tour but that knowledge of cars did not translate to purchasing a tractor for the farm. He opted for a large Lamborghini Tractor imported from Germany. However, he knew about cars and not farming and did not realise that it was potentially too large, contained the wrong hitch (equipment that connects other machinery) and had no English manual. With some more research and time devoted to this task, Jeremy could have made a better decision that would have cost him less money and time. While we have his mistakes to learn from, we can also learn from his wit and successes. Jeremy did a great thing early in his farming journey, which serves as a lesson to other start-up founders: surround yourself with great advisors. Jeremey hired Charlie, the agricultural consultant, an expert in the field and used him as a sounding board, a source of reason and expertise throughout the series. Sarcastically he was called Cheerful Charlie, by Jeremy, as he would always tell him as it was rather than what he wanted to hear. This is the job of a great advisor. As a founder, you do not want an advisor who will nod and agree with what you say but will challenge and question your motives and plans. They have the expertise and know which questions to ask, and you should be aiming to leverage them as much as possible. Another common failure point with start-ups is assembling the right team. When you are first starting, you cannot afford to have anyone and must do things yourself, or if you are lucky, you will have some people working for sweat equity. If you are even luckier, you will have some of your own funds that you can use to keep yourself and a small group of employees operating. Jeremy also attempted to farm his land himself but quickly realised he was out of his depth and started hiring. Please take note of this point as hiring someone who has had experience in a start-up or technical expertise in a similar field is okay but not ideal. It would be best to find someone in the centre of that Venn diagram of start-up experience and similar technical experience. These employees bring more to the table and can help leapfrog some early issues. On Clarkson’s Farm, Caleb was not only entertaining through their back-and-forth banter with Jeremy, but he was also an experienced farmer and had a deep knowledge of the farm itself. He was able to name all the Farms fields while Jeremy had no clue. He looked for people who had previously worked on the farm, allowing him to leverage the knowledge of his farm, putting him one step ahead. The first job on the farm and Jeremy’s first objective was to plough the farm and then seed planting. As he did not know what he was doing, he used the common-sense approach and asked his advisors and team members who have experience, how it should be done. He listened to their advice, was shown by them how to do it, and then was left to do it on his own. This is the exact process a founder should follow when attempting a task that has been done before. There is the odd case when you are innovating so much that you are at the frontier, and no one knows how to move forward but these start-ups and few and far between. But just when you thought Jeremy had everything going for him, he made a common start-up mistake: not having patience. He felt that the process he was demonstrated was too slow, and he could do it better. He tried to take shortcuts to get to a result. Although the effects of those shortcuts were not immediately noticeable; further down the line, he would face consequences. When it came time to harvest, the density of his seeds was not as high as it should be. He should have been harvesting two tonnes per acre but was only getting 1.5. The other effect of those shortcuts was a little more noticeable and made tending to the crops a lengthier process, and he did not follow the instructions correctly. He made it more difficult to get machines through the crops to spray and maintain them. He stuffed up his ‘tramlines’ and made it more complicated than it needed to tend to the crops throughout the season. Just like any other founder, Jeremy tried to capitalise on opportunities by trying to get more revenue. This opportunity arose after he told the audience that the government pays him to keep some of his fields as wild grass. Still, he would have to mow it throughout the year. His idea was to purchase sheep that would keep the grass in check and then sell the sheep. The idea is solid in theory, but he did not run the calculations and did not do a risk assessment. That ended up costing him time and made little money. He thought on his feet and went with it, which is a trait of a good founder. Whether it’s good or bad, a decision is made and allows you to move forward. Jeremey did not dwell on the decision he made and complain about the effort needed for the reward. He moved on and used it as another learning opportunity. He had to bring on a Shepard to help look after the flock. When it came time for lambing season, he used the shepherd’s expertise to help deliver the babies. He was observing and learning. Then one night, he was left on his own, and a baby was being born. Did he shy away from the challenge? No, he went in and assisted with the birth. He might have made a mistake and put his hand in the wrong hole but figured that out pretty quickly and adapted. He did another thing. The parallel that we can map from Jeremy’s sheep experience to a start-up journey would be to understand when to stop continuing down a path after the decision is made and focus your efforts on a task that will help drive your objectives forward. Every situation can be a learning experience, but you need to weigh the effort involved in progressing and get beyond the sunken cost fallacy of the decision branch you are currently on. Another thing Jeremy did was to try and create some revenue during his farming season, which is something start-up founders try to do. How can you make some money on your journey until your main product is ready? Jeremy set up the Didley Squat Farm Shop selling produce from his store. Now a huge advantage he has compared to any other start-up fonder is that he is a celebrity who people would come to see, leading to substantial traffic queues of people coming down to see him. The lesson we can learn from this endeavour is to potentially consult, utilise our expertise or create some partnerships that, in the long run, would ultimately assist in moving forward. It is not always the best decision to do this as it can take efforts from the final objective and delay your outcome, but it can also help you get there if done the right way. If you follow Jeremy’s model and decide to direct some efforts in a side project that can provide a revenue stream, plan it out and think it through properly. Jeremy had made mistakes in this venture, e.g., not checking planning permits and building permits correctly. Still, he also made some very calculated decisions about the positioning and placement of his store to ensure he would have foot traffic. He chose a corner of his farm bordering a campground, ensuring that he would have a constant flow of customers. Even though he had identified the shortcomings of those ideas and was ultimately delayed because of the mistakes he had made, he persevered and kept moving forward with the planning and eventual opening of the store. Jeremy did another thing. Jeremy, while being confident, like a start-up founder, was not afraid to admit when he made a mistake or underestimated how difficult a task may be. He always tried to correct his problems as he moved forward, as shown when he harvested his crops. He did not have undercover storage for his wheat crop, and it had to stay outside in a temporary location. To sell the crops, he had to call a grain merchant to come and collect his harvest, but he only ordered one truck, which was enough to pick up one load from the harvester instead of the 20 he needed for the whole crop. He had to stop harvesting, and then when they were able to resume when it was good weather, he organised the correct number of trucks to collect it all. This is a classic example of underestimating a task and moving forward with a decision. Jeremy also faced outside pressures, as all start-ups do. Whether these pressures are from competitors, environmental, time-based, Jeremy met these issues. But the weather was the biggest problem and it was out of his control. It was raining too much when he started, and he could not prepare the fields and plant his seeds. During summer, it was too hot and not enough rain was falling on his crops. He complained about the problems he was facing, as everyone would. However, he did not just sit there and do anything about them. Jeremy tried to create temporary solutions to help irrigate areas of the farms using solar panel pumps and sprinklers and a water tank to take water around from the rivers around his farm and keep things growing. He showed the trait of a successful founder. When faced with obstacles Jeremy created solutions to keep pushing forward. He did not stop and complain about everything out of his control. So, what can we take from the article besides a summary of some of the key activities and plot points of the show? At the end of the show, he had completed one year of his farm start-up and just like any other start-up, he learnt a lot of new skills, made mistakes, kept moving forward and barely made any money. However, he enjoyed the process and said it was the happiest he had ever been. This is what a start-up should be like. You should love what you do; otherwise, you will not have the drive and determination to keep pushing for something that you have no love or passion for."

Tips For Launching Your First Ebook One of the best ways to turn your digital passions into a money-making business is by selling ebooks on the internet. Anyone with a strong desire to write can make their dreams a reality, turning writing into an extremely lucrative pastime. If you begin selling Books, you can help others in your position. Making your first eBook is surprisingly easy, and this quick-fix article will guide you through all the important steps as you learn to make money from selling ebooks on Kindle and other digital reading devices. First of all, decide what sort of eBook you want to produce. Are you going to write one yourself, or pay someone else to do it for you? Many people choose to self-publish their books, but you can also use services such as Amazon's Create Space to create and upload an eBook to be made available to the Kindle marketplace. Whichever method you choose, your ebook should be informative, entertaining, and contain some kind of call to action. The next step is to pick a domain name for your website. This is pretty simple - just choose a domain name similar to the name of the eBook you are publishing. Amazon is the biggest buyer of eBooks, so if you have already registered your eBook with them, they'll be the one who will be displaying it on their platform. This is the first step towards making sales from your new website. Once you have an attractive website, you need to start writing your first ebook. It is recommended that you use a good writing program such as Microsoft Word to make sure that everything is perfect before you sell ebooks. Even if you are a beginner, it is always easier to make changes to your work in the editing stage than when you are trying to sell it after it is completed. After you have written your first ebook, you need to make sure that you build an email list of subscribers to whom you will be sending your ebook. This can be done by using a mailing list management software like Aweber, or you can simply add an email button to your website. You need to make sure that you build your email list to promote future sales of your ebooks. Make sure that you add your affiliate link to every email sent out to your subscribers. You should also consider creating a forum on your website. This is a great way to get questions answered about your ebooks, as well as to share your knowledge and ideas with other people who may be interested in purchasing your ebooks. Using forums is a great way to build customer loyalty and trust. If you are marketing an expensive product, such as a printing press or graphic design software, a forum is a great way for people to ask you questions. Just make sure that you are always willing to help your customers if they are unsure of something. Once you have built up your email list and your forum, you can start promoting your ebook. One of the easiest ways to do this is to write reviews for your ebook. In addition to writing a review for each of your books, you can also send an email to your list with a link to a location where you will accept credit card payments. Selling on sites like ClickBank or Commission Junction is a great way to make sure that your books are paid for and that you are making money from selling your ebook. Finally, you can begin the actual writing process. Writing your first ebook can be a daunting task. This is why many people choose to publish their first ebook online in conjunction with the traditional publishing process. With a little bit of luck and the right planning, you can launch your ebook publishing process successfully. With some luck and proper planning, you can be enjoying your ebook profits in no time at all! All you need to do to get started with getting paid for promoting your own ebooks is join the kotobee program. I would strongly suggest that you join the kotobee program, but that's up to you. You can also use Word press, MySpace, or any other social media site to promote your own product."
8,Important features in store site design,business," One of the most important things to consider when designing a store website is its features. An online sales site can only be intended to sell a specific product or to sell a wide range of products. Therefore, some basic features and facilities are available in all store sites, but others are added according to the needs and necessities of the business. For this reason, we decided to mention some important features of the store site and its basic and advanced facilities. Customer panel design Customer panel is one of the sections that in most cases not much attention is paid to its design. While this can have a direct impact on customer satisfaction. Suppose a user comes to your site and wants to buy a product. If he is confused after adding it to the cart and does not know how to complete the purchase process, he prefers to leave the site and enter the competitor site. Although the customer panel is the last part of the product sales process, its design is not simple at all. We have divided the features of this panel into three separate sections, respectively; Shopping Cart, Shipping Information, Payment Information. In the following, we will fully describe the information related to each section. Cart • Product information such as name, color, size, code • Number of products purchased • Shipping cost • The amount payable • Discount rate • The final price • Register a discount code Post information Address Information: Enter the address or select the sending address How to send Determine the sending time interval Payment info Ability to choose the payment method Possibility of payment on the spot View the total purchase amount Show shipping and packing costs View the total purchase amount Access to the rules and conditions of return of goods Ability to print product order receipts Search system design One of the most challenging topics for our team is the design of the online store site search section. When the customer enters the site and enters the name of his product in the search box, the required product should be displayed in the category of related products. The more accurately and intelligently your site search engine is designed, the more likely it is that your products will sell. In fact, site search is not just about displaying results, but it should be included in the design of an online store site that is user-friendly and interactive. In the following, we have mentioned the features and facilities that are very important for the search section of your store site. Search box with distinctive design and color The search box is the part whose design is neglected when designing a store site. Using this section, your customers can search for any type of product on the site and choose it for purchase. For a better display, this section should be designed in a different color. In addition, it is very important to put the word ""search"" inside the box and to consider the button and the colored box in its design. Search results page with clever design The professional design of the site search section is determined from the search results page. Our site design team designs the search results page in such a way that when a customer searches the site, all the products appear in a separate cell with its name, price and ranking on the results page. In addition, we place feature-based product filtering options on the right side of the page so that customers can find the goods they need based on the desired features. Another feature that we add to the design of our store site is the ability to display a close-up view of the product (from different angles) on the results page. By adding this feature, your customers can see all parts of the product without having to click on it. Smart auto-complete Have you ever typed a part of a product name in the search box or Google and the rest of the product name is displayed automatically. This happens if a code string called SLI (Search Learning Improve) is used in the site search section. In fact, by placing this algorithm in the search section, we strengthen the site's search engine and increase the site's sales up to 6 times. Advanced product filtering in search results The search results page is the beating heart of a store site. This page is the part where the user decides to buy the product with one click or leave your site. Designing this section is not an easy task and many web design companies do not design it properly. We design a site search engine based on what our user is looking for on the site and what they expect from the search. Suppose a women's clothing retailer comes to your site and is looking to buy blue clothes. Because this person has already made a purchase on your site or done a search, just typing the word blue will show all the blue clothes on the search results page. In addition to clothing, there are other blue goods for sale on the site. In addition, we can design the site search section so that products that are ready for sale and products that have just entered the site are displayed in two separate sections. Dedicated page design One of the most important parts that we pay attention to in designing a store site is the use of custom designs for its pages. Dedicated design means the use of a graphic design and user interface that reflects the type of brand and product of the store. This way, when a customer enters your site, they will easily remember your brand. Ability to compare products In our opinion, the design of a professional online store should be such that customers can easily compare different products with each other and then buy the best product needed. We will consider this possibility in all store sites that we have designed. By selecting the option to compare two or more products on the search results page, the user will compare the features of different products side by side. Ability to submit user comments One of the important features that we activate in all pages of the store site is the ability to register user comments. When customers can post their positive and negative comments on a product page, they will actually share their shopping experience with others for free. In this way, new users are encouraged to buy and potential customers become loyal customers. Create favorites There should be a section on each store site so that customers can mark the goods they intend to buy in the future. The list of these items will be added to a section called Favorites so that customers can purchase them as soon as possible. Connect the online store to the inventory One of the most interesting features in the design of a store site. Show the amount of goods in stock. For this issue, we connect the warehouse automation section to the store site. From then on, the number of goods in stock is displayed on the page of each product. By doing this, customers can determine the popularity of the product and, if the product is running out, do not delay buying it. Ability to search for products with long keywords Most users who visit your site will search for a product that fully understands its features. For example, when a man is looking for a ""medium-length white long-sleeved shirt"", he enters exactly the same phrase in the search box. In our view, a good store site should be able to find products for users with long keywords. Because 70% of users' searches are from this category of words. Of course, it is interesting to know that the sales of products for these words are very high. That's why we design a search engine online store site that has this feature as well. Provide a list of products related to the purchased product One of the most useful features we have for store sites is keeping track of the user's purchase history and the pages the user has browsed. Suppose a user comes to your site and chooses a shirt to buy. After adding the product to the cart, on the product page, we offer the person a list of goods such as shoes, sandals and accessories that he can use with this dress. This will not only buy the list of all the clothes needed for the party, but also increase sales. Another great trick we use to design an online sales site is to provide a list of former customers' purchases. Suppose a user logs in and buys a mobile phone. After the purchase and the customer entering the site, a special offer can be considered for them. He considered a part of the page with the title ""Customers of this product have also bought these goods"". This section actually offers similar tastes to customers. If the customer sees this section, he will be more motivated to buy the goods. Match Breadcrumb for all pages It must have happened before that you enter a store site and want to search for a product. One of the most common tasks after searching for a product, clicking on it and reading its information is to return to the product classification page. Breadcrumb is an advanced web site design feature that can make your search or that of your customers much easier; This means that customers can achieve their desired category without clicking on the sidebar menu and selecting a category. Look at the photo below. This photo shows an example of breadcrumb. The customer has achieved a specific product by choosing the category of computer, laptop, laptop model and then its accessories. In designing a store site, what is important is that the customer can return to the path and category they have already gone through. Breadcrumb will make this easy for customers."
9,Will The Next Office Be a Shipping Container?,business," Anything old has a new outlook on life. Shipping containers that have been upcycled and converted into office space are known as office containers. This trend is expanding to multifamily and even office space, with fashionable office dwellers installing them as individual offices inside the property. Most have been fitted with windows and doors, as well as insulation, allowing you to store your desks and computer equipment. An architecture of a shipping container is the use of containers as a building material, which has grown in popularity in recent years due to their strength, availability, and relative cost-effectiveness compared to other building materials. The benefits of using shipping containers for this is the strength. Shipping containers are designed to hold heavy loads and withstand the strain of being stacked in high columns, as well as extreme weather conditions. Because of their durability, shipping containers can also be used as safe storage containers. Shipping containers can be conveniently combined into larger structures because they have a standard width and only two standard height and length dimensions, making design, preparation, and transportation much easier. They're even built to interlock, making transportation even simpler. One of the uses of containers is used as an office. Office containers have a variety of sizes, such as 10ft, 20ft, and 40ft, depending on how large the container is needed. The 10ft office container fits only for one desk, because it only has length 2.99m and height 2.59m. Meanwhile, the 20ft office container can fit two desks and four chairs, with the length of the container is 6.06m and height 2.60m. Last but not least, the 40ft office container is the bigger one of another. More than three office desks and six or more chairs can be accommodated. This can be adjusted to fit the room's layout based on your preferences and needs. A sanitary can be added to this container office. If you're looking for office space, a shipping container could be a good option."
10,Post-COVID Marketing Strategies for Plastic Surgeons,business," Now that most practices are “open for business” again, you are probably enjoying a surge of cosmetic patients who have been waiting anxiously to get in to see you. That’s fantastic, but I’m not sure you should count on that surge lasting. A majority of cosmetic patients still fear for their safety, and or they have uncertainty about the economy, and if they still have a job, they are on the sidelines waiting it out. So, what do you do when the demand for cosmetic services decreases? Typically, you spend more on advertising to find patients ready for your services. And you drop your prices because you would rather lose some profit margin than lose the patient altogether. But now you need to see more patients make up for the discounted pricing, so you need to spend more on advertising to find more patients, and around and around it goes. Before you spend more on random advertising and drop your prices, check out these 3 marketing strategies proven to keep you busy: YOUR CURRENT PATIENTS ARE YOUR GOLDMINE The fastest and straightest path to one of the easiest sources of new profits is to consistently go back to your past and current patients. The fact is, your patients trust you already, they have faith in your abilities, and they like you. They are already bonded with you so wearing PPE isn’t going to dramatically hinder your relationship as it will with brand new patients who don’t know you. They are more likely to agree with your recommendations, say yes, and move forward faster, while new patients need to shop around. When you honor their loyalty, they will reciprocate by returning…. It’s that simple. The secret is to “see” each patient as a revenue-producing asset and a member of your team. Treat them with respect and kindness and show your appreciation and gratitude for them choosing you over all the other competitors surrounding you. FOCUS ON WORD-OF-MOUTH REFERRALS Most practices rely on somewhere between 20%, 40%, 70% of their business on referrals. Yet, they have not given any thought to having a system in place for referrals. They simply wait around and hope that referrals are going to come in on their own. But the lifeblood of every profitable practice is lots and lots of referrals. Patients come in from the recommendation of another patient. That costs you nothing except great customer service and good results. The best part about referred patients is they are less cost-sensitive, convert more easily, and are pre-disposed to refer somebody else. You can’t buy that kind of advertising to attract patients who are 90% ready to convert before they even meet you. Brainstorm about all the little things you can do that cost you little but are actually high value to patients who see you went above and beyond their expectations, so they remember a “WOW” experience with you. For example, present your post-op surgical patients with a goody bag full of your skincare products, referral cards, thank you note and a gift card to experience your non-surgical procedures. CHANGE YOUR MESSAGE The way to get attention in today’s crowded world is to be different. That means stop doing what everyone else is doing! Since our industry has matured, many practices fall into “sameness”. But then you don’t stand out as a better choice for your patients. It’s time to change your message. For example, rather than the same message of “Hello, I’m a plastic surgeon”, change it to “Welcome, I will use my skills and expertise to help transform you into the person you’ve always wanted to be, safely and with impeccable customer service so you feel like part of our family.” But then live up to that. While everyone else sends appointment reminders, your coordinator personally calls to introduces herself and help prepare them for their consultation. While everyone else waits for patients to call if they have any concerns, you make courtesy calls to ensure they are comfortable and happy. And, while everyone else discounts their services or uses vendor programs, you strategically honor their loyalty with your own customized rewards program that does NOT discount but does encourage them to help you grow your practice in several ways. I promise you, if you would focus on growing your practice “from the inside out” rather than the “outside-in”, that’s where all your leverage is to grow faster, easier, and cheaper than your current attempts. If you need a marketing plan to “attract – convert – follow up – retain” cosmetic patients, I have a Predictable Patient Attraction Plan that does just that. I guarantee at least a 300% return and the work is done for you. You will have an automatic steady stream of cash-paying patients who: •	Return again and again •	Refer their friends •	Give your great reviews •	Share, like, and post about you on social and more. Schedule a call with me to see if your practice has what it takes to grow faster, cheaper, and smarter."
11,Top 5 Money Makers in Your Practice,business," There are 5 essential money-making operations that occur in ANY successful plastic surgery practice. If you miss any of these 5 key elements, you’re leaving a lot of money on the table – often several HUNDREDS of thousands of dollars. However, the reality is that most practices focus on ONE area only (instead of all five) and that is hurting them, and they don’t realize it. I guarantee if you focus your time and energy on these five areas, you will attract more patients, perform more procedures, and make more money….. all with less effort. Here are the 5 key areas to focus on to win: •	Lead Generation •	Converting callers into appointments¬¬¬¬ •	Converting appointments into paid procedures •	Encouraging these patients to return, review, post, and share •	Building an army of raving fans who refer you to their friends and family Think about it. Don’t a majority of your surgeries come from word of mouth referrals and existing patients coming back for more? So, the biggest problem holding you back is your narrow focus on “getting more leads”. You might be throwing a ton of money at SEO, Google AdWords, social advertising and directories OR you’re spending a ton of time creating content for your Instagram and Facebook followers. Yes, it’s exciting to get lots of leads and comments but here’s the kicker…Leads are only one part of the new lead process. These leads need to be converted because if you can’t monetize these leads, then you’re throwing money down the drain. However, if you KNOW how to monetize the leads through the other 4 key elements mentioned above, then you can run circles around your competitors and even CRUSH them. Here’s an example: •	Let’s say your competitor is spending $2,000 per month on PPC. For this amount, he gets 10 people to call. Most of the PPC leads are “price shoppers”, so let’s say he converts 4 out of 10 into an appointment. Only two of them show up, and only ONE of them is getting a procedure for $1,000. Your competitor doesn’t follow up with the leads, so they are lost. This means he makes $1,000 from the 10 leads, and he spent $2,000. Does that sound familiar? •	Let’s say YOU are spending the same $1,000 per month on PPC. You also get 10 people to call. However, your staff has a proven sales script that gets you SIX appointments (instead of 4 like your competitor). All of these SIX are excited to see you, so all of them are showing up for a consultation. You close 3 of the 6, and you’re offering the SAME procedure for $800. You make $2,400 on the initial call. However, you have a proven system in place, and over the next few weeks you systematically follow up with the remaining 7 leads that did NOT book a procedure. Through systematic follow-up, you’re getting 1 more patient out of the remaining 7, bringing your total revenue to $3,200. You upsell your 3 new patients on skincare or more Botox, and you earn an additional $1,500. In addition, you get 2 more reviews from them, and 1 out of the 3 new patients refers a friend. The friend does the same procedure for $800, so your total revenue is now $5,500 for the $1,000 you spent on PPC. Let’s compare: Your competitor made $1,000 on a $1,000 investment, and you made $5,500 on a $1,000 investment. So, what do you think your competitor is doing next? Probably “testing” PPC for a few more months, getting increasingly frustrated that he’s not making money and then moving on to another marketing strategy that sounds interesting. And what will YOU do? Since you’re making $5.50 on each $1 that you spend on PPC, you will spend as much money as possible, constantly tracking your results to ensure that you’re getting the same return on your investment and within a few months, you will DOMINATE your zip code while your competitors are still fiddling around with the next shiny object strategy that comes their way. Do you see how focusing on a plan that includes all 5 money-making operations makes all the difference in your revenues? Before you write off a certain marketing strategy, look carefully at your results and back-end processes to determine where the breakdown is since there’s a chance it’s not what you think. Ask yourself: •	How quickly do we respond to these leads? •	Can our receptionist convert our callers to appointments? •	Is our coordinator equipped to convert our consultations to paid procedures? •	Do we have a plan in place to encourage our patients to return, refer, and review? If not, what is that costing us? Attracting new cosmetic patients online has become a big expensive challenge for surgeons like yourself so it’s time to fight back by having your operations in tip-top shape as diagramed above."
12,Matrix and Financial Freedom,business," As you know, there are certain rules on which our entire world order as a whole is based. Whether we like it or not, we have to either obey these rules or stay on the sidelines of the big game called life. Thus, financial freedom is the result of certain actions that correspond to the established rules of this game. In fact, most people believe that our world is exactly as we see it. But you have probably already realised that our world is the MATRIX. Undoubtedly, modern computer processors and graphics accelerators have stepped in their development so much that the graphics of recent games are almost impossible to distinguish from our so-called reality. Game developers admit that you can simulate anything. The only question is the limitations of the computer ""hardware"", that is, the capabilities of the computer itself. And the fact that conventional processors will soon be replaced by so-called neuroprocessors, which are much more powerful than usual ones, makes you think a lot. So what is this Matrix? How can a person find himself in it? And is financial freedom possible? Surprisingly, all the answers are within ourselves. Moreover, the journey inside is necessary for us in order not to wander outside. In the modern version of the Matrix, everyone can find their way and be the Chosen One. Your financial freedom is just one of the options for the development of the chain of events. Thus, you need to make a choice. If you decide that you are not the Chosen One, then you will be right. If you decide that you are the Chosen One, then you will be right. Do you need knowledge and financial freedom? It's up to you to decide… Considering the above Matrix, take 100% Online Shop OzGalore for instance, that has proven to work in this very competitive world. It doesn’t stop there, it has chosen to what extent it should go above and beyond to achieve higher. Sky's the limit."

Then you give your professional recommendation of what you could do to address her concerns. •	Have your wife or family member ask you questions about plastic surgery that you hear repeatedly at your consultations. •	Show before/after photos of your patients on an iPad and explain the process of what they had done. •	Interview your patients using video conferences with screen share (such as Zoom.us) and have them tell their story: •	What was bothering them (the pain they were in) •	Why they chose you over your competitors •	What the process was like (easier than expected) •	How great they feel now Add Entertaining Content Some of the most popular surgeons got that way because they are authentic and real with their patients. They show more sides of themselves than just their surgeon side. They show they are a family man, an artist, a dog lover, an exercise enthusiast, a great cook, and so on. Just do what feels most comfortable to you. Your current and new patients will love getting to know you better. When they feel more comfortable with you, they are way more apt to go to the next step and that is to meet you in person. The content can be still photos, short videos made with your iPhone, longer videos made with your iPad, and video conferencing at your PC while you’re showing your screen of before/after photos. Repurpose the Content Here is the beauty of creating this content. One piece of content can be repurposed into so many other bits of content on different social platforms. That’s the secret to scaling content. Do it once and then spread it all over the Internet to reach a broad range of new prospective patients who go to these various platforms to get their information. So, let’s say you made a video of a mock consultation with your family member so here is what you do: •	Send to your current patient list first since they are most likely to respond •	You upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo, IGTV (Instagram), and Facebook watch •	You have it transcribed and turn it into articles, blog posts, press releases, and RealSelf Q&A •	You upload screenshots to Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat with a link to watch the video •	You pull the audio MP3 from the video and start a podcast and upload to many podcast platforms And, here’s another growth hack…. whichever content gets the most likes, shares, and comments, turn it into an ad for that platform so it reaches many more consumers than just the little organic reach you get. Be sure to also add it to your website so when they click on it or anywhere else on your website, you can retarget them to see your ad. Obviously, this takes tech-savvy know-how but there are plenty of people who can help you (maybe even your own kids who hang out on these platforms all day.) Collect their contact information Now here is the caveat to putting in the effort to create this content. … You must also collect their contact information so you can follow up when this pandemic is over. Every content piece you create should have a way for your audience to give you their name, cell, and email. THIS is how you build your brand and list during COVID-19. Stay healthy!"
15,COVID-19 Restart Plan for Plastic Surgeons,business," As the United States reopens for business, you need a plan so read this COVID-19 Restart Plan for Plastic surgeons so you are set up to win once you reopen your practice to cosmetic patients. If you want to talk to me personally about your own plan, schedule a Complimentary 30-Minute Strategy Call. PLASTIC SURGEON COVID-19 SURVEY RESULTS Growing a cosmetic practice as we know it, has changed…big time thanks to COVID-19. I surveyed plastic surgeons from around the US to learn their concerns about restarting their practices post-COVID-19 and here are the main anxieties you are dealing with: •	The health and safety of your staff and patients. •	Your cash flow that abruptly came to a halt and you’re wondering if it’s coming back •	Refunding booked surgeries if the patients are scared to move forward •	The uncertainty of patients still wanting surgery due to the fear and economic uncertainties they face •	Bringing back your staff and hoping you have enough patient flow to keep them productive and your overhead manageable •	Taking appropriate precautions to protect you, your staff, and your patients, while also seeing enough patients to be profitable. While these concerns are warranted, there’s always a way to turn things around so let’s continue… PREDICTIONS After interviewing several surgeons on my podcast, “Beauty and the Biz”, attending medical society webinars, and watching White House briefings, here are my own predictions….. Demand for Cosmetic Procedures There will be an initial surge of cosmetic patients who believe they NEED cosmetic rejuvenation. They have been stuck at home and want to get back to looking good and feeling great. There will be a certain group of cosmetic patients who wanted cosmetic surgery but will now settle for non-surgical treatments to tide them over until they feel safe and financially secure. But then what? Will the demand return as before? I believe that will take some time. Just like it did in the 2001 and 2008 Recessions. The demand for cosmetic rejuvenation is still there by all accounts; however, we don’t know how many consumers will be afraid, or unable, to spend big dollars on surgical cases. Competition/Pricing Some of the 22K med spas and some practices that were underfunded won’t survive. Of those that do survive, many will drop their prices to attract patients; further, commoditizing this industry. That’s why it’s more important than ever to differentiate you as educated, skilled & experienced. Do not be shy about showing off your surgical degrees, before/after photos, and awards so patients can see why you are a better choice. New Safety Guidelines Limit You You can’t have a crowded reception area so you can’t see as many patients. What does that mean for your revenues? As a solution, you could extend your hours to make up for it; however, that will increase your overhead so do the math before deciding. Marketing for New Cosmetic Patients You won’t be able to spend as freely to attract new cosmetic patients unless you’re getting a great return on your investment (ROI) or you’ll run out of cash. That means no more “ego/brand advertising”. My advice to you is: “If you can’t track the results, don’t spend the money.” Plastic Surgery Virtual Consultations For those surgeons who have embraced this, virtual consultations have proven to be successful and will become Mainstream because cosmetic patients will demand it for consultations as well as post/pre-op visits. Put a process together to orchestrate a virtual consult just as you do in real life. However, I suggest putting parameters around it. For now, these consults should be free but then charge to avoid no-shows once we are out of the woods. COVID-19 RESTART PRACTICE PLAN STRATEGIES FOR PLASTIC SURGEONS Ok, that’s the bad news. But like everything else in life, it’s your choice how you REACT to this. If you keep your growth mindset in check and be smart, you will overcome this challenge just like you have other challenges in your life. I implore you to think logically and NOT emotionally at this time, using the strategies below to restart your practice: Strategy #1: Target Market the Best Cosmetic Patients We don’t know how many consumers can still afford your services. We do know unemployment has hit an all-time high so that means, you want to “target market” more than ever before. Obviously, discretionary income will take a huge hit for the foreseeable future, so answer this question: Who is most likely affected and least likely to be affected by economic dips? Focus on the latter group who have the financial wherewithal to not only weather the economic storm but also have the resources to move forward with cosmetic rejuvenation. Every marketing & advertising dollar counts so prioritize: •	Current active patients who have given you money before •	Old patients who know you but haven’t been in for awhile •	Those who came in for consults but didn’t book surgery •	New patients who don’t know you yet AND have the financial wherewithal to afford your services (target high-income zip codes, homeowners, professionals) Strategy #2: Build Your Brand When an industry is saturated with a supply of cosmetic rejuvenation providers including plastic surgeons, cosmetic surgeons, general surgeons, non-specialty doctors, NP’s, RNs, PAs, laser techs, and aestheticians….. …….You don’t compete on price. You compete on your brand. However, your brand is NOT just your Website. It’s only one piece of the puzzle of YOU. It’s the personality of your practice and a promise to your patients. Your brand relays your values, how you communicate your services, what you want consumers to feel when they interact with you, your staff, and your practice processes. As Jeff Bezos of Amazon says, “Branding is what people say about you when you’re not in the room.” Your brand = Trust + Safety + Helping others so here’s what you do: Safety: Make videos, checklists, statements talking about all the precautions you have put into place to protect your staff and patients from the virus. Trust: Differentiate you with your education, experience, a skill that others can’t compare to when it comes to choosing the best provider. Helping others: Show you have a generous heart with pro-bono efforts and giving back to your community. Strategy #3: Cosmetic Patient Marketing Content Now is the time to adopt quality over quantity in procedures and patients. Focus on marketing the procedures you can do in-house and that gives you the most profit using the least amount of resources and drop everything else for now. AND, review which referral sources give you the most revenues (not the most traffic) but the most paid procedures. Keep in Touch with Current Patients The patients who already know, like, and trust you are always your best audience so stay connected to them via email, text, and social media. Give them reasons to like, share, comment on your content so other prospective patients, like them, will choose you as well (see examples below): Reach New Prospective Plastic Surgery Patients The whole world just went digital so please adapt to it, so you don’t get left behind. BUT, be sensitive with your messaging. Since marketing plastic surgery during COVID-19 is touchy and could hurt your brand, your #1 objective is to build your brand and your list – NOT to market and sell your services. You do that with the 3 E’s: Empathy: The goal is to enter the conversation your patients are already having in their heads that you need to address such as: Show your concern for patient and staff safety more than promoting your services that could hurt your brand if you look greedy and insensitive. Educate: You still have a huge population stuck at home and online all day looking around for answers to their questions. Do Q&A videos for each procedure and offer a free virtual consult during this time. Entertain: Get attention and stand out by showing different facets of yourself so prospective patients get to know you better. Examples include you in the kitchen cooking for the family, how you stay fit, show off your dog tricks, etc. Strategy #4: How to Reach New Plastic Surgery Patients Social Media is not free. You think you are posting and reaching your patients but, in reality, only 5-10% of them are actually seeing your content. Just like you had to pay for ads in newspapers, radio, and TV, you have to pay for ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube. But that takes money, creativity, experience, and patience. You have to kiss A LOT of frogs to get that one princess who gives you money. That’s just the reality. Content Strategies While you are well within your rights to promote your services, please be sensitive to the fears and challenges of the cosmetic consumer patient. Start out easy and keep it light at first. Award cosmetic patients with a gift card toward their first post-COVID-19 treatment if they do any of the following: Surveys/Polls: Ask 3 simple questions to get a feel for where patients’ mindsets are at with things like: •	What do you miss the most: Botox or Fillers? •	Will you wait or come back now? •	What’s your post-COVID-19 Wishlist? Contests •	Best face mask •	Best Botox wear-off photo •	Best home exercise •	Best free app Patients Stories: Build up your social proof by encouraging your current patients to share their own journey, with photos, to help other prospective patients get comfortable with cosmetic rejuvenation. Have your patient explain why they wanted plastic surgery, why they chose you (that’s why others will choose you too), what the process was like and how great they feel now. They should post it on their social media platforms and then you be sure to reply with a thank you Strategy #5: Improve Your Patient Experience + Processes Use this forced downtime to your advantage by working ON your practice since you can’t work IN your practice. Meet with your staff on a Zoom conference call and go through each step of the Patient Experience from A-Z. You are looking for the holes that lose callers and consultations and keep patients from returning and referring, as well as wastes your time and money for no good reason. CONCLUSION This COVID-19 Restart Pivot Plan above will keep you in the game, so you are in great shape to thrive when the dust settles. But it’s up to you if you’re going to execute these growth strategies or sit back and wait for things to get better on their own (they won’t.) My team and I are happy to do the work for you if you don’t want to but please get it done. Your future depends on it. I hope this was helpful to you and I look forward to your feedback – P.S. It’s difficult to think clearly when you are emotionally charged with fear: How can I bring in revenues? Can I afford to bring my staff back? Will the patients return? and so on. That’s why it’s helpful to speak to someone who has perspective and distance who can objectively help you think through things, so you come up with a practical plan of action to get you through to the other side.

16,Automated Marketing Plan for Plastic Surgeons Post COVID-19,business," Even though America is slowly re-opening from the COVID-19 crisis, you don’t really know what will happen in terms of patient confidence and the state of the economy so you need an automated marketing plan for plastic surgeons post-COVID-19. As a plastic surgeon, these questions, most likely, swirl in your head: Will patients return or will fear for their safety or budget keep them away? Will enough patients spend enough to make you profitable or just keep you and your staff busy but losing money? Do you double-down on your marketing efforts to attract new patients ready to say yes or do you discover your extra efforts only managed to drain your budget? All of this uncertainty weighs on you. You depend on a steady flow of cash-paying patients willing to pay a fair price for your services, but will they continue to do so now that the world has turned upside down? WHAT DO YOU DO POST-COVID-19? What you do next will determine how you re-enter the marketplace to get the quickest results possible to build up your practice once more. You have an enormous opportunity to attract and convert cosmetic patients anxious for your services…….. but, so do your competitors. What’s going to make the difference for you? THE ANSWER IS AN AUTOMATED MARKETING PLAN FOR PLASTIC SURGEONS POST-COVID-19. If you don’t have one, you need one…NOW. If you already have one, you need to perfect it…NOW. Why...you ask? Because my guess is, this will NOT be “business as usual” when you open your doors. There will be a fight for cosmetic patients, now more than ever, so you need to win your fair share while spending the least amount. Your automatic marketing plan needs to be firing on all cylinders, so you have systems in place to: •	ATTRACT the right patients who are least likely to be affected by economic downturns and are willing to pay a fair price for your skill and expertise. •	FOLLOW UP on every single lead in a systematic way so more of them are converted to take action than to mysteriously drift away…never to be heard from again. •	TRACK your results so every dollar you spend on marketing and advertising works hard for you to rebuild your cosmetic practice. Not sure if you are set up to win? Trying to go it alone and figuring it out yourself? Maybe you have attended your medical society webinars, read a marketing book, or received free advice from your vendors but here’s the thing… General information is NOT what you need right now. You need a shortcut to hit the ground running when your doors open. You need a new objective perspective from someone with 35 years of sales and marketing experience who has worked with hundreds of cosmetic practices to “find the money” they couldn’t see because they were too close to the situation. You need a customized marketing plan that incorporates YOUR specific branding and YOUR specific assets, mapped out, in writing so you have a specific plan for attracting new patients to you. During this COVID-19 pandemic, I am offering to review and improve your branding and marketing plan for a fraction of my regular $15K fee for consulting. But only until they lift the orders to stay home so act now. I’m doing this to help you survive. I guarantee to find holes that cost you missed leads, missed new patients, and thousands of dollars. Once your customized marketing plan is in place, you no longer “hope” for results. You see your results in black and white. You don’t have a cosmetic practice without a steady flow of cash-paying patients, and you don’t have those patients without an Automated Marketing Plan. I will check out your current plan to find the holes and put new levers in place that you never thought of that are keeping new patients away."
17,How to Have a Strong Digital Presence,business," How to Have a Strong Digital Presence Let’s face it: businesses that have a poor or non-existent digital presence are invisible to a large clientele, and as a business owner without a strong online foothold you may lose out on possible future sales and loyal customers. A critical factor in the success of many businesses is through presentation, which can be achieved via personal branding and social media. For small businesses and entrepreneurs, a strong digital presence is even more important. Here are a few ways you can improve your digital presence. Utilize social media platforms. High-value social media platforms, like Facebook and LinkedIn, are a great way to reach audiences and other professional businesses in your field through common interest. Moreover, these platforms are a great way to demonstrate the “face” of your brand – the personality, the interests, the values, etc., and allow you to better connect with potential customers and make your brand more “relatable.” Social media is low-effort, low-cost, and can subvert the way you initially perceived how a business can interact with its target audience. You can encourage discussion, create polls, stream live, or even chat with customers through private direct messages. All in all, social media platforms encourage relatability and can draw in more customers – and even potential business partners! Start a blog. “Content is king” – we all know that. When you offer valuable, insightful content that is high-quality, you contribute to your online presence and offer free information to your clients which may both attract potential customers and even retain existing ones. By creating a blog, you can embed a wealth of information that your customers depend on and can engage with as they please. When you create your blog, you can also add your brand’s own personal spin on it. Incorporate a voice specific to your brand and how you feel it should sound to your audience. Incorporate your values – i.e, if your brand is big into the environment, make a few posts that are centered towards switching to reusable household items vs single-use! Finally, Google and other search engines will rank valuable, high-quality content with the right keywords much higher than any pages generated by your generic content mills. You can enhance your online presence by ranking higher on search engine results, generate more traffic, and attract more customers. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly. Having your website be accessible by mobile is one of the best ways to ensuring users can reach you. In fact, it is expected that the number of people using some means of mobile – whether that is via laptop, tablet, or computer is only going to go up. You want your website to be visually attractive, but you should also consider optimizing it for mobile devices as well. Google will also rank websites higher that are mobile-friendly as well, meaning that optimizing your websites to be accessible via mobile will help in your SEO journey. There are mobile-friendly tools you can use to test how your website appears if you are accessing it via mobile. Prioritize networking. Networking is an essential aspect of running a business, as it improves your connections between other brands, audiences, and increases your overall chances of success. Social media is one of the easiest ways to network, smoothing out all the bumps that come along with traditional networking practices. There are no travel costs, no location barriers, and it can be a lot more efficient to achieve the kind of reach you want. Networking encourages connections via shared hobbies, passions, and interests. This is true for both professional relationships and for customer relationships. You can reach out to other brands and explore shared values and strengthen your bond with social media giveaways and collaborative content. Try Facebook groups, LinkedIn, and Instagram to forge connections with other businesses and your clientele. Boost your reputation. By offering valuable content to your customers through your blog, social media platforms, and forging connections digitally by answering questions and becoming a place of valuable information, you boost your brand’s reputation. One of the greatest ways to acquiring potential leads is through referrals, which can be achieved if you have a solid reputation. Your current clients may refer others to you! Another way to ensuring your reputation is solid is by acquiring small business insurance. This shows to your clients and hiring bodies that you have a financial backup, and you are invested in your work."
18,"Architects: Artists, Scientists, or Both?",business," When one thinks of architecture, what comes to mind? It may be thoughts of old gothic steeples peering over a European hillside or maybe a sprawling modern metropolis reaching high into the sky. These thoughts reflect the meticulous and stylish design that architects utilize in the course of their work. Even so, many architects apply for work visas under the O-1A (extraordinary ability in science, business, education, etc.) instead of under the O-1B (extraordinary ability in the arts) prong. So why is this? In some cases attorneys and architects may ignore or not realize the amount of creativity needed to design or create a building or a structure. The Creative Process It all comes down to one thing, the process. An architect needs to approach their work with strategy that encompasses creativity and functionality. It starts with drafting an architectural design and amending those to the satisfaction of the client. Next is bringing the drawing to life and truly visualizing the final product in a three dimensional state. Obviously, architects rely on science and mathematics but that does not discredit creativity within the process. Revealing the architect as an artist comes down to perspective. It is important for Immigration Officers to see the creative process when reviewing an O-1B petition. Each level of architectural design relies on creativity to bring the vision to fruition and focusing on the creativity enables architects to be filed as O-1B’s. We should not neglect the scientific aspect of this career but instead use it as a foundation to highlight the artistic side. As an architect, one needs a strong understanding of depth of field, height, balance, color schemes and more, all of this is creative. For example, when admiring the World Trade Station, designed by Calatrava on focuses on the beauty of the design. Or when one studies the Guggenheim Museum, one admires the form and the contrast with the NYC buildings. One focuses on artistry of the buildings. Obviously, every case is different and if an O-1A seems more promising, it is still a valid option. Many architects are filed under O-1A’s but it is important to have every option at one’s disposal. One could argue that almost any profession evokes a creative process but when we are discussing design and architecture, this rings especially true. Admiration of Design When we admire the design of a good, a garment, or a menu item, we are appreciating the creativity that goes into the final product. The same is true when we admire a building, we take in the beauty of the structure and appreciate the visual design. We know that behind the construction of a building is a sea of knowledge and a lengthy process of design and artistry. We know that this structure wasn’t built solely on science but also through creativity. For these reasons, architects may petition as O-1B’s. The science is not neglected but is instead used to highlight the art and creativity of the field. Admiring architects and their work goes beyond science and bringing every step of the process to light is key when crafting a successful petition. Having an immigration attorney that understands these subtle nuances is imperative and will make the process easier."
19,Green Investments That Can Save Your Business Money,business," Did you know you can increase your business profit when you go green? That is one of the main strategies of a successful business. Although you might realize, the task is not easy. There is a fine line between having happy customers and cutting costs because your competitors make it difficult to raise prices. But there are ways to reduce your business expenses and maintain your bottom line - investing in your own company with environmentally friendly business practices is a great way to do so. From getting smart about the type of supplies you purchase to decreasing your energy usage, we share some great investments ideas that will save your money company while going green. Are Green Investments Worth It? For certain businesses, yes. Green investments can reduce overhead costs while lessening their impact on the environment. It's a great way to display a competitive advantage over others in your market. 'Can going green help my business and give it a competitive advantage?' According to Neilsen-back research, yes! The study reports that customers feel that every business should help improve the environment. About 66% of customers are willing to spend more money on sustainable brands. Also, 48% of US consumers are ready to change their buying habits to reduce environmental impact.  So put your money to work by investing in your business. Another benefit? You can help the planet and can gain customers for years to come. Here are some of our best green business money-saving tips! 1.Go Paperless Perhaps one that you might have been thinking about for a while - going paperless. Scan and store all documents and paperwork digitally to reduce all hard copies of your business prints. It's crucial to encourage employees to use documents and share them online will eliminate a good chunk of printing expenses. Print jobs can quickly add up - from paper, toners, ink to disposing and recycling paper. Is it worth spending all that money and time going paperless? A study by Multibriefs suggests that a business spends $80 per employee on paper every year.  Storing and filing documents also takes up time, resources, and space. All these things can add up and can be expensive. Unfortunately, these numbers are not declining. Overall, the amount of paper used in businesses is still increasing each year by 19%. Going paperless will not just save some trees and money. Paper is the third-largest user of fossil fuels in the entire world. 2.Telecommuting While telecommuting is not a perfect solution for every employee and every business, many positions can work from home. Telecommuting offers so many benefits environmental and money-saving. According to Global Workplace Analytics,  US business saves $700 billion each year, allowing employees to work half of the week from home. That comes out to $11,000 per telecommuter. Research suggests that employees telecommunicating are more productive while working from home. Taking cars off the road, you can save many greenhouse gasses. If the whole United States drove 2-3 days to work, it's equivalent to taking the entire New York State personnel off the road. 3.Reduce How Much Electricity Your Business Uses A business is spending on average $654.71 each month on energy bills in 2017. Just like everything, energy bills continue to increase, meaning the number has gone up yearly. While the number of energy spending differs in every region and industry you are in, it's a big chunk of your business overhead. Even though most businesses depend on electricity daily, is there anything you can reduce that number? In recent years, high energy rates and the need for more sustainable business practices have created many energy-efficient substitutions. LED and CFL Lights One example is switching to CFL or LED lights. Making the switch to these energy-efficient bulbs may cost more up-front, but the reduction you will see on your energy bills, and the longer lifespan of the light bulbs will give you a big payback over the years. A 12-watt LED bulb will last 25 times longer than an incandescent light bulb and uses 25% less energy. CFL bulbs are a great alternative to incandescent but have a shorter lifespan than LEDs. Thermostat Control Turn your thermostat during work hours, but make sure to turn it off during the evenings and weekends. Programming your thermostat to turn off during the evening and weekends will guarantee you are using your thermostat smartly. While saving money can depend on your electricity rates and how large the building is, it's a fantastic method to reduce costs without spending a lot of money or making adjustments. You can cut your energy bill by 1% for every degree higher or lower in an eight-hour day. Generate Your Own Energy For Free One of the most significant environmental investments you can make for your business is renewable energy, like solar panels. By taking control of your electricity bill, making this investment can substantial payoff in the long run environmental and financially. How does purchasing a solar energy system compare to other types of investments? When going solar, it's not unusual for a commercial customer to see ROIs in the double-digits. Solar energy is a profitable investment. Making Green Investments for Business to Save Money While making environmental changes for your business can seem like a big undertaking, it starts with small steps. Whether that's taking control of office supplies, controlling the amount of energy your business uses, or adding solar panels for your business, making these types of investments can significantly cut overhead costs and save you money. Reducing your impact on the environment can get your customers excited about your company."
20,Armco Crash Barriers During A Global Crisis,business," When crisis struck the planet in the early months of 2020 it's fair to say that many of us were unprepared. It's also fair to say that over the coming month's many businesses would undergo monumental changes to not only the way that they operate (many working from home) but also in how their products or services changed in how they were used. For Armco Direct, a crash barrier supplier, things were no different. An Armco crash barrier is the general name given for barriers made out of corrugated steel. They ensure pedestrians and assets are protected from hazards such as out-of-control vehicles and other hazards which could result in devastating losses to your business, including injury to employees. But when the pandemic swept the UK many businesses were forced to create one-way systems that reduced the chances of employees or customers from coming in contact with someone who had covid. This is where crash barriers supplied by Armco Direct came in handy. Providers such as Amazon quickly bought up these sturdy steel guides and created systems that minimised exposure to the virus while keeping the business efficient. Not to mention the use that was continued to be found in preventing damage and injury. Shipping nationwide and with fast delivery options Armco Direct stepped up to the challenge of providing businesses across the country with much-needed Armco crash barriers. Now that we are starting to move out of the pandemic the use of steel barriers for businesses across the UK has started to migrate back to their original purpose, preventing wayward vehicles from providing very unwelcome damage to property and personnel. Crash barriers from Armco Direct are discreet, yet robust safety systems, which are made from 100% recyclable corrugated steel that is galvanised to the BS EN 1461 standard. This means they’re fully capable of remaining firmly in place, staying strong and sturdy, whatever the conditions. The way that they’re designed allows the barriers to absorb the impact from a collision, causing as little damage to the barrier and vehicle as possible. These silent heroes have always been there, waiting for a crisis to strike and will continue to do so, waiting, protecting."

2,Plastic Surgery Loyalty Program,business," This is why and how you want to institute a Plastic Surgery Loyalty Program in your practice today. Free organic reach continues to be strangled by Google and Facebook. That forces you to increase your ad budget and compete with others in your area to attract new cosmetic patients. So, let’s say you get 100 leads. Most likely…. 50 are weak, flaky, and never respond to your outreach 20 respond once but then disappear 20 are no shows if you don’t take a credit card 9 consult with you, say they will call you tomorrow to schedule surgery, and then disappear 1 may actually have surgery (if you’re lucky) That is how it is in today’s saturated marketplace. So, what do you do? You turn your happy, cash-paying patients into your sales ambassadors and 10X their value to you so you DON’T have to pour crazy money into advertising that gives you mediocre results at best. Because the stats clearly show that retention is faster, cheaper, and easier than new patient attraction. For example: CONVERSION RATES FOR COSMETIC PATIENTS The conversion rate for existing patients is 60-70%, while a new patient is only 5-20%. This makes sense since cosmetic rejuvenation is an emotional decision based on trust. Surgery is a big deal for consumers, so they need to feel comfortable with their service provider. So, if the patient already knows, likes, and trusts you, they are far more likely to say YES than a stranger internet prospective patient who doesn’t know you. IT COSTS 7X MORE TO ACQUIRE A NEW PATIENT THAN TO RETAIN AN EXISTING ONE. When externally advertising to attract new cosmetic patients, it averages between $1,000-$1500 to acquire a new cosmetic patient. Once you acquire that patient all you have to do is give them a good patient experience and result, so they are encouraged to return for more. That doesn’t cost you an extra dime in advertising. You have already attracted the patient. Just hang onto them. INCREASING CUSTOMER RETENTION BY 5% INCREASES PROFITS BY 25-95% When you retain cosmetic patients and turn them into loyal fans, they grow your practice for you. You now focus on creating a great patient experience, so they return more often, spend more at each visit and increase their lifetime value. These loyal patients also refer more of their friends….for free! That allows you to decrease or eliminate your external advertising budget. BUILD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING PATIENTS AND REFERRALS WILL FOLLOW. It changes everything when you have a “patients for life” mindset. When you see your patients as friends and family and treat them with respect, they grow your practice for you. As Maya Angelo says, “They won’t remember what you told them. They won’t remember what you showed them But they will remember how you made them feel.” Please make your patients feel important, wanted, and appreciated. These happy patients will be your patients for decades and return for more as the aging process continues. They will refer their family members and friends who will then refer their family members and friends and so on and so on. The secret is to have a system that automatically nurtures your current patients so they return, refer, review, show off their results, and share you on social media so their friends get to know you. INSTITUTE A PLASTIC SURGERY LOYALTY PROGRAM The way to combat commoditization, competition, and aggressive marketing is to think smarter and more strategically than your competitors who only focus on short-term gains. Instead, you work with the assets you already have first and then build out from there. Most practices have this backward. They focus on new leads ONLY, rather than on their current assets. But here’s the truth in today’s saturated marketplace: “Retention is the New Patient Attraction Strategy” Contrary to popular belief, the growth strategy funnel that actually builds a solid cosmetic practice for the long run goes like this: First, Increase Referrals & Reviews Then retain more patients Then add more value to differentiate you from your competitors Then ongoing staff training so they know how to interact with patients Then increase your conversion % Then increase your transaction value for each visit Then increase the frequency of visits And then increase your leads In other words, get your house in order before you invite new people over. Train your staff on customer service so your patients have a great experience on the phone and during their visit. That’s where your leverage is. Meaning, you’ll bring in more revenues without spending more when you leverage the assets you already have. INCREASE YOUR PATIENT’S VALUE WITH A LOYALTY CLUB One happy patient can create so much value for your bottom line. For example: VALUE OF A COSMETIC PATIENT REVIEW 82% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses. They trust reviews almost as much as they trust recommendations from friends and family. That means, to have a fighting chance in today’s digital world, your practice needs to be consistently getting new reviews, especially Google reviews since they rule the world for the foreseeable future. VALUE OF A REFERRAL Referrals from your happy patients are free and credible. You know a referred patient is much more likely to convert to paid procedures during their consultation because you’ve come so highly referred by someone they trust. So, what’s that referral worth to you?  Let’s use realistic averages to figure it out: Average surgical procedures     =   $6,000 Average injectable treatment   =   $500 Average laser procedure  =   $1,000 But that’s not the full story. A patient who has one procedure or treatment with you, with likely stay for more and refer their friends so their value should look more like this: Injectable procedures 3x/year = $500 x 3 = $1500 Surgical procedure = $6,000 Refer 1 friend for surgery = $6,000 Refer 1 friend for injectables = $500 Total Value of that Referral   =  $14,000 per year Not sure about that? Try this exercise….Pull a report called “revenues by referral source”. I guarantee a whole bunch of your patients has been referred to you by other patients or they are current patients coming back for more. Usually, it’s about ½ and the other ½ came cold from the Internet (and they like your reviews). VALUE OF PLASTIC SURGERY BEFORE/AFTER PHOTOS Next to reviews, patient before/after photos are the next vital social proof you can offer prospective patients considering cosmetic rejuvenation. A picture really is worth a thousand words. They motivate prospective patients to take action. They instill confidence and inspire patients to think about what’s possible. Too many practices have not yet made before/after photos a priority. You need a system that focuses on it to grow your photo gallery, which is a major patient attraction tool you have full control over. VALUE OF RETURNING PATIENT Once you attract a patient to you, you never have to spend another dime to attract them again. They already know you and visit you willingly. These returning patients make you “top of mind” so whenever they’re talking to friends, it’s likely your name comes up. Talk about free advertising! And, these returning patients will buy more as the aging process continues. Again, without you spending a fortune on external advertising. So, how do you make all of this happen on autopilot? INTRODUCING THE KISS LOYALTY CLUB It’s the first-ever easiest “Done-for-You” Patient Loyalty, Attraction and retention System… on Autopilot since the marketing is done for you. It puts “golden handcuffs” on your patients, so they stay loyal to you, return more often, refer their friends, give you great reviews, allow you use of their before/after photos, have surgery with you, and share you on social media. And, unlike industry vendor loyalty programs that allow patients to go to any practice to redeem points,  The KiSS Loyalty Club can only be used in YOUR practice, so it’s got built-in exclusivity. It’s super simple to use….Patients get a KISS for each dollar they spend with you so they collect KISSes for free cosmetic services. And, they can shortcut it to get extra KiSSes when they write a review, refer a friend, approve the use of their before/after photos, shoot a video testimonial, share you on social media, or complete surgery which is optional. That’s it. The simplest and easiest Plastic Surgery Loyalty Program in the industry today."
3,Safety Culture and Coaching Climate,business," Every human group develops its own culture that consists of knowledge and practices. All companies, big or small, have a safety culture, but that’s not to say that all safety cultures are the same. Some are positive and effective, while others are negative and downright dangerous. Essentially, a company’s safety culture is the shared set of values and practices that guide all employees’ behavior. It’s what employees do and how they act even when nobody is watching. Today’s organizations cannot depend solely on management and safety personnel to communicate about safety. Everyone in the organization must be empowered to coach others on safety issues. For example, many organizations track the number of days each work area has gone without an accident. While these methods and numbers are an important part of management, they aren’t enough to build a strong safety culture. Leaders must be able to inspire others to help maintain a safe workplace. This calls for exceptional leadership and well-developed people skills. Most organizations have measures for managing and reporting safety practices, but a strong safety culture means going beyond the traditional methods of managing safety. We need a culture that inspires behavioral changes in the employees instead of teaching them how to act safely. To understand how to set such a culture, we need to consider the following three questions: What does the organization do to control safety? What do the people do to improve safety? How do people think and feel about safety? Since most of the traditional existing safety cultures were based on situational and behavioral aspects covered through the first and the second, we should focus on the third question, the psychological aspects. To understand how the psychological aspects control the future of any organization’s safety culture, we would need to look at what is called the safety climate. There are significant differences between an organization’s culture and its climate. The climate of an organization can be changed almost overnight. New safety systems, procedures, and leadership changes can alter the work climate rapidly and effectively. Culture, on the other hand, evolves, often a long time. Therefore, to change an organization’s culture, we need first to change the climate. Every individual employee has their own unique safety culture, and these cultures are often in conflict. So the effective option for changing culture is to forget about trying to enact a cultural change and focus instead on developing an engaging and interactive workplace climate that makes people buys-in to safety. One obvious way to do that is by developing a climate that provides a sense of trust and care, a climate directed to people’s hearts and minds. If such a climate is established, then over time, people will automatically adjust their values, attitude, and beliefs (safety culture) to fit the climate they are engaging in. That climate will help reset the people’s norm, and then eventually, the desired safety culture will appear. If leaders and individuals exhibit coaching as a style of communication, this will improve the safety climate. Individuals follow the rules because they want to, and Zero Incidents becomes a choice, not a goal or a company targe. The target is to generate more visible leaders in safety. Over time, it will cause people to reassess their deep beliefs and values about safety and positively affect the safety culture. Through the actions of safety leaders, we can create a positive safety culture, resulting in better safety performance, which will help keep our employees safe at work. But now remains the most difficult question, how can we transform leaders into visible leaders in safety? An employee can be a hard-working individual, he can have the required skill and knowledge, but all of that won’t be enough to develop a coaching behavior that can make people buys-in to safety. The secret is the attitude. Adapting a coach-like attitude is the secret factor that will get our leaders starting their transformation journey. Imagine what a typical leader does if he observes an unsafe act/condition at the site. Yes, exactly. Does he start to see the reason why the person was conducting this violation?. He is looking for the problem! And a typical question that will be raised in similar situations will mostly start with WHY? This leader focused on the violator’s behavior and practice, and his question with Why is steering the mind toward blame and pushing the violator to find excuses out of fears. He was coaching the problem, not the person ……..in the next article, we shall continue discovering how to use a coaching attitude to transform leaders into visible leaders in safety…… stay tuned :)"
4,Marketing Mix Strategies for Plastic Surgeons,business," No marketing strategies work all the time or every time. Let me say it another way that is more clear…. There are NO silver bullets in today’s saturated marketplace. Consumers change, media changes, tastes change so you need a strategic marketing mix to get results. The secret to marketing is to test and tweak several things until you get results. Then keep doing it until it no longer works. This should help…. It’s my “20 Cosmetic Patient Attraction Strategies” guide I prepared for you to give you proven strategies that work in the real world. Before you jump in and spend a bunch of money, please take a minute and consider a few key points: Define Your Preferred Patients You’ve probably heard the saying, “You can’t be everything to everybody.”  Cater to the group you consider your preferred cosmetic surgery patients. Learn their demographics and needs. This is important because only a certain percentage of the population will purchase cosmetic enhancement procedures, products, or treatments. By marketing to the right niche market, you’ll be more profitable. You won’t waste your effort, time, or money by throwing out your message to just anyone. Start with Your Current Patients While you’re waiting for your other digital marketing strategies to take hold, implement some “fast-acting” marketing projects that give you revenues now. Start with your current patient base. They already know, like, and trust you. Therefore, they’re much more apt to respond to your marketing efforts. Educate them on what’s new or who’s new in your practice, update them on what’s happening in the industry and encourage them to return, refer and review. Track Your Results Make sure your staff asks every new patient how they heard about you. You can also code your ads, use a special telephone line or special links, and you can follow up with the patients that show interest. The beauty of these tracking aids is you’ll be able to pull reports to track trends and marketing results. If the numbers are good, keep going. If the numbers are disappointing, tweak or delete. If you would like help customizing your own marketing plan, you can schedule a Free 30-minute call with me to map it out."

7,Buying a super specialty home for our futuristic purposes is an exciting experience,business," Before engaging in this specific line, no matter what, at which age you will enjoy it or some shared planning for income potential, you should have a piece of thorough knowledge about the investment part. The real wishes From the start till the end, be with yourself in going on with a suitable home. Obviously, you need a peaceful atmosphere to hang around, like gardening facilities, separate dining rooms, etc., but, yes, if you are a good party player, dining rooms can be spacious to gather around. Get on with a wide variety and a good combination of needs and wishes for your sweet home. Sometimes it is okay because some need an attic or separate bedroom to stick on with. What are your primary requirements? Take a walk through your home and make notes on some changing things in a better way. The areas of improvement pay attention to the house daily. What are your primary requirements? a. The budgeting and funding plan Plan your budget according to your stay in the house. Say, if you have plan A, to move on in less than six years, then the investment factor is at risk because the savings will be low, which might not be a good idea to deal with. Plan B is you are staying in the place for a long time; then the larger investment plan works here because it gets back to you over a certain period. Both choices are entirely applicable based on you and your funding capacity. b. Scores of your credit reports If you have any errors or shortages, close them ASAP to have high chances of getting a mortgage loan. This is a significant concern while reviewing and obtaining copies of your credit scores by visiting many credit rating websites. Most people do not know the importance of this when buying a house. Please ask yourself, like; Why should I check on my credit? And my fellow friends, the lender can’t do these steps for you as he is not your legal, financial advisor.

To calculate mortgage amount: Say you just purchased a home for $500,000 and made a $60,000 down payment. It would be best to calculate the down payment percentage by the down payment amount with the home purchase amount. To calculate the mortgage amount, divide the home purchase amount $500,000 with a down payment of $60,000. c. Choose the best type of loan This is like a partner in the relationship; if you choose the right one, you are safe; otherwise, you have to keep dealing with your loan. You have to do confined research on the pros and cons of different loans. According to the studies, the best one is the fixed-rate mortgage loans for a more extended staying period. But if you think you want to switch on to another home, then choose an ARM because it is apt to save money. Practically and in a technical sense, if you take ARM for any longer staying period is risky because of the fluctuation in the market conditions. The rate will rise over and over again. Therefore your monthly payment will be in a high state, and you will stay back. Whatever the loans are, choose wiser to avoid the consequences. d. Some major pros include: Getting pre-approved mortgage loans, looking for a dignified real estate agent in Ontario, making a reasonable offer so that the seller will love to accept it, getting a home appraisal by making the lender get on a low risk in a marketplace. Analyzing the escrow, meaning the time calculated from the purchase agreement until the final settlement. Take a walk through your home and make notes on changing things in a better way.

8,The Art of Film Distribution,business," When one hears the term film distributor, one may think of all the work that goes into releasing a movie. Getting a film in theaters, marketing the film, and setting a strategic release date takes a sharp business sense. So how could this profession qualify for an O-1B artist visa? Business Skill There is no doubt that being a successful film distributor requires a high level of skill in business and negotiating. That being said, film distribution is not a one-dimensional field. Successful film distributors need to understand the film in its entirety; the message, the aesthetic, the style, and more. Film distributors need to be able to match a film with the proper distribution company or distribution channel. Because of these factors, it is not uncommon for distributors to have previous filmmaking experience. Storytelling Filmmaking in and of itself is all about storytelling and film distributors are an integral part of the storytelling process. If no one sees a film, how can the story be shared? Therefore the continuation of the film's story is the distribution of the film and storytelling is inherently creative. Following this logic, we can deduce that film distribution is not only a business endeavor but also a creative venture. When we look at fields that may traditionally be considered business-oriented, we have to remember that many of these professions are multi-dimensional. We should not ignore the business side of these professions but for O-1B purposes, it is important to highlight the creative side. Focusing on the business of the arts, along with the creativity that goes into making nuanced decisions, allows non-traditional artists to file under O-1B. O-1A or O-1B? Many professionals that were denied O-1A visas may not even be aware that they qualify for an O-1B. Breaking down the creative process is key to figuring out whether or not there is artistry and creativity that goes into the work one is doing. Interpretation is everything and if there is not a creative process present in one’s field, he or she may be better off filing under an O-1A. Analyzing your own situation is the first step of the process. Interrogating yourself and deconstructing your own process must be done in order to achieve answers. It is also important to have a competent attorney that is familiar with O-1 visas and who understands art and the creative nuances. In this case, we would consider film distributors as creatives. They utilize creative strategies, choose proper distribution channels that align with a film's creative side, and they assist in the continuation of storytelling."

10,"Product Design, A Creative Venture?",business," Product Design, A Creative Venture? Product designers are responsible for informative and visual consumer product design. Most of the time, product designers are filed under O1-A due to their technical design abilities but what if they were able to be filed under an O-1B? Aesthetics When you see everyday products in a grocery store, you may analyze what you're looking at and what you're attracted to. Aesthetics are more important than you think when it comes to purchasing a product. Many tedious decisions are made when designing the shape of a bottle, the color scheme of packaging, the material used for packaging, the font sizes and even the font in itself. All of these things factor into whether or not we will buy a product. Many people will buy products based on their looks and there's nothing wrong with shopping for aesthetics as opposed to shopping for functionality. As an immigration attorney for artists, I focus on the creative aspects of product design. Even if you are a product design manager, those final artistic decisions are made with you. When we work with product designers, we do not focus on the scientific process or underlying business knowledge. Instead we focus on creative decision making and creative expertise because business and creativity are not mutually exclusive. The Right Questions As an artist and creative person, it is imperative to understand the business of the arts. Having a strong business sense does not take away from the creative design or the creative strategy that one employs in his or her profession. When it comes to product designers and focusing on the concept of the aesthetic, we have to take into consideration the decision making process that goes into the design of a product. This allows us to ask some important questions: Why is this color being utilized? What does the designer want to invoke in the consumer, or what information is the designer trying to communicate about the brand identity? When one asks these questions, it tends to flip the script of a normal business thought process and instead becomes a creative thought process intertwined with business. A product may be great and functionally sound but without proper aesthetics, it may not sell. This is why one needs to be aware of the creative knowledge that goes into product design. ‘ A Multidimensional Approach Even so, many may argue that product design is a scientific or business-based profession. That’s not to say that there aren’t scientific or business elements in product design, however this profession is not one dimensional. Although a product designer needs to have a business sense, they also need a strong creative sense. This creative sense allows product design cases to be filed successfully under O-1B. If there is any doubt as to whether or not your field or work is creative, it may be time to examine and interrogate your process. Asking the right questions may lead you to realize that creativity is a staple in your work. Unraveling these layers will allow you to think differently and may help you realize the creativity in your own field."
11,3 Reasons Your Small Business Needs A Copywriter or Editor,business," Small businesses owners have to consider where their money is best spent. They might be tempted to do most of the administration themselves, from formal letter writing to composing company leaflets. Here's why it's a better idea for your business to use a professional copywriter or editor. You may be sending a formal letter to a customer who hasn’t settled his account, or a tenant who hasn’t paid their rent. It might be a marketing mailing. It could be grant application or an appeal to the bank to increase your overdraft. Whatever you’re writing, there’s always a desired outcome and choosing the right words can increase your chances of achieving that outcome. A copywriter or editor can take the basic message you’ve written and re-package it for a more powerful punch. Company brochures, mailings, adverts and even professional emails contribute to the public’s image of your company. If the text is amateurish, it will affect the way your potential clients/customers and suppliers perceive your business. You don’t want to look like you’re a child with a lemonade stand. You want your business to be taken seriously. But don’t worry if you don’t want to be too formal. A good copywriter or editor can combine informality with professional if that’s your aim. Lots of people think it’s not a big deal if there’s a little error, but that’s not true. You might be experts in a particular market, but you will be judged by the standard of the communications you put out. Unfair but true. Many years ago, I was sorting through piles of job applications for the company where I worked. One of the CVs we received had a typo in the person’s name at the top. Needless to say, I did not put that applicant down for interview. My view was that someone who didn’t even notice their own name typed wrong on a job application was hardly likely to be meticulous about their work. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe she was a superb worker. But that typo destroyed her chances. An editor or proofreader can prevent that happening to you. The good news is you don't have to hire your own copywriter. There are plenty of freelancers who can help you as and when you need their services. You'll get all the benefits at a minimal cost."
12,4 Common Print Advertising Mistakes,business," There’s more to advertising than just letting people know you’re offering a product or service and there are right and wrong ways of creating print ads. Advert design matters. If you want your newspaper or magazine advertisements to be effective, here are some common mistakes to avoid. I responded to a survey from a magazine I read. Despite reading the whole issue, when they presented me with a picture of an advert from inside, I didn’t even recognise it! I had obviously turned that page so quickly that it didn’t register at all. I went back and compared it with the adverts I had noticed to see the difference. The main difference was the amount of text on the page. Too much text on the page is off-putting, especially if it’s all the same size and colour. It makes the content look boring. No matter how exciting the writing, if the first glance isn’t inviting, nobody will read it. Keep your text to a minimum – stick to the basics and include details of where people can find out more. If you have to include a lot of text, break it up with text boxes and vary the font size, style and colour. A cluttered-looking page can be overwhelming. It also looks unprofessional and gives the impression that you’re trying too hard. A lot of empty space helps display the picture and text so it catches the eye. A large page with a single photograph accompanied by a few lines of text (plus contact details) is most inviting. Avoid the temptation to save money by cramming everything into the smallest possible advert size, and limit the number of products you feature in a single advert. You can always direct people to your website with a ‘For more products like this, visit…’ at the bottom. If the contact information isn’t clear, you can’t expect anyone to contact you. I proofread an advert for an online event that ended with ‘for more information, call…’ The number was apparently the booking line, but the advert didn’t say that. The number was also very small, and was situated just above their counselling helpline number, which was in much bigger, bolder writing. To prove my point that it needed changing, I ran it past one of their target audience, who said she couldn’t tell how to book and would have simply turned the page and given the event a miss. Avoid confusion. Make it as clear as possible how to contact you and make sure the contact details stand out. If you want the sale, you need to do the work. Unless your product is super special, you can’t expect your potential customers to take the time to find you. I see a lot of adverts which have an attractive picture and great product benefits listed, but the company name is barely noticeable and/or not very memorable. For example, I know there are riser recliner chairs because I’ve seen them advertised regularly in a magazine. But if you asked me where to buy them, I wouldn’t have a clue. The company name on the advert has never registered with me. People don’t always buy something immediately, especially if it’s an expensive item or something they don’t need at the time. By the time they want to purchase, they will remember the product exists, but your advert will be in the bin. If your company name isn’t obvious and memorable, the risk is that someone will search online for the product, not the company, and likely end up buying it from your competitor. Make sure readers remember both the product and your company name. Your company name should be prominently featured in the advert. It helps if it has a memorable and recognisable look. That’s where a logo can be helpful. Even if readers don’t recall the company name, if they see it appear in an online search, they’ll recognise it from the advert they saw."
13,How To Create Google Charts Like The Sankey Diagram,business," Data is a two-way thing; to one side, it is quite valuable and lets you learn how to improve your ads and enhance the customer experience. On the other side, it's quite time-consuming and difficult to extract the information. However, the problem with Google Ads is that it produces a plethora of data at one time. And, if you are not using it carefully, you will be drowned. We all know that data is constantly changing; therefore, you need to analyze the information quickly. That's when you need charts! Charts and visualization help you turn the raw data into a visual format, letting you process information quickly. This article will tell you how you can import data into spreadsheets by using the Sankey diagram in Google sheets. What Is Sankey Diagram? Sankey diagrams have become popular in the data visualization task, so the front-end developers need to hand in this chart. The Sankey diagram is simple and straightforward; it's a flow diagram that describes nodes with each node linked by flows. The quality of each node represents its width. The chart type emphasizes major flows and helps in creating the dominating contributor. This guide explains how you can create a basic Sankey diagram and how you can configure them to a specific type. Why It Important To Chart Your Data: Charting will help you understand what goes behind numbers, so you are wasting your time analyzing the spreadsheets' data. Why Should You Use Sankey Diagram: •         Compared to other pie charts or conventional bar or even flow charts, the Sankey diagram visualizes the energy balancing and the material flows. •         The width of the arrow is directly connected to the quantity flow. Broader the width of the arrow, the larger the material or energy flow. •         The arrow shows the flow from one node to another; this makes them ideal for value chains or production systems as you cannot achieve this by using excel tables, pie charts, or even bar charts. •         They easily communicate your message between the teams or to the clients and other external partners. How To Import Or Export Data From Google Ads In The Google Sheets Using Sankey Diagram Building Google Ads report in the Google Sheets is quite useful; you can easily do everything using a Sankey diagram.

Just drag and drop your data and analyze the blank space. •         You can also use filters by clicking on the header of the column •         Next, download the data as an Excel file 'Excel.csv' and give it a name. •         Once done, you will have two options to import the data in the Google Sheets. One is to open the file you have saved in Excel and copy-paste the Google Sheets report. Besides, you can click on 'Fire' in Google Sheets and then import. Then, you just have to upload the file. The data that you have imported will appear in the spreadsheet; you might have to remove the first two lines from the top. Now you have successfully imported the data in your Google sheets. How To Draw A Sankey Chart With Google Sheets: Here's how you can convert the raw and difficult spreadsheets into an easy-to-understand Sankey diagram. For this, you need to install ChartExpo; here are the steps to do this: •         Once installed, go to the Google Sheets ( you will find it at the toolbar's top). Look for the 'Document add-ons'; once clicking this, you will see a drop-down with all your loaded add-ons. •         Go to 'ChartExpo' and press 'Open' to start the process •         Once the 'chartExpo' add-on loads in the tools, you will see it on the right side of the spreadsheet. Click on the 'plus (+) to get started with the new chart. •         Now, select the Sankey Diagram from the chart category collection; select the columns and the metrics that you want to measure. •         Once you have arranged all the data in the ChartExpo, click on the 'Create Chart' from the bottom of the menu. •         You may also adjust the title, heading level, color, and other metrics if your chart looks dull. Just click on the 'Edit Chart' icon from the top. •         To add a title, click on the Edit pencil, placed next to the 'Chart Header.'

14,Methods of Carpet Cleaning,business," Steam cleaning or chemical cleaning - most recommended option for carpet. It is important to keep carpets in your home fresh, and clean for a healthy life. You can do it by simply vacuum them every other day or on a weekly basis. But sometimes to only vacuum isn’t enough to get rid of all the dirt you want. It is recommended to have your carpets or rugs professionally cleaned by an experienced carpet cleaning company every 6 to 12 months. Lack of proper carpet cleaning may arise in multiple allergens which can lead to serious health problems for you and your family. Once you decide it is time for a deep house cleaning including your carpets, you must choose the method of cleaning. The most commonly used methods are steam cleaning and chemical cleaning. They are both effective methods. Here are the main things that characterize steam and chemical carpet cleaning Steam cleaning Steam cleaning also known as hot water extraction is very effective as it can clean 97% of stains, dirt, and bacteria. Steam cleaning should be your choice if you have stubborn stains and want that deep clean. So how does it work? First of all the boiling water is sprayed all over the carpet which helps to loosen the dirt. Then the next step is very easy as the water is all sucked back by special machines. As you can imagine this method may be time-consuming especially if you have a big area to clean for example whole room or more. It is important to completely remove moisture from the carpet as leaving it clean but wet may be resulting in bacteria growth. If you want your carpet to be cleaned faster, then choose a different carpet cleaning option. Chemical cleaning Chemical cleaning is a method that simply uses chemical detergents to clean your carpet. They can be in a form of liquid or dry. The so-called dry detergents use water as well but very little amount. Cleaning carpets with this method will be a lot faster than the steam method but on the other hand, it is not recommended for deep stains. Dry chemical cleaning only cleans the top layer of the carpet or rug from dirt and bacteria. The chemicals don’t go deep into the carpet and that leaves the rest of it simply dirty. Some of these chemicals may be left behind after cleaning is finished what can be a cause of concern especially if you live with small children or with someone who has breathing problems. It is always best to leave chemical carpet cleaning to an experienced carpet cleaner. Regular dry cleaning can help your carpets to look new, but to prolong their lifespan you should opt for a steam cleaning. Remember that while doing some deep cleaning to your carpet it is also a good idea to do some of that long-awaited house clearance. If you worry about how you will get rid of all the unnecessary items, then worry no more. There is a simple solution in the form of a house clearance company. They will come, collect and dispose of all the items you want."
15,5 Reasons Why I Think the Artificial Intelligence Impact for Accountants is Overstated,business," Summary: The accountancy profession is frequently named as one of the industries at most risk of displacement from AI technologies. As a Chartered Accountant with just under 20 years' experience, I give 5 reasons why I think the role of the accountant can't be automated away. Introduction There’s no doubt that since the time I began my career in 2004, the finance and accounting industry has changed somewhat. A lot of that change has come from the emergence of new technologies, such as cloud accounting software and the development and use in the larger corporates of AI technologies and on-demand MI analytics tools. The question remains then – what is the future going to look like for accountants? More specifically – is the profession set to become a thing of the past? In short response – my answer is that this is highly unlikely, for a whole number of reasons. Let’s make no bones about it, being a Chartered Accountant myself, I do have some personal interest in this debate, however, even after taking a purely rational view of this issue, I still conclude that complete displacement of the profession (for the foreseeable future at least) is highly unlikely. Instead, a changed and newly positioned role seems the most plausible. In this article I will lay out the main considerations that have led me to this conclusion. This is probably one of the strongest arguments in favour of a continued role for accountants. The point here is that while a machine can push out a number, people still place reliance and responsibility on other people to obtain reassurance that what is being presented to them is correct. This is particularly true in practice where clients seek the advice of a trusted advisor and look for a seal of approval (particularly around tax and forecasting issues). Even within larger corporates, I have seen instances of, for example, projects to validate a number that has been automated and posted by the system, which does not appear to be correct. That’s not to say that the ability to interrogate such numbers going forward won’t improve at some point, but I still maintain that somebody, somewhere, will have to take responsibility for checking and reconciling what’s being posted and passed up the chain. For larger more complex software, this becomes pretty specialist with a whole industry centred around delivering this. Accountants often work hand in hand with IT specialists and project managers to help with the roll out of such programmes. In the SME space, accountants are increasingly being expected by clients to help them implement and use going forward, accounting software that can help them not only with their finance and accounting needs, but also with other operational issues (such as stock management, timesheets etc). There is so much on offer now both in terms of the number of different software packages and potential add ons (to help with things like inventory management as suggested above) that clients quite frequently feel lost and don’t quite know where or how to make a start. Moreover, they’re too busy servicing their own clients and customers. I therefore envisage a growing role in the future for accountants whereby the gap between the end user and the software itself is bridged, with a view to enabling and implementing the most efficient use of the system at hand. It is my expectation that at some point in the future, we will see the emergence of an increased number of combined degrees at universities offering “IT and Accountancy” related subjects, as well as more IT focused modules on some of the professional qualifications. I think there are many people out there, whether it be in big business or SME owners, that can be given a report from the system and still have a whole host of legitimate questions in respect of what’s being presented to them. For example, questions around estimations in the accounts for work in progress, accruals, and depreciation policy. For most decent sized businesses, there are frequently events that are outside the normal business course and which decision makers want extra comfort on. For example, only recently, I had a client who disposed of a large element of their fixed asset base in a single sale. As such, they were extra concerned around the profit on disposal figure presented to them in the accounts (which we had to break down and explain, asset by asset). A system could potentially automate and generate such answers (eventually) however, I think the system would become so complex to use that one would still need an accountant sat between them and the system. The bottom line is, a set of numbers can be presented on a page to an end user, but the skill of a good accountant is to bring those numbers to life demonstrating what they mean from a commercial standpoint. Whether it’s tax or accounting standards, they're always changing, and that takes the time and attention of accountants to make the appropriate amendments. In this ever-shifting environment, even if a software itself could automate some of this away, I still believe that the solution would become so complex that there would inevitably need to be an accountant involved to understand and facilitate the use of the functionality. With this one I am largely thinking of bookkeeping. I think the role of the bookkeeper is probably the most mentioned function as being within the ‘at risk’ category moving forwards. However, I think to some degree (in the current environment at least) this is overstated. More specifically, solid bookkeeping forms the basis of everything else – without this, no senior finance person can take what’s in the system and use that to produce value insights through reporting, cash flow models etc. I therefore see the role of the bookkeeper as being extremely important in terms of ensuring data integrity both now and moving forwards. Coming back again to point 1 above – “you can’t automate responsibility” - senior finance people will still need staff to take accountability for providing that hand over point. More still, for every 10 clients I see with Xero, I would say 9 of them are using the bank feeds and rules feature incorrectly i.e. they are not getting the real value from the system. To this end, I see the bookkeeping position as pivotal in helping maximise the value of the software that’s on offer. Bank feeds themselves sometimes fail and some of the purchase invoice software (to automate the coding of invoices) is often referred to as “unreliable by clients”. While this will likely improve in the future, there will still need to be staff who understand this part of the process and facilitate a handover point up the chain. Then there’s the element that non-one outside of the profession seems to raise, and that’s the role of chasing inputs and queries to address new information from end users/clients. Bookkeepers are invaluable here in terms of making sure that the right data feeds are in place. Conclusion My overall conclusion for the changing role of the accountant is likely to be a greater shift towards a combined accounting and IT skillset. Strong interpersonal and communication skills will become even more important as clients and other end users increasingly look towards their accountant for communication and comfort around what the numbers themselves mean, both now and potentially in the future. A common theme I have noticed is that the two main contributors to the argument seem to be either from the software industry or the accounting industry itself. I think the issue with the views coming from the software industry in particular is that they are often theory based on how things would operate in an “ideal world” where the inputs and outputs are constant. That’s not a criticism, but I do think it overlooks many of the dynamics that we as accountants face (which one wouldn’t necessarily fully understand without working in a finance function). Most accountants I have spoken to seem pretty open to the changes, if slightly confused as to which elements really could be automated fully (as there is still with many of the current technologies offered, a significant amount of manual intervention required). It would be great to hear more from individuals with a combined IT and accounting skillset to provide more balance to the debate."
16,Is Marketing Considered Art?,business," Some may call them marketing specialists, marketing professionals, or public relations managers. They are all different professional titles, but they all encompass marketing and/or PR. At Yao Law Group, we almost always file digital marketers, social media managers, and traditional marketing specialists as O-1Bs and therefore as creatives. The Creative Process Oftentimes, marketers are filed under O-1A as a business professional. In contrast, we tend to look at the creative side of what they do. Everything a marketer does is part of the creative process in some capacity. Even data analytics, which doesn’t sound very creative, influences the entire creative process. When filing for an O-1B, our goal is to prove that a marketing professional is utilizing creativity, artistry, and influencing creative decision making. Whether someone is a marketer, a director, or a performer, their work ultimately tells a story. This is a common theme among all creatives and proving this storytelling aspect is key to obtaining the O-1B visa. We argue that all storytelling is creative and marketing in and of itself is all about telling stories. These stories arise through advertising, copywriting, or even data analysis. Although the storytelling medium marketers use is different from traditional artists, it does not discredit them as a creative professional. It is imperative to break down the process and show the immigration officer that creative strategic thinking goes into the end result of marketing projects. The Business Of The Arts Creativity is not the only factor when it comes to being an effective marketer. Having a sound business sense is almost equally as important. When creativity and business is combined and proven with quantifiable results, it affords more evidence of one’s creative professionalism. We use these results in the O-1 application process. There is no doubt that marketers make business decisions but business and creativity are not mutually exclusive. Breaking down one’s own creative process can be difficult and may be hard to even understand the amount of creativity in one’s own work. It is important to work with an experienced attorney who will be able to assist in extrapolating the creativity in your process. Showcasing the creative process is why we are able to file most marketing professionals as O-1Bs. However, there are are cases in which it is not appropriate to file the marketing professional under the O-1B prong. O-1A or O-1B? There may be those in marketing whose main focus is cold-calling, sales, and managing accounts. Although these are no easy tasks, they focus less on the creative and storytelling side of things. In these cases, it may be better to file under the O-1A prong. If you’re considering whether or not to file an O-1A or an O-1B, it’s important to be strategic and know which prong is more appropriate for your own work. Working with an experienced attorney to properly evaluate your professional profile and strategize on your case is the most sound approach."
17,Are Digital Marketers Creative and Artistic?,business," Are digital marketers creative and artistic? Do they qualify for O-1B Visas? Digital marketing is a fairly new field in the sense that it's only been around since the advent of the Internet. When many people think about the internet, they may think about coding, computer programming, IT, or other professions. Although understanding and utilizing the internet is part of digital marketing, it is not the only relevant aspect of the field. Digital marketing focuses on bringing in new business and building brand awareness, however, most choose to ignore the creative process of digital marketing. Before we do that, we have to deconstruct what digital marketing actually is. Asking others about digital marketing may lead you to different answers and sub answers. For our purposes, we're going to break down digital marketing into three different subgroups: email marketing, social media management, and data analytics. Email Marketing Email marketing includes choosing the right text and using persuasive language in your drafting process. Email marketing also includes using graphics and incorporating them into the design of the email. The email has to be hand-tailored to a specific audience in order to be successful. The architecture and the creation of the different copy and graphics associated with the email is creative. As a digital marketer, one must pick creative and engaging language. This language must entice and influence someone to open or engage with the email. Crafting language and images is part of the creative process. Social Media Management Another aspect of digital marketing is social media management. Social media management includes the construction of a post that's going to be placed on a social media platform. For example, it could be the manipulation of a photo, the architecture of witty text, and/or including captivating captions. All this is creative because you're using creative strategy to facilitate the design of the final post. This process includes being an effective writer and constitutes a creative endeavor. Even if you don't believe that digital marketing is creative, think about everything that goes into it, think about the writing, think about the copy and the text. Writers are commonly filed under O-1B because we recognize the creative nature of writing books, articles, etc. Why wouldn't that process or that creativity be implemented in the copy or the drafting of the text for social media posts? These are things that I focus on and by deconstructing the process, we can understand the creativity that goes into Digital Marketing. Now we see that drafting a post or beginning an email campaign is all part of the creative process. With email marketing, we focus on the design, we focus on the layout, we focus on the creative nature of the writing. With a social media post; we focus on the editing of the images, the composition of the image, and the creation of creative copy. Many digital marketers use social media and email marketing but let’s look at an example of a client, who was not creating posts or creating marketing material. Data Analytics My client was involved in gathering data, creating graphs, and providing marketing strategies to brands. His company would use the data he collected to effectively develop a marketing campaign. He would use data gathered from market research and create a graph based on the data. You may be thinking, “A graph, that's math, that's not creative!” You put data into a graph to basically understand where all the information is coming from, and how to properly organize the information. So a graph is basically the organization or the visual component of information that's been analyzed, utilizing that information, and reporting the data. Let’s say, for example, he would have a meeting with Puma, present the data, and present the graph. He would report that the best campaign to craft at this moment is for people who live in Manhattan, who like black sneakers, and report the best demographics to target. By using this data, he was able to influence or create information that brands were utilizing to create their campaigns. So while my client was not actively creating the campaign, he presented data that would influence the creativity of copywriters and designers involved in the campaign. This case was filed under O-1B and was approved with no premium processing during the height of the pandemic. What we were able to do with this client's case ultimately focused on the end result of his work. The end result of his work was to influence creative campaigns. Therefore, his work created the structure for a brand’s campaign. Although the first part of his work was business oriented, the whole development of the campaign was structured around his unique knowledge and data. These are very different examples of how digital marketing can be utilized and filed under O-1B. Digital marketers all directly or indirectly influence the creative process and engage in a creative process."
18,Facility Management,business," Facility or facilities management (FM) is a paradox that many people outside the profession and industry do not fully understand. We are generally aware that FM aligns with buildings and outsourcing of the non-core functions within an organization but beyond this level of understanding, it remains somewhat of a mystery. Unlike allied professions and industries such as human resources, construction, engineering, surveying, architecture etc., which are established and understood, FM is a relatively new concept in historical terms. Indeed, FM has come into its own only in the last 25–30 years or so. In addition to the lack of obvious clarity around its purpose, its definition can also be a little confusing and broad in scope, to say the least, particularly when compared to the allied professions and industries. In this article, we will examine FM, its definition, purpose, constructs, and its success interdependencies. I have worked in the FM sector, since it became an industry in the UK in the late 1980’s. As a young graduate, cutting my teeth in construction on my very first project, the re-development of Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport, I was given the opportunity to take up a facilities management role with a leading international organization. At this time, the UK Government began replacing its Property Services Agency (PSA) and later Property Holdings (the departments responsible for maintaining Crown Premises), with outsourced models, The outsourced public sector contracts, under the ‘Compulsory Competitive Tendering’ initiative, were let to private sector organizations. This was how it all started in the UK and 31 years later, it has certainly matured from those early years."
19,HelloFlow raises $1.6m for its no-code KYC and client onboarding solution,business," HelloFlow, a Danish FinTech startup, has closed a $1.6m Seed round led by a Danish VC PreSeed Ventures, and UK-based, Seedcamp. The company revolutionizes client onboarding and identity verification in the financial industry with a no-code platform, that integrates with ID authentication services in local markets. ""Using the platform, you can set up a proper, sleek, and compliant onboarding process and share it with the clients, all inside a single day. This makes it possible to launch your service in new markets across the world within 10 minutes"" – explains Mikkel Skarnager, the Co-Founder and CEO of HelloFlow. With an increasing focus on anti-money laundering (AML) processes in the financial industry, not least due to a series of international scandals and fines against financial institutions reaching $10.4 billion in 2020, the regulatory requirements and compliance standards for onboarding new clients to banks, investment & trading platforms, crypto broker services, sports betting sites and alike have exploded. With their digital no-code onboarding platform HelloFlow, therefore, taps into a rapidly growing market estimated to €1 billion at the time being. Combined with new expectations from clients demanding the process of starting to use a service to be digital, seamless, and quick, financial businesses are under pressure to find new onboarding solutions. Not only are 45% of clients likely to abandon the application form as it provides a bad customer experience, but a recent study shows that financial institutions may reduce 80-90% of operational costs by digitalizing their onboarding setup. While financial institutions fully recognize these issues as well as opportunities to optimize, they struggle to find solutions on the current market, as available international services like Onfido or Dow Jones are cost-intensive and have low conversion rates, whereas the more effective process of integrating with local regulatory services takes months (at best) of developing customized IT systems as almost every country has their own solution (like NemID, BankID, MyInfo, BeID, etc.). Exactly being in charge of building a bespoke onboarding and customer identity verification (KYC) setup for the Danish bank and trading platform Saxo Bank was what led HelloFlow’s founder and CEO Mikkel Skarnager to his vision of creating a solution with low barriers to digitalization for all financial businesses regardless of size, market or resources. Mikkel Skarnager explains that “After having spent 2 years building a setup for Saxo Bank it became obvious that doing the same thing all over again at other institutions simply wouldn’t make sense. I wanted a completely new way of thinking about such setups, hence hope to do for financial institutions no less than what Webflow does for web design, but with a focus on KYC and AML compliance”. Previous to his career at Saxo Bank, Mikkel worked ‘on the other side of the table’ with developing the ID authentication service NemID for Nets Group. So did his co-founder and CTO at HelloFlow Ciprian Florescu, who therefore have in-depth knowledge of how regulatory services are built. And the two founders’ experience is what has especially impressed Alexander Viterbo-Horten Investment Director at PreSeed Ventures prior to investing in HelloFlow: “I and our entire team at PreSeed Ventures have been impressed by Mikkel and Ciprian from the first meeting. There is not only a very strong founder market fit due to their relevant experience, especially with Mikkel’s insight from building a bespoke solution for Saxo Bank, but as a team, they move with an incredible speed and continue to prove a high level of execution skill”. PreSeed Ventures have in the company of Seedcamp invested $1.6m in HelloFlow. Previously the two have also co-invested in Danish startups like Pento or Dreamdata. About the new investment Tom Wilson, Partner at Seedcamp, comments: ""HelloFlow's plug and play solution is a real game-changer for client onboarding, allowing companies to set up processes quickly without the need for custom code. We're delighted to have the opportunity to work with Mikkel and Ciprian and support them in helping companies say goodbye to slow client onboarding.” With the new capital, HelloFlow plans to accelerate its product development to expand the progressive functionalities of the platform. Moreover, the company aims at expanding beyond the financial industry by offering a complete onboarding solution for legal services and the accounting industries."
20,Spies and Mercenaries,business," 1.0 INTRODUCTION According to Black law DictionaryEspionage, or spying, has reference to the crime of gathering, transmitting or losing information respecting the national defense with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to be used to the advantage of any foreign nation.  Spies help agencies uncover secret information and to know about their enemies tactics. Many governments and private organisations routinely spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf. The Hague Regulations of 1907 state that a person can only be considered a spy when acting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the Zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the Zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information are not considered spies, similarly, the following are not considered spies, soldier and civilians, carrying out their mission openly, entrusted with the delivery of dispatches intended either for their own army or for the enemy army. To this class belong likewise persons sent in balloons for the purpose of carrying dispatches and generally or maintaining communications between the different parts of an army or a territory. Mercenary on the other hand according to Black’s Law Dictionary, is derived from the Latin word “mercenaries” which simply means “a Soldier of fortune”. A mercenary is an individual who is hired to take part in an armed conflict but is not part of a regular army or other government military force, his sole motivation is private gain.In the last century, mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non-mercenaries. The Geneva Conventions declares that mercenaries are not recognized as legitimate and /or lawful combatants and do not have to be granted the same legal protections as captured soldiers of a regular army. In practice, whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree, as financial and political interest may overlap. 2.0 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE USE OF SPIES AND MERCENARIES The use of Spies and Mercenaries date as far back as time immemorial, In the Bible It is recorded that Joshua and Caleb spied on the land of Canaan and came back with a good report. During World War 1 and II it is recorded that mercenaries were used, one of which is the famous Mata hari who spied for Germany during World War 1. In Congo mercenaries were employed by the Katanga secessionists from 1960 to 1963 and also subsequently used by the Tshombe and Mobutu Governments against the Simbas from 1964 onwards which marked its first time after the Spanish civil war. Recruitment for the Congo was made open and widespread as it was publicized and missions were sent out to Belgium and France and at the wake of 1961, recruiting offices were opened even at South Africa In Nigeria during the Civil War it is also recorded that spies and mercenaries were used by both the government forces and Biafra armed forces. Also in 2015 mercenaries where brought from South Africa in the war against Boko Haram and large success was recorded during the said period. Just recently after the killing of some farmers in a rice field at Zabarmari village the Governor of Borno State suggested that Nigeria should seek the assistance of mercenaries in the war against Boko Haram. While some scholars have argued that members of the dreaded Boko Haram sect are not Nigerians but hired mercenaries with the sole aim of destabilizing the government. 3.0 LEGAL STATUS OF SPIES AND MERCENARIES (ESPIONAGE) Espionage is a crime under the legal code of many nations. In the United States it is covered by the Espionage Act of 1917 while in Nigeria it is covered by the Nigeria Military Manual of 1994. The risks of espionage vary. A spy breaking the host country’s laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed.  Spying or Espionage consists in collecting or trying to collect information on military strength by an act of false representation or an act deliberately of a clandestine nature. Generally, if spies participate in hostilities, they can be punished for their participation, but only after a fair trial provided with all judicial guarantees. Article 30 of the 1899 Hague Regulations which has similar provisions with the 1907 Regulations provides that a spy taken in the act cannot be punished without previous trial. While Article 31 further provides that a spy who, after rejoining the army to which he belongs, is subsequently captured by the enemy is treated as a prisoner of war, and incurs no responsibility for previous acts of espionage. It therefore means that a spy taken in the act shall be tried and treated according to the laws in force in the army which captures him. A spy who rejoins the army to which he belongs and who is subsequently captured by the enemy is treated as a prisoner of war and incurs no responsibility for his previous acts. Article 46(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I (APGC77) provides that notwithstanding any other provision of the Conventions or of this Protocol, any member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict who falls into the power of an adverse Party while engaging in espionage shall not have the right to the status of prisoner of war and may be treated as a spy. Further Article 45(3)Any person who has taken part in hostilities, who is not entitled to prisoner of war status and who does not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the Fourth Convention shall have the right at all times to the protection of Article 75 of this Protocol. While Article 5 provides that where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as spy such person shall nevertheless be treated with humanity, and in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular prescribed by the present convention Article 47 on the other hand provides for the status and treatment of mercenaries. It provides thus: A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war. A mercenary is any person who: Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces. From the above, spies are recognised under the convention and protected as prisoners of war while mercenaries are not and do not enjoy the status of a prisoner of war under IHL and are regarded as an unlawful combatant. In Sandrock case (Almelo Trial) in 1945, the UK Military Court at Almelo held that killing captured members of the opposing forces or civilian inhabitants of occupied territories suspected of espionage and found the accused guilty of the killing without trial of a British soldier who was alleged to be a spy. Also in the Dostler case before the US Military Commission at Rome in 1945, the accused, the commander of a German army corps, was found guilty of having ordered the shooting of 15 American prisoners of war in violation of the 1907 Hague Regulations and of long-established laws and customs of war. The Defence submitted that the US soldiers had worn no distinctive emblem and that their mission had been undertaken for the purpose of sabotage. The Defence considered, therefore that they were not entitled to the privileges of a lawful belligerent, though it was admitted that they were entitled to a lawful trial even if they were treated as spies. It has been argued by scholars that in case of doubt as to the status of persons captured during hostilities; these persons must be treated as prisoner of war and/or in accordance with the principle of common humanity until a regularly constituted tribunal has determined their real status. If the tribunal determines that the captive is a lawful combatant, this captive is entitled to a prisoner of war status but if otherwise at that juncture, the mercenary soldier becomes an unlawful combatant; but still must be ""treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial"", being still covered under the law. The only possible exception is when the mercenary so captured is a national of the authority imprisoning him, in which case he would not be a mercenary soldier.If, after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then he can expect treatment as a common criminal and may face execution. This is because mercenary soldiers may not qualify as Post –World War Solders and as such, they cannot expect repatriation at the end of the war end. For example, On 28 June 1976 at the end of the Luanda Trial, an Angolan court sentenced three Britons and an American to death and nine other mercenaries to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The four mercenaries sentenced to death were shot by a firing squad on 10 July 1976. The legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationalities with respect to that of the combatants. If they have not ""in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities""  they are not mercenaries but civilians who have non-combat support roles and are entitled to protection under the Third Geneva Convention. The United Nations on 4th December 1989 passed a resolution, at an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. The convention entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the UN Mercenary Convention. Article 1 of the Convention  gave a similar definition of Mercenary as defined  under  Article 47 of the Additional Protocol I, however Article 1.2 broadens the definition to include a non-national recruited to overthrow a ""Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State; or Undermine the territorial integrity of a State;"" and ""Is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation."" Under Article 1.2 a person does not have to take a direct part in the hostilities in a planned coup d'état to be a mercenary. Some Critics have argued in some quarters that the UN Mercenaries Convention 1989 and Article 47 of APGC77 are designed to cover the activities of mercenaries in post-colonial Africa and do not in any way address adequately the use of private military companies by sovereign states. It is worthy to note that, the laws of some countries forbid their citizens to fight in foreign wars unless they are under the control of their own national armed forces. The UN Mercenaries Convention provides: Any person who recruits, uses, finances or trains mercenaries, as defined in article 1 of the present Convention, commits an offence for the purposes of the Convention. In Austria for instance, if a person is proven to have worked as a mercenary for any other country while retaining Austrian citizenship, his or her Austrian citizenship will be revoked. In 2003, France criminalized mercenary activities, as defined by the protocol to the Geneva Convention for French citizens, permanent residents and legal entities. This law does not prevent French citizens from serving as volunteers in foreign forces. The law applies to military activities with a specifically mercenary motive or with a mercenary level of remuneration. 4.0 COMMERCIALIZATION OF SOLDIERY SKILLS After the end of World War II many countries had limited personnel to cover the field which prompted an increase in demand for expert hands in some military operations. This is usually what private military companies in modern day do. Now because of the expertise of past military Generals/warlords who are retired but not tired in the art of welfare and because of their love for better military services, soldiery being all they know and needs to make money. Some of them tend to establish these private military companies which supply government and private organizations with modern technology on the act of combating and detecting crimes and also providing personal security. These companies because of their previous ties to the arm forces usually have the connections needed to pull these contracts. These private military personnel’s fight for a fee and have often been accused by scholars of turning the phenomenon of war into profit making mechanism. For instance Osama’s lead attack on the WTC and Pentagon, which lead to a massive increase in defense spending by U.S.A, most likely made the Bush Family a great deal of money because it was their company Carlyle Group that was contracted. Also the invasion of Iran by U.S. military forces under the disguise of Iran producing a nuclear weapon but with ulterior interest in controlling Iran Oil wells has received series of commendations and even after the U.S.A pulled out its troops it allowed private military personnel’s to guide some of its facilities. 4.1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMERCE AND ARM CONFLICT Arm conflict generally cannot take place without the use and supply of goods and services such as arms and ammunitions, military wears, food for soldiers, payment of salary for arm personnel’s etc. For parties who benefit from war it is seen as good business because profit would be made from the procurements of arms, ammunitions and rendering of military services. Now the danger in the relationship between commerce and arm conflict is that in a bid to always be relevant actors (PMC) who supply ammunitions and military services during arm conflicts would not want conflict to end and would do anything to develop more sophisticated weapons and deadly strategies to make warfare easy for their customers. These weapons and strategy in the long run endanger our common humanity. For instance the chemical bombings used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan till date still has effects in the populace, waters and farm lands. Recent report had it that the Niger Delta region in the Nigeria is now inundated with British and American private military companies (PMCs) engaged in security services for their clients in the oil and gas industry. The story titled The mercenaries take over and published on February 22, says no fewer than 10 such companies, prominent among them Control Risk which has on its payroll the former body guard of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, Erinys International and ArmorGroup, currently operate in the restive Niger Delta, some through spurious partnerships with local companies. This evokes a disturbing picture of an imminent cataclysm in a region now credited with one of the largest concentration of small arms in the world. 4.2 ROLE OF PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES IN ARM CONFLICT A private military company (PMC) is a private company providing armed combat or services. They refer to their staff as security contractors or private military contractors. They also refer to their business generally as private military industry or the circuit A number of reports have indicated that private military companies have played a central role in some of the most sensitive activities of the Military, CIA and other government and non-government organizations during arm conflict. According to a 2008 study by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, private contractors make up 29% of the workforce in the United State Intelligence Community and cost the equivalent of 49% of their personnel budgets. These activities include arbitrary detention and clandestine raids against alleged insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, involvement in CIA rendition flights, joint covert operation, trained or supplements official arm forces in service of government, employed by private companies to provide bodyguards for key staff or protection of company premises especially in hostile territories, etc. Employees of PMSCs have been involved in the transport of detainees from pick-up points (such as Tuzla, Islamabad, and Skopje); in rendition flights to drop-off points (such as Cairo, Rabat, Bucharest, Amman, and Guantanamo); and in building, equipping, and staffing the CIA’s “black sites. In 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., a subsidiary company of Boeing, on behalf of five persons who had been kidnapped by the CIA and held in overseas secret prisons maintained by the United States 4.3 PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES AS MODERN DAY MERCENARIES Private Military Service Companies (PMSCs) are the modern reincarnation of a long lineage of private providers of physical force, such as corsairs, privateers, and mercenaries. PMSCs are non-state entities operating in extremely blurred situations, where the lines between what is allowed and what is not are difficult to identify.The new security industry moves large quantities of weapons and military equipment. It provides services for military operations, recruiting former military as civilians to carry out what has been labeled as “passive or defensive security”. What the Geneva conventions prohibited via mercenaries is what these PMSCs try to bring in through the back door. According to the definition under Article 47 (2) of Additional Protocol I, to be considered a mercenary the person has to fulfill the six conditions set out in that instrument. A mercenary (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; (d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; (e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and (f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces. The definition of a mercenary under the UN Convention covers all the criteria of Additional Protocol I with the exception of “does in fact take a direct part in the hostilities.” In addition, the UN Convention includes “any other situation” in which a non-national is recruited to take part “in a concerted act of violence aimed at (i) overthrowing a Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State, or (ii) undermining the territorial integrity of a State.” Whereas Additional Protocol I only applies to international armed conflicts, the UN Convention covers both international and non-international armed conflicts. Furthermore, the UN Convention makes the recruitment, use, financing or training of mercenaries an offense under international law and implies that any foreigner taking part in any violent activity aimed at provoking a change of regime through a coup d’état during peacetime may be considered a mercenary. But not all state has signed and/or domesticated this law. A number of the activities fulfilled by PMSC may meet the requirements contained in the international instruments regarding mercenaries. Also, the recruitment of former militaries and law enforcement personnel as “security guards who would be ’exposed to great risks including but not limited to the threats inherent in a war situation,” included as a clause in a number of contracts that the private security contractors signed, is extremely close to the element of the definition that specifies that the mercenary must be specifically recruited “in order to fight in an armed conflict. Even if they do not conduct offensive operations but have been recruited to protect military objectives, “security guards” may be targeted by the enemy who consider them as being recruited in an armed conflict. A number of activities conducted by PMSC employees may be considered direct participation in hostilities, such as the involvement of Blackwater employees in Najaf, Iraq, on 4 April 2004. Even though the main motivation of many of the private contractors engaged by PMSCs may be private gain, it is extremely difficult to prove this in court. Moreover, for many private guards, the motivation is a mixture of monetary gain, the “excitement and adrenaline” of adventure, and the possibility to put in practice all of their training, as. PMSCs usually hire personnel who have been highly trained in dangerous and counterinsurgency operations such as members of US SEALs, or SWCC, the British SAS or the French Legion. Each of the elements taken individually poses problems to classify PMSCs as mercenaries. For PMSCs and their employees to be considered mercenaries, all the requirements in the definition of the international instruments must be cumulatively met. In the absence of which it is my opinion that PMSCs are commercial firms legally registered in their home countries, a large number of which have obtained contracts from governments (the Pentagon and the State Department in the United States). 5.0 CHALLENGES COUNTRIES FACE IN RELATION TO SPIES, MERCENARIES AND PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES The following are some of the challenges that countries faces in relation to spies and mercenaries: Lack of accountability for human right violations that they have committed which has been partly due to the difficulties in the application of domestic laws to PMSC actuating in foreign countries as well as to the difficulties in carrying out investigations in failed states. It has been argued by some scholars that Private military companies usually do not want an end to war so they are always involved in developing more sophisticated weapons and new war strategies which may endanger our common humanity. Just like those who created a virus for systems are also the once who created an anti-virus. So the virus would be spread so that persons can buy their anti-virus. There are currently no globally accepted norms or legal framework applied to these private military firms. No international court has jurisdiction over these corporations and there is no pre-existing mechanism in place bound by international law to account and manage for PMSCs use of force. For instance in central BaghdadIraq on 9th October 2007, two Armenian women were shot dead when their car came too close to a convoy protected by Unity Resources Group (URG) contractors.URG employees opened fire as they felt threatened that the women’s car approached the convoy at high speed and was not going to stop this hired mercenaries were never prosecuted. Also one of the most egregious known human rights violations by a PMSC is the shooting massacre perpetrated on 16 September 2007 by Blackwater personnel in Nisour Square, Baghdad. Seventeen people were killed and twenty others were severely injured although Blackwater came under heavy criticism it was never prosecuted. Blackwater has also been accused of fabricating documents to acquire unauthorized weapons, defrauding the USA government, and tolerating the widespread use of steroids and cocaine by its personnel. Only after the implementation of a new Status of Forces Agreement in January 2009 and the cancellation of Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 which had granted immunity to contractors was the government of Iraq able to deny Blackwater’s application for an operating license. However, the company still had a contract with the U.S. State Department, and some Blackwater personnel were working in Iraq at least until September 2009. 6.0 CONCLUSION The paper has successfully examined the legal status of spies and mercenaries, with a look at various conventions, a look at the role of private military company as modern day mercenaries, commercialization of soldiery skills and Challenges countries faces in relation to the use of spies and mercenaries. 1.0 INTRODUCTION According to Black law DictionaryEspionage, or spying, has reference to the crime of gathering, transmitting or losing information respecting the national defense with intent or reason to believe that the information is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to be used to the advantage of any foreign nation.  Spies help agencies uncover secret information and to know about their enemies tactics. Many governments and private organisations routinely spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf. The Hague Regulations of 1907 state that a person can only be considered a spy when acting clandestinely or on false pretences, he obtains or endeavours to obtain information in the Zone of operations of a belligerent, with the intention of communicating it to the hostile party. Thus, soldiers not wearing a disguise who have penetrated into the Zone of operations of the hostile army, for the purpose of obtaining information are not considered spies, similarly, the following are not considered spies, soldier and civilians, carrying out their mission openly, entrusted with the delivery of dispatches intended either for their own army or for the enemy army. To this class belong likewise persons sent in balloons for the purpose of carrying dispatches and generally or maintaining communications between the different parts of an army or a territory. Mercenary on the other hand according to Black’s Law Dictionary, is derived from the Latin word “mercenaries” which simply means “a Soldier of fortune”. A mercenary is an individual who is hired to take part in an armed conflict but is not part of a regular army or other government military force, his sole motivation is private gain.In the last century, mercenaries have increasingly come to be seen as less entitled to protections by rules of war than non-mercenaries. The Geneva Conventions declares that mercenaries are not recognized as legitimate and /or lawful combatants and do not have to be granted the same legal protections as captured soldiers of a regular army. In practice, whether or not a person is a mercenary may be a matter of degree, as financial and political interest may overlap. 2.0 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE USE OF SPIES AND MERCENARIES The use of Spies and Mercenaries date as far back as time immemorial, In the Bible It is recorded that Joshua and Caleb spied on the land of Canaan and came back with a good report. During World War 1 and II it is recorded that mercenaries were used, one of which is the famous Mata hari who spied for Germany during World War 1. In Congo mercenaries were employed by the Katanga secessionists from 1960 to 1963 and also subsequently used by the Tshombe and Mobutu Governments against the Simbas from 1964 onwards which marked its first time after the Spanish civil war. Recruitment for the Congo was made open and widespread as it was publicized and missions were sent out to Belgium and France and at the wake of 1961, recruiting offices were opened even at South Africa In Nigeria during the Civil War it is also recorded that spies and mercenaries were used by both the government forces and Biafra armed forces. Also in 2015 mercenaries where brought from South Africa in the war against Boko Haram and large success was recorded during the said period. Just recently after the killing of some farmers in a rice field at Zabarmari village the Governor of Borno State suggested that Nigeria should seek the assistance of mercenaries in the war against Boko Haram. While some scholars have argued that members of the dreaded Boko Haram sect are not Nigerians but hired mercenaries with the sole aim of destabilizing the government. 3.0 LEGAL STATUS OF SPIES AND MERCENARIES (ESPIONAGE) Espionage is a crime under the legal code of many nations. In the United States it is covered by the Espionage Act of 1917 while in Nigeria it is covered by the Nigeria Military Manual of 1994. The risks of espionage vary. A spy breaking the host country’s laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed.  Spying or Espionage consists in collecting or trying to collect information on military strength by an act of false representation or an act deliberately of a clandestine nature. Generally, if spies participate in hostilities, they can be punished for their participation, but only after a fair trial provided with all judicial guarantees. Article 30 of the 1899 Hague Regulations which has similar provisions with the 1907 Regulations provides that a spy taken in the act cannot be punished without previous trial. While Article 31 further provides that a spy who, after rejoining the army to which he belongs, is subsequently captured by the enemy is treated as a prisoner of war, and incurs no responsibility for previous acts of espionage. It therefore means that a spy taken in the act shall be tried and treated according to the laws in force in the army which captures him. A spy who rejoins the army to which he belongs and who is subsequently captured by the enemy is treated as a prisoner of war and incurs no responsibility for his previous acts. Article 46(1) of the 1977 Additional Protocol I (APGC77) provides that notwithstanding any other provision of the Conventions or of this Protocol, any member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict who falls into the power of an adverse Party while engaging in espionage shall not have the right to the status of prisoner of war and may be treated as a spy. Further Article 45(3)Any person who has taken part in hostilities, who is not entitled to prisoner of war status and who does not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the Fourth Convention shall have the right at all times to the protection of Article 75 of this Protocol. While Article 5 provides that where in occupied territory an individual protected person is detained as spy such person shall nevertheless be treated with humanity, and in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular prescribed by the present convention Article 47 on the other hand provides for the status and treatment of mercenaries. It provides thus: A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war. A mercenary is any person who: Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces. From the above, spies are recognised under the convention and protected as prisoners of war while mercenaries are not and do not enjoy the status of a prisoner of war under IHL and are regarded as an unlawful combatant. In Sandrock case (Almelo Trial) in 1945, the UK Military Court at Almelo held that killing captured members of the opposing forces or civilian inhabitants of occupied territories suspected of espionage and found the accused guilty of the killing without trial of a British soldier who was alleged to be a spy. Also in the Dostler case before the US Military Commission at Rome in 1945, the accused, the commander of a German army corps, was found guilty of having ordered the shooting of 15 American prisoners of war in violation of the 1907 Hague Regulations and of long-established laws and customs of war. The Defence submitted that the US soldiers had worn no distinctive emblem and that their mission had been undertaken for the purpose of sabotage. The Defence considered, therefore that they were not entitled to the privileges of a lawful belligerent, though it was admitted that they were entitled to a lawful trial even if they were treated as spies. It has been argued by scholars that in case of doubt as to the status of persons captured during hostilities; these persons must be treated as prisoner of war and/or in accordance with the principle of common humanity until a regularly constituted tribunal has determined their real status. If the tribunal determines that the captive is a lawful combatant, this captive is entitled to a prisoner of war status but if otherwise at that juncture, the mercenary soldier becomes an unlawful combatant; but still must be ""treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial"", being still covered under the law. The only possible exception is when the mercenary so captured is a national of the authority imprisoning him, in which case he would not be a mercenary soldier.If, after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then he can expect treatment as a common criminal and may face execution. This is because mercenary soldiers may not qualify as Post –World War Solders and as such, they cannot expect repatriation at the end of the war end. For example, On 28 June 1976 at the end of the Luanda Trial, an Angolan court sentenced three Britons and an American to death and nine other mercenaries to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The four mercenaries sentenced to death were shot by a firing squad on 10 July 1976. The legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationalities with respect to that of the combatants. If they have not ""in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities""  they are not mercenaries but civilians who have non-combat support roles and are entitled to protection under the Third Geneva Convention. The United Nations on 4th December 1989 passed a resolution, at an International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. The convention entered into force on 20 October 2001 and is usually known as the UN Mercenary Convention. Article 1 of the Convention  gave a similar definition of Mercenary as defined  under  Article 47 of the Additional Protocol I, however Article 1.2 broadens the definition to include a non-national recruited to overthrow a ""Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State; or Undermine the territorial integrity of a State;"" and ""Is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation."" Under Article 1.2 a person does not have to take a direct part in the hostilities in a planned coup d'état to be a mercenary. Some Critics have argued in some quarters that the UN Mercenaries Convention 1989 and Article 47 of APGC77 are designed to cover the activities of mercenaries in post-colonial Africa and do not in any way address adequately the use of private military companies by sovereign states. It is worthy to note that, the laws of some countries forbid their citizens to fight in foreign wars unless they are under the control of their own national armed forces. The UN Mercenaries Convention provides: Any person who recruits, uses, finances or trains mercenaries, as defined in article 1 of the present Convention, commits an offence for the purposes of the Convention. In Austria for instance, if a person is proven to have worked as a mercenary for any other country while retaining Austrian citizenship, his or her Austrian citizenship will be revoked. In 2003, France criminalized mercenary activities, as defined by the protocol to the Geneva Convention for French citizens, permanent residents and legal entities. This law does not prevent French citizens from serving as volunteers in foreign forces. The law applies to military activities with a specifically mercenary motive or with a mercenary level of remuneration. 4.0 COMMERCIALIZATION OF SOLDIERY SKILLS After the end of World War II many countries had limited personnel to cover the field which prompted an increase in demand for expert hands in some military operations. This is usually what private military companies in modern day do. Now because of the expertise of past military Generals/warlords who are retired but not tired in the art of welfare and because of their love for better military services, soldiery being all they know and needs to make money. Some of them tend to establish these private military companies which supply government and private organizations with modern technology on the act of combating and detecting crimes and also providing personal security. These companies because of their previous ties to the arm forces usually have the connections needed to pull these contracts. These private military personnel’s fight for a fee and have often been accused by scholars of turning the phenomenon of war into profit making mechanism. For instance Osama’s lead attack on the WTC and Pentagon, which lead to a massive increase in defense spending by U.S.A, most likely made the Bush Family a great deal of money because it was their company Carlyle Group that was contracted. Also the invasion of Iran by U.S. military forces under the disguise of Iran producing a nuclear weapon but with ulterior interest in controlling Iran Oil wells has received series of commendations and even after the U.S.A pulled out its troops it allowed private military personnel’s to guide some of its facilities. 4.1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMERCE AND ARM CONFLICT Arm conflict generally cannot take place without the use and supply of goods and services such as arms and ammunitions, military wears, food for soldiers, payment of salary for arm personnel’s etc. For parties who benefit from war it is seen as good business because profit would be made from the procurements of arms, ammunitions and rendering of military services. Now the danger in the relationship between commerce and arm conflict is that in a bid to always be relevant actors (PMC) who supply ammunitions and military services during arm conflicts would not want conflict to end and would do anything to develop more sophisticated weapons and deadly strategies to make warfare easy for their customers. These weapons and strategy in the long run endanger our common humanity. For instance the chemical bombings used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan till date still has effects in the populace, waters and farm lands. Recent report had it that the Niger Delta region in the Nigeria is now inundated with British and American private military companies (PMCs) engaged in security services for their clients in the oil and gas industry. The story titled The mercenaries take over and published on February 22, says no fewer than 10 such companies, prominent among them Control Risk which has on its payroll the former body guard of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, Erinys International and ArmorGroup, currently operate in the restive Niger Delta, some through spurious partnerships with local companies. This evokes a disturbing picture of an imminent cataclysm in a region now credited with one of the largest concentration of small arms in the world. 4.2 ROLE OF PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES IN ARM CONFLICT A private military company (PMC) is a private company providing armed combat or services. They refer to their staff as security contractors or private military contractors. They also refer to their business generally as private military industry or the circuit A number of reports have indicated that private military companies have played a central role in some of the most sensitive activities of the Military, CIA and other government and non-government organizations during arm conflict. According to a 2008 study by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, private contractors make up 29% of the workforce in the United State Intelligence Community and cost the equivalent of 49% of their personnel budgets. These activities include arbitrary detention and clandestine raids against alleged insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan, involvement in CIA rendition flights, joint covert operation, trained or supplements official arm forces in service of government, employed by private companies to provide bodyguards for key staff or protection of company premises especially in hostile territories, etc. Employees of PMSCs have been involved in the transport of detainees from pick-up points (such as Tuzla, Islamabad, and Skopje); in rendition flights to drop-off points (such as Cairo, Rabat, Bucharest, Amman, and Guantanamo); and in building, equipping, and staffing the CIA’s “black sites. In 2007, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., a subsidiary company of Boeing, on behalf of five persons who had been kidnapped by the CIA and held in overseas secret prisons maintained by the United States 4.3 PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES AS MODERN DAY MERCENARIES Private Military Service Companies (PMSCs) are the modern reincarnation of a long lineage of private providers of physical force, such as corsairs, privateers, and mercenaries. PMSCs are non-state entities operating in extremely blurred situations, where the lines between what is allowed and what is not are difficult to identify.The new security industry moves large quantities of weapons and military equipment. It provides services for military operations, recruiting former military as civilians to carry out what has been labeled as “passive or defensive security”. What the Geneva conventions prohibited via mercenaries is what these PMSCs try to bring in through the back door. According to the definition under Article 47 (2) of Additional Protocol I, to be considered a mercenary the person has to fulfill the six conditions set out in that instrument. A mercenary (a) is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; (b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities; (c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party; (d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict; (e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and (f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces. The definition of a mercenary under the UN Convention covers all the criteria of Additional Protocol I with the exception of “does in fact take a direct part in the hostilities.” In addition, the UN Convention includes “any other situation” in which a non-national is recruited to take part “in a concerted act of violence aimed at (i) overthrowing a Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State, or (ii) undermining the territorial integrity of a State.” Whereas Additional Protocol I only applies to international armed conflicts, the UN Convention covers both international and non-international armed conflicts. Furthermore, the UN Convention makes the recruitment, use, financing or training of mercenaries an offense under international law and implies that any foreigner taking part in any violent activity aimed at provoking a change of regime through a coup d’état during peacetime may be considered a mercenary. But not all state has signed and/or domesticated this law. A number of the activities fulfilled by PMSC may meet the requirements contained in the international instruments regarding mercenaries. Also, the recruitment of former militaries and law enforcement personnel as “security guards who would be ’exposed to great risks including but not limited to the threats inherent in a war situation,” included as a clause in a number of contracts that the private security contractors signed, is extremely close to the element of the definition that specifies that the mercenary must be specifically recruited “in order to fight in an armed conflict. Even if they do not conduct offensive operations but have been recruited to protect military objectives, “security guards” may be targeted by the enemy who consider them as being recruited in an armed conflict. A number of activities conducted by PMSC employees may be considered direct participation in hostilities, such as the involvement of Blackwater employees in Najaf, Iraq, on 4 April 2004. Even though the main motivation of many of the private contractors engaged by PMSCs may be private gain, it is extremely difficult to prove this in court. Moreover, for many private guards, the motivation is a mixture of monetary gain, the “excitement and adrenaline” of adventure, and the possibility to put in practice all of their training, as. PMSCs usually hire personnel who have been highly trained in dangerous and counterinsurgency operations such as members of US SEALs, or SWCC, the British SAS or the French Legion. Each of the elements taken individually poses problems to classify PMSCs as mercenaries. For PMSCs and their employees to be considered mercenaries, all the requirements in the definition of the international instruments must be cumulatively met. In the absence of which it is my opinion that PMSCs are commercial firms legally registered in their home countries, a large number of which have obtained contracts from governments (the Pentagon and the State Department in the United States). 5.0 CHALLENGES COUNTRIES FACE IN RELATION TO SPIES, MERCENARIES AND PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANIES The following are some of the challenges that countries faces in relation to spies and mercenaries: Lack of accountability for human right violations that they have committed which has been partly due to the difficulties in the application of domestic laws to PMSC actuating in foreign countries as well as to the difficulties in carrying out investigations in failed states. It has been argued by some scholars that Private military companies usually do not want an end to war so they are always involved in developing more sophisticated weapons and new war strategies which may endanger our common humanity. Just like those who created a virus for systems are also the once who created an anti-virus. So the virus would be spread so that persons can buy their anti-virus. There are currently no globally accepted norms or legal framework applied to these private military firms. No international court has jurisdiction over these corporations and there is no pre-existing mechanism in place bound by international law to account and manage for PMSCs use of force. For instance in central BaghdadIraq on 9th October 2007, two Armenian women were shot dead when their car came too close to a convoy protected by Unity Resources Group (URG) contractors.URG employees opened fire as they felt threatened that the women’s car approached the convoy at high speed and was not going to stop this hired mercenaries were never prosecuted. Also one of the most egregious known human rights violations by a PMSC is the shooting massacre perpetrated on 16 September 2007 by Blackwater personnel in Nisour Square, Baghdad. Seventeen people were killed and twenty others were severely injured although Blackwater came under heavy criticism it was never prosecuted. Blackwater has also been accused of fabricating documents to acquire unauthorized weapons, defrauding the USA government, and tolerating the widespread use of steroids and cocaine by its personnel. Only after the implementation of a new Status of Forces Agreement in January 2009 and the cancellation of Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17 which had granted immunity to contractors was the government of Iraq able to deny Blackwater’s application for an operating license. However, the company still had a contract with the U.S. State Department, and some Blackwater personnel were working in Iraq at least until September 2009. 6.0 CONCLUSION The paper has successfully examined the legal status of spies and mercenaries, with a look at various conventions, a look at the role of private military company as modern day mercenaries, commercialization of soldiery skills and Challenges countries faces in relation to the use of spies and mercenaries."

3,Chairman of Darlox: China's PCB industry will usher in the next decade,business," After nearly 40 years of development and growth, the upstream and downstream of the domestic printed circuit board industry chain has been improved day by day, and it has become one of the industries with great potential for development. At present, under the huge terminal market, domestic-funded enterprises are rapidly rising by virtue of their capital and cost-effective advantages. The next round of transfer will be a shift from ""foreign capital"" to ""domestic capital"". From the perspective of the scale of output value, China has a huge domestic demand market, and both the electronics manufacturing industry and the semiconductor industry are gathering in China. Traditional PCB boards such as single and double panels do not have high technical requirements and have a relatively high domestic market share. For high-end PCB boards, domestic manufacturers are still lacking in technology and have a low market share. From the perspective of the industry chain, PCB dedicated Key materials, high-end equipment, and engineering software are still heavily dependent on external sources. This is where the industry will break through in the future. From the perspective of technology and application, PCB companies have taken root in the electronics industry, cultivating telecommunications, computers, consumer electronics, automobiles, and medical fields, IC substrates, metal substrates, special substrates and other product lines, through technology leadership, quality priority and intelligent manufacturing to provide customers with reliable and timely products and services. With customers growing together, many outstanding national enterprises have emerged. For example, Jingwang Electronics has made major breakthroughs in precision circuits, FPC impedance control and high-reliability multilayer board technology, and is at the leading level in China, serving high-end models of customers such as Huawei. In addition, because of the great progress in product reliability and special processes, domestic PCB companies have repeatedly won customers' favor in the fields of communications, automobiles, and industrial computer medical treatment. As the 5G era approaches, the artificial intelligence and car networking industries may usher in an explosion. At present, the 5G commercial, AI, and Internet of Vehicles industries have entered a new stage of rapid development, technological innovation has become more active, new applications have flourished, and the scale of the industry has continued to expand. The emergence of these emerging markets will bring huge opportunities to the PCB industry. In the next few years, it may leverage a market of 100 billion yuan. This is the next decade of China's PCB industry. While market opportunities continue to expand, sophisticated and complex electronic terminals have brought innovations in PCB manufacturing. The low latency, high transmission rate, and high connection density of 5G will increase the PCB circuit density and frequency. As application scenarios include automobiles, high-speed rail, industrial control, and even medical treatment and rescue, the reliability requirements are also higher. . The application of massive MIMO technology, product design and craftsmanship are quite different, coupled with the application of microwave frequency band, these are also huge challenges for PCB manufacturers. Artificial intelligence terminals have significantly increased the integration level, resulting in a corresponding increase in PCB circuit density, which puts forward higher requirements on precision manufacturing technology, and more importantly, the application of smart cloud will bring about the demand for big data; Internet of Vehicles and ordinary Compared with network products, which connect the various ecology inside and outside the car, the most important thing to realize the real ""car life"" is still the reliability of the product. Darlox Electronics has begun to deploy in these markets, such as participating in customers' 5G R&D and providing PCBs for test base stations.

5,How Digital Marketers Can Improve Their Online Presence,business," Online marketing is a growing and important aspect of companies in today's technologically advanced world. The truth is that online marketing has been around almost as long as the internet itself. There are many benefits to marketing online as well as some challenges to overcome. Online marketing helps to promote a company's products and services while also providing consumers with information and resources they may not be able to find offline. Basically, online marketing simply refers to any online marketing strategies or assets they can use to reach consumers. Email marketing, pay per click advertising, social networking advertising and blogging are all good examples of online marketing they help provide information to consumers and persuade them to purchase. Content marketing provides fresh, relevant and engaging content for consumers to consume on a regular basis and also drive large volumes of traffic to a company's website. This type of marketing allows companies to establish an online presence and get in front of their target audience. Content marketing is the next big thing in online marketing strategies, as it can provide a company with numerous benefits. A company can use content marketing to obtain leads from the social media sites and other forms of free advertising that they have on their disposal. They can then use these leads to develop and launch new channels, which will deliver even better results. For example, if a company launches a contest and reaches out to users on Facebook, Twitter, etc., then they can build a solid relationship with these users and hopefully influence their buying decision. This is the same for content marketers working with B2B companies to provide them with leads and new channels to sell their products. B2B companies that aren't taking advantage of the opportunities provided by digital advertising can miss out on attracting the attention of large amounts of potential buyers. As well, they could be missing out on capturing a specific niche market that could be highly profitable. Digital marketing can help companies reach their desired demographic target through the various platforms that are available, while at the same time providing them with the ability to choose the kind of advertising that will best reach them. Customer service is an important part of any marketing strategy, and B2B companies should pay special attention to this component of their advertising budget. In fact, marketers should be paying close attention to the customer service record of a prospective client before deciding to invest in them. The amount of money being spent on an ad campaign can greatly affect the success of that campaign. A low cost customer service record may give the impression that the company doesn't really care about their customers, but a poorly done ad campaign could potentially cost them more money in the end. Lastly, there are various social marketing strategies that are being employed by companies today. Some are successful and others are not. Social media is the most popular online marketing strategy today, as it allows businesses to reach an extremely targeted audience without spending a lot of money. If these businesses make a good impression on their potential customers with their social marketing efforts, they will likely develop a good relationship and could turn into long-term customers. These kinds of relationships are very valuable, and businesses need to consider all of their options when developing a plan to improve their online presence. This includes hiring professional digital marketers to help them achieve their goals."
6,What is a Standoff?,business," Have you ever been to a restaurant or business where they have information or photos displayed on glass seemingly floating on a wall? More than likely they are using a standoff, and not the Mexican kind.  Standoffs are small metal spacers made of aluminum, stainless steel or acrylic that goes between a sign and the building meant to be hung on. The body of the Standoff is drilled into the wall while the cap is attached to the piece of glass or acrylic that can display your media. The sign will appear to ""Stand-Off"" from the wall. This creates an almost invisible way to hang pretty much anything you want to display on your wall, from business names to restaurant menus. I can almost guarantee you see them almost every day, without even noticing. Standoffs can come in a wide variety of diameters and lengths to support any kind of design or weight of sign. There are different types of Standoff depending on how they attach to the display or wall. The most common type that you will see is the ""through-grip"" standoff. As described before this is the kind that attaches to the wall and then the cap of the standoff goes on the other side of the sign to attach to the wall. There is a small hole in the body of the barrel attached to the wall that you put your anchor through to securely place it along the wall. Conversely there is also an edge-grip style that doesn't require any drilling to attach the cap to the barrel, the standoffs grip onto the sides of the sign and are attached to a fixed line which is anchored into the wall. Another common place you will find standoffs is inside computer parts. Motherboards and other components of computers often require delicate pieces like processors to be set at a specific distance from each other in order to prevent malfunction, and need to be securely attached to either the board or the case of the computer. Of these standoffs they can be either female-to-female, male-to-male, or the standard female to male. Depending on the application you will need to select the right standoff for how far away or close the pieces need to be from each other. If you find there is still a gap then any kind of spacer will do the job. Some specialty standoffs can also exist if say you wanted built in lights to brighten your sign display. Connected to a transformer these standoffs typically have LED's built in and offer different colors to enhance your sign display even further. If security is an issue, often the case for museums or art galleries; many companies also offer tamper proof standoffs. Ingeniously designed these standoffs will actually tighten if someone tries to unscrew them or otherwise tamper with the sign. Many times they will have other methods to prevent theft such as not having visible screws to undo. These are commonplace in areas that tampering with a sign or display will be expected."
7,Pros And Cons Of Accepting Digital Currencies Including The bitcoin Protocol,business," Many people are trying to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of bitcoins. This is because they recognize that it is a new technology with many great benefits but also has some disadvantages that we should be aware of before we start using it for ourselves. One advantage of Bitcoins is that it does not require a third party like a bank or a credit card to hold an account. Instead, you only need your computer and a high-speed Internet connection to buy and sell. Transactions are secure and easy to use because the bitcoins are stored in a public online database called the ""bitcoin network."" This makes transactions safe and sound by using complex mathematical algorithms to ensure the security of your transactions. Bitcoin Another advantage of using bitcoins is that no government or regulatory oversight is needed. The bitcoins are held in a public online database maintained by several different websites. Since no government controls the Bitcoin networks, no regulatory oversight is needed and this means that there is no danger of terrorist groups funding terrorist activities or of corrupt governments stealing money from their citizens. The disadvantages of using bitcoins also worry some people. In some parts of the world like the United States, some people worry that there could be a lack of privacy if they transact in the conventional way. They worry that their personal information may be intercepted in the block chain. The worry is unfounded because the bitcoins do not need to be transacted in person. Any unauthorized access to your personal information is illegal. In fact, the bitcoins are treated exactly like any other public record, so if you want to look up someone's private information, you can easily do so through a comprehensive and trusted directory on the internet. The disadvantages of bitcoins also worry some businesses and consumers. Since you cannot hold and transfer money using bitcoins, you have to convert the funds into conventional currencies before you spend them. This conversion process can take a long time. Another disadvantage is that the fees for transferring money are high. This is due to the large number of factors that have to be taken into account to compute the transfer fees, including the rate at which international wires are being made to the particular financial institution and the rate at which the bitcoins are being transferred. Some argue that the pros and cons of the currency protocol named after the Internet to figure out the way the system works. This is also the case with the bitcoin system. The biggest advantage of the bitcoin its uses as a transactional currency. Transactions involving the sale of goods and services are not possible without the help of the bitcoin protocol. So the bitcoins offer great uses to businesses that want to make international trades. Some argue that it will be decades before digital currencies are widely accepted across countries. However, the volatility in the price of the bitcoins has been decreasing since the establishment of the bitcoin system. Many retail stores accept the credit cards and debit cards as payment for the goods that they sell. This means that buyers can easily buy products online without having to pay hefty exchange fees."
8,The Different Ways That Internet Usage Can Impact Your Business,business," Internet has changed the way we do business. Businesses are acquiring more consumer data and engaging in buying behaviors and making marketing strategies according to the study. Innovative new business models are constantly coming up. Everyone is looking for unique internet business ideas. While there are many business concepts that have developed through innovation, some have a much better chance of success when implemented properly. The first concept that we need to look at is that of communication. In order for us to communicate with each other and with our customers, we need to find a way to get our messages across without drowning us in the text. Some people use voice to talk over the phone, but this method is very time consuming. For this reason, short messaging service (SMS) is used for many forms of communication. SMS allows us to send instant messages from our computer to another computer, mobile phone, or mobile device. Text messaging is not only used for communication, but also advertising. The most common form of advertising today is through banner ads on the web page. Other kinds of advertising include pop-ups and advertisements that come up when you visit certain websites. These kinds of advertisements are usually not noticed by passers-by, but when they are clicked, they bring you to a separate website where you will find information about the company that is advertising. The next concept that we need to look at is that of internet use and the relationship between the use of internet and the economy. Most businesspeople realize the value of advertising to increase awareness of products and services. They also realize that a good deal of lost revenue can be offset through careful use of internet. This means that when people are aware of a particular business or product, they will make a purchase. In today's information age, most people rely heavily on the internet for research purposes. When the Internet was first introduced to the world, it was considered a novelty. Fast forward to 2021 and the use of internet in research are commonplace. This means that the use of the internet to gather information about products or services is no longer a novelty. The last concept we need to look at is the impact of social media. Many businesspeople are now more likely to interact with their customers online than they are in person. This interaction can often lead to more sales and, as a result, increased profitability. Social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook allow people to share information about their lives and businesses with others who are also part of that network. As more people begin to build social networks, the importance of using the Internet becomes more evident. Marketing through the use of blogs is also becoming commonplace in marketing efforts. The blog allows people to express themselves in a sort of diary, and businesses can take advantage of this writing to market their product. One of the disadvantages of blogging is that, if you are not careful, it can easily get out of hand and become a place for people to vent. However, as long as you make sure your content is relevant, you will be able to help your cause and draw traffic to your website. By examining how different elements of internet usage impact your business, you will be able to determine how to use the medium to its fullest potential. By having an understanding of what the different ways are for getting the most from internet usage, you will be able to use it to its fullest advantage. Not only does the Internet help in increasing your company's visibility, but it also allows for greater levels of communication between your employees. It also allows for you to better manage your budget."
9,Modern Day Ecommerce,business," Modern buyers want convenient and simplified access to products catalogs via the web but they will also need a personal telephone call or assistance with a knowledgeable sales representative. They often search for products on their smart phones, send off RFQs over the internet, and discuss prices over the telephone on a live call. For this reason, it is crucial for businesses to maintain privacy and security in regards to the personal information that they divulge, particularly when it is transmitted over the internet. Ensuring privacy is best achieved through adoption of best practices when it comes to managing eCommerce transactions. When it comes to online shopping, many consumers enjoy being able to shop from the comfort of their own home. This is why they turn to eCommerce to do so. In order to complete a secure, private shopping experience, individuals must ensure that their personal information is safe and secure. Many websites, especially those that specialize in collecting and processing credit card transactions, use encryption technology to prevent the transmission of sensitive personal information. When purchasing something via an online catalog or through a company's website, these individuals can rest assured that their personal information is protected and will not fall into the wrong hands. However, even with encryption technologies in place, consumers still need to be aware of their security options and the best practices for securing their personal information. The first step to ensuring security is to educate oneself about security best practices. The easiest way to do this is through tutorials and online discussions. Reading articles on the subject matter and watching tutorial videos on YouTube also give individuals a great opportunity to learn more about how to secure their information. The Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies offer a variety of tutorial and discussion groups designed to help consumers learn about the importance of securing their personal information. Websites and companies also take advantage of secure sockets layer (SSL) technology to protect their consumer information. Consumers should make sure that their computer's Internet security suite is capable of dealing with websites that require SSL encryption. This technology is used by websites and companies that process credit card transactions. The encrypted information is sent over the secure internet connection between the buyer's computer and the merchant's website. The buyer's personal information, along with the order confirmation, is passed between the buyer and the seller before it is transmitted to the payment gateway company. Some companies choose to incorporate their own internal system for securing their ecommerce website and data. Often times, these internal systems are available for purchase or rental but consumers should do a search for them and compare their security options. Some of these security options include application security, database security, application testing, firewall and memory protection among others. Some companies take advantage of layered security options in addition to using secure sockets layer (SSL). These companies often use a technology called virtual private networks (VPNs). Using a VPN will allow consumers to conduct business online even while they are on the road or in an airport. Some websites will only accept credit cards and/or debit cards. If a website is only going to accept one type of payment, consumers should research the company to see if they have other options available. Some companies will accept major credit and debit card companies as well as electronic check instead. When consumers are shopping online, they should always check to see if a company accepts the type of payment they wish to make. If a company will accept any and all forms of payment, then the website is likely a legitimate company. It is important that consumers be aware of where their information is going. Many companies take advantage of this by stealing information directly from consumers. However, it is very possible for a website to protect its consumers. The best way to do this is to use a firewall for protection. A firewall blocks unwanted traffic from going to and coming from a website. It also acts as a barrier against hackers who want to take advantage of the website."
10,Online Marketing For Freelancers,business," Online marketing for freelancers has grown in popularity over the years. This is especially true of SEO services and freelance market place services for which there are a large number of clients. These are the services that allow users to post content on the Internet, including articles and other content, so that others can see them. When a user posts content, such as an article, it becomes visible to many of those who visit the site that post content through search engines. The content is usually written by the client and then posted on a site that has an online marketing campaign for writers. Content marketing can be a good way for an established business to advertise to new, potential customers. Online service marketing, which includes this service marketing mix, is a good way to market through the Internet to both existing customers and potential customers who have not yet visited the site or firm. This is also a good way to find clients who may be interested in the products or services that you offer. One of the many challenges of working as a freelancer is providing quality work for the clients that you represent. There are a number of different types of clients that a freelancer can work with. A few of these are traditional business firms, which often hire freelancers to market their products and services. There are also other online service providers that can be freelancers such as bloggers and designers. This is especially true of the latter, as it is much easier to find clients who are interested in the type of work that a freelancer does, compared to looking for clients in an offline market such as an office building. Freelance writers are one type of service provider that can benefit from online marketing. Freelance writing jobs can be a great way for a freelance writer to increase their income. When a person markets themselves through an online service, they often do not have to pay for advertising. Instead, the advertiser pays them to provide content for their website. When an advertiser uses a freelancer to promote their product, it helps to bring more people to the site who may be interested in the product that is being offered. Another way that online marketing can help to make freelancers more successful is through a brand awareness campaign. A brand awareness campaign can be done by a freelancer or can be handled by an online marketing consultant who has connections within the industry. When a professional handles the online marketing strategy, they can build a good reputation for the freelancer and help to increase their client base in a very short amount of time. In addition to this, online marketing for freelancers also tends to improve their skills. One of the main skills that a freelancer can learn through this type of campaign is SEO, or search engine optimization. Freelancers who are hired to promote a brand online often work with SEO experts who can help them create the best campaigns possible. The expertise that they gain as a result of this type of campaign will help them grow as a freelancer and open up more opportunities for them in the future. For some freelancers, the idea of working online has many benefits. There is no commute to and from work, no dress code, no security worries or the hassle of dealing with customers or vendors. For these types of people, working online can be a great benefit to them. However, there are other types of freelancers who struggle to break into the industry because they lack the expertise that is needed. An online marketing consultant can help them overcome their problems. This type of online marketing can be very beneficial to any company, and is a great way to ensure success for companies that hire freelancers. Online marketing is a wonderful way to market any business. Freelancers who use a service marketing plan or who focus on one particular intangible good can have a greater chance of success than those who try to focus on different areas. They may not see immediate results, but they will succeed over time and be able to make the most of their time and efforts. By working together with a seasoned SEO consultant, a company can get the best of both worlds and start to see the profits that they have been dreaming of."

12,Does Discounting Help or Hurt?,business," Is discounting helping or hurting your practice? As you know, plastic surgery advertising is out of control. Everywhere you look, you see ads, banners, and websites Offering deep discounted surgical and non-surgical procedures. That’s not happening by accident. Extreme competition is forcing some practices to lead with a price to attract new cosmetic patients. However, this heavy emphasis on discounts creates the “Groupon Discount mindset” in consumers. But that not only cheapens the surgeon’s image but also our entire industry. And, on the other hand, you have to address it with prospective patients because they are bombarded with it. They start believing price is the only variable to consider when shopping around for a service provider. But then, that puts you in a position to play “Let’s Make a Deal” with prospective patients who want to negotiate with you. OR NOT, but then you lose to these discounters more often than you want to admit, so what do you do? FIRST, GET YOUR OWN MINDSET STRAIGHT. It’s never ALL about price. If it is, you didn’t do a good enough job promoting your value OVER price. It’s your responsibility to show prospective patients why you are worth what you charge, and I’ll give you examples coming up. And here’s something else to consider… Like attracts like. That means you attract who you are. If you verbally wrestle vendors to the ground to get a great deal, you will attract patients who do the same. If you make buying decisions based on quality, credibility, and excellent customer service at a fair price, you will attract patients who do the same. Be the quality decision-maker you want your patients to be. PROMOTE VALUE AND BENEFITS OF YOUR SERVICE The value of your services is the difference between the price you charge and the benefits the patient perceives they will get. If the patient perceives they will get a lot of benefit for the price they pay, then their perception of your value is very high. The good news is, you can control that. Spend the time teaching prospective patients how much they will benefit, how much your expertise and skill will help them, and all of the things your intangible services can do to help them to achieve their goals and solve their problems. The more you focus on these values, the less important price becomes. STEPS TO FOLLOW TO HELP YOU FOCUS ON MORE THAN PRICE: Who Wants Your Services? In other words, who is most likely to choose you and pay your prices? How old are they? What is their income level? Do they have children? What is their level of education? What zipcode do they live in? Now that you know their demographics, ONLY advertise to that targeted audience. Not only will you save money, but you’ll also get better quality prospective patients who can afford your services and who want to pay a fair price for your skill and expertise. Identify the Patients’ Problems Clearly You are in the business of providing solutions to problems consumers have about their appearance. Cosmetic patients pay you to solve their problems, so your job is to find out what bothers them and why. Here’s a secret that wins you more patients…… Not only are you looking for the positive benefits prospective patients hope to gain such as increased confidence, increased desirability to the opposite sex, and a new lease on life, but also address their fears. Because they may like what they hear, but they are afraid. Afraid they will spend all of this money and time recuperating only to regret their decision. The media loves to show plastic surgery patients who have had bad plastic surgery outcomes with distorted face and body features, awful scarring, and disfigurement of other cosmetic surgery patients who said yes. So, the prospective patient is scared they, too, will end up with regret and have to go through hell AND spend even more money to fix it. The surgeon who not only proves their skill but also calms their fears AND reassures them of a better future, wins. Prove It! For all sorts of reasons, consumers are a skeptical group. They want proof from all sorts of sources so provide it. For example: Proof from You: Great before/after photos untouched – and lots of them Videos explaining each procedure Your videos talking about pros/cons; i.e., A smiley face scar vs. a flat tummy Tour of your clean updated private, and comfortable in-house OR suite Media PR Speaking engagements Book you wrote and/or articles authored Guest spots on others’ blogs and podcasts Voted Top Doc Excellent staff credentialing you Your superb customer service Outside Proof: Patient video testimonials telling their story and what you did for them Online reviews from happy patients Patient comments in 3rd party forums Google your name and all good news comes up Your patients interacting and talking about you on your and their social media platforms The more benefits, value, and proof you can clearly provide to prospective cosmetic patients, the more likely they will consider more than just price. When done correctly, they see and appreciate your higher price is well worth it."
13,Social Media Ideas for Plastic Surgeons,business," Social Media has become the most influential virtual space available today to help you grow your practice. That’s why you need the guide below that gives you social media ideas for plastic surgeons. Now that 59% of the world’s population is online, it’s no longer optional if you’re looking for new cosmetic patients.  It’s here to stay so you might as well embrace it. Make it an important part of your marketing plan, your branding, and a gateway to current and prospective patients. Social media done right can increase your website traffic, generate leads, portray you as an expert, and build relationships by interacting with your audience. The beauty of social media is that you get to tell your story your way. You are the actor, producer, and editor all in one. You control the narrative and create your own image.  That’s powerful, but also daunting so this post gives you lots of social media ideas for plastic surgeons you can use right away. TYPES OF PLASTIC SURGERY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS Since you are a business, remember your main objective of social media is to grow your plastic surgery practice. So, your social media posts need a balance of the various types of social media posts that are: Educational Informative Interesting Entertaining Compelling To help you get started, use this guide of social media ideas for plastic surgeons: OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA TIPS TO HELP PLASTIC SURGEONS Social Media can take a chunk of your and your staff’s time so here are tips to help you be most effective: Choose the Right Social Media Platforms for You as a Plastic Surgeon Unless you have a marketing agency doing this for you, you most likely have a staff person handling this and 10 other things, so their time is limited. My advice is to focus on one platform first. Get good traction going and then spread out to more platforms. For example, Instagram is, by far, a favorite for our plastic surgery industry. However, Facebook wins hands down for sheer volume and results. The good news is Facebook owns Instagram, so when you post on Facebook, you can automatically post to Instagram and vice versa (check your settings). Yes, TikTok is the latest craze and you can build an audience early there; however, that takes time and the audience skews very young. That means they want to be entertained, so I hope you can dance! Use Lots of Social Proof in Social Media Posts for Plastic Surgeons The most serious prospective cosmetic patients looking for a provider care most about your social proof.  Consumers want to see your work. They want to know what kind of results to expect. They want to see your other happy patients enjoying their new look. That means you want to show off your before/after photos or, better yet, let your patients do it for you! Have them post their before/after photos on their own social media platforms. A photo really is worth a thousand words so don’t hold back. Show off your great results and watch the comments flow in. Social Media User Generated Content And here’s another new trend to complicate things….85% of consumers find User Generated Content more influential than brand content. That’s the content that is created when your audience comments on your posts. You see plenty of examples of this on social media when the surgeon asks his audience a question to respond to or shows them a video and now you see a stream of responses.  That’s user-generated content that engages prospective patients to interact with you. Consider what inspires your audience to share content and how you can create an environment to engage with patients to create user-generated content.  Examples would be: “I’m going hiking this weekend. What are you doing?” “I’m thinking about getting this new technology. What do you think?” Video is a Super Popular Social Media Idea for Plastic Surgeons Patients prefer video to all other forms of content when learning about new procedures and services. It’s also a great way to position you as a helpful expert when you answer prospective patients’ most common questions. Start your own YouTube channel and designate an outside videographer or a tech-savvy staff person to capture and post content in video to then be shared throughout your social platforms. For example, do a tour of your office, interview a patient to describe her own journey and how great she feels now, and do educational videos going over FAQs of popular procedures. Authentic Personality Posts Prospective cosmetic patients want to know you. Your headshot on your website doesn’t cut it anymore.  They need to see you in action as a surgeon, a speaker, a person, a parent, an athlete, and so on. To keep it simple, select someone in your office to be the “Roving Reporter”. Their job is to follow you around with an iPad or iPhone to capture moments of “A Day in the Life of a Plastic Surgeon.”  You are the content. It’s you preparing for surgery, doing surgery, your post-op visits, consulting with new patients, interacting with staff, and so on.  It’s endless content for you since no day is the same and you have an endless stream of patient stories, their journey, and their results. Collect Contact Information Here’s the big challenge when you build your web presence on social media such as  FB, IG, TikTok, and the rest of them….the landlord can kick you out and/or raise the rent at any time.  That means you are at the mercy of their rules. That also means they can shut you down for offensive content and they can force you to “pay to play”. One way they do that is to “strangle” your list of followers, so they no longer see your posts. So now you have a false sense of comfort thinking you are communicating regularly with your audience when in reality, less than 10% are seeing you. These social platforms want you to advertise which would be fine except, if you have been trying to advertise on social media platforms, plastic surgery does not get along well due to the nature of your content. You are one step away from porn, you are seen as persuading consumers to have medical procedures and you are hurting the consumers’ self-esteem. That’s why it’s so difficult to get your ads approved. As a matter of fact, social platforms’ organic reach will be non-existent in the near future. As already mentioned, they only show your posts to about 10% of your audience since they want you to pay for advertising just like you had to with TV, radio, and newsletters but do you see the catch 22?  They will force you to advertise YET they won’t approve your ads – crazy!! So, here’s what you do…..you collect your own data of your followers by using an opt-in landing page like this one.  Add a link in your bio that goes to a customized landing page for the prospective patient to give you their name, cell, and email, as well as ask a question or request a consultation. Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing will continue to be popular; however, consumers are waking up to the fact that most influencers are promoting for the sheer motive of getting paid, and that hurts your brand. Word of mouth has always been and will continue to be a huge patient attraction strategy. When you get patients talking about you on social media, you build brand awareness and credibility and set yourself up for more patients. One way to drive social word of mouth is to partner with influencers—people who have a large following on social media and can draw the attention of that following to you. Just google “influencer marketing platforms” and they will partner you with influencers. Of course, it would be great if you could get one of the Bravo housewives to be your influencer, but it’s not necessary.  Start by getting to know your current patients to find out what kind of following they have and if they would be willing to spread the word for you.  Local followers are more likely to follow through than followers who have to travel cross-country to see you. SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLS TO HELP YOU There are loads of tools to help you if you decide to do it yourself. Hootsuite is a popular social media management tool since it allows you to respond and engage without having to log in to each of your individual social media accounts but there are many others. And, if you need help making your graphics eye-catching, Canva is popular because it’s so easy to use and has a huge library of creative deliverables done for you. Video editing is also becoming a big part of social media to make your content more eye-catching and engaging so I suggest starting with free apps, such as Apple iMovie and OpenShot for PC. CONCLUSION As you can see, there is a lot to social media. But like everything else in life, you get out of it what you put into it. If you believe social media is an important aspect of your brand and marketing plan, you need to put the time and investment into it, and you can start by using my Social Media Ideas for Plastic Surgeons Guide."

When consumers are shopping online, they should always check to see if a company accepts the type of payment they wish to make. If a company will accept any and all forms of payment, then the website is likely a legitimate company. It is important that consumers be aware of where their information is going. Many companies take advantage of this by stealing information directly from consumers. However, it is very possible for a website to protect its consumers. The best way to do this is to use a firewall for protection. A firewall blocks unwanted traffic from going to and coming from a website. It also acts as a barrier against hackers who want to take advantage of the website."
15,"E-commerce of wine, the boom of 2020 in the data of the Italian bigs, who look to the future",business," Driven by the closures to restaurants imposed by the pandemic and by the desire of wine lovers not to renounce a good glass of wine even at home, the boom of wine e-commerce in Italy has been one of the phenomena accelerated by Covid. A phenomenon still limited in absolute values (Nomisma estimates talk about a total turnover of about 200 million euros), but important for several aspects. First of all, it represents an important channel for many small wineries focused on catering and that, due to strategy, structure, and size, do not want or are not able to access large-scale distribution, which, especially for the larger wineries and historically present in modern distribution, has been the real barrier to the crisis. Secondly, because more and more wine e-commerce portals are also communication tools, capable of connecting producers who want to make themselves known and consumers who are looking for something new, as well as training, with different proposals for tasting courses, wine culture and food matching. Third, because according to all the analysis and testimonials of the big players, many of those who started buying wine via the web for the first time, are continuing to do so, and this will be more and more important, with Italy on the right path to recover a gap compared to other countries in this sense, with many cases, from the US to the UK, online wine sales are worth more than 10% of the total, with peaks such as in China, where estimates range from 20% to 30%. And that this sector will have an important future, is also told by the investments magnetized by some of the most important realities of the sector, and their 2020 turnovers, as revealed by the data, collected by WineNews, on big players such as Tannico, Vino.com, Callmewine.com and Xtrawine, the so-called “pure players”, which put together a turnover of 82 million euros in 2020, with a growth of more than +80% on 2019, in addition to the peculiar experience of Winelivery, which focuses mainly on fast deliveries in major cities, and which came to 7.5 million euros, with a boom of +600%. Tannico, which recorded in 2020 the entry into the capital of a beverage giant such as Campari Group (which invested 23.4 million euros, with a reserved capital increase for 49% of Tannico, with the possibility of rising to 100%, from 2025, based on certain conditions), saw its turnover reach 37.5 million euros, with a growth of +82% on 2019, thanks to 2.5 million bottles delivered, 400,000 orders shipped worldwide (+95%, mainly Uk, USA, Switzerland and France), with peaks of 7,500 orders handled in a single day. WinePlatform, the b2b service launched in 2017 to support wineries on a technological and logistical level in the sale of their products to end customers, is also registering a vertiginous growth in volumes. The 120 wineries active on the platform - such as Donnafugata, Masi Agricola, Alois Lageder and Cantina Tramin, to name a few - have, in fact, seen both the number of customers served and orders managed more than quadruple in 2020, for a total of over 78,000 bottles sold. “It has been a challenging year but one of great consolidation for Tannico - says Marco Magnocavallo, CEO of Tannico - the Covid emergency has brought an acceleration of business that we expected to reach in 2021 with a huge share of new customers on their first purchase. It was also an important year for Tannico for two new projects that were launched and that opened our company to multichannel communication: the Tannico Wine Bar launched in July in Via Savona in Milan and the Tannico Flying School Online - our platform that informs and shortens the distance between people and the world of wine with thematic tours, tutorials, interviews with winemakers and video tastings”. Vino.com (formerly Vino75), owned by Andrea Nardi Dei, nearly doubled its turnover to 30 million euros, explaining to WineNews: “The market today is made up of a few “pure players”, like us, but also many newcomers and the overall growth (albeit to a lesser extent, ed.) is also due to the classic wine shops that have invested online, and to the channels of the large supermarket chains. It is a market that in the last years has grown by 23% year on year, on average, but there is still a lot of room. One thing that has worked in our favor is that our platform, in 2014 when we started, we wrote it completely by ourselves, and this has been strategic because this year we have been able to keep up the pace without changing our infrastructure”. Also thanks to a partnership that was born from the start with a giant like Google, which is constantly evolving and sees the tools for analysis and promotion becoming more and more refined. ”We don’t just focus on sales - explains Nardi Dei - but on providing an experience: there is the virtual sommelier, there is the possibility of discovering new products and producers, beyond the big brands, thanks to a deep and evolved navigation system, there is, in short, great attention to everything that is the “customer experience”. We have also grown abroad, in particular in Germany, where things are going very well also thanks to the fact that we take care of the customs operations, without any additional burden for those who sell and for those who buy, but also in Holland and Belgium, we are moving in France, Denmark and Sweden, and we are already present in China, which is a very particular market, and where we focus only on high-end products, in a store inside Alibaba”. Another important aspect, is the difference in purchases compared to other channels: “in these months we have also sold wines from large-scale retail trade, but the main target is another one. Just look at the average price: in large-scale distribution”, says Nardi Dei, “we are around 3 euros per liter, while we are around 13/14 euros per bottle, with an average order of 8/10 bottles. And this also tells us that we are not taking away space from the classic wine shops, those in the vicinity or in the neighborhood, where people buy just one bottle for a special occasion. In any case, in my opinion, there are still many possibilities for growth. In Italy, online is still worth less than 2% of the market, and the spaces are not saturated at all”. A similar vision to that of Alessandro Pazienza, sole director of the Xtrawine group, one of the historical players in the sector in Italy, which, in 2020, “touched an aggregate turnover of 12.5 million euros, up +80% on 2019, of which 10.5 million euros can be attributed to our Italian platform, and 1.5 million euros to the Hong Kong office, even if we historically have international markets as a strategic horizon, so much so that our sales are 45% in Italy and 55% abroad. Certainly, 2020 was a decisive year, the boom did not stop even in the summer when there were reopenings, and 2021 also started with great growth. In fact, even though companies like us have been on the market since 2009, I think we are at the beginning of our history, there is enormous potential in Italy and the world. I do not think we can go back, and I would say more: we are in front of a distribution revolution of the wine product”. And although in recent years, and especially in recent months, dozens of companies dedicated to wine e-commerce have been born, “in my opinion this is a channel that structurally tends to concentration, the big ones, especially among pure players, will remain few”. Among these, another reality that has grown significantly is Callmewine.com, which at the end of 2020 saw the Italmobiliare of the Pesenti family invest 13 million euros to acquire the majority of the company, of which it now holds 60%. For Callmewine.com, the year closed with 12 million euros in sales, up 95%, and 2021 too began with strong volumes, involving both better-known and commercially strong wines and appellations, as well as more niche and artisanal realities, the portal explains to WineNews. “Callmewine represents a fast developing reality - comments to WineNews Carlo Pesenti, CEO of Italmobiliare - that has been able to anticipate some of the trends of this last period, such as the increased degree of digitalization of consumers and the greater propensity to buy online. These phenomena are already present and destined to consolidate, also in a framework not conditioned by the constraints imposed by the current situation. The presence of Italmobiliare will make it possible to make the most of important growth levers not yet exploited. On the other hand, the entry into a dynamic reality such as Callmewine is an opportunity for Italmobiliare to consolidate technical, commercial and organizational expertise in the management of e-commerce and the online channel, a strategic know-how that is fundamental today and can also be applied in other portfolio companies”. A more peculiar case history is that of Winelivery, another reality with important numbers: thanks to a monstrous growth of +600% in 2020 on 2019, it has a turnover of 7.5 million euros, with its app downloaded by more than 700,000 Italians, and 1.2% of the Italian population. A reality, that of Wine Livery that focuses on the peculiarity of express service, with delivery standards in 30 minutes in the main Italian cities, also thanks to 60 stores from Sicily to Alto Adige. 2020 was also an important year from the point of view of funding. The last important investment round concluded in December, saw the reconfirmation of the trust of both partners, including Gellify Digital Investment, as well as the entry of a small pool of new partners synergistic with the project. The collection has allowed the company to find the necessary resources to execute the ambitious development plan of the four-year period 2021-2024, which will bring Winelivery to increase the capillarity and diffusion of the service, thus consolidating its leadership in a segment that, in Italy, has created from scratch. “We consider Winelivery still a startup - says Francesco Magro, founder and CEO of the company - because, as such, we have a desire for growth and we set ourselves very challenging development goals. At the same time, we behave as a company that has to compete on the market, and therefore be able not only to grow at important rates but also to bring profitability to shareholders”. The future of wine, therefore, also passes through digital and e-commerce, even at a worldwide level. With a channel, of wine e-commerce and everything that revolves around it, that continues to receive major investments, such as the one announced in these hours by Vivino, the most used wine review and sales app in the world (50 million users), which has just raised another $155 in funding, in a round led by Swedish investment firm Kinnevik along with Sprints Capital and others, bringing the total raised by the company created by Heini Zachariassen to $221 million from the foundation. The primary goal of the new investment, a note explains, is to improve the technology platform and artificial intelligence to refine suggestions and recommendations for users. But also to invest more in markets deemed to have higher growth potential, namely the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, Portugal and even Italy."
16,Nothing But the Best Aerial Drones for You,business," A drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS. I want to introduce you to the best aerial drones to purchase. The drones were initially intended for the military. However, the application of drones is expanding. It is also used in agricultural, recreational, commercial, and scientific applications. Drone racing, aerial photography, surveillance, and policing can be conducted using drones too. Drones are extremely useful in our everyday busy life and should be pursued by all. Proper care should also be always taken so that the drone is not misused. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes adding a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the UAV. The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention. Drones are rising in popularity. With more people using them, their functions have increased. There is such a wide variety of drones out there that you would have to choose which drones to buy. Drones are aerial vehicles that do not need piloting. Industry players term them Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems. They have preprogrammed flight plans and will fly in straight lines or circles. For more information, log on to https://dronesforme.siterubix.com"
17,Drones with Cameras for Adults,business," Drones with cameras for adults can perform air operations that manned aviation finds difficult or impossible, and they provide evident economic savings and environmental benefits whilst reducing the risk to human life. They already surpass manned aircraft in endurance, range, safety, and cost-efficiency, but next-generation devices will widen the gap still further, adding greater stealth, sensory, payload, range, autonomous, and communications capabilities. Drone sensor technology currently in development can map 2.7 million square miles in a single flight – nearly the area of the 48 contiguous US states. With their growing capabilities, drones are being used in an ever-wider and more innovative range of applications, each with its own unique set of challenges. While some drones are versatile enough to fulfill many types of missions, most are more specialized and designed for a single purpose. Drones are available in many types of geometries, which can be broadly classified under three headings: Fixed-wing, helicopter, and multirotor. The choice of geometry, and the best way of assembling and equipping it, depending on the application. Below are some factors to consider when choosing a drone solution, as described in an article by CMEC, who are designers and manufacturers of batteries for electric UAVs. Multirotor drones are an easy and cheap way of getting a small camera into the air for a short time. They allow good control over position and framing, making them perfect for aerial photography work. However, they have limited endurance and speed, making them unsuitable for aerial mapping, long-endurance monitoring, and long-distance inspection as needed for pipelines, roads, and power lines. Although their technology is continually improving, multirotor is fundamentally inefficient and energy-hungry, as they must constantly fight gravity just to stay aloft. Current battery technology limits electric drones to around 20 – 30 minutes’ flight time with a lightweight camera payload. Internal combustion (IC) engines are not suitable, as they cannot handle the fast and high-precision throttle changes essential for stability. By contrast, fixed-wing drones, like aero planes, use their wings rather than vertical rotors for lift. Requiring energy only to move forward, they are far more fuel-efficient than multi-rotors. Additionally, these drones can use IC engines, so many can stay aloft for up to 16 hours. They can cover longer distances, map much larger areas, and loiter for extended periods monitoring their point of interest. Fixed-wing drones also have downsides. Being unable to hover, they are unsuitable for aerial photography work. Launching and landing are more demanding, as they need a runway or catapult for take-off and a runway, parachute, or net to land safely. Only the smallest fixed-wing drones are suitable for hand launch and ‘belly landing’ in an open field. These types are also higher-cost and operating them is more difficult to learn. A new alternative, called fixed-wing hybrid VTOL, merges the benefits of fixed-wing flight with an ability to take off and land vertically, and hover. These concepts were tried out with manned aircraft in the 50s and 60s but proved too complex and difficult to fly. However, they are now beginning to become feasible, with the arrival of modern autopilots, gyros, and accelerometers. The autopilot can maintain stability, leaving the human pilot the easier task of guiding them around the sky. For more information, log on to: dronesforme.siterubix.com"
18,The Know-Hows of Transferring Money To And Fro Somalia,business," The Federal Republic of Somalia, or Somalia, is a nation lying in a locale of Eastern Africa.

19,Your PMP Study Plan 2021: 7 steps to PMP Exam Success,business," If you've already done your research about the PMP exam, by now, you must have realized that it's a mammoth of a goal to accomplish. The Project Management Professional (popularly known as PMP) is considered a gold standard in the project management community and serves as a badge of honor for those who've demonstrated the commitment, discipline, focus, and hard work in acquiring the coveted designation. That being said, there are now over a million people who have their PMP, and so can you. All you need to do is have a plan of how you will get there and follow it. Whether you're new to the field of project management or someone with years of project management experience, having a study plan for the PMP will always prove to be helpful in your journey to acquire the PMP. Planning becomes even more critical when you're trying to study for the PMP along with work commitments. Think of PMP exam preparation as an exercise in managing a project of your own and testing your skills. Here are 7 steps to follow to get that coveted PMP designation under your belt. Step #1: Understand roughly how much time and effort is needed for PMP exam preparation. The first step in accomplishing any task or initiative is to assess what it entails. For the PMP exam, this means understanding what material is covered on the exam and the exam format. Knowing the breadth of the material tested in the exam will enable you to plan more realistically. However, on average, the PMP exam preparation timelines range from 2-3 months or roughly 80-100 hours of study and practice. To find out how many months you'll need to compare the total time you can spare during a week to the total time required for preparation. Remember to keep the plan high-level and keep room for flexibility in your schedule. There could always be certain days when you might not have the time to study due to professional and personal commitments. Step #2: Plan your exam end date and exam preparation approach After acquiring an understanding of the materials and the exam structure, get an idea of when you would like to take the exam and your exam preparation approach. This does not mean booking the exam but merely planning a particular week or month by when you would want to write the exam. When it comes to approaching the exam content, there are different ways you can do this. For example, some people like to learn in a classroom setting, so they take physical or virtual PMP classes. Others who have a busy work schedule might not have the capacity to spare five days straight in a class and prefer a self-paced course option. Whatever option you choose, remember that the selected option must work with your learning style, costs, and schedule. For example, we've had several busy professionals leverage their PMP exam preparation with our PMP e-learning courses and attained success. Step #3: Go through the exam preparation materials and the PMBOK patiently While studying for the PMP exam, patience is key. The concepts in the PMBOK and the supporting materials are quite comprehensive, and you must go through them with focus and concentration. For example, the first time you read the PMBOK, you might feel overwhelmed with the way it's structured. Hence, breaking down the exam content and tackling one chapter at a time from the PMBOK is a better approach. For example, you can read one chapter from the PMBOK and supplement it with watching the videos in your PMP e-learning course and solving end-of-chapter questions. Step #4: Prepare for agile along with predictive project management Until the end of 2020, the exam PMP content was primarily predictive. Beginning in 2021, the PMP exam content contains both predictive and agile concepts. So, if you've worked in a waterfall-style environment for most of your career, agile might seem like a newer topic for you. However, with the release of PMBOK 6th edition, PMI also released the PMI Agile practice guide, a 210 pages book that covers various agile topics written in collaboration with the Agile alliance. So, reading the PMI Agile Practice guide in addition to the PMBOK is vitally important since nearly 50% of the PMP exam is now agile. Furthermore, grab a free copy of the scrum guide and read it thoroughly, too, since scrum is a widely used agile framework and a majority of the agile questions in the PMP exam are on scrum. Step #5: Practice enough mock exams and questions The PMP exam is truly a test of your ability to comprehend the question and relate it to a project management concept. Plus, the exam length is 4 hours, and the majority of the questions are situational. Further, several questions in the exam can be pretty lengthy and will require good reading speed and comprehension abilities. As the saying goes, 'Practice makes perfect', so getting ample practice before the exam is paramount. Most of us writing the PMP are not in the habit of sitting for long hours writing an exam anymore, so it's essential to put yourself through that situation as much as possible to become comfortable with it. Additionally, practicing various mock questions from different sources can give different perspectives of the exam. One important thing to note is that whatever resource you choose, make sure they provide a good mix of predictive and agile-based questions. You must solve at least 4-5 mock exams with an average score of 75-80% to feel confident about sitting the actual exam. Step #6: Review wrong answers from chapter tests and mock tests Knowing the material and solving mock papers isn't enough if you aren't learning from your mistakes. Even with high scores in the mock tests, you must review all your incorrect answers. This will ensure you don't miss out on concepts you must know for the exam and eventually add to your score in the actual exam. While reviewing incorrect answers, it's a good practice to refer to the sections of the PMBOK provided in the answer explanation. Doing this will help you identify the reason for the wrong choice and reinforce the correct answer. Follow this process for every chapter or mock test you solve. Step #7: Read through the PMBOK one more time and solve more questions The PMBOK is a massive book. It's nearly impossible for anyone just to read it once and be able to retain the information. With 10 knowledge areas and 49 processes, after a point, it can become quite difficult for anyone to remember the content within each of the processes or knowledge areas. Additionally, project management is an integrated discipline where various processes, tools, and techniques connect with each other. Hence, every time you read the PMBOK you'll discover these new connections amongst the multiple processes and knowledge areas which strengthens your understanding of the subject matter and aids you while answering questions, further improving your overall performance. Keep solving mock questions all along this step to check how much of your understanding has improved. Some additional tips for PMP exam success In addition to the steps given above, here are some additional tips to support you during your PMP exam preparation. Tip #1: Review the glossary in the PMBOK and the Agile Practice Guide Although overlooked by many PMP exam candidates during their exam prep, the glossary serves as an excellent resource to familiarise yourself with several definitions, terminologies, and acronyms used across the PMBOK. You can also convert the glossary into flashcards for on-the-go-byte-sized learning. Tip #2: Get on board with a study group for additional motivation Preparing for the PMP exam is an enormous task with weeks and months of commitment and dedicated effort. Therefore, it's common to lose your motivation along the way, especially when you're all alone in the journey. It's probably a good idea to join a study group locally or online. Not only you'll feel charged with the energy of other candidates, but you'll also be able to learn about other resources you can leverage for your PMP exam prep and learn from other people's experiences and mistakes. Tip #3: Use flashcards Using PMP flashcards is a great way to break up the PMP content in micro-sized learning artifacts. Flashcards can be Q&A-based, definitions, acronyms, or formulas related to the PMP exam. The beauty of using flashcards is that they are portable and can be used for quick learning whenever you find the time. These days you'll find both paper-based or app-based flashcards, or if you want to go a step further, create some of your own, especially for the content that you might find difficult to remember. The PMP exam is difficult but not unattainable. Many candidates have found success in passing the PMP exam using a strategy such as the one written above. However, it's also important to remember that everyone is different and that no one size fits all. Feel free to take cues from various sources and design your custom PMP study plan. Lastly, remember that, no matter what process you follow, the key ingredients of dedication, hard work, and effort are what will pave the way for a successful PMP exam pass recipe."

4,Predictable Cosmetic Patient Plan,business," Predictable Cosmetic Patient Plan DO YOU HAVE A PREDICTABLE COSMETIC PATIENT PLAN? IF NOT, READ ON! This is a brand new predictable cosmetic patient plan that Reveals a Revolutionary Way to Generate More Revenues for Your Plastic Surgery Practice…without the Need for Expensive Marketing Agencies, Social Media Managers or Discounting Your Services. Once you know-how, this gives you an opportunity to DOMINATE your market because you’re firing on all cylinders…while your competitors continue to run from one shiny object to the next, burning through time and money and then complaining nothing works! WHAT’S YOUR #1 PRIORITY AS A PLASTIC SURGEON? The answer is or should be to have a predictable cosmetic patient plan. An automatic system to attract a steady stream of cash-paying patients that is reliable and consistent. There’s a saying in business, “Nothing else matters until a sale is made” and that’s true for every business. That means you don’t need leads. You need patients who are willing and able to say yes to you and pay you for your services. Isn’t that right? So, what’s stopping you from having that peace of mind of consistent flow of patients? For one thing, the numerous advertising challenges facing you today as a plastic surgeon include: You can re-design your website, AGAIN, but that alone does NOT get you website traffic because google changes the rules too often. If you “pay to play” using Google AdWords, in order to compete, you have to be willing to outspend your competitors which is a very costly game. You can try social media advertising, but Facebook owns Instagram and Limits you on what you can advertise due to the nature of your content. And to make it even more challenging, the Current Trend in Facebook is Private communities and Tight-knit tribes Which means it’s harder to pin down a target audience to get your ads in front of. And even if you do, consumers today are savvier than ever and tend to filter out advertising. The point being, there’s a lot of NOISE in today’s marketplace and it takes a lot of time, money, effort, and content to get attention. That’s a lot going against you when it comes to attracting more patients to your practice. I suggest getting very targeted and focused when setting up your predictable cosmetic patient plan. Because you can no longer afford to advertise all of your services to EVERYBODY since you’ll run out of time and money trying to be everywhere for everybody. Map out a predictable cosmetic patient plan… …Using this blueprint for patient attraction and conversion because it doesn’t matter how many leads you get if you can’t convert them into paid procedures. So, when attempting to attract new cosmetic patients to your practice, here are the questions you want to ask so you focus on the right things: Which procedures are bringing you the most money? What are the demographics of the patients who want those procedures? Are those patients easy to find and market to? The point being, you have to know your audience and your numbers to know who to target most effectively. But it’s not all about new leads. That’s only half the battle. The other half is about what happens to those leads? It’s imperative you identify the gaps in your lead process that are hurting your revenues such as: Weak phone staff who can’t convert the callers to appointments Low conversion rates because your coordinator is not professionally trained to convert consultations Weak Patient experience Weak follow-up and Poor Patient retention You give yourself a huge raise when you fix these problem areas that are losing you money and keeping you from predictable revenues. And here’s something else to keep in mind… CUSTOMER OPTIMIZATION IS A MUST IN TODAY’S WORLD Due to the insane amount of competition and the increasing costs of advertising, smart plastic surgeons will continue to develop other marketing channels and shiny object gimmicks. However, the main lift in their revenues will come from customer optimization. That means the smart surgeons invest to acquire new patients AND they invest in keeping them because Retention is the new Patient Attraction Strategy of today. Increase a patient’s lifetime value so they return more often, spend more during their visit, refer their friends, give you a great review and share you on social media. This is where all of your leverage and predictable revenues come from. You already spent a fortune to attract that patient to your practice and it costs you nothing to keep them but reaps you huge rewards when you do. Because most cosmetic patients are not “one and done”. They didn’t stop wanting cosmetic services. They just stopped wanting them from you because you are ignoring them. Please remember, cosmetic patients have endless needs, especially as the relentless aging process continues so spend a small amount of your time on patient loyalty to reap big rewards. Your cosmetic patients need your surgical AND non-surgical services now and a month from now and a year from now and so on. And, contrary to popular belief, cosmetic patients really don’t like to doctor shop. When they find someone they like – they stick with them. ESPECIALLY if it’s someone who’s helping patients improve their physical appearance. “Patients for Life” Mindset When you adopt the “Cosmetic Patients for Life” mentality, you gain leverage with those patients who already know, like, and trust you. You already spent a fortune attracting them to you. Now just hang on to them AND they’ll be your unpaid sales ambassadors that: Bring you new patients who convert Write you 5-star reviews Share you on THEIR social media platforms Interact with you on YOUR social media platforms Agree to have their B/A photos used in your marketing and so on. SO, TO PULL ALL OF THIS TOGETHER – WHAT’S THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADVERTISE YOUR COSMETIC SERVICES TO GROW YOUR PRACTICE? The answer is to test and track your advertising channels to ensure you’re getting a good ROI, perfect your lead funnel so you convert more of these leads, and then turn these happy patients into your unpaid sales team. And, it’s also about building up your social proof so new patients who are researching online, can see for themselves how much other cosmetic patients love you and their results. What others say about you because social proof and word of mouth referrals are: A critical part of building a cosmetic practice – always has been and always will be The most authentic way to get new patients The most effective way of advertising for free So, when you have a “More Patients on Autopilot” system in place utilizing social media, email, and word of mouth: You don’t have to do the work – your patients are doing it for you All you have to do is continue to provide quality service and build relationships with your patients And give ADDED INCENTIVES to your patients to help you grow your practice organically That’s where the KiSS Loyalty Club comes in. KISS LOYALTY CLUB FOR COSMETIC PATIENTS It’s a revolutionary Way to Generate More Revenues for Your Plastic Surgery Practice…without discounting your services or spending more on advertising. The KiSS Club: Uses your current patients to do the work for you Rewards your current patients for growing your practice Uses a trustworthy and personal source – your existing patients who already know, like, and trust you Requires almost no work on your part and is Easy to implement and Automatically tracks your progress and generates monthly ROI reports Because here’s the thing… Cosmetic patients are busy and not thinking about your marketing plan so The KiSS Club includes a full done-for-you marketing plan that keeps you top-of-mind and encourages your patients to spread the word in lots of different ways, and, in return, they are rewarded with KISSES. Every KISS they earn is a dollar towards free non-surgical treatments and it’s simple and fun for patients to follow and easy for staff to track. SO, HERE’S HOW KISS LOYALTY CLUB WORKS: When your patient is checking out for the day, your staff adds KiSSes to their account. So if they spent $400 on non-surgical services that day, they get 400 KiSSes and their goal is to reach tiers for free services.

You are investing in a healthy profit margin. Your patients also GET to tier 1 automatically with 1K kiSSes when they: Write a review, refer a friend, approve the use of before/after photos, and complete surgery (that’s optional).

You’re running a business, after all, so here’s the math: In order to achieve a free area of Botox, your patient will need to first spend far more on your non-surgical treatments to reach that reward. Or, they’ll need to give you a referral, review, or social post…or something else that immediately benefits your bottom line! And, remember, the minimum ROI on a free service is at least 750% so this is a profitable money-maker. Also, you might be using other vendor rewards programs which is fine. The KiSS Rewards Club works side-by-side with whatever setup you currently have, even if you provide vendor discounts or other special offers. My intuitive system makes things easier, NOT harder. And, we’ll work with your staff to make sure everything is implemented efficiently, and without any headaches. It’s so easy to use, the staff training takes 10 minutes or less!

Reward your existing patients with more services, and yourself with more revenues. Please click to schedule a call with me and I look forward to speaking with you."
5,"Federal ‘Vanessa Guillen’ Act introduced, data reveals risk of sexual assault at Fort Bliss",business," EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — Christian Alvarado never thought he’d be convicted of sexually assaulting Pfc. Asia Graham and other women. “These [expletive] are going to trip when I walk out of this,” Alvarado told Maj. Natalia Cardona, the military forensic psychologist who evaluated him as part of a general court-martial. Alvarado’s statement prior to being convicted and sentenced to 18 years underscores the attitudes that lawmakers and advocates say are emblematic of the need for military justice reform when it comes to sexual assault. “We’re here today because every year, 20,000 service members are sexually assaulted and another 100,000 are sexually harassed,” Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, said in a news conference on Wednesday. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, joined Speier and a coterie of legislators from both parties and chambers of the U.S. Congress to introduce the Vanessa Guillen Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act. The bipartisan and bicameral bill would transfer the decision to prosecute serious crimes in the military from the chain of command and into the hands of trained, independent military prosecutors. Escobar is co-leading efforts on the House side. U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, introduced the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act (MJIIPA) to the Senate earlier this week. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,. is also working on the act. “For eight years, I have proudly worked hand-in-hand with Sen. Gillibrand on this crucial, bipartisan legislation to combat sexual violence in our nation’s military,” Cruz wrote in an email to KTSM 9 News. “Unfortunately, sexual assault within the ranks continues to be a substantial problem facing our service members — and it’s one we must address decisively.” The continued calls for legislation come in the wake of Graham’s death and the murder of Spc. Vanessa Guillen following separate incidents of sexual assault while enlisted in the military. “The fact remains, under the status quo, too many victims are reluctant to come forward and report these horrific crimes,” Cruz wrote. “Moving prosecution of sexual assaults outside of the chain of command can help prevent those assaults by increasing reporting throughout our military and assuring victims that any possible conflicts with their command structure won’t affect their case.” Analyses of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the U.S. Army was conducted at the request of the U.S. Army’s Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1 to evaluate where and why incidents are most prevalent. The analyses found the average total risk to all women in the Army overall is 5.8 percent, but that some groups of women face a much higher risk of sexual assault/harassment based on the installation that they’re assigned to. Fort Bliss was found to have the second-highest risk for women with a rate of 7.6 percent. The study found that Fort Hood has the highest risk for sexual assault, at 8.4 percent. The study’s authors reported that about 1 in 12 women at Fort Hood are sexually assaulted. Texas posts — including Fort Bliss — lead all Army installations in risk of sexual assault, study finds. Additional risk was identified based on commands and career fields. The commands with the highest total risk for women are combat units, particularly the 1st Cavalry Division (with a risk of 9.3 percent), Headquarters, III Corps (8.1 percent overall risk), both at Fort Hood; and the 1st Armored Division (8.5 percent), which is at Fort Bliss. Women in artillery careers were found to have the highest total risk of sexual assault at a rate of 10.6 percent out of all groups of soldiers evaluated. The study’s researchers say one explanation is that both Fort Hood and Fort Bliss have large volumes of young, unmarried women who are junior-ranking soldiers. The research team also examined adjusted risk, which evaluates the risk of sexual assault and harassment on an installation-by-installation basis. Again, Fort Hood and Fort Bliss were reported to have high adjusted risk, meaning that women at these installations are at greater risk of sexual assault than at comparative bases. Men in the Army, by contrast, were found to have an overall risk of 0.6 percent of sexual assault and 6.5 percent overall risk of sexual harassment. The researchers’ recommendation is to optimize reductions in sexual assault rates by offering enhanced and expanded prevention programs to installations, commands and career fields where soldiers are most at risk. An additional recommendation for the researchers is to collect survey data to quickly and efficiently identify units, commands, bases, career fields and other groups at risk for sexual assault and harassment. Proposed legislation and recommendations by researchers also urge the implementation of preventative efforts. Research suggests that the climate of a particular base of unit plays a role in the prevalence of sexual assault or harassment. “Groups of soldiers that have better supervisor unit and unit climate scores tend to have lower adjusted sexual assault risk and sexual harassment risk scores, while groups with worse climate scores have higher adjusted risk,” according to the study. Another recommendation is to develop climate-improvement interventions for commands, installations and career fields with elevated adjusted risk for sexual assault and harassment and poor climate scores. Other characteristics were identified with elevated risks of sexual assault among women in the military, particularly groups with large proportions of soldiers with combat arms jobs. The recommendation is to examine the distinctions between service members’ experiences in similar groups with different risk profiles in order to determine factors such as work life, social life, culture, etc., that could contribute to disparities when it comes to sexual assault/harassment exposure. The authors of the study stress conducting studies and sharing historical sexual assault risk and harassment data with unit commanders. “When we have a system that fails victims, everyone is failed. Because everyone is a potential victim,” said Rep. Michael R. Turner, R-Ohio. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is looking to the future and is confident the bill will pass quickly in the House and Senate. Legislators working on the bill said they wanted to also remember the lives lost before introduction of the legislation. “We come together today with one voice, with one plan, to save service members from the fates of Specialist Guillen, Private First Class Asia Graham, Airman First Class Natasha Aposhian,” said Speier."
6,The Special Commercial Courts in Poland,business," For several years, Poland has been considered a rather interesting investment destination. Such interest of foreign investors in Poland also results from official publications of the US government, which on its website explains: “In the thirty years since Poland discarded communism and the fifteen years since it joined the European Union (EU), Poland's investment climate has continued to grow in attractiveness to foreign investors, including US investors. ""(US Department od State, https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-investment-climate-statements/poland/). However, it should be noted that any investment activities may result in the necessity to go to court. whether it will be a dispute with public authorities before an administrative court or, for example, a court dispute with an unreliable contractor. First of all, in Polish court proceedings, special commercial courts (commercial departments in common courts) hear the following cases: •	from civil relations between entrepreneurs in the scope of their business activities, even if either party ceased to conduct business •	from the relationship of the company and the claims referred to in Art. 291-300 and art. 479-490 of the Act of September 15, 2000 - Code of Commercial Companies (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 505, as amended) •	against entrepreneurs for the cessation of environmental violations and restoration to the previous state or for compensation for the related damage and for the prohibition or limitation of activities that endanger the environment •	from construction works contracts and contracts related to the construction process for the performance of construction works •	from leasing contracts •	against persons responsible for the entrepreneur's debt, also in the alternative or jointly and severally, by operation of law or legal action •	between the bodies of a state-owned enterprise •	between a state-owned enterprise or its organs and its founding organ or supervisory body •	in the field of bankruptcy and restructuring law •	for granting an enforcement clause to an enforcement order, which is a final or immediately enforceable judgment of a commercial court or a settlement concluded before this court •	for deprivation of enforceability of an enforceable title based on a final or immediately enforceable judgment of a commercial court or a settlement concluded before that court. The newest type of commercial courts in Poland are special divisions in common courts, which have been granted exclusive jurisdiction in intellectual property matters (in matters of protection of copyright and related rights, protection of industrial property rights and protection of other intangible property rights). It should be noted here that in matters of intellectual property, the parties, as a rule, must appear through their professional litigation representative – attorney-at-law (adwokat or radca prawny). In addition, in the case of commercial companies, there are special registration courts that keep the National Court Register. Moreover, in complex cases of competition protection and cases in the field of public economic law, the Court of Competition and Consumer Protection operates in Warsaw, and in public procurement cases, the Public Procurement Court."

8,No More Silver Bullets: Patient Attraction Plan for Plastic Surgeons,business," PATIENT ATTRACTION HAS GOTTEN HARDER OVER THE YEARS. A lot of cosmetic practices were built off of one marketing channel. For years, Plastic Surgeons could count on their TV ad or their RealSelf Q&A to be their main pipeline for new patient attraction.

9,Plastic Surgery Marketing: What's Working Now,business," You probably noticed it’s getting more challenging to get attention online, so this will lay out plastic surgery marketing: what’s working now. There is so much noise in the marketplace today, your message gets lost in the maze of advertising. The sheer number of marketing channels to choose from that help you get in front of prospective cosmetic patients is mind-boggling…. and it’s not going to get any easier for all sorts of reasons. Take SEO. Internet search engine optimization (SEO) rules continue to evolve. It’s just not enough anymore to have a nice website. Nobody is going to see it unless you can convince Google you deserve to be on the first page of search rankings and that’s no easy feat. For example, in the good old days of SEO, your web folks could help your rankings by writing articles stuffed with keywords. It was easy enough for them to do it for you, so you and your staff didn’t need to get involved so it was a win-win. But those days are gone. Google has gotten smarter and will penalize you for keyword stuffing – and any other shady tactics you use to attempt to try and game the system. The bottom line is Google will continue to make it more difficult for you to be found organically (aka – Free). And, since google rules the world for the foreseeable future, it’s best to follow their lead. Since you can’t count on organic SEO like before, you have to look at other creative marketing avenues to get the attention of prospective cosmetic patients long enough for them to notice and act. Below is a list of plastic surgery marketing strategies that are working now to help get you ranked and get the attention of prospective cosmetic patients. Some are quick and easy and most take time and effort because that’s what’s needed to stand out and be heard above the noise. Here they are… CONTENT CREATION In case you haven’t heard, “Content is King” since Google loves content because that’s what googlers want. Think about it from your prospective patients’ point of view… Let’s say they are interested in a tummy tuck. What do they do? They google tummy tuck so it would be wise for you to have a customized content creation marketing strategy such as: A blog post explaining what a tummy tuck is Videos explaining the FAQs of a tummy tuck Gallery showing lots of before/after photos of other patients who have had a tummy tuck Patient reviews of tummy tuck patients singing your praises SOCIAL MEDIA Social media has changed the way your prospective patients communicate as well as get their information. Oftentimes, they will bypass google altogether and search, instead, on their favorite social media platforms. They have a tendency to trust their friends online more than big internet companies. And it’s very much a popularity contest for them. If everyone is following, liking, and sharing you, so are they. That’s your opportunity to use social media marketing strategies, so they get to know you and see you as the best choice. Start with this guide, “Social media ideas for plastic surgeons” that gives you lots of great ideas on what to post: Social Media Ideas for Plastic Surgeons SOCIAL PROOF/INFLUENCER Social proof marketing has been around as long as plastic surgeons. The smart plastic surgeons gain approval from their patients to show their before/after photos to other prospective patients. And they encourage their patients to write a review, and even do a video testimonial. These are essential marketing tools to help other prospective cosmetic patients feel reassured and confident they will also get the result they’re hoping for when choosing a plastic surgeon. Local and national celebrities have been practice-building assets as well. I once went to a med spa opening and she had a B-celebrity attend. It turns out they went to school together, so the celebrity was doing her a favor. You never know… Now that social media has caught on, social proof marketing has evolved into Influencer marketing. Influencers are individuals who have a dedicated social following and are viewed as experts within their niche. This works because of the high amount of trust these social media influencers have built up with their following, and their recommendations serve as social proof. So, if the influencer liked you, so do their followers. PATIENT REVIEWS Next to patient before/after photos, online reviews are extremely important to the prospective cosmetic patient searching for a plastic surgeon they can trust and connect with. Because, what your patients say about you is much more important than what you say about you. And, the more, the merrier. Set up a Patient Reviews protocol so you have a built-in system for asking for patient reviews. By the way, since Google owns the Internet for the foreseeable future, I recommend you make google reviews a priority over the others like www.healthgrades.com and www.vitals.com. Make it easy for your patients to give you a good review and you’ll get more of them. Videos have taken over as the #1 media choice for consumers who prefer watching videos to reading or even looking at images. That means YouTube videos do a great job of engaging your would-be patients if you make videos that are informative, compelling and/or engaging. And Google owns YouTube, so it would be smart to use YouTube marketing strategies to help your search engine rankings. YouTube Marketing can consist of replays of talks you have given at medical conferences or patients events. You can have a professional videographer shoot video and take photos and turn it into your PR introductory video. You can videotape your patient consultations so other prospective cosmetic patients hear enough to feel comfortable enough to call you for their own consultation. PATIENT RETENTION “Patient retention is the new patient attraction strategy of today.”That is so true if you think about it. Who is easier to convert to a surgical procedure? A stranger Internet patient or someone who was referred by their best friend who loves you and their result? This is so often missed but this type of leverage is how you win. You’ve already spent a fortune in time, money and effort attracting these patients to you. It takes minimal time, money, and effort to hang on to them and nurture that relationship. You do that with a simple patient retention marketing strategy to turn these patients into loyal, raving fans such as emails, Instagram contests and a patient loyalty program. WORD OF MOUTH The easiest lead you will ever get is the one that comes from your happy patients. This would-be cosmetic patient is already pre-sold on you because their friend has sung your praises. Word-of-mouth patients are easier to convert, they make a decision faster and are not as price-sensitive as stranger Internet patients. And they didn’t cost you a dime in advertising. Word of mouth marketing for plastic surgeons strategies include: Talking to your patients to let them know you want more patients just like them; Prepare and send great content to your patients on various procedures you offer and remind them to share it with their friends; and Appreciate and acknowledge your patients when they do refer new patients to you since behavior that is rewarded is repeated. For example, this patient loyalty program gives patients KiSSes to redeem for Botox, filler, and laser procedures. TEXTING It’s also called SMS (short message service) Marketing.  It’s very popular since most consumers have their cell phone with them at all times and they read their text messages within minutes of receiving them. So, it’s fast, effective and the cost is minimal. That makes text marketing for plastic surgeons a great channel to increase your revenues but only if done right. You must have your patients’ permission to text them and they must be able to opt-out with a simple STOP. Tip: Make sure your text marketing messages are super compelling, so your audience appreciates receiving them. PODCAST Podcast marketing for plastic surgeons is the newest media channel since consumers have taken a keen interest in listening to podcasts while they exercise, drive or whatever! It’s a fantastic way for new prospective patients to get to know you. I can tell you personally, this marketing channel has gotten me more exposure these past two years than anything else I’ve done. Beauty and the Biz Podcast Podcast marketing also helps your SEO since you now have many more platforms to be found on such as apple podcasts and google play, Spotify and many others. And your branding improves since you’re seen as an expert and you control the narrative so only content you approve of gets out into the world. PATIENT WEBINARS Thanks to COVID, the general public has now gotten used to doing business and life online. Plastic Surgery Patient Webinars Take online learning, for example. Companies like Zoom and  GoToMeeting have exploded. People are appreciating the convenience and time savings of learning online so use that to your advantage. Present your own cosmetic patient webinars to your current patients ready for more rejuvenation and connect with new prospective patients who don’t know you…yet. This one-to-many format is your leverage. You do this one presentation by explaining procedures and showing before and after photos and then opening it up to questions for the audience. Now that its “in the can”, you have content for your website, YouTube, social media, and so on. That’s how it grows legs and gets you in front of new audiences without any extra effort on your part. EMAIL MARKETING Email marketing has its challenges; however, it still wins over any other marketing channel such as social media posts and ads, when it comes to monetizing. That’s because consumers now expect certain email to be promotional, whereas they see social media to be more entertaining. Also, you are emailing your own patient list who already know, like and trust you so you have a warmer audience to nurture. And, unlike Instagram, where you have only a second to grab someone’s attention, there is more room for you to lay out your message in an email, thereby capturing the audience’s attention long enough to get them to act. Think of your email list as an asset because it is. There is so much you can do with email marketing and your email list. It is far from dead so turn your patient list into a money-making asset. PATIENT SURVEY There is a saying in business that goes like this: “You can’t fix what you don’t know, and you don’t know until you ask.” This is as true for cosmetic practices. You have to know what your patients want and don’t want to be able to keep them happy and coming back for more, as well as bringing their friends with them. Conduct a simple annual patient survey to let your patients know you are interested in their input. You care about them and improving your practice for them. CROSS PROMOTE COSMETIC SERVICES Are you sure your cosmetic patients know ALL you offer? If you ever hear, “I didn’t know you did that”, the answer is no, they don’t know about all of your treatments and procedures. That means you are leaving easy money on the table because a patient who is giving you money, will give you more money if you introduce them to more solutions to their appearance problems. When you use simple cross promote marketing strategies, your revenues can easily increase by 20-30% without effort or being pushy. Simply educate your patients on ALL you offer via in-house signage, email and packages to name a few. FOLLOW UP ON PLASTIC SURGERY LEADS Why spend a ton of money on leads if you’re not going to follow up on them? Most practices make that one phone call and/or send one email and then add the lead to the “dead lead” pile when they don’t hear back from the prospective cosmetic patient. When the surgeon asks the staff what happened to them, the answer is usually: “Oh, they weren’t interested.” “They were just price-shopping.” “I tried but they’re not responding.” Granted, depending on where these leads came from, some can be of poor quality, but not all of them. There are at least 15% of those leads that would have converted if given a chance. The secret to follow up on plastic surgery leads is to set up protocol, just like you do for surgery, so follow up becomes a habit. CONVERT CALLERS & CONSULTS I have given you many plastic surgery marketing strategies above to attract lots more cosmetic patients to your practice. When executed, new prospective cosmetic patients will notice you, stop long enough to digest your information and then go the next step which is to actually call your office and book a consultation. However, what experience will they have with your staff when they call? Will it be a continuation of your online brand touting skill, expertise and customer care or will it be the opposite and hurt your brand you work so hard to build? Does the caller book the appointment or hang up confused and disappointed? If they book the consultation, will they say yes or “I gotta think about it”? If you are willing to spend a fortune, and time and effort on new leads, be sure your staff is professionally trained to convert callers and consults. As the saying goes, “Nothing counts until the sale is made.” BUDGET FOR MARKETING The easiest way is to simply budget proportionately to your successes, so you get better results and easier conversions. Then the question becomes how much to spend on advertising and marketing and that depends on: How competitive an area you’re in How long you’ve been in practice Your reputation and credibility As a very general rule, 10% of your budget should go towards marketing and advertising. Increase it if you are a young practice growing and decrease it if you are well established. And, this is important. You need tracking mechanisms such as promo codes, call to actions and a special phone number to track the calls and a special website or web page to track clicks. Whatever it takes to know your results, so you know for a fact what’s working and what’s not. Because I don’t care what anyone else says…. you can’t live off of clicks, likes, shares or visitors. You can only live off of prospective patients going through your processes, choosing you and giving you money. So, the rule is: “If you can’t track it, don’t invest in it.” And, if it’s not working, change, tweak or delete it. Do not keeping throwing money at something hoping it will catch on eventually. WHAT TO DO NEXT I suggest you meet with your team and go over these plastic surgery marketing strategies to determine which ones you are committed to executing. Then take that list and prioritize in what order you will execute and include a deadline date. I guarantee you will attract more cosmetic patients than ever before."

11,Good Marketing Plan for Cosmetic Practices,business," You can transform your cosmetic practice from revenue highs and lows to a steady stream of patients and profits when you have a custom marketing plan in place. This approach allows you to dominate your market because you fire on all cylinders while your competitors continue their narrow focus. Here is what to focus on that gets you the most reliable results: INTERNET MARKETING TO ATTRACT NEW COSMETIC PATIENTS Website Design and SEO. Work with a reputable Internet company that knows the plastic surgery industry. One that has been around and is stable. Get references and review their work. Pick well and then stay with them. The more you bounce around from one Internet company to another, the more leverage you lose. Pay to Play.  Being found organically on the first page of Google is getting more difficult. Your Internet company must have additional strategies to get patients to your Website while they work on your organic reach. Decide on a monthly advertising budget and focus on one profitable procedure for the biggest impact. Set up protocols for incoming leads.  The first responder usually gets the business so be sure your system and staff follow up immediately. They must be able to convert a website visitor and caller to a booked appointment and a consultation to a paid procedure. RETENTION IS THE NEW PATIENT-ATTRACTION STRATEGY Patient retention must be part of your marketing plan, so you increase patients’ lifetime value, while decreasing your advertising costs. You miss the opportunity right under your nose to double your results when you miss this in your marketing plan….. Focus on your established patients who already know, like and trust you. Your established patients are less price sensitive because they have more to go on than price. They know you’re a reputable surgeon because they have experienced your work firsthand. They can see your results, so they have peace of mind they’ll get another good result. That matters more than saving money to a majority of your patients. It’s also far cheaper to encourage your established patients to return than it is to attract new Internet Stranger Patients to replace them since it takes a lot to get someone’s attention in today’s crowded marketplace. And your established patients are also more likely to give you a great review, permission to show others their before/after photos and help spread the word about you. ENCOURAGE MORE WORD-OF-MOUTH REFERRALS And we all know new patients come from current patients so they must be included in your marketing plan. Word of mouth referrals are your lifeblood. You’ll run out of time, money and energy running a “burn and churn” kind of practice, right? The longer you’ve been in practice, the less you need to exert that kind of energy because you now have a raving fan club …or at least you could have a raving fan club who return and refer a lot more often. The best marketing plan includes strategies to attract new patients by being the first to respond and follow up with new incoming leads. Also to nurture your current patients so they return and refer.

12,5 Simple Ways To Do A 'Half-Year Overhaul' In Your Business,business," There is never a wrong time to review, reimagine, and overhaul your business. But some times can feel especially fresh or inspiring - such as the New Year, or after reaching a certain milestone. One such time can be the Summer, or halfway through the year. This can be a great time to revisit your goals, get clear on the strengths and weaknesses of your business, and launch into the latter half of the year full of inspiration and momentum. Below, we look at five simple - yet highly impactful - ways that you can perform a half-year overhaul in your business. A half-year overhaul is a frank and thorough assessment of your business goals, its current performance, and day-to-day workings. Try the five tips below and see if you can achieve the growth and success your business deserves before the end of the year! Tip 1: Revisit Your Goals The New Year is famous for its resolutions and goal setting, but halfway through the year is a great time to revisit these goals and check whether they are still appropriate for you. Consider whether your existing business goals still excite you, whether they will continue to make as big an difference for your business, and if there are any new ways to approach them. Don’t be afraid to replace a goal with something more relevant or exciting to you and your business! Goals should grow and evolve as we do. There are few things more frustrating than a goal that we are simply not driven to achieve, so only make room for goals that ignite a genuine interest or that would bring great value to your business. Tip 2: Upgrade Your Equipment Halfway through the year is a great time to assess whether the equipment you use in your business is still performing well, or if it needs an upgrade. This might include computers and software, office supplies, production materials, and even your mode of transport. The quality and effectiveness of your equipment can have an enormous impact on the overall efficiency of your business. A slow computer, outdated software, unreliable transport, or equipment that is not up to your most regular tasks, is not helpful. Upgrading your equipment does not have to be prohibitively expensive either. There are now many options to purchase second-hand as part of the reduce, reuse, recycle approach, as well as to part-exchange it or write it off as a business expense. By investing in good quality items that help you with your most important tasks, your business will reap the rewards! Tip 3: Refresh Your Space Refreshing or updating your workspace can have a profoundly uplifting effect on your work. This could involve clearing out clutter or outdated papers, for example, as well as cleaning, changing the position of the furniture, and more. Consider whether the space could benefit from any seasonal adjustments to make it more comfortable — such as air conditioning or fans in the Summer, and effective heating during the Winter. Even adding a few inspiring decorations, plants, or a great scent can help your space to feel brand new — whether you work from home, in an office, or anything in between! Tip 4: Do An Audit It might not seem as enjoyable as some other tips, but the Summer is a great time to perform a full and comprehensive audit on your business. Assess your day-to-day processes and ways of working, as well as identifying potential methods to make them more efficient. Revisit your budget and ensure that your expenses are accounted for. A flexible budget that you can trust and rely on is an effective way to keep your business running smoothly, so be sure to revise it regularly — but especially during the New Year, halfway through the year, and at tax season. Tip 5: Develop Your Team If you work with a team, invest in them by creating a supportive and collaborative environment as well as exploring regular training and group learning options. You may also choose to grow your team by hiring a professional to handle more specialised aspects of the business, such as creating effective pitches for work, writing SEO-optimised blog posts, utilizing social media marketing for increased customer engagement, and more. If you work alone, do not forget to invest in yourself too! Make room for continual learning and improvement, as well as adequate rest to help ensure you remain focused, effective, and healthy."

There is such a wide variety of drones out there that you would have to choose which drones to buy. The general idea of drones has been around for more than a century. It is not a terribly novel concept, really: We've invented all these cool ways to fly around, but many of them are dangerous, so wouldn't it be great if humans did not need to be sitting inside? Drones are aerial vehicles that do not need piloting. Industry players term them Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems. They have preprogrammed flight plans and will fly in straight lines or circles. Many of them can hover in place as well. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes additionally a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the UAV. The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention. A drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard sensors and GPS. The drones were initially intended for the military. However, the application of drones is expanding. It is also used in agricultural, recreational, commercial, and scientific applications. Drone racing, aerial photography, surveillance, and policing can be conducted using drones too. Drones are extremely useful in our everyday busy life and should be pursued by all.

15,Features affecting the cost of designing a store site,business," You may think that a store site is much more expensive than the design price of a corporate site because of the large number of products it contains. The fact is that this is only one of dozens of cases affecting the site design tariff. What you expect from your site visitors is very important. If you know that your visitors are investors and business owners, in some cases, user interface design and user experience will become more specialized and expensive for that site. On the other hand, the amount of time you have as a customer to deliver the site can change the site design tariff in general. In addition to all this, we must mention that if for your store site, its own design is a priority for you. We have to say that custom design of a site is very costly. In the following, we will name all the features that affect the cost of designing a store site. Dedicated page design Dedicated page design is very time consuming. While designing each page with a ready-made template is done faster. Because of this, custom design of a page is more expensive than design of the same page with ready-made templates. Mobile mode These days, buying a product or service via mobile is a common way for everyone. Therefore, the mobile version of an online store should be designed in such a way that you can easily select the buttons and options within the site. But you should know that the design of this section requires advanced coding, which will increase the design rate of a site. User interface design and user experience The user interface is the part of the site that connects the customer to the site features. This section can be designed with simple tools or professionally coded. These two factors can increase or decrease the design cost. On the other hand, the user experience conveys a positive feeling to the user after entering the site and working with its tools. The design of this section can be very time consuming and due to its time consuming, increase the design tariff of websites. Special facilities What sets your store site apart from others is the special features you provide for it. For example, designing the offered products section, adding the Special offer section in the site pages, designing the sales section of returning goods, designing the sales section of the year trends and wish list, designing the offered products section according to the purchased product and dozens of other features can be used as Special features of a store site should be considered. Each of these sections increases the design time of the site in WikiDemi and as a result increases its design tariff. Special search locations For a store site, finding a product easily and quickly, among a multitude of products, is an important feature. On some sites, the search features are very simple. But in others, using advanced coding, it is possible to use different filters to find the product. The cost of coding this section can vary greatly depending on the customer's order. WikiDemi manages to do this well with a reasonable tariff and using an expert team. Clever design of search results page The design of this section may seem very simple in appearance, but we must say that the wrong design of this section can cause the user to leave the site. We design this section so that when a user types the product name into the search box, the relevant goods are displayed in the search results page as best they can; That means all goods With the full name, price, discount rate and customer ranking on the search results page in separate cells. Another feature we use to better display the product on the search results page is the ability to display a close-up view of the product by hovering the mouse over the product image. This is one of the additional features in the design of the store site. Therefore, it easily increases the cost of site design. Advanced product filtering One of the most important parts of designing a store site that can play a decisive role in the cost of preparing it is to provide an advanced filtering system. Suppose you are looking for a blue dress. We design the search box so that when you type the blue word in the site search box, results tailored to your needs will be displayed. Suppose you are a new user on the site, when you first click on this word in the search box, all the blue goods will be displayed for you. Instead, if you are a user who has already searched for a product on the site, it will show you products in the search list according to your previous search and tastes. We can design this section even smarter. For example, if you log in as a customer or search for a product as a major buyer, the products on the search results page will be different. Appropriate results will be displayed for each person according to the needs of the people. These features are very useful, but these features will easily increase the cost of designing a website. Number of site pages One of the most important part of having a site design tariff is the number of pages a site needs. For example, if you want to sell a variety of products, you need to consider a larger budget than when you are focused on selling a particular product. Because products have to be categorized into different subcategories, each section has to have a different user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) tailored to it. Increase inbound site traffic (SEO) One of the vital issues that is considered as part of site design is SEO. A store site will not sell unless the design of its various sections is SEO friendly and on the other hand receives a good ranking in Google. SEO-friendly design of a store site is a costly and time consuming task. This alone will increase the cost of designing an online sales website. Connect the warehouse to the online store Designing and launching a good website is only half the battle for great product sales. In fact, the commitment to the customer to deliver the goods on time, maintain product quality, provide after-sales service and be informed of its inventory is another part of the path to success. To achieve this goal, it is essential to design a part of the site that can connect the physical warehouse to the online store. Although this section is considered as an additional feature for the site, we recommend all our customers to add this section to the site. After connecting the warehouse to the online store site, your site customers and suppliers can be informed of the stock of each product. In addition, shippers can select stores with sufficient inventory to ship. Also, the system of taking invoices from the inventory list of goods in different stages is possible by launching this section. Although this section greatly increases the estimated cost of site design, it is very useful for our customers who are looking to expand the facilities of their store site. Customer panel design We have found in our surveys that a large proportion of customers who leave the site in the final stages of purchase are simply confused by the customer panel. The customer panel of an online sales site is the part where a customer can see the information of the ordered product, add or help the new product, choose the address and delivery time, and pay for the product. The design of this section may seem silly, but we must say that the design of the user interface and user experience of this panel is very important. That is why the specialized design of the customer panel will increase the design tariff of a store site. We have designed three separate sections for the customer panel design, which are displayed on three separate pages. Below you can read the information related to each section. Cart Information of purchased goods such as name, color, size, code Number of products purchased Product shipping cost The amount payable Discount rate The final price Discount code registration section Post information Address Information: Enter the address or select the sending address Select the submission method Specify the sending time interval Payment info Ability to choose the payment method Possibility of payment on the spot View the total purchase amount Display shipping and packing costs View the total purchase amount Access to the rules and conditions of return of goods Ability to print product order receipts Before ordering a website design, the type of site and the expected features should be carefully considered. Each of these can affect the design of a website. But instead, they will provide more features to customers."
16,Drones are making it's way to the Future!,business," Drones are rising in popularity around the world. With more people using them, their functions have increased. The general idea of drones has been around for more than a century. It's not a terribly novel concept, really: We've invented all these cool ways to fly around, but many of them are dangerous, so wouldn't it be great if humans didn't need to be sitting inside? An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which includes additionally a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the UAV. The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention. The drones were initially intended for the military. However, the application of drones is expanding. It is also used in agricultural, recreational, commercial, and scientific applications. Drones racing, aerial photography, surveillance and policing can be conducted using drones too. A Drone is a flying machine with no pilots inside it to operate. It operates on a remote system and can be handled like a specified toy helicopter. The only difference is it can be used to solve serious issues such as sting operations, calamities in which human beings remain unharmed though the entire operation is done by humans. It has a high-definition camera of 720 pixels which gives a sharp image of the object or the video, making any work more accurate and distinguished. This 380gms machine is mostly made of good fiber material whereas metal is negligible. Moreover, all parts are repairable and the instructions to do it are available on internet sites. Its flight is usually controlled in two ways; either autonomously by computers in the vehicle (autopilot) or under the remote control of a pilot on the ground. Have Fun!

17,What Is the ABC Test for Independent Contractors?,business," Many of my clients fall into the trap of misclassifying employee's. While it might be tempting to forgo the headaches of having a fulltime employee on your payroll, the IRS has very stringent rules around these classifications. It's not as simple as, ""Well, I only want to hire this person for 6 months"". Because of this, I urge my clients to work with HR, an attorney or myself in classifying their workforce. The test may be worded differently for various states, so we'll use the California test, as described in a California Supreme Court case. The ruling was for the purpose of wage orders (state wages, hours, and working condition requirements). The ""Dynamex Case"" illustrates the decision process to determine independent contractor status only for the purpose of wage orders. Remember, this case only affects California, but California is often a leader in these types of cases. The Court said that the worker could only be an independent contractor if each of these three factors was met: The worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact. The worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business. The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed. Why the ABC Test Is So Important Let's look at each of these test factors a little more closely to see how this change affects the way businesses will have to consider classifying workers in the future. Remember that all three tests must be met. A. The ""control and direction"" requirement factor for independent contractors is long-standing, and it's the general test that the IRS uses. The IRS looks at three factors of control – behavioral, financial, and relationship control. The IRS also looks at each business on a case-by-case basis. No one factor is considered defining. Even if a contract exists, that's not in itself proof of an independent contractor relationship. Including this factor isn't surprising, and it's basic to the definition of an independent contractor. B. The ""work outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business"" factor is a fairly new twist. This concept began with the gig economy businesses like Uber. Even if the control and direction requirement is met, it looks like an Uber driver is doing work that is WITHIN the usual course of business. Uber is about driving people. Uber drivers drive people. Workers outside the core functions of a specific business would include the types of jobs that can be outsourced, such as maintenance companies, financial support functions like payroll and accounting, and technical businesses like IT and call centers. C. Finally, the ""customarily engaged"" in an independent business factor further limits the possibility of these workers being independent contractors. The types of workers who would fit into this category would be professionals; particularly licensed ones. They might have their own practices or who work for a variety of customers within the scope of their professional duties. These independent professionals include a wide range of occupations, including barbers, massage therapists, CPA's, freelance artists, chiropractors, and many more. The IRS lists veterinarians, contractors (in construction industries), subcontractors, public stenographers, and others. Taken together, the ABC test is provides a good outline of when we can classify workers as independent contractors. How Does The ABC Test Affect My Business? The law is evolving. Although several states have adopted the ABC Test as law, other states may be using it for only specific situations, like determining unemployment insurance eligibility. Court cases are popping up all over the country. In the case of Uber, courts have taken different stances on this question. A U.S. court judge in Philadelphia said limousine drivers for Uber are independent contractors, but the New York Unemployment Insurance Board ruled that Uber drivers are employees. Both cases used ""control and direction"" as criteria. Which Law Do I Follow? State or Federal? It's confusing when federal and state laws conflict. Which rules? The general rule, as noted by Lawyers.com, is that you as an employer ""must follow whichever law is most generous to employees."" That's why the federal and state default status is that of an employee. The burden of proof is on the employer to justify the independent contractor status. State laws may be limited in scope, as in the case of some states which use this test only for unemployment compensation. Businesses can be audited or reviewed by either federal or state regulators. So, What Do I Do? If you think your business might need to re-examine the status of some workers you employ, start by getting an employment law attorney. You will need to look at the current employment laws in your state and have your attorney keep you advised of issues and changes. If you fail to classify a worker correctly, it could mean fines, penalties, and retroactive payment of wages, or getting a settlement offer. It's worth getting in touch with someone who can help you sort out the muddle."
18,Tips for Picking the Ideal Orange County Personal Injury Lawyer,business," If you’ve been injured in any type of accident, you’re entitled to compensation from the people and/or entities that are responsible for the injuries you sustained. Finding the ideal lawyer isn’t necessarily finding the largest firm with the most aggressive litigators. At a huge firm, your smaller case can get lost in the shuffle. But at the same time, if you’ve sustained catastrophic injuries, you need to hire counsel with the necessary resources to see your case through. Do You Need a Trial Lawyer? According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), sixty percent of all tort trials are for personal injury cases. More than half these cases are for motor vehicle accidents, fifteen percent for medical malpractice, five percent for product liability, and the remainder were listed as “other”, which includes slip and fall cases, intentional torts, dog bites, etc. Most of the plaintiffs were successful at trial for motor vehicle accident cases and intentional torts (assault, defamation, etc.), but less than twenty percent of medical malpractice cases resulted in a win for plaintiffs. Surprisingly, plaintiffs tended to do better when cases were tried in front of a judge rather than a jury. For cases that go to trial, the average time from incident to verdict is about two years, but it’s important to realize that complicated cases and matters in densely populated areas, with backed up court systems, can take much longer than this. The backlog from the Covid 19 pandemic is making this situation even worse. Injury Lawyers Can Be Highly Specialized Most Orange County personal injury attorneys are well equipped to handle a wide range of cases, including the following: ●	Car Accidents, ●	Slip and Fall Accidents, ●	Wrongful Death Claims, ●	Dog Bites, and ●	Traumatic Brain Injuries. If you’ve been hit in the rear while waiting at a light, any experienced Orange County personal injury attorney will be able to handle your case well. But if your accident was complicated, your ideal injury lawyer may be a niche specialist. For example, medical malpractice attorneys often specialize in one of the following areas: ●	Orthopedic; ●	Neurological; ●	Obstetrics/Birth Injuries; ●	Cardiology; ●	Oncology; ●	Plastic Surgery and ●	Psychiatry. So,  an obstetrics/birth injury medical malpractice attorney will have an in depth understanding of all the acceptable and expected pre-natal care, making it easier to spot and prove negligence. This type of specialist will also be familiar with the best medical experts in this niche, having worked with them on prior cases. Your ideal Orange County personal injury lawyer may also consider associating in a specialist to work with them on your case so that you can benefit from this expertise, giving up a portion of their fee to benefit your case. Most importantly, your ideal Orange County injury lawyer will be honest about their experience and clearly explain your options. Great Case Management Is a Must The ideal Orange County injury lawyer will have a well-organized office and a competent staff, so it’s important to spot these red flags before you sign a retainer: ●	Helter Skelter paper files piled up to the ceiling; ●	Don’t expect mahogany desks, but broken furniture and dirty rugs are no-go; ●	Casual attire such as jeans is typical for staff at an injury law firm, but sloppy looking staff is not; ●	Receptionist that doesn’t acknowledge you when you walk in; ●	Expecting you to wait a very long time without an explanation; and ●	Giving you mountains of papers to sign in the waiting room without any explanation. The best Orange County personal injury lawyers provide top notch service and get you the highest amount of compensation possible for the injuries you sustain. The Personal Touch You don’t have to agree to be represented by an attorney that doesn’t even want to bother to offer to meet you. Widespread vaccination means that more attorneys are meeting clients in person, but a Zoom meeting can also suffice. What’s simply unacceptable is to be emailed papers to sign without the opportunity to get to know your attorney and ask questions about your case. Your ideal Orange County personal injury lawyer knows that getting to know your client is one of the most important parts of presenting their case well to the insurance company, defense counsel, a judge, or a jury. The best personal injury attorneys know that a thorough interview of a client is not only a great way to start a professional relationship, but always provides clues about the strength or weakness of a case that might not show up on paper. Your ideal injury lawyer is doing their job well by assessing the strength of your testimony from the moment you step through the door. Your personal injury lawyer should pride itself in treating every client like gold."
19,HOW TO PLAN A BUILDING OR A HOUSE,business," Execution of a project and its design is a very crucial stage in any project. It involves not only architects but also builders, contractors, consultants, project manager, site supervisors and labours. As the work progresses step by step, complexity of the project also increases. So, here are some steps that will help you to understand how to build a project and its design from its very initial stage. 1.APPOINT AN ARCHITECT Architects form base of any project. They are the one who create a simulation of a building that is going to stand on a site in practicality. Appointing a good architect with innovative skills and a decent experience will help to achieve the goals. While appointing an architect, an appointment letter should be signed duly as an agreement between both the parties and to understand professional fees of the project initially. 2.REQUIREMENTS To start design of any building, requirements are the foremost part of the process. Requirement list involves two types of requirement i.e., user requirement in which the owner forms a brief about how he wants to build the project and other one is site requirement which is understood and studied by the architects to meet the needs of the client with respect to existing site conditions. Document requirements and other project requirements are also the part of this process. 3.PROPERTY LEASE/ OWNERSHIP DOCUMENTS Property lease or ownership documents are must to initiate a process of building a project. A land owner should have all the documents of sale deed/ ownership etc. approved from legal authorities or municipal corporations to start a project. 4.SITE SURVEY A proper site survey which includes survey of existing physical features such as roads, services, surrounding buildings or structures etc. and contour information is necessary to understand the context of a site. It becomes easier to design a project after understanding the existing site conditions as mentioned above. 5.SKTECH DESIGN AND ROUGH ESTIMATE Initial design agreement is done with the client by a sketch proposal to check if all the needs are satisfied or not. If the initial design is finalized by the client then the rough estimate of the project is prepared; which includes and specifies the essential things required and its implementation on site. An estimate is a fee structure which includes rough costing of all the works that will be executed during the construction of a project. It reflects overall rough cost of the project that is going to be executed on site. 6.MUNICIPAL DRAWINGS Municipal drawings are prepared with all the technical details such as FSI calculations and area calculations with all the rules and regulations that are described in the Development Control and Regulations (DCR) prepared by the authority. Then the drawings are submitted for approval. After approval, further process of the project is continued as per the requirements. 7.WORKING DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS AND TENDER DOCUMENTS After preparation and approval of municipal drawings, working drawings are prepared which includes all the detailed drawings starting from centre line plans, plinth level plan, beam and slab layout, electrical plans, plumbing layout, etc. All the details and specifications are mentioned in each drawing as per the requirement for the better understanding of the work on site. Specification list is also separately prepared to mention all the specified materials that will be used in construction as well as its dimensions and physical attributes. After the preparation of these drawings, tender documents are released by the tenderer which is an offer to carry work as specified in the specifications list. A tender can be different type depending upon the type of the project. It could be for a construction work, demolition work, material supply, cleaning work or painting work, etc. A tender can be public/ open or invited/ closed tender. 8.CONTRACT As per the tender documents, one contractor is selected for the construction work process under the contract document following the contract act. Then the work order is released from architect in accordance with the owner. To carry out good construction work from the contractor; Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is kept from the contractor’s bill. If the work is not completed within the given amount of time then refund of the EMD is denied as per the terms specified in contract. 9.BILL OF QUANTITIES A bill of quantities is specification of materials required to carry out the construction works or materials used for construction of window or doors etc. All the materials and its quantities should be properly mentioned in the bill as it cannot be changed once the work is started. To change or add any specifications in the bill of quantities a special document has to be passed and approved by the authority. 10.COMPLETION CERTIFICATE Once the construction work is completed and all the formalities are done as per the contract, then, the building is inspected for next 6 or 8 months or a year for any defect. This is called as defect liability period. If the building is without any defects then it will be given completion certificate by the respected authorities. Briefly, we can conclude that, above mentioned factors play a crucial role in the construction process of a building step by step. Some of these factors may vary as per the site location and the rules and regulations followed by that particular area. But overall structure of a construction process of a building which is designed is similar to these factors. We should understand that every process requires a specified time and a team to be carried out as per the requirements and sometimes it might turn into a failure also. To avoid this factor of risk one should always appoint a good workforce and communicate at every stage of the work to check if the work going on is okay or not. Respecting and following all of the agreements is also one of the important factors to carry out a successful project. In this way, one can assure a successful building of a project and design as per the needs and requirements. Website: https://www.darchitectdrawings.com/"

Take a look at your prospective coach’s online presence, website, and social media. Seeing how a coach’s website is put together will give you an understanding of their values and if they walk the talk. Business Coaches would know how important it is to have a website designed to convert visitors into clients, so if you are not seeing a website that makes you want to learn more about this coach – walk away! When you look at their social media presence, how are they representing themselves? Are they talking about topics that are relevant to you? Are they providing good value? Are they consistent in their postings? Do they seem to walk their walk and talk their talk? Does their online brand seem in line with what they say they help their clients achieve? Read their articles, books, blogs, and watch their videos. Can you relate to them? Are they sharing high-quality insight or just the ‘same-old-same-old? These are all clues as to the work ethic a prospective coach has and allows you to see if you resonate with their content. That said there are still many coaches that do not use Social Media as a marketing tool so don’t base your whole decision on this one piece. What are their qualifications or certifications? This might seem like common sense but remember that the coaching industry is not officially regulated so anyone can call themselves a coach. Look for a coach that holds an ICF accreditation if possible. This way you know that they had to go through ICF endorsed coach training and a minimum of 100 hours of coaching practice to get their accreditation. What do they know about business? Most business coaches started off their careers in large corporations or by running their own businesses. Take a look at their history on Linkedin or look at their website to see how they have gained their business experience and in what areas. Who recommends them? Asking for recommendations from peers is not a foolproof way of finding a business coach, but a trusted recommendation is a far better solution than doing an internet search. Also, look for testimonials on their website or social media pages and don’t be afraid to reach out to some of those clients and ask for their opinion. Once you are happy with a handful of coaches that having researched them feel like a good fit, it’s time to reach out to them and get a more personal feel. Most business coaches will have a free consultation appointment somewhere between 15 and 60 minutes where you can get to know each other a little better. This is your opportunity to drill into how the coach intends on providing you with value and solutions that will drive your business forward. The continued relationship. Let’s be clear here, hiring a business coach or a coach of any sort means starting a relationship. A great coach works so deeply on transformation with you that it does become personal, and as with any relationship that requires effort on both sides to maintain. It’s not unusual to “go through” several coaches before you find the right one. Aside from the factors above in helping you to choose a coach, you also need to recognize how you work together, communication styles and alignment with your overall goals are also factors that will make or break your relationship with your coach. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to understand the fit without experiencing it. Some coaches make that “try before you buy” phase easier by having a smaller paid coaching/consultation session that you can go through to get a feel for the coaching style before you commit to a paid program or package, which leads me to another point. Look for a Business Coach that has a paid program or packages. A good coach knows that you cannot create transformation overnight and that several coaching sessions are needed in order to create momentum. If a coach allows you to book your sessions whenever you feel like it and charges you month to month, in my opinion, this is not a good way to manage your coaching journey. Whilst it is ultimately down to the client to decide what they want to be coaches on and how often they want to be coach, a great coach knows that accountability is one area they provide much support in and that often to get results, they need to hold their client's feet to the fire. Therefore if you are looking to achieve specific results from your coaching sessions, look for a coach that offers packages (better value for you) and/or a program where you can collaborate with others and build relationships at the same time. Creating Value It’s not about how expensive a coach is, it’s about how much value they can provide for you.  If they can’t find improvements in your business – even quick wins – that cover their costs pretty quickly, you should cut your losses and find one that can. If you feel like your coaching sessions have turned into a “bitch session” and you are not moving forward, take a moment to re-evaluate your arrangements. Coaches are not cheap – the average hourly rate is around $250 now, however, a good business coach should be helping you to recuperate those costs in other areas. Is there a connection? If there is no connection, or no respect and trust, the coaching process is doomed from the outset.  “You need to make sure that your values are aligned with those of your coach, both personally and in business. Look for someone who is genuinely interested in your success. As you know, coaching is about asking questions that serve you, the client. If your prospective coach is only talking about their own accomplishments, they are probably more passionate about themselves, than about transforming others. Firm but fair Coaches don’t always have the right answers, so if your coach is advising you to take action that you are not comfortable with or that you feel is not the right direction for you right now, don’t be afraid to say something. I’ve sat with business coaches before who told me during my free consultation session to raise my prices by 5% as the first strategy to make my business more profitable. They knew nothing about my clients, my values, or my business model at that point. Needless to say, I didn’t end up hiring those coaches. That said, on the other end of the scale, you do need a coach who has the courage to tell you to go for option B even when you would prefer option A. A coach who agrees with you won’t push you out of your comfort zone and we all know that personal growth is outside of that zone! Ultimately you may have to kiss a lot of frogs to find your perfect business coach. Go in with your eyes open and don’t let yourself be talked into anything you are not comfortable with. As Oprah says “your gut is always right”. However, be prepared for a trial and error kind of journey to find the perfect business coach to help you transform! It’ll be worth it, I swear!"
2,Digital Marketing Strategy from Start to Finish,business," Gone are the days when billboards and newspaper ads have been the most effective means of promoting your brand and your products. Digital marketing is a must for all businesses, and selecting the right strategies will be key to your success. There are a number of opportunities when it comes to digital marketing, nevertheless, so it can be overwhelming if not outright panic-inducing you to try to find out where to start. We at Digital Nomad Ventures, a digital marketing agency based in Colombo assist to draft Digital Marketing Strategies. While it might seem tempting to just dive in and get started on as many platforms as once, telling yourself that you’ll figure out the details later, you’re really just shooting yourself in the foot. Doing some sort of ad plan with no clear targets in mind — it’s more about hopping onto a sailboat with a map, where you’re likely to get lost drifting at sea. Without a digital marketing strategy, you won’t see the results because you don’t have the right content in place to actually get the results. And believe me, after all the time and resources you’ve invested, that’s the last thing you want. Determine What You Want to Accomplish What do you want your digital marketing campaigns to accomplish? Do you want to build name brand recognition? Generate leads? Get more sales or email subscribers? Great! Whatever it is that you want, though, you need to name it. This is yet another way that marketing has an online dating crossover comparison. If you go on a bunch of blind dates with no idea what you’re looking for, you might settle down with the first person who you can tolerate. If you have an actual list of traits you want in a person, you’re much more likely to find your match. Your goals matter, and you’ll need to take specific steps to accomplish each one. We’ll look at this more in-depth a little further down. Understand the Digital Sales Funnel The digital sales funnel is an important marketing concept that you need to grasp before actually developing your strategy. It is made up of several different steps that buyers move through in order to get to the point of purchasing and/or becoming long term customers. Users who are at the discovery stage aren’t going to respond in the same way to an ad as someone who is at the loyalty stage. They’ll be interacting with your brand in different ways and on different platforms, and your digital marketing strategy will need to be tailored to keep that in mind. Create Buyer Personas The next step you’ll need to take in order to create your strategy is to get a solid understanding of who your audience is and what motivates them. This will be essential because it will help you to assess which marketing platforms you can find them on, how they’re interacting with it and what they want to see from you. Buyer personas should be specific. It’s important to note that your buyer personas should absolutely be based on research. Skip the thinly-veiled stereotypes and instead use the analytics that you already have available. Determine Where to Find Users At All Funnel Stages You’ve got a good understanding of who your audience is, so now you’ll want to understand how and where to connect with them. Again, refer to your analytics on this and cross-reference them with your buyer personas. Here are a few examples of how they might: Someone who is taking a lot of time to plan an expensive bathroom remodel might discover you by googling phrases like “bathroom design ideas” or searching on Pinterest. If they find your blog post featuring images of remodels you’ve done, that could be how they discover you and look to hire you. A person whose home was flooded after a leaky pipe is going to be looking for someone right now to come to fix that flooring before the mold sets in. Your best bet will be to connect with them through Google Ads because they’ll be searching for those services and you want to be competitive. Some customers are feeling just okay about that run-down bathtub but don’t have the money to fix it. You run a Facebook Ad campaign showing how affordable and high-quality refinishing tiles or glazing tubs could be and create a demand for someone who wasn’t otherwise looking. Consider all paid and organic marketing channels and think about which of your audience members are using them and what stage of the funnel they’re in. This will help you determine the marketing channels you should be on and who you’ll want to be targeting in each part of your digital marketing strategy."
3,5 Simple Ways To Help Your Business Thrive,business," Recent times have been full of uncertainty and upheaval across all industries. Many businesses have struggled to survive, while others have had to completely change their outlook and approach to continue serving their customers. Whatever your experience, there are several simple but effective ways that you can help your business to thrive — whatever the circumstances. Many businesses have found that one of the most effective ways to survive and thrive in a competitive marketplace is to maintain an online presence. This can be as simple or elaborate as your budget and time constraints allow. A simple online presence might include a website with up-to-date contact details, a contact form, and a clear and concise message about the products or services you provide. A more elaborate online presence might also include social media feeds with original content, offers, video tutorials, testimonials and more. Many businesses now also use a dedicated blog to drive online traffic towards their paid services, or to go into more detail about the benefits of their products, for example. The internet is now one of the most powerful tools in business. It remains one of the most common ways that potential clients and customers first discover businesses. But it is also competitive and even oversaturated, so it is important to make an effort to stand out and be visible. Above all else, strive to be clear, concise, and easy to contact. Whether you have a large international team or a small selection of personnel, the people you work with matter. Investing in their education, wellbeing, and creating a positive company culture can be a vital — but often overlooked — aspect of a thriving business. Investing in your team might involve regular training, updating credentials, and progress reviews to check that they are happy and thriving. It could also be as simple as checking in online, ensuring they take adequate breaks and feel comfortable enough to raise concerns. Mental health in the workplace has become an important topic, especially as conditions such as stress and burnout are becoming more prevalent. It is perhaps especially important to ensure that remote-working employees still feel they have an adequate work-life boundary, but others can benefit from a more balanced approach too. And if you are a sole trader or work alone, don’t overlook your own wellbeing and education! Invest in yourself, caring as you would about an employee, and you will reap the benefits in the success and longevity of your business. An effective budget can be the lifeblood of your business. It can help to ensure that expenses are met and cashflow remains healthy — but it is too often only a consideration once a year or during tax season. Thriving businesses regularly review their budgets and try to allow for as much flexibility as possible. Ways to help support your budget are to continually check that expenses are necessary and accounted for, as well as to optimise spending so that your business is cost-effective. For some businesses, this might include reducing travel expenses, or looking at ways to cut spending on company cars, for example. For larger businesses, it could be ensuring that office costs are all accounted for, or switching to smaller premises if employees are now working remotely. Whatever your business and industry, an effective budget that you check regularly will leave you and your team free to focus on important, creative aspects of the business. Whether in person, in writing, or online, a clear message is essential. It is the clarity of your message that affects how well your customer understands your product or service. It can make the difference between a sale and no sale at all. Many businesses hire professional copywriters or SEO experts to help ensure that the message of their business is clear, effective, and reaching the targeted customer. Although this may seem the simplest tip for a thriving business, it can also be the most impactful. The best businesses know their customers well. This means that they know exactly what problem their product or service solves, who is most likely to buy it, and where they are most likely to find them. Consider your ideal or most likely customer and also where you are most likely to find them. Would it be tradeshows or social media, for example? Or even in a particular setting such as a university or leisure centre? Target your advertising in strategic ways. Also, consider using surveys and asking for feedback after purchases to get to know your customer. By targeting customers who your products and services will genuinely appeal to, you should achieve more growth and success as a result!"
4,A Reality Check About Unpaid Child Support And Alimony,business," While alimony and child support are not related in legal terms, they could be said to be related in the fact that, unfortunately, there are those who are ordered to pay alimony and or child support and sometimes fail to do so. As these orders are from a judge, they are enforceable. However, the aggrieved party must return to court to have any kind of justice, which hopefully will include back payments and payments in the future. Let’s take a look at each type of order to understand better how to handle arrears. Unpaid child support: In Florida, Family Courts are very protective of minor children and their rights. Their motto is “in the best interest of the child.” This being said, when there are arrears in paying child support, there are serious consequences for offending parties. Once the case reaches a judge, there are a number of possible outcomes. The best outcome is for the delinquent parent to immediately pay all arrears and continue forward from that day. Frequently this does not happen, and the non-paying parent may: •	Have their passport canceled until the arrears are paid •	Have any tax refund coming to the delinquent parent be given to the court to help reduce the amount owed. •	Garnishing the bank account and paycheck of the offending parent until the amount of arrears is paid back •	Suspending the driver’s license and car registration of the non-paying parent until most of the arrears are paid back. •	In extreme cases, the parent owing back child support may be put in jail for up to179 days until a court-determined amount of back child support is paid. The best way to have arrears paid back is to hire an attorney. However, if this is not possible, the state has a free procedure handled by the Florida Department of  Revenue Child Support Enforcement. Unfortunately, there are usually over 1,000 cases waiting to be heard, so that the waiting time can be several months. Additionally, the lawyer assigned to your case will not meet with you until the day of the hearing, which doesn’t leave much time for sharing your concerns. Unpaid alimony: When there is a large amount of unpaid alimony, the person receiving the alimony can file a judgment against the delinquent spouse. If the judge decides to award the back-owed alimony, the former spouse responsible for alimony payments will be ordered to pay the back amount plus interest. He or she will also be ordered to pay the legal fees for the former spouse. It is unnecessary to use an attorney to file a judgment against the delinquent spouse, but it is wise to do so. You want to be sure all the t’s are crossed and i’s dotted before you go before a judge. In Florida, as in most states, it is wise to pay child support and alimony on time. Of course, time can change things. Sometimes, hard times such as job loss, severe medical issues, and heavily increased basic living expenses make paying alimony and or child support difficult. Don’t wait until you are in arrears. Find a Family Law attorney to help you petition the court to modify or sometimes even eliminate the money you have been ordered to pay."

6,12 Key Factors that Support Transformation into an Anti-Fraud Culture,business," Taking a first step in providing anti-fraud training and raising awareness or undertaking an organisation fraud risk review are positive steps forward in mitigating fraud risk. However, if there is no long-term plan to develop an anti-fraud culture that includes buy in from and consistent leadership from the CEO and senior management of an organisation, then any attempt at culture change is likely doomed to fail. Defining organisational goals, mission, vision and values, publishing policies and procedures that align with each other is one thing and using such phrases as ‘walking the walk’, ‘talking the talk’, ‘practicing what we preach’ and ‘leading by example' is another, but if we don't have real and demonstrative leadership and ownership in terms of an anti-fraud culture then how can we expect compliance and support from the rest of the organisation when we seek to create and disseminate such cultural change? There are a number of key factors that are incongruent with building an anti-fraud culture that would need to be addressed before an organisation was able to introduce a successful fraud risk mitigation framework. KEY FACTORS Is anti-fraud communicated from the top, is it a priority for the CEO and board and are their actions documented and visible to the organisation? Is there an anti-fraud owner, definitive action taken where fraud is identified? Is the culture consistently part of the discussion and issues raised acted upon or is it just empty words? We have seen too many organisations globally that have an anti-fraud message and policy but have still been prosecuted for their actions or inaction to prevent it or have punished whistleblowers for their disclosures. Are values and behaviours published and practiced, are we clear on values or are there acknowledged and accepted grey areas such as conflicts of interest, gifts and hospitality and the lack of declaration, reporting or response where non-compliance is known? Do the published values and behaviours form part of our performance review? How can you inspire staff to protect the organisation’s revenues when typically, their views aren't sought on culture, risk identification and mitigation both at the crucial stage of setting out organisational policy and during day to day operations of the organisation? How do you ensure that we communicate to the whole organisation and if we don't seek their views and professional expertise how can we reasonably expect culture to change? How do you introduce regular and honest communication that is rapidly, demonstrably and effectively responded to? How can staff report fraud when there is no, or limited, awareness or fraud training? What do current fraud typologies look like and what controls are available to reduce the risk? Why would staff report fraud if they aren't protected from reprisals because of a lack of confidential and objective internal reporting routes and/or a whistleblowing protection framework? Is there accountability and are staff that breach organisation codes of conduct or anti-fraud policies dealt with correctly? Many organisations may, for example, seek merely to remove the identified fraudster without establishing the flaws in systems or processes which facilitated his or her activities and thus leave the way open for subsequent fraudulent activity. How you we communicate to staff, partners, and suppliers that we take fraud seriously and act? Do you measure our anti-fraud culture performance, does it translate into an increase in risk identification, reporting and mitigation? Is there continuous improvement, measuring the success and impact of the anti-fraud culture and where flaws are identified ensuring that those are rectified immediately? Equally, it is important that any document enshrining the culture does not become dormant but evolves as the situations the organisation finds itself in do. FOCUS ON PLANNING So, before we introduce an anti-fraud strategy, we should plan to ensure that we have or are able to build an anti-fraud culture. We must first be clear about the result we want to achieve. If an organisation lists staff integrity and ethics as its values, do we really ‘walk the walk’ and ‘talk the talk’ or simply provide empty rhetoric which, in our experience, demotivates staff who may feel patronised by senior management? Once we know where we are then we can start designing a roadmap. COMMUNICATING ANTI-FRAUD INTENT To understand where current culture is it is important to engage staff that includes within the solicitation and full consideration of their views in what needs to be done to make the change. We often hear about the ‘tone at the top’ but we rarely consider the ‘mood in the middle’ or the ‘reality at the bottom’. Only with this engagement do we have a greater chance of success because the staff on the ground know from practical experience how the reality of business operations can undermine many of the principles the organisation stipulates that it abides by. Thus, for example, the organisation may have a strict policy on refusing all gifts tendered by a supplier in pursuance of a contract, but it might be asking a great deal of a sales executive in a far flung jurisdiction to potentially scupper a deal by ‘offending’ that supplier and refusing to take the gift. This is the type of pinch point which demonstrates the true value of any anti-fraud culture – could the sales executive in reality refuse the gift, scupper the deal and walk back into his organisation and receive a pat on the back from his managers? If the answer is no, then the anti-fraud policy may not be as robust as management perceives it to be. How do you communicate our culture and anti-fraud stance to our partners and suppliers? Having the correct message may have the impact of reducing external fraud attempts because fraudsters realise that there is a greater chance that they will get caught. CONCLUSION Introducing an anti-fraud culture is only one part of an anti-fraud strategy but is an important component in achieving success in profiling risk and introducing risk mitigation. If we want our staff, partners, or suppliers to report fraud and assist us in risk mitigation, to allow our organisation to profile the fraud risks that directly affect the organisation and its response, to introduce an anti-fraud culture we need to define what we are doing right and communicate what needs to be done in order to build a successful anti-fraud approach."
7,Using Misplaced Forms to Get More Sales,business," Some forms just get forgotten. Perhaps people will enter your online form one time and never come back again to fill it out. Perhaps prospects will come to your sales page once and leave again. You could have a plan in place to tolerate the form for these people, but it may not be enough, especially if you offer multiple products and services to prospects. You could even add a form right on site that allows you to send future visitors to a special offer or learn more about what you have to offer. For those who do not offer multiple products and services on a single site, you may want to consider adding a form that allows visitors to fill it out at a later date that will help them determine which product or service to buy after they visit. The truth is that there will always be a percentage of individuals who will not buy your product or service right away. There will be people who are just eager to check out whatever you are offering at your site in exchange for their email addresses. You will need to continue to follow up with these prospects in order to convince them that your website offers something of value that was not mentioned elsewhere. Having a form on your landing page that asks people for their email addresses is a great way to begin to build a list of people who are interested in your product or services. You may be thinking that that asking for contact information is fine. You can probably count on this article site as a good example. They allow people to subscribe to a newsletter. In most cases, people will initially sign up for newsletters through a box and may not buy anything right away. Recently I was looking for the weather for the next ten days and found a new one. I wanted to read the weather forecast. I signed up with Yahoo News but got few dupes. After reading the news and news stories on a regular basis, I decided to sign up for a weather forecast service. I am able to view the weather without paying for it. I normally buy the news online before I get the weather. The weather is very relevant to what I am looking for at that time of day. I do not yet have a weather forecast service but I do not believe it would be a good idea for me to buy it right now. I have the information from Yahoo, but I plan to subscribe to a local weather service at some point in the future. For right now, I am happy to use Yahoo news for now and they have the news I am interested in. On my second visit, I will likely not come back to Yahoo. Regardless of your website, you do need to keep in contact with people who are interested in what you have to offer. Use email to contact them and offer them more information regarding your product or services. Take another approach. A company called MyLife has a great online newsletter. Users are automatically taken to an e-mail form to subscribe. After subscribing, recipients receive the e-mail newsletter start off as soon as the e-mail arrives. So the first purpose here is to add new e-mail subscribers (this is probably the best way to do it, even if you do not currently have a website). The second purpose of the newsletter is to provide your existing email subscribers with an incentive and an extra value. In order to send them a new newsletter, you would need to change your incentive. It could be that you are giving them something extra for signing up for your newsletter. They are already interested in your product or service and you want to build on that. That extra incentive could be a mini-course related to what you are offering. Is there a shortcut or does it need to be sent by e-mail? I don't know, you will decide what will work best for your business. In that case, you can ask your current e-mail subscribers if you could send an e-mail. It goes without saying that I have given them information of value, so their response should be no. If they want something from you, they will tell you so. That may keep you from sending them your newsletter, but does it not work for your business? I say, why not, at least for this scenario."
8,"Is There a Difference Between Theft, Robbery, and Burglary?",business," Most people use the words theft, burglary, and robbery interchangeably. While this is fine for casual conversation, there are significant distinctions between each of these offenses in the context of criminal law. If one of your loved ones has been arrested for stealing, it's important to understand exactly what the charges involved. The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) publishes Philadelphia crime statistics every year. According to the PPD's 2014 crime stats report, there were 15,999 cases of theft, 6,924 cases of robbery, and 9,567 cases of burglary. Of course, it isn't just law enforcement that makes a distinction between these offenses - so does state law. Robbery, which is the least common of these three crimes in Philadelphia, is defined by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3701. This statute describes robbery as theft (which we'll cover shortly) plus one of the following elements: In short, a robbery is a theft that specifically involves some sort of force, assault, or intimidation. An additional statute (18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3702) is devoted solely to the robbery of a motor vehicle, sometimes called carjacking. Depending on the circumstances, robbery can be graded as a third, second, or first-degree felony. The maximum criminal penalties for each class of felony offense are listed below: Burglary, which is defined by 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 3502, specifically involves entering a building or other piece of property ""with the intent to commit a crime therein."" State law allows defendants who are charged with burglary to raise three defenses: Theft, which is the most common of among these offenses by a wide margin, is sometimes called larceny. For instance, you may have heard the terms ""grand larceny"" (grand theft) or ""petit larceny"" (petty theft). Unlike burglary and robbery, which are highly specific in nature, theft is a very broad charge which encompasses numerous offenses. Some of these offenses are common (like shoplifting), while others are so obscure they're virtually unknown. Examples of Pennsylvania theft crimes are listed below: Unlawful use of computers used to be a theft offense, but the relevant statute was repealed in 2002. As you can see from the above list, theft covers a very wide range of both tangible and intangible objects. Theft might involve stealing a physical item (like a purse or a bike), a service or utility (like cable or internet), or simply valuable information (like another person's identity, or a company's trade secrets). Depending on the nature of the alleged offense involved, theft grading runs the gamut from third-degree misdemeanor to first-degree felony. Thus, a defendant who is convicted of theft might be facing anywhere from one to 20 years in prison, and/or fines ranging from $2,000 to $25,000. It depends on the type and dollar value of the property involved, among other factors. For instance, theft is automatically a second-degree felony if the property stolen is a firearm, or if the value of the stolen commodity is at least $100,000 but less than $500,000."
9,6  Smart Selling Strategies To Market Big Ticket Products,business," Strategy # 1: Risk Turnaround Turning around the risk is a vital marketing method and it is specifically important to give some type of risk turnaround for Big Ticket Items. When you are chatting to your customer, they are going to have the adhering to inquiries on their mind. ""Does this sound too good to be true?"" ""How Can I ensure I get value for money?"" ""Am I going to buy this seminar or video collection and it will not work for me or it's not going to be as useful as I believe it is?""

We specify it as the collaboration with several services, which will help you market your business while you help them market their own. This sort of teamwork is likewise called joint venturing. There are numerous means to a joint venture. You may have a product that is comparable yet not specifically like your rival. To put it simply your niche markets are somewhat different.

All the joint venture partners obtain the name, address, phone, and e-mail varieties of all potential customers that react.

And they will certainly pay you back by being your customer permanently. Strategy # 4: Care of Existing Customers Many businesses tend to ignore their existing customers. They simply think they currently just made the sale and absolutely nothing more will happen unless that customer voluntarily asks for another product. This is the reverse of the techniques we have spoken about for Building Long Term Relationships and It's All About Value.

You have to evaluate whatever to optimize your action and conversion prices! And below is the most effective component: If you do not understand if something will certainly work, simply test it! You ought to be frequently checking new strategies and new ideas. Allow your clients to inform you what works and what does not. Strategy # 6: Testimonials You can blow your very own horn regarding just how excellent your product is all day. From a skeptical customer's point of view, that just isn't good enough. Certainly, your customer will carefully assess your product on the benefits that you explain to them. If your product will be a great solution for their needs, they will decide. They know you are trying to sell them your product! What really makes the difference, the strategy on Risk Reversal was to have other people give testimonials about your product. If you have a lot of going crazy followers, all informing just how your product helped them fix their problems, other individuals are most likely to consider that and be excited. Because it's not you who are starting your own product is terrific, but other clients are blowing the horn concerning your product!

12,How to improve sales with Web Design,business," Someone may think that just the fact of having a website helps to improve online sales or contacts. That’s not true. Your business’ sales will improve only if your website quality is immediately perceived by the users, and they are encouraged to have specific behaviours while visiting your website. A utterly important factor, in this context, is Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO), whose aim is to understand visitors and customers’ behaviour to give them what they need, and this by improving the site elements. When everything is done properly, this will generate higher profits. As often happens, the devil is in the details. The truth is that if you want to achieve a top-performing sales funnel, all conversion points on the website must be perfectly optimised, so when someone is visiting the website is encouraged to follow a specific path. The starting point has to be your audience. Studies show that 96 percent of site visitors are not ready to buy. This means that you have to convince them that you can help them providing a good service or product. Another crucial factor is that your website must provide high quality content and User Experience (UX) to lead your audience closer to the sale. We are talking about exceptional and bespoke design as well as smooth and easy navigation to keep your site visitors engaged. CRO is related to different factors; our focus, in this article, will be on how to improve CRO (and, consequently, sales) with good web design in Northern Ireland. How to improve sales with Web Design in Northern Ireland In terms of web design and CRO, there are two main factor you should be acknowledged of: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). While it is useful to talk about them as two different things (especially if you want to make an analysis to get the best results from your website), they are deeply connected, and sometimes they could even merge. Anyway, what we have to know is that a good web design includes quality UX and UI at the same time. Design It won’t take too long for your visitors to have an impression on your website. And you have to be sure the first impression is good. It takes approximately 50 milliseconds, for a user, to form an opinion on a website based on a visual appreciation. If your page is poorly designed, this will increase the bounce rate (which is the percentage of users that exit after visiting only one page). But if your website is well designed, the chances they navigate it will improve. There are many factors that help in that sense: bespoke and eye-catching website design consistent branding high-quality imagery and videos clear and easy to read titles and text good use of colours, with the right contrast Navigation When users visit a website, they could have different purposes. Visitors could be interested in buying a product online, or learning something more about a specific topic, or even they could be there because they need a service that you offer. Obviously this depends on the purposes of your website and, more generally, of your business. For this reason you have to be sure that everything is clear. If you sell a product, make sure that all the informations and prices are there. If you have a blog, make sure it is well written and useful for those who read it. If you offer a service, make crystal clear how this service can help the people. To put it simply: make sure the navigation is as easy as possible. To sum up: providing quality design and navigation is fundamental to ensure a conversion focused web design. You must be sure that the best practices are applied to your web design to turn your site visitors into paying customers. This is how conversion rate optimisation (CRO) works when applied to web design. How Web Design factors can Boost the Sales for your Northern Irish website Ok this sounds pretty obvious. Nonetheless, it is still worth mentioning it as first factor. An eye-catching, bespoke web design, with quality visuals and photos, tailored to your brand, is simply the minimum you should aim for. A high-quality web design is an investment that will last years Nowadays responsive design for mobile devices is a must, as half of the worldwide online navigation is provided by smartphones. So you have to be sure to provide high quality and navigation not only on desktop but also for tablets and smartphones None likes a slow website! Users expect the website to load in 2 or 3 seconds. After that, the chance they will quit the website will improve drastically. For this reason, one of the main targets for a web designer should be to balance design and speed. Videos, animations, complex structure could be nice, but if you want to use them, be sure your hosting service is fast and reliable and the pages are optimised for the highest performances. We already mentioned User Experience (UX). This is fundamental when you have to think about your website’s navigation. Simply, provide an organised navigation that is easy yo use. This will help people to find your products and services faster. We cannot stress enough in terms of how good and bespoke design is essential in terms of branding and online identity. But even in this context, you have to be sure that your main CTA button is always clear and easy to see. This button is the direct path towards a conversion. So make sure it is clear to see, strategically placed to be sure that visitors can easily click it if they want to. A good idea could be to use a specific colour for your main CTA — obviously aligned to your branding’s palette colour. Most of the times users will be landed to your homepage. For this reason be sure that this page is perfectly designed and provides the most useful information and CTAs for the users, especially in the top sections. This will help to convert visits in contacts and/or sales. Someone could think that white spaces are passive areas, and reducing them to be helpful to provide more informations. The truth is that white spaces are active elements in a good web design. Our eyes get confused when there are too many elements to focus on. White spaces help in balancing the elements, leading the eye to focus on those you want to. Helping the visitor with this kind of “visual breathing” will help to ease the navigation towards your website. There are many factors that help the user to trust your website. Be sure your website showcases them. Placing a consistent logo where’s needed (on the menu, on the footer, the favicon), security or sector-related badges, testimonials from you clients, awards, partnerships: these are factors that will help to improve the trustfulness of the people visiting your website. Conclusion Website Design impacts hugely in terms of a wider Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) strategy, as will help the customers while visiting your website.

13,10 professional tips for dress mannequin for e-commerce business,business," 10 professional tips for dress mannequin for e-commerce business A Ghost Mannequin is a custom-built mannequin with detachable body parts including the upper body, legs, and arms. In the shoot, the photographer will normally take some snapshots of the object as it is being held by the mannequin. After that, the photographer integrates and removes the files. As a result, the customers will be able to see the fitness of a realistic human figure. Because you now know how to do it, here are some helpful suggestions for Ghost Mannequin Photography to help you to improve your e-commerce business. 1.Pick the right Mannequin for Your Item: For e-commerce item photography, picking the correct mannequin is important. Here are a few strongly recommended suggestions to assist you in selecting the best mannequin for your item. • Use a mannequin that is the right size for your piece. A good fit illustrates the outline of your dress and demonstrates the best features. • Having different sizes of mannequins for each piece is not necessary. In these kinds of situations, hooks or clips should be used to make sure the best possible fit. When selecting a mannequin for your items, ensure to choose one that best represents the object - ghost mannequins available in a range of designs and sizes. When the mannequin isn't up to standard, the clothes can look better than they should. As a consequence, having many mannequins to shoot with is useful. When you've found the perfect mannequin, pack your clothes in a simple capturing order, selecting those that fit without having to change mannequins or pieces. This strategy would save you a lot of time and effort. Determine which mannequin modules must be removed. For instance, when wearing a blazer, the coating is an important feature to display on your eCommerce store, eliminating or even any garments that you want. Take control of the arms and sleeves, and double-check that the stitches are matched with the mannequin's shoulders. Remember to check for any visible bending on the fabric. Eventually, establish your lighting and contacts to highlight the dress's key characteristics without drowning out any kinds of colors. Focus your lens and take a range of pictures of the garment in general, concentrating on the coating stitching. Make an effort to think about the box in order to understand what the clients are looking for. In the end, any setup can save you time. Consider the shoot from a creative perspective and double-check that you have everything you need. Cameras, tripods, and lamps are probably the best things to shoot properly. Maintain the balance of the outfit over the mannequin when photographing common clothes. Maintaining the same point on your shoulders, for example, is an easy but successful way to enhance the item's look. Don't neglect to photograph the dress from various sorts of angles so that the customers can get a sense of the fabric's concept. Many novice photographers are unable to adjust their camera settings to meet the demands of the photograph. Here are few suggestions on how to pick the most basic camera setups. • The lens focus is dictated by the aperture, which should be adjusted to higher values (f/8 to f/12) to focus on the item's outlining. • If you're using ambient light, use a high ISO configuration (600) to reduce noise and grey areas in your images. • Modify the shutter speed in compliance with the background lighting and the hue of the dress to allow enough light to move through. • Natural light is known as the most cost-effective and high-quality light source for dress photography. Where sunlight is inadequate or unavailable, you can use key-lighting, and hair-lighting, fill-lighting devices. It's time to take the photos now that something about the shoot is going on. Keep these instructions in mind to ensure that the images have a professional look and are equivalent to Amazon item photography. • Place the camera at the dress's chest or hip height. • Make sure the camera is pointing at the object at the correct angle. The garments seem manipulated and uneven whether the camera angle is too wide or too short. • Regardless of how professional you're, make use of a tripod to hold in place pictures to concentrate on the details like zips, cuffs, embroideries, as well as other types of the outfit. 10.Change the picture: Finally, we'll look at a few post-processing techniques to give the photos a professional look. As previously said, Ghost Mannequin Photography necessitates the use of several photographs and the subsequent detachment of the mannequin. Adobe Photoshop, for example, is a powerful post-production app that gives you a variety of tools to get the job done. You might, for example, create different layers for the backdrop and the piece. You can now choose the item and cover up the backdrop layer and any unnecessary elements. In comparison, using dark areas to add texture to the pictures is a smart idea. Ghost Mannequin Photography to enhance Your Business: You may either incorporate these Do-it-yourself tips to give your company strategic advantages over its competitors. Commercial photography services are offered at a significant discount by top-tier object photographers. These experts handle every part of the pictures on your website, from photographing the object to post-processing.

As a result, now is the time to choose a Ghost mannequin service provider, such as Clipping Path CA is the best for your item photo editing."
14,Are You Making Any of These Website Mistakes?,business," I’ve recently reviewed several websites of coaches, and I discovered the following website mistakes. Are you making any of those on your website? The website looks like it was designed by the website owner themselves (and they are not a web designer). People recognise a professionally designed website and one that is not. A poorly designed website doesn’t inspire trust or credibility. What you can do: Get a professional web designer to fix your website. And if you aren’t able to do this for any reason, keep your web design as simple as possible. Less is more. Reduce the number of fonts you use. Make sure you choose fonts that are easy to read. Reduce the number of colours. Get rid of background images. You describe your work in a way that’s not clear to your target audience. You use jargon. While you and your colleagues know what certain words mean, your prospective clients might not. What you can do: Look at your website through the eyes of your prospective clients. Will they understand every single word you use on your site? Write crystal-clear copy so your readers understand what it is that you are offering. The web copy is mostly about you. When you are making this website mistake, then you’ll see a lot of ‘I’ in your copy. Your website needs to be about your clients. They need to be the focus. What you can do: Replace your ‘I’ statements, with ‘You’ statements. For example: Instead of ‘I will teach you’, use ‘You will learn’. You describe your offerings only with a couple of sentences. What your service entails is vague, and readers don’t understand how the process works. You are not giving enough information for potential clients to feel safe to take the next step (ie. book a call). What you can do: You need to describe your services in detail. A single paragraph is not enough. You need to provide enough information so that most of your reader’s questions are answered. Imagine it like a Q&A session between you and your potential client. Often, coaches or therapists use website taglines that are cryptic and not understood by the website visitor. Most readers will simply ignore the tagline. Most times, it confuses them and they leave the site. What you can do: Make your tagline simple and straightforward. What is the main problems that you solve for your clients? When you have pinpointed the key issue, then simply write a tagline about it. For example: (What you offer) for (target audience). ‘Web design for therapists.’ Helping (target audience) (do what). ‘Helping singles find love that lasts.’ If there are too many buttons to click, it takes the reader’s attention into too many directions. It’s easy to get overwhelmed with too much choice. At the end, your visitor will leave rather than take action. What you can do: The only page on your website that can have more than one call-to-action, is your home page. On all other pages, keep the focus on ONE call-of-action. As a coach or therapist, you MUST have a photo of yourself on your website. Even better if you have several professionally taken photographs. When you are the face of your business, people need to see a face that they can connect with. A website without a photo of you doesn’t inspire trust or credibility. What you can do: Get a set of professionally taken photos. Do not only get headshots but include photos that show you in action. For example, if you are a therapist, include a photo of you in a consultation. If you are a gardener, include a photo of you gardening. I see pages that have an unclear or even no call-to-action. Don’t miss out on an opportunity to guide your visitor towards taking an action, such as signing up to your newsletter or booking an initial free call. What you can do: Think about what you would like your prospective client to do when they visit your website. Is it to call you? Book an appointment? Sign up to your newsletter? Make sure you include a call-to-action on every single page on your site."
15,REFLECT YOUR SUN SIGNS WITH THE INTERIOR DESIGN OF YOUR HOUSE,business," What style of interior design is best for your Sun sign? Some people born under the sign of the zodiac require a Zen den that shouts, ""Privacy, please!"" Other astrological signs appreciate a flexible environment that can accommodate a constant stream of visitors, partygoers, and visiting family. We've highlighted ideas for the atmosphere, colors, layout, and interior design that shouts ""home sweet home""—exactly as you want it—based on astrology, of course. (This article includes – Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries) Aquarius, the Water Bearer. An Eccentric, Idealistic Air Sign. This month marks the start of the Aquarius season, and persons born under this sign are the pioneers, rebels, and trend-setters! They are always pushing the boundaries of fashion and style, striving to leave their mark on everything they touch. They enjoy a challenge since this is the sign that dominates the future. Saturn, the planet of laws, constraints, and discipline, is Aquarius' traditional ruler, but Uranus, the planet of eccentricity and creativity, is their modern ruler. This may appear to be a contradiction because Aquarius IS a contradiction. They are committed to being a member of a community of like-minded people while yet want to stand out. When their minds are made up, they are open-minded yet unyielding. They advocate for human rights, yet they might be distant from their interpersonal relationships. One thing is certain: you never know what you're going to get when you're around an Aquarius! Aquarius interior design will be as quirky and out-of-the-box as they are. Expect bold statement pieces to inject individuality into the area. They'll enjoy living areas with a view since, as an idealistic air sign, they enjoy looking out the window and dreaming up fresh, creative new ideas! Expect unusual textures and color combinations. Aquarius values individuality, so they'll be drawn to vibrant colors and intriguing textures. They want their surroundings to be as rich and varied as they are! Aquarius will appreciate a sleek lighting fixture that is as forward-thinking as they are. This year's Aquarius season runs from January 19 to February 18. Allow this season to motivate you to let your freak flag fly and embrace your oddities and strangeness! Pisces, the Fish. An Imaginative, Idealistic Fish. The Pisces season is when we delve deeply into our emotions, spiritual beliefs, and long-term goals. This is the zodiac's last sign. They are recognized for their deep, sensitive dispositions and a proclivity to absorb the emotions of those around them, whether consciously or unconsciously! Two fish — one swimming up and the other swimming down – depict this changeable water sign. The Piscean spirit is encapsulated by this duality. They live with one foot (or fin!) firmly planted in reality and the other firmly planted in their fantastic fantasy. Some Pisces effortlessly achieve this balance between the actual world and their dream world, manifesting their desires and living beautiful, magical lives. Some Pisces prefer to live entirely in their imaginations, self-medicating via illusions and avoiding reality at all costs. Jupiter, the planet of faith, optimism, and luck, is the ruler of Pisces. Pisces is on a never-ending journey for wisdom, spirituality, and a belief in something higher than oneself. Pisces can feel like a fish out of the water if they aren't connected to a cause, vision, or spiritual belief larger than themselves, so it's important for them to connect to something that makes them feel connected to the universe – whether it's a religion, personal spirituality, a connection to nature, or an artistic flow. The appeal of Pisces home design is similar to that of these elusive fish! These fish are the most sensitive of the zodiac, and they want a peaceful haven where they may reset and recharge. They may feel more at peace when surrounded by seafoam greens, rich aquamarines, and sparkly blues since they are a water sign. Because this sign is linked to spirituality and religion, some totems that remind them of their higher mission will make their home as inspiring as it is livable. Pisces, as a water sign, will feel at ease when surrounded by colors and imagery associated with the sea. Pisces Season this year is February 20 – March 20. Let this season inspire you to strip back the layers of your soul, connect with your deeper belief system, and flow with the currents of life. Aries, the Ram. A Courageous, Bold Fire Sign. The Aries season in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to spring, and as the weather warms up, so does our energy and spontaneity! Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and it represents the divine spark of life, as well as the strength of a kid. Rather than overthinking things, Aries takes action immediately and thinks afterward. The rams are lured to fresh beginnings and begin, but they might become bored halfway through and forsake the activity in search of something more stimulating. They make up for their lack of follow-through with enthusiasm, daring, and fearlessness. Mars, the planet of action, assertion, and activity, is the ruler of Aries, encapsulating its go-getter, adventurous attitude. These people never back down from a challenge they look forward to it! They thrive on the chance to demonstrate their worth. They're action-oriented, impulsive, and frequently rash! You'll always know where you stand with a ram since they're upfront and honest about what they want and who they are. Interior design for Aries will be as energetic and daring as they are! They'll desire a room in their house that represents their heavenly nature as a sign of self. Bright, energetic hues like reds, oranges, and golds will make these rams feel comfortable. They won't want their living rooms to be dark, monochrome, or uninteresting; instead, they'll want them to be as bright and cheery as they are! Aries understands that life is too brief to be monotonous, thus the bright colors will appeal to them. Aries will be drawn to warm decors that enliven the room, as red Mars is their governing planet! This year's Aries Season runs from March 20 to April 20. Allow this season to encourage you to go for what you truly desire and to have the confidence to follow what ignites your spirit."

17,How To Get Company Registration in Dubai for Your Business Setup in Dubai,business," Over the years, Dubai has proven to be a prominent trading hub for small business setups and international investors who benefit enormously from the supportive market of the UAE. The entrepreneur-friendly policies offering complete ownership rights, tax savings, various business setup options, and vast scope of growth opportunities are the reasons why many investors are increasingly considering this platform for their future endeavours. Although company registration in Dubai is not overly complicated, there are still certain inconsistencies that new investors with minimal market understanding may encounter. You may complete your company registration process without delay if you have the right direction and adequate support from the local consultants. You can begin with your company registration process in Dubai by following the following steps: Step 1: Choose your Business Activity One of the initial steps to register a company in Dubai is choosing your business activity. It is important because it lays the foundations for all the succeeding operations of your company. Your nature of business will translate the type of jurisdictions and available trade licensing options for your business registration. Thus, before completing this part of the process, you must perform a thorough study because any mistakes here might cost you more than you would otherwise. Step 2: Choose the Economic Zones Economic zones are also referred to as jurisdictions. The UAE market is broadly categorized into three zones: Mainland, Free Zone, and offshore, each having its own set of rules and regulations to initiate a new Business Setup in Dubai. The type of business activity and your company requirements will determine whether you choose Mainland Dubai or one of the 40+ Free Zones. Step 3: Choose Your Company Structure The most commonly used business structure in the UAE is a Limited Liability Company (LLC). In addition to providing access to conduct business operations all across UAE, this business structure comes with the limitation of not having complete ownership over your business setup. It requires the investor to partner with a local sponsor in order to carry your business operations in Dubai or other emirates. It may seem intimidating to the new investors, so we suggest getting help from professional business setup consultants such as Corporate Business Services (CBS) to help you ease this process. Step 4: Choose your Company Trade Name: You must choose a company name that aligns best with the legal conventions set by the authorities. Your company name should not include any offensive or blasphemous term and must include the complete name(s) of the business owner or one of the partners. Company formation professionals can guide you through the process more efficiently and make your Business Setup in Dubai incredibly easy. Step 5: Apply for Trade License: A trade license dictates the type of activities your business is allowed to perform in any jurisdiction. For licensing in the mainland, business investors can choose from one of the four licensing options, i.e., Commercial license, Industrial license, Professional license, and tourism license. However, this structure doesn’t apply to Free Zones having a licensing structure of their own. Once you complete this step by partnering with local consultancy services, you must submit your trade license application to the DED. Step 6: Find a Local Sponsor: Finding a local sponsor is not required for business setups in Free Zones. However, to ensure support and security to the foreign investors, the UAE government has made it a prerequisite for non-locals to form partnerships with the local sponsors if they want to initiate a Business Setup in Dubai. So, under a Memorandum of Association (MOA), entrepreneurs hold only 49% of the total company shares and liabilities of the same capacity. Thus, securing both the parties involved. Get Assistance from Consulting Experts to Ease the Process Once you complete the preceding steps, you’ll need to do the paperwork and get additional approvals, if required, for your new company setup. CBS or other similar business setup consultants can help you with the documentation, external approvals, visa processing, tenancy contracts, cost management, registration application submission, and other legal matters when needed. Equipped with vast resource capacity and a team of professionals, such consulting firms can help you perform your company registration procedures and subsequent business operations before you know it."
18,Solar Car Parks: Commercial Solar Options,business," Solar Car Parks are car park coverings that are made from a steel and hold solar panels for the purposes of creating solar energy. A solar car park is an innovative use of traditional solar panels and car park shade structures to create something completely new. The solar carpark can generate power that is completely renewable. It is an excellent commercial solar opportunity using the existing car park space to create a small solar farm on site of the car park. When you are looking for a shade structure for your commercial entity perhaps consider a solar car park. It is important to look more broadly than traditional rooftop solar, especially when you are working in commercial applications. Investment in a solar car park is just that - an investment. Solar car parks are constructed using PV structures either in a brand new space or retrofitted to an existing car parking lot. They are both cost effective and a great way to get a shade structure for your car park. They can be purchased under a Power Purchasing Agreement which means there is not a need to outlay significant capital. But the big question is are solar car parks worth it? Especially in terms of the power that they generate. In fact, yes, solar car parks do generate a significant amount of solar energy. The amount of solar power that is generated will change depending on the size of the car park and some other inputs, however, generally, a car space will create 3kW of solar power. Multiply that by the number of carparks and the numbers really do stack up."
19,5 Ways to Increase Your Brand Sales & Build Brand Awareness,business," Fifteen years ago the internet exploded with the concept of social media in the form of Facebook, a social network in which you could simply share yourself and what you were up to. From its meager beginnings, the social media frenzy has blossomed into perhaps the largest “free” marketing system in the world. For anyone willing to put in the time and effort to post regularly, create interesting content, and cultivate the tips and tricks of the trade, social media is a powerhouse. But you have to remember; everybody does it, and many of them do it better than you. There are a few ways you can make sure your targeting your audience well, and best utilizing this amazing marketing tool. Make sure you’re active on as many platforms as you can be. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, whatever platform caters to your target market, be present there! Another great way to make sure people keep coming back for more is to diversify your content. Do you always post blogs, or only post pictures? Switch it up and keep it interesting! Add a video here and there; write some interesting articles for blog posts. Make people glad they stopped by. Above all else, be interactive and consistent. If people feel like you are a real person behind the keyboard, who listens and responds to them, they can begin to build a relationship with you. If there is anything we learned from watching the copywriters of MadMen brainstorm around the table, it’s knowing your audience. When you’re cultivating a brand, you know who it’s for. It’s probably for people just like you, as most brands are born from a necessity or something lacking that a given demographic experiences. Social media platforms are just another form of accessing your audience, so knowing which one is most used by your target audience is paramount. Do you think your brand mostly aligns with Instagram and YouTube users? Are your consumers the quick quipping Twitter users who want one-liners and fast facts? If you don’t know, try out everything and see what is performs the best. People want to interact with a brand they feel embodies who they are. Surfers, divers, and fishermen deck themselves out with Salt Life® shirts and bumper stickers. Skateboarders wear as much checkered-patterned Vans® paraphernalia that they can get their hands on. People associate themselves with brands that that represent the lifestyle they live or aspire to be a part of. Show these consumers what it means to live YOUR brand’s lifestyle. Tell your story (social media is a great place to do this!) The ups, the downs, even the embarrassing parts, will all show that you are relatable. Was your brand born from an experience? Perhaps you noticed something important and felt nobody was doing anything about it? Share these thoughts, feelings, and even emotions with your audience. You would be surprised how many people think “me too!” when reading about a brand and its mission. Once you’ve shared your story, the journey isn’t over, you have to promote yourself! You’ll probably get tired of it, but you can’t promote yourself too much. Remind people of what your brand represents, what you stand for, and how your brand is impacting the community. Share interactions you’ve had with consumers. If people love your brand, tell others about it! Did someone come up to you and tell you they love your brand and your vibe? Share that! Remember, no one will promote you if you don’t do it first. Much like knowing your most efficient social media outlet, knowing your audience is one of the biggest keys to success. It can be hard to sit down and think about “Who likes me, and who doesn’t” but it’s integral to your brands growth. For instance; if your brand manufactures and markets ergonomic golf clubs, it’s important to know your target customer probably isn’t a twenty five year old in Kentucky that frequents demolition derbies on the weekend. (If your brand revolves around the demolition derby lifestyle, that’s probably exactly who you’re looking for!)  Think about what your target consumer enjoys doing. Remember that they have interests outside your brand, so know what they are and how you can use that to your advantage. Remember our Salt Life® target audience? They probably also care about ocean conservation, traveling to anywhere with a beach or ocean, etc. This all makes up who they are as a community outside of one brand. Once you know who you’re looking for, sit down and cultivate a breakdown of what you think their day might look like. How do they start their morning? With a balanced breakfast and a workout, or avocado toast and a mimosa? What do they do for work? Where do they spend their time? Where do they relax with family and friends? What other products are they buying, and are these products similar to yours? Are the other products they are buying competitors of yours? Or potential collaborations? Cultivate everything you can about the personality and lifestyle of your perfect customer. You should know this ideal candidate as well as you know yourself! Among the entrepreneurial industry, there’s a phrase “A rising tide lifts all boats.” This means a healthy economy, or good relationships with other businesses, benefits all involved. This is a really great mindset to have when it comes to collaboration between yourself and other brands. You want to create symbiotic relationships in which both you and your collaborative partners are gaining, and this is really important to never forget. You might want to jump straight to “collabs” with all of your favorite influencers and like minded brands, but make sure you have something to bring to the table as well. Don’t look to other brands to lift you up, but instead be ready to tell them how collaborating with you will benefit them as well. Collaborative endeavors are endless, so get creative, don’t close your mind set off to any potential opportunity, and be ready to make some magic! Most commonly in today’s market, the collaborations we see are brand partnerships. These don’t necessarily have to be products. An author could collaborate with a fitness coach, creating a book in which they have both contributed skills, and have now made a product together that both can use for their personal brand. If you find brands or social media influencers you would like to work with, you just have to be brave, and ready to hear no. Reach out and tell about yourself, the capacity at which you’re interested in working with them, and why you felt drawn to them. Not everyone you ask to work with will be interested, and that’s ok. This is in no way a reflection upon you and your brand, just thank them for their time and keep moving. There will always be more creative people to work with, there are plenty of branded fish in the sea! You’ve established your brand, shared your story, carefully curated your social media presence, and discovered your perfect target audience….but there’s one final piece to the branding success puzzle. You’re going to need help getting yourself and your brand out there. It’s great to promote yourself and share as much and as often as you can, but the reality is you just can’t be everywhere and meet and see everyone. You need people on the ground making the face to face connections that take branding to the next level. Those people are brand ambassadors. Just as the name entails, brand ambassadors work with a brand to raise awareness and promote brand recognition. Consider these people to be like sales representatives for you, but on a smaller scale. If you do hire sales reps, these can be part or full time positions, but it’s a more traditional job description. These people are directly responsible for sales of your brand or product, the definition of brand ambassadors can be a little more flexible. Brand ambassadors usually represent a given brand on social media or in person (such as at places of business, stores, festivals, special events and more.) They will wear branded clothing, become educated on products and services, and serve as the middle man between your brand and the public or your target audience. In the last few years, brand ambassadors have really flourished on social media, which gives you a secondary outlet that you weren’t privy to before. Not only can you access your own following, but their entire following as well. While these people don’t work for free, they will often work for reimbursement via product, services, or exposure. If you’re interested in getting brand ambassadors on your team, think back to that perfect customer, and get to work finding them. If they truly are your ideal consumer, they’ll most likely be thrilled to have the opportunity to work with your brand! Final Secret Bonus Tip: These five tips will help you on your branding journey, but there’s one monumental mistake brands make that keeps them from ever getting off the ground. Not acquiring attention! If brands allow themselves to stay too small for too long, their audience forgets about them, and all their efforts fizzle out. Your brand is as big as you believe it is! Now go believe in it!"
20,Reasons Your Page Is Not Indexed On Google Search,business," These days, several SEOs struggle to rank on the first page of search engine results. Some of them even put ""my site"" as a sub-headline on their site map when it is not even close to the top 100. As sad as this is, it is inevitable that some sites will never be visible in the first search result, and they will perish there forever. The following is a list of the reasons why your page is not indexing on Google. Reason No. 1: Why are websites, even those with thousands of pages, not rankable in Google? One of the main reasons for this is that many bloggers aren't indexing their pages correctly to rank them high. Indexing, or making a page easily searchable by users, is the process of making a web page easier for search engines to index, so it appears higher in search results. Reason No.2: PageRank is Google's ranking metric for web pages. The higher a site's PageRank, the more likely Google will crawl, index, and display the content on its SERP. This means that the higher the PageRank, the more search engine traffic your site will receive for its content. Having a high PageRank will lead to having more visitors from Google search results pages than lower-ranked sites. This means you will be able to achieve better rankings on Google search results. Reason No.3: You do not have a perfect SEO strategy. Picking the right SEO strategy doesn't have to be complicated; all you need to do is study several factors at play and identify which ones contribute to the inability to rank. Reason No.4: When your website goes live, your competition is already ranking sites. You might even have got chosen as a top result for a search. What is left to do is show up in the SERPs and get direct traffic from search engines. As mentioned by ghostwriting services USA this is where many beginners go wrong. They don't realize that even if they have good content and content marketing strategies that bring in traffic, their sites will still get targeted because search engines restrict where to index pages with degraded performance. Hence, we know that why it is important to leave those pages on good terms with search engines to stay ranking high even after they have rank. Reason No.5: Search engines pass over most Search Engine Optimization efforts because of outdated strategies. Potential customers and clients who use the Google search engine to find their desired information on other sites. This is normal because Google is an easy system to read and follow. It offers valuable information even to people who're not well versed in SEO. Learn how to draw the line between your SEO efforts and the ones that get ignored. Reason No.6: The number of Google search engine crawlers has more than tripled in the past few years, and the sheer number of pages on the web is overwhelming. It's not possible for most of us to generate and index all pages on the web consistently. This is where there are different types of issues arise. This results as most search engines have lower priority indexing sites with broken pages, duplicate content and 404s for links not found. Prioritization is in different stages, but ultimately, you need to know why your page is not ranking among the search results in Google. Reason No.7: Search engines index only websites that have a unique URL. This means if you have a page on your site that is HTTPS but has an address like https://articlebiz.com.example123, your page will never be indexable. However, this also means that any other page on that domain with an identical URL to yours will also not be indexed, even though it points to a different page on the same domain. Sometimes you will get SERPs that are missing pages from your site – this can happen if Google does not have certain index pages on your site or a vast number of duplicate content issues."

1,How do I start a food business?,business," Starting a food business can leave you in a tangle of red tape, unless you know where to start. We’ve outlined the process below and highlighted some things to consider, as well as signposting useful resources for the new food business owner. First things first: Food Business registration If you are not already registered as a food business, or you are taking over an existing food business from someone else, you must register online with your local authority, before you start trading. It is against the law to trade as a food business without registration – but making yourself known to your local authority gives you access to your local food safety team (including EHOs) who can be a valuable source of support and information when you are setting up. Food business registration is required by any business which: sells food cooks food stores or handles food prepares food distributes food, including: restaurants, cafes and takeaways catering businesses run from home, B&Bs, mobile catering and temporary businesses marquees, food stalls, food pop ups and food vans nurseries, schools and care homes distance selling, mail order and food delivery including online You will also need to go through the legal process for setting up any kind of business, if you haven’t already done so. Check out the UK Government website, Business Wales, or NI Business Info for details of how to do this. The UK.Gov page also gives details of permits and licences required for mobile food businesses or street trading. Premises and Facilities You will need to demonstrate that you have suitable premises and facilities to be able to prepare food safely, including the following: Premises must be clean, in good repair, and suitable for safe food preparation – for example, secure from pests. Provision must be made for waste disposal that does not encourage pests. The physical space must be suitable for food preparation, including walls, ceilings and surfaces that are easy to keep clean, without peeling paint or other potential contaminants. Light and ventilation must be adequate. You must have adequate, separate provision for handwashing, including hot water, and suitable areas for changing into clean work clothes. There must also be adequate facilities for equipment, crockery and cutlery washing and disinfection, and equipment must be in good working order. For a more complete list of the expectations for premises and facilities, check the FSA’s Setting up a Food Business page Food Safety One of a food business operator’s fundamental legal responsibilties is to ensure that their food is safe to eat. Food safety encompasses a range of measures, including: Creating and using a Food Safety Management, or HACCP, plan. This is a written plan that is used to risk assess, manage and record food preparation processes, from cleaning schedules and supplier records to temperature monitoring and stock rotation. Being aware of the risks and laws surrounding Food Allergens, and ensuring customers can consume your food without risk of harm from allergenic ingredients. Managing suppliers, ensuring that they are committed to providing you with food that is safe to eat and ensuring that all of your ingredients can be traced back to their original source. Ensuring that you and your staff are adequately trained and / or supervised, understand all elements of good food hygiene practice, including how to deal with allergens, and can undertake all necessary tasks in a way which eliminates the risks of unsafe food. Make sure that any training that you undertake is designed for the correct level and staff role – for example, Level 2 Food Hygiene and Allergen training for all food handlers, or those running a very simple food operation, and Level 3 Food Hygiene for those in a managerial or supervisory role. A reputable training provider will be able to supply you with a syllabus and sample of learning material, so you can check it is right for your needs. The FSA has published a comprehensive list of your food safety responsibilities The list above may seem daunting, but one really key point to remember, is that there are many resources available to help you. If you have any doubts about setting up and running your food business, seek out advice from your local authority food safety team, and your Environmental Health Officer. They will help you to operate safely, legally and, if you get things right, will be able to award you that all important 5 star rating – good luck!"
2,home inspection Houston,business," What most people think is that a successful home inspection depends on the company from which services are being taken which is true but just to some extent. The major part of a successful home inspection is always dependent on a home inspector who is going to perform a home inspection on your beautiful house. For a reliable home inspection Houston is lucky to have a company named 1strate inspections who have been serving the state for more than 38 years and still strong which makes it obvious that this company is completely trustworthy and will send reliable home inspectors to your place to see if your house has any underlying problems which should be fixed as soon as possible. If your house has problems or you suspect that there might be a problem then do not delay it any further and call a home inspection company to get this issue fixed for you as soon as possible. If we talk about 1strate inspections, their services include mold inspection, pool and spa inspection, sprinkler system inspection, termite and wood destroying insects inspection, infrared inspection, pre-drywall inspection, VOC testing, pharmaceutical inspection and many more. If you are worried about the condition of your property and are concerned that there might be something wrong, do not delay it further and call 1strate inspections as soon as possible as they have a very agile customer care system along with a very experienced team which consists of ten members who will leave no stone unturned to give you the best customer service experience. Their team consists of ten people who are committed towards their work and are really hard working when it comes to the services they are expected to provide. When a person searches some words like “home inspectors near me Houston'' they must be looking for the best services around but the more effective way to know and be satisfied of your choice is that you should always ask around from people you know or your relatives about the services they got from some home inspection company and what were their reviews afterwards. If any of your neighbors or relatives tell you about the company that suits your needs best, the first thing before calling them should be a call where the customer could judge what to expect from them once they set foot on our property. For that, the best way to check someone’s reliability is to check what their customers have to say about them. Do not forget to check how many five stars they have on the services they provided and how many people were completely satisfied and happy with the services they got. It is also very important to try to find one or two names of the home inspectors of the company which got the most positive and five star reviews. In this way, you will be able to differentiate between the good ones and the exceptional ones. Apart from services, it is very important to check if the home inspector that is going to visit our house should have his qualifications and certifications as required by the state which are InterNACHI, CPI and CMI. Through these certifications, a person can know if the opposite party is qualified enough or not to have a keen look inside their house in order to detect all the problems that are hidden to the naked eye which need absolute precision and expertise along with experience. 1strate Inspections proudly serve the state of Houston, Cypress, Spring, Katty, Sugar Land, the Woodlands and all of the surrounding areas if you need it to be done at your place in no time. There is no hassle as the help desk at 1strate Inspections allow people to be comfortable with their own schedule and get the work done in their presence so that they might know more about their house and what is up with it. Familiarity with the situation of the house is very important as the owner will be able to make the right decision for the house when the time comes and once the home inspection is done, he will know how to go forward for the maintenance and what measures are needed to be taken when something goes wrong. None of this could be done without the help of an experienced home inspector who is fully aware of what he is doing so if you think that there might be something wrong with your house, book a home inspection and get to know more about the place you are living in. Once we know what is exactly up with the place where we live, we can easily take preventative measures in order to get rid of all the present and upcoming problems by being completely alert regarding our surroundings and condition of the property."
3,Ways to Make Your Blog Post Interactive,business," Static marketing content is as outdated as print-only newspapers. Just as day-old newspapers become litter in the streets, static digital content is useless to the average reader. There are many Ways to Make Your Blog Post Interactive which we will go through in this article. With such an inundation of static marketing content, one-piece hardly stands out from others, meaning brands blend and ideas fade. We at Digital Nomad Ventures, a Digital Marketing Agency based in Colombo offer SEO blog writing services. Readers crave the dynamic nature of interactive digital content. An ion Interactive study measured the success and general feeling from marketers regarding interactive content. In terms of effectiveness, 93% of marketers say interactive media is great at educating buyers; 88% say it’s effective at differentiating brands, whereas static was found to be only 55% effective. Not convinced yet? Did you know that interactive content also drives 2X more conversions than static content? Despite these numbers, many marketers shy away from interactive content. It might be because it has a reputation for being expensive and labor-intensive. But that is an unfair reputation. Creating interactive elements is, in fact, easy, fast and even free. These ten tools allow you to start immediately interacting with customers, which draws them in, converts at higher rates and gives feedback to improve your business. Why make your blog post more interactive? Before we get into the “how” I thought it would be useful to have a talk about a few reasons why making your blog more interactive is so beneficial. It can really help people The most important thing for me is that an interactive blog can genuinely help people. Experiencing some human connection (even over the net) can be extremely beneficial for people, especially if the content is helping them with work, life, family, depression, etc. It helps you develop content Interactive content often leads to more content opportunities as discussions and debates can provide questions or fuel for extra content. This is a great way to involve your tribe and/or save time on content creation. It can improve sales An interactive community makes your blog or website appear more trustworthy and as such you have a larger and more engaged audience to launch products and make money from the blog. It can motivate you I try really hard to respond to every comment and email that I get because I know that everything, I have is due to the readers of this site. It’s something that gives me a lot of motivation to produce honest content and be as genuine as possible, especially when I get harsh feedback. It’s good for SEO Google likes to see websites that are regularly updated and comments, social shares and other forms of interaction can often play a role in how well you are ranked on Google compared to other more stagnant websites. Let’s take a look at some fun ways that people have made their blogs more communal places and how we can apply some of that creativity and cleverness to our own websites. As always, if you know of something cool please let me know in the comments. Use design techniques to encourage interaction It’s good to start with some basic design characteristics that encourage people to interact in some way. As with many areas of blogging, if you don’t get the design right you can undo a lot of your previous hard work. Create and use blog post templates which will help you to draft out blogs faster. Whenever an author gets a comment that she or he likes they can add a little badge that highlights it to other readers and sort of promotes it as being something worth noting. On other blogs, I’ve seen similar things where the best comments get highlighted in a different colour. We’ll look more at this kind of thing below. One of the main things you want to think about from a design point of view is that your interactive sections should be simple to use and easy to find if you want anyone to pay attention to them. As always, take a look at what others in your niche are doing and see if you can improve. Specifically, invite interaction for your blog post When I first started blogging, I was really afraid of asking for anything. It always seemed like bad etiquette to specifically ask someone to subscribe or leave a comment or perform a particular action. You should do keyword research to come with blog post ideas. But, over time, I’ve started to notice that people really don’t mind so long as it isn’t happening all the time, and as long as the content that you provide is somewhat valuable. For example, I always ask people to leave a comment at the end of my blog posts and usually throw in a second invitation to my mailing list when I notify them of new posts. Embed content from other sites This one is a little bit tricky because you have to be careful about how your source content so as to avoid copyright problems as well as duplicate content penalties from Google. That being said, there are some ways that you can do it effectively and ethically. For example, if you wanted to write an article about Donald Trump’s recent activities you might embed a series of tweets that help to provide context or background to your position. All you have to do is go to Twitter, find the specific tweet and then click “embed tweet” and paste the code into your blog post. That way you get a live updated and clickable message that shows re-tweets, likes, etc. You could also link to your own tweets as a way to get a conversation happening there. Target your Niche Find your niche and provide value. With the staggering number of blogs on the Internet, you need to corner off a certain section of information and declare it as yours. Rather than trying to be everything to everybody, be one particular thing to a select group of people. The more value you provide in terms of content, the more likely people are to keep coming back. Encourage interactivity for your blog post Encourage interactivity in the comment section by both asking people what their thoughts are at the end of the post, and by responding to comments. People will only make comments if they feel they’re going to be heard. Keep it as civil as possible while maintaining freedom of speech. Allow people to voice their opinions even if they’re dissenting views, so long as they’re not attacking you or one of the other commentators. Use some sort of blog post format, so that all your blogs are properly organized. Patience Be patient Don’t expect your blog post to be successful overnight. It can take anywhere from one to five years to see any kind of major traffic. Expect to have both up and down months and take them in stride. How interactive is your blog? Is your blog a very interactive place? I’d love to know what you think makes a difference. Are there any tools or techniques you have used that had an impact?

5,How to improve your local ranking on google,business," If you're trying to get a business off the ground and build it from the ground up, local SEO is an important part of your strategy. The truth is that in today's day and age, local search engine optimization actually matters more than ever before. Read this blog post for three ways to improve your local SEO. In order to rank well in Google for local businesses, you have to do local SEO. And, in order to do local SEO, you need a map pack. A map pack is a collection of images that illustrate your business and your location. It contains a single image for every detail from business name, to address and zip code. Images are what Google uses to rank your page for your purpose (i.e. local business search or local restaurant search). Google uses a pretty sophisticated algorithm to determine the location-relevant image that is most likely to rank best for the quality of your image. The algorithm also takes into account the surrounding neighborhoods and landmarks in your area. The background of the image plays a big factor too, as background can affect a photograph’s ranking. In order to properly set up your map pack, you need to know what information you need to include for each image. Before you get started, it’s important to download Google’s mobile app, as it contains additional tools that are perfect for organizing and adding images. According to Google, the best time to put together your map pack is before you actually launch your business. Before you begin uploading images, make sure that you have a business brief that explains what your business does and how it meets your audience’s needs. Use your essential facts to answer the following questions: After you have your business brief, input the images into Google’s image mobile app. When you’re done uploading your images, Google will notify you via email if your images rank in the top five locations where queries are being served. Thus far, you’ve gone over three critical things that are critical for doing your first map pack: Make sure what you include in the first map pack is relevant and helpful to the site’s audience. The best bloggers understand this value and apply it to every single post they write. The more content you create for your site, the more likely you are to rank higher on search engines. Search engines rank websites based on how much content a site has, so the more content you have, the more likely it is that search engines will rank your site higher. Naturally, a website that’s lacking in some area will be ranked lower, while a strong site with plenty of content will rank higher. Find out more about 10 ways to make your content stand out and your SEO strategy today!.1.1. Optimize for local audiences By now, the majority of businesses have a website and they’ve optimized it for local audiences. This means that by creating relevant content – now and in the future – you’re giving yourself the best chance at ranking for targeted keywords for your local area. Head on over to the Keywords by Site tool to easily find keywords for your local section. Rewrite old articles and optimize them if they’re from a while ago, but use the new, relevant keywords. Once you’ve made changes, contact the webmasters and let them know that you’ve updated and are willing to be a reciprocal link. If they don’t accept your offer, contact each of them and see if they’d be happy for you to be a follow link instead. Don’t be afraid to ask for a connection; it just takes a minute. Frequent discussions and questions on relevant sites can also provide opportunities for links. A site like SugarRae is very active in the Communities Forum where people are sharing information and links to the sites they “love. Smaller business sites can be helpful, too, such as Business.com. This is an excellent opportunity for beginners to build a reputable brand in their local market. Don't just focus on keywords; local content, reviews, images, forum discussions, and videos create excellent links for your site that will help your business. Get started by joining the Communities Forum and participating both online and offline. Reviews are important for your business. Not only are they a great source of word-of-mouth marketing, but they also help customers to feel more confident about buying your products or services. It’s important to get reviews from customers who have already purchased your products or services. Home Depot has an amazing recommendation system for online shoppers. They recommend things that other online reviews say are good or bad. It helps customers make a buying decision. That’s why they have a 4.4 out of 5-star rating on Amazon. How do they do this? They give a 100% money-back guarantee. For every 1,000 customers who purchase a new home or purchase a service at their store, they give a free $100 towards the purchase and installation of their product or service. The company doesn’t just partner with well-known review sites and websites automatically. Instead, it partners with experts in its industry. They hire a team of local SEO experts to look at reviews of local hardware, home improvement stores, and companies like Home Depot. The process works a little like this: every story on a relevant site that addresses a home improvement or home improvement product or service from a source like Google Images, Yahoo! Images, Facebook Marketplace, or Reddit receives a content writer from the local SEO team as a part of the content moderation. Reviews that violate the rules receive a warning, but the content still remains visible to the audience. So it’s easy for you to see a handful of these reviews and act accordingly. You can’t make a sale, but you can boost your online presence with testimonials and reviews. Local SEO is essential if you want to start a business in your area. It’s easy to fall into the trap of relying on backlinks, but local SEO is more strategic. Don’t rely on a backlink to rank well on Google. Focus on local search engines instead. Conclusion: Local search engine optimization is important whether you're an online business or a brick-and-mortar business. Use this information to help raise awareness of your business in your hometown and beyond! Local search engine optimization is the process of optimizing a business’s online presence to rank higher in search results for local keywords, such as “dry cleaners in San Diego” or “pizza restaurants in Los Angeles.” The process of implementing local SEO involves various web development elements, including: Review management On-site content building Domain migrations On-site link building Social connection building And a ton more Even though local search engine optimization might seem simple at first, these are very challenging tasks. When I started doing local SEO over a year ago, I considered it easy compared to now. Business owners and SEO marketers have really gained a lot more knowledge over the past year, but many of us still haven't hit home runs with our local SEO campaigns. So, what are the problems you need to fix, and how can you fix them? Well, it turns out that there are two particular issues that tend to plague local businesses that aren’t implementing any type of local SEO strategy: Review management Managing the reviews that already exist on a local business’s site has never been (and probably won’t ever be) as frustrating as when new reviews start rolling in. This happens because so many of us, including many local companies, are held to an overly lax standard for customer service. With so much on the line, owner responses are nothing short of national competitive advantage, so businesses simply aren’t held to the same rules as customers (for whom free stuff is a real perk). If a publication like the San Diego gay community had a problem with your business, your company literally has more customers than the next biggest competitor—and that’s before you get into the negative reviews being left by unhappy customers about your policies, employees, and location."
6,How To Find The Best Recreational Kayak,business," Recreational Kayak Suppliers will share this article with you. You might glide in a mangrove swamp, spend a weekend in a lakeside cottage, or hang out on a lake near your home on a warm afternoon and fall in love with kayaking. When the fever sets in, you start to consider buying your own recreational kayak. Those who have paddled in the rolling waves and struggled with the wind of the lake have a few pieces of advice for those who own kayaks for the first time. Consider your unique situation first. We recommend the two-step process of buying your first rec kayak: (1) understand your personal needs, (2) compare brands to reduce features: First of all, where are you going to paddle? A calm river or a mellow rapid? The combination of ocean, lake, and river? Only the sea, or only the whitewater? Second, in the research process, determine: How will you transport it and where will you store it? Do you prefer to sit inside or on top, the sit-inside tandem or the sit-on-top tandem? Do you want a dedicated recreational kayak (fishing, kid-sized, etc.)? Are any functions (for example, locking of hatches, weight capacity) a potential transaction barrier? Are you on top or inside? Before kayaking became a popular sport today, most kayaks were traditional or seated. The sitting style is a typical ""Inuit"" design, all other factors are the same because the paddlers are closer to the water, they run faster (think Italian sports cars). For the same reason, these low-altitude boats are easier to maneuver in rapids. What's not to like? Although this traditional design will bring you closer to the action-the oars actually lower themselves into the cockpit and tuck their legs under the bow-sitting in it is better than sitting on it. difficult. Once in the cockpit, kayakers can install a ""spray skirt"" on the edge of the oval cockpit to completely seal the paddles and prevent water from entering. If the hull is tilted (literally, it is turned 180 degrees from a position, the head is submerged, and then it is fully upright), ""sitting in"" can perform a ""roll"". This skirt seals the cockpit and the lower body of the kayak so that cold water can be kept out of the door so there is no need to drain. Anyone who often encounters ice water likes the style of sitting in it. However, most recreational kayakers do not wear skirts, nor do they move their bodies gracefully on the white-capped water. Casual oarsmen like mild temperatures and enjoy a refreshing soak in and out of the boat. Sport kayaks and sea kayaks are usually seated inside because they can provide more protection from bad weather. For a slender sea kayak, it is faster to sit in; for a sports kayak, sitting in it means you can roll underwater. Transport and storage In addition to the paddling experience, you also need to consider two other factors: kayak transportation (vehicle and walking) and home storage. If you plan to kayak alone, make sure you can easily lift the kayak onto the truck or put it on the roof of the car. Kayaking brings many opportunities to transport boats (and gear!) around rapids, obstacles, or low-water parts. The kayak you own should be light enough for you and your friends, children, or spouse to last at least one block. Also, consider the width. The widest part of the kayak is called the ""beam"". ""The wide beam and bulky model are a challenge for anyone. Remember to also consider storage issues. Many people choose to create space in the garage and hoist the kayak above the cars. Most lakes, many rivers If your plan is to do a lot of river paddling while avoiding hard rapids, then a longer boat can do some distance is best. If your boat is relatively long, such as a sit-inside or sits on a top tandem kayak, you can gain speed and storage capacity. If you plan to deal with Class III rapids, consider using a kayak that is more flexible, shorter, and more stable. Generally speaking, this means choosing a boat that does not exceed 12 feet, whether sit-on-top or sit-inside. On the other hand, if you buy a shorter, more flexible kayak-you will suffer on the calm water and have to paddle anywhere. In windy conditions (in fact, this is inevitable), you won't get anywhere soon. Smaller boats also do not transport a lot of equipment, so it is not ideal for multi-day trips. At the risk of repetition, we recommend buying a recreational kayak, as long as you can easily lift, transport, and store it. However, if whitewater is your interest, we recommend that you go beyond recreational kayaking and enter the world of sports kayaking. Kayak"
7,How to do a Background Check in Canada in 2021,business," Many individuals require background checks at some point in their life but do not know how to obtain one. No need to worry, Globeia is here to support you every step of the way! Before we delve into the way background checks are obtained, let’s first go over what a background check is. A background check is a method for individuals or companies to verify the identity of a person in correlation to the validity of their criminal record, employment history, educational background, alongside other details that confirm the identity of the person in question. Having access to details from the past, such as any previous criminal acts, is a key factor to consider when making informed decisions about the future. Quite often, background checks are a vital process conducted by employers in the hiring process of a candidate. Alongside employers, other resources such as embassies, universities, and even immigration departments may also require you to get your background check done in order to aid them in their decision-making process. The purpose of the background checks we provide is to comprehensively depict an individual’s criminal history. There are four types of background checks we provide: CPIC – (Canadian Police Information Centre) which is a name & date of birth based criminal record check Fingerprint Based Criminal Record Check Vulnerable Sector Check Judicial Matters Check CPIC – (Canadian Police Information Centre) - Name & Date of Birth Based Criminal Record Check: A name-based criminal record check, more so often known as CPIC (Canadian Police Information Centre) is a method to detect a person’s criminal record in the RCMP National Repository of Criminal Records, based on the name and date of birth of the individual, and can be done within one day. These name-based criminal record checks are considered basic as they are merely based on name and date of birth, hence the name and are ideal for certain employment purposes. The purpose of this type of criminal record check is to compare the applicant’s personal identification to available criminal records to see if they have committed a crime. Name-based searches are conducted by a local police agency. Globeia can assist you with obtaining a name-based criminal record check (CPIC) as they are partnered with the police who have access to their database to check the records. A name-based check can either come back as negative or incomplete. If it's negative, that means no criminal record has been found. If the results come back as positive or incomplete, this means that a record is found. This means that the search was unable to conclude that the individual does not have a criminal record, but does not necessarily mean that they have a criminal record. Sometimes these checks may come back as incomplete, since having the same name and date of birth as another person may be quite common. In that case scenario, the individual would be asked by the RCMP to obtain a fingerprint-based background check as this is the most discrete and accurate depiction of a person’s criminal record and history. Fingerprint Based Criminal Record Check: The fingerprint-based criminal record check, as mentioned above is the most accurate depiction of a person’s criminal record as no two individuals share the same set of fingerprints. This type of fingerprint-based criminal record check is often required by immigration departments, citizenship offices, certain employment types, amongst other resources that may ask you to obtain this type of clearance. When name-based criminal record checks do not provide a definite way of confirming a person’s identity, you may be asked to provide fingerprints. This is known as a certified criminal record check. It looks for crimes and arrests that are in the database under that set of fingerprints. Fingerprint criminal record checks are done by the RCMP. Globeia can assist you by taking your fingerprints and electronically submitting them to the RCMP the day of. The RCMP takes an applicant’s submission (usually performed by Live Scan digital fingerprinting process) to assess whether the individual has a criminal record. The RCMP fingerprint-based criminal record check is more thorough than the CPIC check as it is merely based on an individual’s fingerprints. A very small number of people have fingerprints that cannot be processed electronically. In these exceptional cases, the police service or agency will submit a paper copy of your fingerprints. It takes 10-15 minutes to take the fingerprints in the office and then we would submit the fingerprints to the RCMP the day of. The RCMP takes 2-3 weeks to deliver the results to the mailing address that you provide if there is no criminal record present. However, if a criminal record is present, it may take between 1 to 4 months for the results to be delivered to the mailing address. Vulnerable Sector Check: The vulnerable sector check is for people who volunteer or have jobs where they are in positions of trust or authority over children or vulnerable persons. The decision to request a vulnerable sector check is made by the hiring company or volunteer organization. The vulnerable sector check can only be done by the police, at your local police station. As such, if you are residing in Toronto, you would have to visit the following address: 40 College Street Toronto, ON M5G 2J3 However, as per the RCMP policy, the police station may advise the requirement of providing fingerprints ONLY if the GENDER and DATE OF BIRTH of the applicant match an existing pardoned sexual offence record. This is not an accusation of criminality, but it is required to verify the person's identity and to protect personal privacy. You will only be required to do the fingerprint-based criminal record check if the police station asks you to do it. In this case, they will issue you a letter of which you would be required to bring with you when you visit an accredited fingerprinting agency like Globeia. The fingerprint criminal record check is part of a vulnerable sector check wherein we can help the applicant to obtain a criminal record, only if the police station has advised the applicant to do so. Fingerprints for vulnerable sectors take 10-15 minutes to take the fingerprints in the office and then we would submit them to the RCMP day off. The RCMP then takes 2-3 weeks to deliver the results directly to the Toronto Police Station if no criminal record is present. Please note that in the case that a criminal record is found, the turnaround time to receive the results maybe 1 to 4 months. Judicial Matters Check: Judicial matters check is intended for applicants seeking employment or volunteering with organizations that require a criminal records check, along with a search of outstanding entries and charges. The information released on a CRJMC includes: criminal convictions from CPIC and/or local police records, findings of guilt under the Youth Criminal Justice Act if allowed by law Absolute and conditional discharges, and charges before the court or judicial orders. A CRJMC is typically used for Municipal Licencing, UBER or other ride-sharing organizations, and employment positions that are not related to the vulnerable sector (retail, trades, banking, etc.) and take 7 to 10 business days for the judicial matters check to arrive. **Please note, in order to receive any of the background checks (police clearances), two pieces of valid ID are required, of which one must be a photo ID containing the individual’s signature. Below is a list of accepted identification: -Driver’s Licence -Canadian Passport -Foreign Passport -Canadian Citizenship Card -Permanent Resident (PR) Card -Certificate of Indian Status -Student Identity Card -Firearms Acquisition Certificate (FAC) -Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) identification card -Federal, provincial, or municipal identification card -Military family identification card (MFID) -Work Permit Please don’t hesitate to give us a call or reach out to us via email for further information.

8,Money laundry & Cryptocurrency,business," Money laundry, has been a part of our economic societies for as long as one may care to recall the term itself dates to the early 20th century when the Italians used laundromats to provide an inconspicuous and seemingly legal facade to criminal money ever since, the act of money laundering, has evolved just as quickly as if not quicker than the laws meant to curb it. It is therefore no surprise that with the digitalization of commerce money laundering has entered the murky waters of cyberspace. As well over the past few years,  the prevalence of using cryptocurrency as a means for laundering money has seen an exponentially upwards trend. Its illicit usage having grown from a means to blanket darknet crime has become a staple in cybercrime of all magnitudes. Consider North Korea among the most notable entities infamous for its institutionalized cybercrime and among its recent infamous highs are types of warping $81 million in cash and $250 million in cryptocurrency according to some estimates nearly 10% of hermit kingdom's income comes from cybercrime, as well in 2018 criminal entities moved $1 billion in Bitcoin and that raised to two point $8 billion in 2019. There's a lot of movement going on in the crypto world but how do they manage to pull it off? These are after all crimes of international magnitude you would expect the rest of the world's capabilities to determine the actions of a single isolated wrong tour. The answer is simple :  make your money transfers so sophisticated that the complexity of tracking it eventually exceeds the time and resources available to do so since most of the cryptocurrency market is not governed by a central body. It's relatively easier to provide security to transactions or what are crypto currency exchange couple days with the anonymity of crypto transfers and you have yourselves a formidable laundromat to clean all your dirty money a cryptocurrency exchange is backed by blockchain technology which is essentially a digital record of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across an entire network of users so as a result such transactions are controlled by the users themselves, without the involvement of any third parties. Although it's nearly impossible to find out the identity of a particular crypto wallet owner the transaction history with records of senders and recipients account date time and payment amount is available to all network participants criminals use a variety of methods with a diversity of complexities to dilute the credibility of such records the simplest method also known as appeal chain transfers money in rapid and automated transactions from one Bitcoin wallet to another through several thousand intermittent transactions this not only hides the origin of money but also reduces the risk of setting off any alarms another classic method to launder money is to manually makes transactions criminals. Using this method generally send funds through several wallets of different users an next legitimate crypto cash with illegal money 3rd and perhaps the most popular method is called chain hopping in a manner similar to using appeal chain this method involves the movement of money from one bullet to another. However, the difference here is that the money is transferred through several different cryptocurrencies and log chains to get it away from Bitcoin and into other more anonymous cryptocurrencies. The idea is to make an investigator lose track of transactions and when their attention is off the chain of transactions to convert it back to Bitcoin as liquefiable currency. North Korea's allegedly state funded cybercrime group uses chain hopping to get its hands on stolen money by bouncing crypto cash from currency to currency and finally to a Bitcoin broker in China they managed to convert $250 million of stolen crypto into clean money without being detected in real time however with the advancements in blockchain surveillance methods. Laundering money via cryptocurrency is no longer as easy as it sounds also please and regulators may once have been clueless but they now have years of cryptocurrency investigation experience under their belts which has made detecting suspicious patterns in crypto exchange significantly easier and faster. However the main hurdle is the cash itself no matter how complex the transaction system is at the end the money has to go through a broker so authorities can follow a complex and convoluted transaction chain origin to his destination, which is often a broker who converts Bitcoin two real money since these money exchanges are more identifiable and fewer in number than the millions of crypto transactions it becomes possible for authorities to retrace a chain of transactions from here in the end it becomes only a matter of time before the culprit is found in regulated jurisdictions like the US Japan and European Union exchanges are already required to verify the identities of the users which makes it a lot harder to launder money that said there still exist some anonymized crypto currencies, which facilitate undetected transfers of money and they are here to stay with the darknet not going anywhere anytime soon there will perhaps always be a need for concealable exchange of money and where there's demand there's always a supply .

10,Website Development,business," Working in website development not only means constantly learning new languages and knowing when to use them, but, it also means learning more about marketing, requirements gathering and human-computer interaction. Website development has transitioned from simple HTML-driven sites to completely interactive informational and ecommerce portals. HTML5, jQuery and node.js didn’t even exist a couple of years ago. Now they’re a neighborhood of each project I do. It has always been my goal to share web programming tutorials and offer suggestions on proper web design here on Web Development Blog. You’ll find articles on eCommerce Solutions, Google Services, jQuery Code, PHP Scripts and a spread of other topics. What you’ll find during this section are conversations and concepts on that don’t easily slot in one among the prevailing categories. We’ll mention website design as an entire , tools, usability and running an internet site development company. As new technologies and programming languages emerge, we’ll mention them here first. There are a lot of free tools, graphics and web templates available on the Internet. We use this selection of resources from time to time. Freeimages, the leading FREE stock photo site! They offer thousands of photo’s from any subject, without watermarks and most of them are in high resolution. Unlike on most other photo sites, it’s allowed to use many of them for free even on commercial sites. Brands of the World, download vector logos and logotypes. It happens that you work on a project and you need a logo from some (bigger) brand for website or artwork. The image file you got is from bad quality and there is no one you can ask for a better version. Sounds familiar? Most of the times I found a vector version on Brands of the World and I was able to finish my work. Note, BotW is not a free clipart gallery, you need to ask the brand owner for permission before you can use a logo in your design. freeCSStemplates.org offers a lot of web templates from great quality. Using one of them can help to jumpstart a website project. They don’t offer a .psd file for the images."

12,How to measure the performance of your website,business," You’re finished.  Your new website is looking amazing.  It is already published on the internet and ready to go…… now what?  How do you know that it wasn’t just a waste of time and money?  Maybe the phones suddenly start ringing more? Or you start receiving hundreds more emails?  The truth is it’s unlikely to have an immediate dramatic effect, especially if you are new to website building.   So how do you maximise your return on investment? Firstly, you need Google Analytics.  This is a free tool and can provide you with a wealth of information to monitor your website.  Using Google Analytics, you can identify traffic sources, visitor demographics, monitor user behaviour and more. Below we will look at four key measures that will help you identify how your website is performing. How do potential customers discover your website? It’s all very well having a website, but how do people find it?  Knowing where your traffic is coming from will help you identify how to improve your website and digital marketing strategy.  Traffic to your website can come from a number of different sources: •	Organic searches: this is traffic direct from a search engine, for example Google, Bing or Yahoo. In order to perform well in an organic search, in other words to appear high up the list of websites when someone searches for your products or services, your website needs to be optimised for search engines. •	Referrals: this is traffic arriving at your website from another site. •	Direct: traffic that has typed in your web address directly.   Perhaps from a sales brochure or a personal referral. •	Email marketing. •	Paid advertising on for example, Google Adwords. •	Social media: for example, your Facebook or LinkedIn page. How many visitors do you have? To understand your reach and impact you can use Google Analytics to see the number of sessions (visits to your site) and the number of users (unique visitors).  Ideally you are aiming for a mix of new and returning customers – the exact mix will depend on your industry.  Most importantly you are looking to continually improve the number of visitors, first or returning, to your website. How are long are visitors browsing your website? Time spent on your website is an important indicator of how successful your website design is.  Generally, the longer the better.   There are also some other key measures that will help you to understand more about time spent by your visitors browsing your site.  Firstly, how fast do your pages load?  Remember you have only 10-20 seconds to engage with your visitors.  Secondly, bounce rate.  Bounce rate is the percentage of people who visit your site and quickly leave.  Obviously, you are aiming for lower bounce rates and longer session times.   If visitors are bouncing quickly, they may not have found what they are looking for.  Or your advertising may not be bringing the right visitors to your website. What do visitors do when they get to your site? This is probably the most important measure of the overall performance of your website.  Which pages or links are your visitors viewing?  Do they click through to find out more and ultimately are you converting your visitors to customers?  If not, why not?  What is your call to action (CTA)?  Are visitors requesting quotes, calling, using the contact form or emailing?   And ultimately what is the cost per conversion for your website? By looking at all of the above information you can identify how your website is performing against your marketing goals, where you need to focus your digital marketing budget and how to improve the performance of your digital marketing campaign. If all this still seems like gobbledygook, or you don’t have the time for this much detail, call Marketelements now for a free consultation."

15,"Cannabis Effects, Risks and Addictions",business," Effects Cannabis can be used in a variety of ways, and the method used can influence the drug's effects. Smoking or inhaling: Elation can begin in a matter of minutes and peak after 10–30 minutes. After about 2 hours, the sensation usually fades. Ingesting: If someone takes cannabis-infused products by mouth, they will normally feel the effects within an hour, with the sensations peaking after 2.5–3.5 hours. According to one study, the type of edible has an effect on how long it takes to experience the effect, with hard candies kicking in faster. Topical: Transdermal patches allow the substances to be absorbed into the body over time. People who use cannabis to alleviate pain and inflammation may benefit from this constant infusion. How do cannabinoids work? The endocannabinoid system in the human body produces some cannabinoids naturally. They send messages across the neurological system in a similar way to neurotransmitters. Memory, thinking, focus, movement, coordination, sensory and temporal perception, and enjoyment are all influenced by neurotransmitters. THC and other cannabinoids bind to the same receptors that respond to these cannabinoids. Cannabinoids from outside sources can alter and disturb normal brain activity in this way. THC appears to have an effect on brain areas that control: ·      memory and attention ·      balance, posture, and coordination ·      reaction time After smoking cannabis, a person should not drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or engage in dangerous physical activity. THC increases dopamine release by stimulating certain cannabinoid receptors. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in the sensation of pleasure. THC has the ability to alter sensory perception. Colors may appear more vibrant, music more vivid, and emotions more intense. What does a person feel? People who use cannabis may experience the following side effects: ·      A feeling of elation or euphoria, known as a high ·      Relaxation ·      Changes in perception of colour, time, and space, for example ·      An increase in hunger ·      Feeling more sociable Risks There are several hazards associated with cannabis use. These are some of them: ·      Impairment of judgment: According to a 2012 study, driving within three hours of using cannabis increases the risk of a car collision. ·      Immune response: A 2019 study found that regular cannabis usage may have an impact on the immune system, but further research is needed to confirm this. ·      Gum disease: There may be a relation between cannabis usage and gum disease, according to the American Dental Association. ·      Memory loss: Smokers of powerful cannabis strains (such as skunk) may have a higher risk of acute memory loss, according to one study. ·      Testicular cancer: According to a 2018 study, taking cannabis more than 50 times over the course of a lifetime may raise the chance of testicular cancer. Some varieties of cannabis, such as skunk, have been tweaked to increase the potency of specific components. The average THC level in confiscated cannabis increased from 4% to over 15% between the 1990s and 2018. One issue with consuming unregulated or recreational drugs is that no one knows what's in them or how strong the effects will be. Contaminants may also be present. Addiction Long-term cannabis use can cause brain alterations that lead to problematic use, often known as cannabis use disorder. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), roughly 30% of cannabis users suffer from this disease, in which they experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop using the drug. Approximately 9% of these people may develop an addiction. When a person can't quit taking a substance, they have an addiction. According to the NIDA, up to 17% of those who start using cannabis in their teens may become addicted to it. Cannabis withdrawal It is not life threatening to stop using cannabis after being addicted, but it can be unpleasant. Symptoms may include: ·      Irritability ·      Mood changes ·      Insomnia ·      Cravings ·      Restlessness ·      Decreased appetite ·      General discomfort Symptoms usually peak one week after quitting and might linger up to two weeks. Experts are unsure how long-term and frequent cannabis usage impacts a person's health. Individuals may experience different short- and long-term consequences. Takeaway Chemicals in cannabis can have a variety of effects on the human body. It's a popular recreational substance that also has medical use. Anyone contemplating the use of cannabis should evaluate the potential negative impacts on their mental and physical health. A doctor is a wonderful person to seek guidance from. Once you have consulted your doctor or are interested in cannabis check your local weed store in Toronto."

18,Lighting tips and ideas by an electrical contractor in Pasadena,business," The right lighting installation can transform any home or business into a totally different space. The type of lighting, the temperature, and color, the fixture, the location. All should match the style and intent you are trying to achieve. There are a lot of tips and tricks to consider. We are going to share the six most important tips given by an experienced electrical contractor in Pasadena who has installed light fixtures for three decades. 1- Residential or Commercial Lighting Is it a home or a business? The type of circuit and voltage used may be different which means you have to look at a different selection when choosing the fixture. Big commercial spaces may also have bigger lights depending on the intent and function of the business which takes us to the next point. The kind of lighting each area of your restaurant needs depends on what happens and what your patrons experience in that area. For example, the table area needs lighting that allows for easy menu-reading. At the same time, though, it shouldn’t be glaring. This will make it hard for people to relax, and they won’t feel a sense of privacy in their space. 2- Purpose of the Space you are Installing Lighting After knowing what type of voltage you are looking at, look at the space and what people will be doing there. Is it a kitchen? A living room? A restaurant? A store? A kitchen needs a lot of light. Recessed lights are great ideas and will look fantastic. Living rooms also look great with recessed lights, but if you are looking into a more classic or sophisticated style, you can look at some pendant lights and chandeliers. If this is for a restaurant or a store it depends of the type. Most will want a lot of light. However, some restaurants or stores may want to create a more romantic or intimate ambiance, which possibly means less lighting, and specific to designated areas – task lighting or accent lighting. 3- Layering with your Lighting Layering is important, especially in restaurants. After you have decided on your ambient lighting, you will need to decide on task lighting. Task lighting is specific lights places in certain areas where people do specific tasks (e.g. eating, preparing food). For example, under-cabinet lighting, bathroom vanity lighting, pendants over a bar, a reception of a hotel, an office, a pool table area, and more. You can have both more general lighting to create ambiance and then task lighting. Task lighting is usually brighter than ambient lighting. 4- Consider Accent Lighting Features Accent lighting is a beautiful addition to any room. These include wall lighting, recessed spotlighting, track lighting, and wall-mounted picture lighting. You these types of lighting a lot in art galleries, photo galleries, garden areas, home entrances, etc. Think of it as something that will catch the eye of your guest or customer. It works particularly well if highlighting something else, for example, a piece of art. 5- Decide on a lighting Design/Theme Yes, lighting can follow a theme along with the style of your house of business. Meaning it should be consistent. Examples are vintage, modern, minimalist, elegant, hip, or more provocative. Try to stick with only about three or four different types of lighting throughout your store or room. 6- Consider Cost-Efficiency Having beautiful light fixtures does not mean that you need to pay more for electricity. Electrical design services can help you understand the best fixtures are you should be using for your specific goals while keeping the electricity costs lower. In some cases, you just need to be more strategic in where to put the fixtures and which one to choose. Although you may think you need more lighting to brighten up an area, you may only need to be more strategic in where you install it. When it comes to improving the appearance of your home or business, lighting is one of the most important factors to consider. It can easily change the look, feel, and value of your property. Understanding the function of each room will determine the types of lighting to consider, along with lighting placements. This will ensure the best results as well as good cost-efficiency. If you are looking to revamp your place or installing new lighting from scratch, you should consider all the above points before deciding what to do. We recommend that you work with your local electrician for further suggestions and ideas on your particular case and space."
19,Mariopeshev.Com Reveals 5 Reasons Why Companies Should Hire A Business Consultant,business," Regardless of how business managers try to expand and further develop their companies, at some point, they will end up needing a fresh perspective and new marketing strategies to take the business to the next level or to solve bigger problems. A corporate business consultant can help you identify business challenges and implement improvements using their specialized experience and skill set. Business consultants are professional advisors with specialized expertise that allows them to excel in a specific field of business. These professionals help organizations improve their outcomes and productivity, evaluate enterprises, and develop strategies to achieve their objectives. Here are 5 reasons why hiring a business consultant is an excellent idea: 1.)	GAIN A PERSPECTIVE FROM AN OUTSIDER Developing a marketing strategy from inside your own business is more challenging than coming at it from the outside. That is why hiring a business consultant can give you new perspectives that do not exist within your organization. Because consultants are professionals who have worked with many different companies, their experiences and resources can bring you measurable results. Their outside perspective infused with your marketing strategies can create unique and unexpected approaches to solving business problems or developing new ways to improve your business. 2.)	SEEK TRUE MARKET ANALYSIS Business consultants will provide you with an unbiased assessment of your business. Compared to a permanent employee, who may be susceptible to an organization's internal politics, consultants provide objective overview of your company. They serve as a neutral third party that can give valuable insights without being compromised by internal distractions. 3.)	UNDERSTAND YOUR CUSTOMERS BETTER Consultants have the resources and time to study and better understand your clients thoroughly. They have experience in various industries and have worked with different companies, which means that they know what quality content will engage more people, generate leads, connect with customers and build trust. 4.)	DEVELOP STRATEGIC PLANS AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES Consultants are natural-born trainers. You may employ a consultant to share their expertise on almost any matter, so they are often hired to influence other employees through action-oriented strategic business plans. For example, internally administered processes such as defining redundancies and making workforce cuts may be affected by and harmful to team structures. Consultants have an analytical viewpoint from which they can see where cuts should be made and how to make them with enough emotional distance. Consultants can also help you implement effective practices for your employees to help them be more efficient in their tasks while also giving valuable guidance and direction. 5.)	SAVE TIME AND MONEY Hiring a consultant may be a more significant investment, but because these professional advisors are not full-time employees, it means you can save money in the long run. And since they are experts in their field and have more experience in the industry, they can save you so much time and help you avoid taking financial risks. Consultants dedicate all their time to weighing the different alternatives and providing analysis and data on the various costs and benefits, which can undoubtedly relieve you of a great deal of stress. Conclusion Hiring a corporate business consultant is a no-brainer. If you see one that fits your business well, then there is no reason why you should not make use of their services. Business consultants infuse a new burst of energy, while giving suggestions how to put out more quality content and develop better business strategies.

20,10 legit ways to make money online,business," 21 Ways to Make $100 or More Online in a Single Day While it’s been a long time since I had my first $100 online payday, I have learned about a ton of different strategies to earn money online since then. And I want to share them all with you, one by one. But first, let me give you a little context about me and my story. Around ten years ago, I started a blog called Good Financial Cents. While my website makes tons of passive income now, I initially built my blog as a marketing tool for my financial planning practice. At the time, I didn’t know anything about online marketing, social media, or SEO. In fact, I was oblivious about the fact you could make money online. Fortunately, I met some mentors along the way that showed me I could use my online presence to earn real money. This was such a huge mindset shift for me since, until then, the only way I knew how to earn money was by going out and getting more clients. I didn’t know it at the time, but I would eventually replace my full-time job with blogging income alone. Now that you know my backstory, it’s time to dig in to some of the ways you can start earning passive or active income with the internet. If you’re interested in earning money online and in your spare time, check out these 21 ways you can earn $100 or more per day: #1: Google Adsense When I started my blog, I faced a lot of restrictions as a financial advisor. As a result, one of the only ways I could monetize at the time was by using Google Adsense. With this income-earning strategy, you simply sign up and Google gives you a code to copy and paste onto your website. From there, Google does the rest and you get paid any time someone clicks on your ads and/or makes a purchase. When I finally added Google Adsense to my website, I was able to earn my first $100 payout within around three months. This is pretty cool, but a lot of people have asked me how I earned so much with Adsense at first. You have to keep in mind that, as a financial advisor, most of the ads on my website are for financial products that pay out rather well. If your blog is in a different niche like food or fashion, it may take you longer for your ads to pay off with your first $100 check. #2: Text Links The second way I made $100 at first was via text links. If you’re wondering what text links are, check out any article on the web and you’ll see highlighted words you can click out to take you to another web page. While I didn’t realize it for quite a while, there are a ton of companies who are willing to pay $100, $200, and even $1,000 or more for you to link from your website to theirs. But I was pretty stoked when a few companies would pay me $100 or more just for inserting a link into one of my blog posts. Unfortunately, I eventually learned that selling text links is against Google’s terms and conditions. If you are doing this on a consistent basis, your website is going to tank over the long-term. For that reason, selling text links isn’t a good long-term monetization strategy. You can do it every once in a while without any negative impact, but you’ll live to regret it if you get greedy and overdo it. #3: Sponsored Posts With a sponsored post, a company pays you to talk about their product or service on their website. While I initially made $100 to $200 for each sponsored post I did on Good Financial Cents, I kept jacking up my rates over time. How much can you earn? Blogger Alexis Schroeder of FITnancials says she frequently earns $3,000 per month with sponsored posts. However, some blogs with more traffic can easily earn $20,000 per sponsored post or more. If you plan to do sponsored posts, I definitely recommend only working with companies you believe in and feel good promoting. If you promote anything and everything without making sure it aligns with your values, you probably won’t gain a lot of trust from your readers. Over time, this could hurt your efforts to grow your website more than the income from sponsored posts helps. #4: Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the most lucrative ways to make money online. When I was able to add affiliate links to my website, I watched my income surge in a big way in a matter of weeks! In the financial planning niche, affiliates include companies like online brokerages, online banks, and financial tools. These kinds of companies pay very good money if you’re willing to promote them. While the type of affiliates you work with will vary depending on the niche you’re in, keep in mind that some companies will pay you up to $100 per conversion. It’s not too hard to start earning real money with that kind of return on your time. If you don't believe me, check out Making Sense of Cents. Michelle Schroeder-Gardner is the entrepreneur behind this blog, and she is also the founder of a course called Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing. Through her website and course sales, Michelle consistently earns over $100,000 per month. No, that is not a typo. #5: Display Ads Display ads are very similar to Google Adsense except that the reader doesn’t have to click on the ad for you to make money. Think of display ads as billboards that are on your website instead of on the side of the highway. With display ads, you get paid based on the number of times your ads are viewed no matter what. For that reason, these ads will work better for you as the traffic to your website grows over time. #6: Freelance Writing Freelance writing is another way to earn online income if you don’t mind earning some of your money with active work. Another benefit of freelance writing is that you can gain exposure by writing for larger websites. One of the first websites I wrote for paid me $150 per article. This wasn’t a lot of money, but I used the opportunity to improve my writing skills and get my name out there. I don’t write as much for other people anymore, but I do know plenty of freelance writers who are earning $250, $500, and even $1,000 or more per article. Some freelance writers I know are even earning six figures or more writing from home each year. This includes blogger Holly Johnson, who earns over $200,000 per year writing articles for other websites. Johnson also offers a course you can check out if you want to become a freelance writer but need some help getting started. #7: Getting New Clients for Your Business When I started my blog, I envisioned my website as a marketing tool to get new clients for my financial practice planning. This strategy worked great since my online presence helped me build authority and reach people I may not have reached otherwise. If you have a service-based business of any kind, I would absolutely suggest starting a blog or building an online presence you can use to get new clients. This can help you build your client base just like I did, and it’s a lot more fun than cold-calling or holding boring seminars. #8: Coaching If you have expertise in a specific field, you can also use the internet to build up a coaching business. This is something that happened on accident for me. As I built my blog and my brand, a ton of people started reaching out to me to learn how I did it and how they could apply the same ideas to their own business. While I initially gave out advice for free because I enjoyed it, I eventually started charging a consulting fee. How much you earn depends on the type of niche you wind up in. According to recent statistics, executive coaches make around $325 per hour while business coaches make more like $235 per hour. Life coaches, on the other hand, are able to charge approximately $160 per hour. If you’re an expert in your field and people are constantly asking to “pick your brain,” you should start charging people . Your time is valuable and so is your advice! #9: Selling Leads Once I was a few years into Good Financial Cents, I started a second website called Life Insurance by Jeff. While we initially started this website to build up our own leads, we got to the point where we had so many leads we couldn’t handle them ourselves. Eventually, I found out that a handful of insurance companies were willing to pay for leads generated through my website. These companies would pay between $35 to $100 per lead, which is insane. This was a big eye-opener for me since I had no idea this was possible. Also note that it’s not just life insurance companies willing to pay for leads. There are a ton of different avenues and lead generation strategies out there, so make sure to consider all the possibilities. #10: Digital Products There are all kinds of digital products out there, but there is always room for more. I even have a few of my own! If you sign up for my free Make 1K Challenge where I show you how to start a blog and make your first $1,000, for example, I have a $7 upgrade that includes some PDFs and behind the scenes video. While $7 doesn’t sound like a lot of money, this one product still helps me earn an additional $1,500 to $2,000 per month passively! Another example of digital products is the wide world of printables. Lots of online entrepreneurs create digital products their customers can print at home, and they often make bank doing it. While many bloggers have their own printable budget templates, meal plans, or checklists, you can also find examples on Etsy.com.The Bottom Line While these are some of the ways you can make money online, this list isn’t all-inclusive. We didn’t talk about Facebook ads, retail arbitrage, membership groups, or a ton of other strategies. The Bottom Line While these are some of the ways you can make money online, this list isn’t all-inclusive. We didn’t talk about Facebook ads, retail arbitrage, membership groups, or a ton of other strategies! If you need to earn more money on the side, remember to think about all the different ways you can earn money with the internet. Even if most of these strategies don’t sound like much fun to you, chances are good that one of these ideas is perfect for your lifestyle and goals. Start earning money online and I guarantee you won’t regret it."

1,4 Powerful Ways To Build A Community Around Your Business,business," Now is the time to connect. Whether you have been separated from friends and family over the past year, have struggled to get your business out there, or have been otherwise unable to do the things you want to do, now is a great time to get creative and reconnect with the community around you. The same is true in business. Being part of a community is powerful. It is not only essential for our mental health and wellbeing, but it's also a vital element of a thriving business. A sense of community is important between businesses and customers, and also between employers and employees. With the tips below, you can start to build a business that is not only a positive part of the wider community, but one that also fosters a positive community within the business itself. Building a community is not only about looking outward at your wider surroundings. It is also about looking inward and reflecting on the community that you are building within your own business — however large or small. It can be helpful to consider the values and mission of your business overall, and how you can reflect them within your business culture. For example, your values might include originality, innovation, and self-expression. Think about the ways you could encourage these values among your workforce — such as by scheduling regular creative activities or field trips for your team members, perhaps. Another great way to build additional community within your business can be to attend events or training courses together. You could perhaps begin by researching the certifications or qualifications that are most valued or relevant to your industry, and then get started. You and your workforce will not only build great team values and stronger connections, but will be more qualified too. Even if you are a global or international business, or operate entirely online, you can still contribute to your local area. You are providing value and growth to the local population - even if indirectly - so why not make an effort to connect with your community and get involved? This might include donating to local causes, getting engaged with fundraisers, offering internships or work experience for local students, giving encouraging talks or speeches in schools, and more. There may also be some complimentary local businesses with whom you could collaborate. You could run joint offers with them, for example, or joint advertisements. And if you have similar or crossover skillsets, perhaps you could join forces on particular projects. Whether you are building a community online or in person, reaching out to potential collaborators can reap real rewards. Community is of course about bringing people together, and what better way to do that than by hosting events? You could perhaps hold conferences, conventions, or networking events and set them up online, if needs be. For example, during national lockdowns, many businesses or educational institutions around the world took their programmes and services entirely online. Live-streamed conferences, Q&As, and tutorials are especially popular and can be hosted via websites or social media platforms. This can be a great way to connect with potential clients and customers who may be all over the world, as well as those who are more local but might have limited mobility. Attending a wide variety of events both online and in-person — or even organizing them yourself — is an excellent way to build a strong and supportive community for your business. Not only will you be giving genuine value and knowledge to others, but you will receive the same in return. Building a community starts within your business, branches out to your customers, and can also include those who you outsource to! Outsourcing important aspects of your business to experts is a great way to save time, make use of others’ skills, and grow your business organically. Outsourcing to an expert might mean entrusting your blog to a professional writer with knowledge of search engine optimisation, for example, of maximizing your opportunities in tendering by hiring a bid writing professional, or by seeking guidance on technical subjects such as GDPR regulations, perhaps. These are all examples of outsourcing crucial business facets to experts who might have years of valuable experience. Through outsourcing in this way you can help the community by providing work and building a collective with knowledge and expertise, while giving your business the best chance of success!"
2,Digital Vs. Physical Products: Why More and More Webpreneurs are Crushing It With Digital Products,business," Not long ago, telling someone you make a living online was akin to telling them you were some kind of archaeologist. Sure, many people knew it was possible to work online and make money, but if you told them how easy and lucrative it was, they still gave you a sideways look. Nonetheless, times have certainly changed. The advancements in technology and the broader use of the internet (especially during the pandemic), have made online business ventures more lucrative than ever. Today, you can purchase (or sell) a wide range of products through various eCommerce platforms. For example, everyone knows how well Amazon is doing to fill consumer demand having cornered almost every niche on the market! Even so, while you can sell both physical and digital products online, the latter tends to be more popular and profitable. This article endeavors to give you an overview of what digital products are and why they are in great demand inside a multi-billion dollar industry. After reading this article, it will be easier for you to decide which approach you should choose in becoming an online business. What are digital products? Simply put, a digital product is any product, whether for sale or not, that is in an intangible format as a digital file. These products can be downloaded, streamed, or translated into mediums such as templates, software or eBooks. However, the primary point of interaction with digital products is through the use of technology and the internet. The most sold digital products include online courses, eBooks, software, graphics, website themes, photographs, and artwork. Physical products, on the other hand, are tangible and you need to ship them out to your customers. These include a vast-range of merchandise that need to be manufactured, labelled, packaged, stored and delivered. 6 Main Reasons why digital products are gaining more popularity in the online entrepreneur space than physical products: When considering becoming eCommerce sellers, many people tend to veer towards traditional, faithful physical products. But not so fast. You may be missing out on some critical time and money savings. Below are some of the greatest benefits you can get from selling digital products: When selling digital products you'll eliminate numerous costs you would have incurred had you been selling physical products. Here  is a quick summary of some operation expenses that you'll either incur way less of or do away with entirely: •	No more shipping, handling and storage costs or hurdles like border inspection •	No manufacturing and purchasing inventory (the highest business expenses) •	No need to sell on competitive e-tail sites or set up bloated eCommerce stores •	Insurance isn’t necessary for digital products. Insuring physical products can get complicated and very expensive quickly, especially if those products don't sell fast or when a disaster strikes like a fire. •	No costly overhead. You will need to invest in an internet service, a fast running computer and a few other tools to create digital products, but considerably less than setting up shop for physical products. When dealing with digital products, you have complete control over your sales process. You won't need to handle numerous product recalls that are common when selling physical products, or risk losing precious retail shelf space. It is unlikely that someone will recall an ebook because the editor missed a typo. On the other hand, if a physical product has any malfunction or fails to meet a customer's preference, they will likely request a refund. Recalls are not only expensive but can also drive away customers from buying your future products. With digital products, you'll have fewer dissatisfied customers, which helps build a positive image for your brand. Setting up a digital product for sale and out to market is much easier and demands less time compared to physical products. As is the case with physical products, you won't have to contend with processes like designing a prototype, negotiating with various manufacturers, or finding a fitting fulfillment company when setting up a digital product. In most cases, all you have to do is create the digital product once and set it up for sale on your own dedicated website. Purchasing digital products is more convenient, given that after completing the purchase process, the customer can immediately have access to the product. They don’t have to wait for days or weeks to access their purchase, as is the case with most physical products sold online. Your customers will only need to press a few buttons, and walla, they have the digital product right on their computer. With physical products, you'll have to replenish your stock continuously as they are purchased. The cost of restocking bulk inventory can be outrageous, especially in the apparel and footwear space. Digital products, on the other hand, are infinite, intangible goods. After creating a superior digital product, you can continue to sell it forever. You will neither run out of downloads for your digital product nor will you have to incur expenses such as storage or logistics. Digital products have an ROI of approximately 80-90%. This incredible return-on-investment is one of the main reasons internet marketers everywhere are tapping into this goldmine. As long as the product is adding value and solving a problem for the customer, they are way less prone to recalls. Without the usual costs incurred in setting up a traditional business, selling digital products online far outweighs the profit potential of selling physical products. Final Thoughts Here’s the Bottom line: digital products can be made inexpensively and sold at great profit margins. They are more resistant to hit or miss trends; eliminate the common barriers to purchase; involve fewer if any middlemen; and most importantly, keeps control squarely in the hands of the business owner. You don’t have to be worried about opening hours or being tied up to one local market either. The internet is borderless and you can reach tens of thousands of consumers with similar interests – something that would be nearly impossible with a physical product. Most internet entrepreneurs start their online businesses by selling either ebooks, audiobooks, ecourses, coaching memberships or a combination of these, which involve little technical skills. If you would like to learn more about how to successfully set up your own digital product business that will prove both enjoyable and profitable, then please check out my book The Digital-X Product Formula at the link below."
3,What is responsive web design and why is it important?,business," What is Responsive Web Design? What is Responsive Web Design? Responsive web design (RWD) is the process of designing websites and applications so they can be easily viewed on a variety of devices, including desktop computers, tablet personal computers, mobile phones, and other types of the display devices. This is a hot topic for web developers and designers in 2014, and if your website is still using the old, static website layout, then you will find it difficult to design one that looks great on any device. The same goes for the software we use to design websites. While we need to design mobile versions of web pages, we also need to include them on laptops, desktops, or other devices at run time, and we need to make them work properly on these devices. As developers, we need to design the sites without getting caught up in the layout, and we also need to design the website with these additional features in mind. If we were to design a website without considering the requirements of all of these platforms, then we will find that many of our designs will either look broken or not have the potential to work on several different devices. Why is responsive design so important? We are seeing more and more devices on the market, and more and more websites that need to look good on all devices these days. If we were to design each website with our own bias, then we would design things that not look good on some of these devices, but work just fine with others. This would be an inefficient use of all of the different design and coding platforms available to us today, which make our web pages look great using many different layout options. Using different layout options will allow us to increase the page size of any website to fit whatever device the viewer is on, in order to get full use of the computer hardware you own. Using different layouts will also increase our design efficiencies because many of the resources we need are Benefits of Having a Responsive Web Design Benefits of Having a Responsive Web Design for the Web design industry is not what it seems: Responsive web design is not about having a mobile device in the corner of the Internet, it’s about designing the web so that your website looks great no matter how it is viewed. Whether viewed on-site as well as on a mobile device, you do not have to make any adjustments to accommodate the environment – your website can serve exactly the same way on all your devices. The biggest obstacle to implementing responsive design into a website is that the webmaster will need to make several changes to the code, and these changes will need to be reflected throughout the website. So how can you use responsive design without losing your audience? The following are three ways through which you can optimize your website without making any major structural modifications: Mobile Website Design with Bootstrap: Bootstrap is an open-source HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework that can be integrated with a basic HTML template. It is easy to start designing a mobile website with Bootstrap simply by importing the following files into your HTML template: The problem of mobile web design can be summed up in a one-word phrase: content. It is a problem of content distribution. If you have a web page that serves as a general information resource, there are only two ways to distribute it: You can either put it on another web page, like an e-commerce store, that does this job, or you can send out your page to be tweeted, shared with Facebook, or shared with email. On top of that, if your page has any form of content, including images and links, if it has any kind of content at all, then you will also want to send out messages about it. An easy to use Bootstrap 3 for mobile responsive website: Responsive website design is a modern website development technique that will bring more Tips for Ensuring a Responsive Web Design Tips for Ensuring a Responsive Web Design, with the Web Standards Association Responsive Web Design with The Web Standards Association: So what exactly is a responsive web design and why is it important? In today’s blog post I will tell you all I know about it. There is currently no one type of responsive website out there, as there is no one type of website. The challenge with responsive web design that I am going to be taking on in this blog post is to create one for myself, and I hope that you will learn something new from what I write. You can find my responsive website template (created as an experiment) at my web template store. But first here is my introduction to responsive web design: So what exactly a responsive web design is: I always thought that “responsive web design” was a bit of a misnomer, because I have no idea what it really entails. So from my point of view, when someone says that they are designing a “responsive website” it is the same as saying that they designed an “unresponsive website”. I suppose you can also say that with a responsive design they are designing a website that fits the screen size of an iPhone or an iPad (as well as larger screens), but that is just an extra bonus; of course, it would be so much much easier if there are a thousand more options for websites to design without having to think the “smartphone website” (iOS-design-first-web-design) and “PC web design” (PC-design-first-web-design). With this kind of thinking, “responsive web design” is just all about designing for iPhone or iPad. And this is probably also all that responsive web design was meant to be all about: to provide an “iPhone and iPad-"

6,How To Success With PPC Advertising,business," Pay-per-click advertising is an interesting topic and an extremely hot topic on today's marketing scene. It covers all facets of internet marketing and includes data analytics, keyword tools, ad placements, and many other disciplines. As more individuals set out to learn more about PPC advertising, they find out how influential it can really be. Without a doubt, PPC advertising has grown at an exponential rate due to the fact that businesses of all sizes are reaching out for new ways to market their products. If you're interested in learning more about how you can get started in PPC advertising, take a moment to examine the following steps. These platforms are easy enough to understand, but they do take some work on your part to make sure that you increase the potential of your campaign. As always, we highly recommend that you proceed at your own pace and find what works best for you. Creating a good landing page is another reason why PPC advertising is so successful. Your landing page should be directly related to your ads. You want your readers to immediately see what your ads are about right off the bat. One mistake that many businesses make is including images or links to other pages on their site. This is done in an effort to maximize traffic and get more clicks; however, this does nothing to promote your business goals. Make your landing page stand out above and beyond anything else on your website. Another way to succeed with PPC advertising is to use tracking analytics and other smart tools. Tracking analytics gives businesses an idea of the actual number of clicks on their ads versus the estimated number of impressions. In addition to this, smart tools like Google Analytics will give businesses a comprehensive look at their demographics. With this information, PPC advertisers can ascertain which keywords and ads bring in more revenue than others. Some people believe that a PPC advertising campaign is not the same as traditional search engine optimization (SEO). While SEO uses both paid and organic search results to boost online exposure, PPC does not use organic results. Instead, PPC advertisers are able to target specific groups of people who are more likely to buy the products or services they are searching for. The goal of a PPC campaign is to drive more traffic to a website, which can lead to more conversions and increased revenue. If you are unfamiliar with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, there are two basic types. There are pay-per-sale (PPP) advertising campaigns and pay-per-click (CPC). With PPC campaigns, advertisers only pay when their target keyword(s) are searched. On the other hand, with a pay-per-click (CPC), the advertiser only pays when a visitor to their site actually clicks on a listed advertisement. Both forms of digital marketing strategy can result in different amounts of revenue depending on how much effort and time is spent on developing the campaigns and tracking down the right keywords. Success with digital marketing strategy requires careful consideration of all the aspects of the PPC campaign. Among these aspects include choosing a profitable keyword or key phrase, creating unique ad copies, testing ads, and keeping track of campaign statistics. Once advertisers have chosen a lucrative keyword or key phrase, they need to develop a compelling ad copy. A well-written ad copy is imperative for any PPC campaign, as it plays an important role in converting visitors into leads and then customers into actual sales. Unique ad copies are also necessary for ensuring success with PPC advertising. Ads that are not well constructed. There are a number of tools available today that businesses can use to manage their PPC advertising campaigns, including software solutions, online reporting solutions, and integrated reporting systems."
7,Massage Therapists - How To Start a Lucrative Business As a Massage Therapist,business," How to Become a Massage Therapist If you love to work with your hands, perhaps you should be in a profession that does exactly that such as massage therapy. In fact, the US Department of Labor has shown in their latest report that there is demand for such professionals until the year 2012. If this sounds appealing to you, then you should know how to become a massage therapist. Those who want to become massage therapists should enroll in a program that is accredited by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork or NCBTMB. To become a licensed professional, you must complete at least 500 hours of training including subjects such as ethics, anatomy, and physiology among others. If you happen to study massage therapy in a school that is not accredited by this body, you will not be allowed to take the national certification exam. This may prevent you from practicing in states that require this prior to employment which is why you should check first if the school you plan to enroll in is in the program. Should you somehow be able to find work without getting a license, you could be penalized with fines and even be banned from every practicing there. The advantage of enrolling in a program under the NCBTMB is that you can apply for federal financial aid if you don’t have the funds to pay for your schooling.

Are you customer-oriented? Do you really want to help the patient? If your answer to all three questions is yes then the next thing you have to do is check what specific interests do you have.

8,Electrical Remodeling Tips By Electricians in Santa Barbara,business," When homeowners think about remodeling their home, the plumbing and electrical system are often not the first things they will think of. Most likely they will avoid any electrical work if they can. People like to wait until something breaks to fix it. But how often should an electrical panel and wiring be upgraded? That is a very difficult question to answer. Basically, it depends on a lot of factors. It depends on the quality of the materials used, the skill of the electrician, not “cutting corners”, the quality of the materials including the panel and the wiring, and the use by the homeowner. Even the weather. For example, big countries such as Australia and the United States have different climates within them. That is one of the reasons why it is a good idea to hire a local electrician. We asked Richard, a trusted electrician in Santa Barbara, CA, when and why homeowners should remodel and upgrade their electrical systems. 1- You see signs of corrosion, rust, heat, or any sound anywhere in the electrical system First and foremost, upgrading the electrical system may be essential to fix certain problems and ensure the safety of your home. If you hear any cracking sounds, smell burning, feel the heat, or see any corrosion coming from the wiring, outlets, or circuit breaker, call an electrician. Adding to that, if your wiring is over 20 years old, you really need to rush that call. These problems are serious, and remodeling is not a luxury, but a necessity. 2- You have an electrical panel from manufacturers who are known for problems Do you know who is the manufacturer of your circuit breaker? The majority of homeowners have no idea and never heard about the risks of living in a home that still has some panels known for problems. If this is you, you should check your panel as we speak. The panels from Federal Pacific Electric (FPE), Zinsco, and Pushmatic are known for big problems, even electrical fires. If you happen to have on the above panels call an electrician to do a replacement as soon as possible. 3- You are going to remodel your home Remodeling your home, especially if doing a big renovation, is a great opportunity to look at your electrical and consider any replacements and upgrades. If you are making changes to the walls, or need to cut holes in the drywall for your plumbing for example, it makes total sense to take the opportunity to remodel everything. Depending of what renovations you are doing, you could save a lot of time, headache, and money if you do it all at the same time. 4- You will be purchasing new appliances which will use a lot of electricity In addition to considering the status of your electrical wiring and panel when remodeling, also check your electricity bill to see how many amps you are currently using. If you are close to the limit that your panel allows, it is a great opportunity to consider an upgrade. This is more common for homeowners who purchased a home before 1990. These are likely to be 100-to-150-amp panels. Nowadays, the standard is 200 amps which allow homeowners to run multiple “heavy “appliances such as air conditioning, dryer, hot tub or sauna, and even a home theater or EV charger. There are many reasons to consider electrical remodeling. You may be forced to do it due to a problem, old wiring, or it just may make sense to save money in the long run and do all the remodeling at once to allow for the current tech lifestyle you wish. Whichever the reason, find an electrician you trust and have them help you with the best plan."
9,SEO Will Help You Increase Brand Awareness in 5 Ways,business," Do you brand or optimize for search? Marketers have a tendency to think in very narrow, exclusive categories, separating their branding and SEO efforts. This causes a misalignment between a company's SEO and brand strategy, resulting in poor results. By combining branding and SEO, you can increase brand scope and boost brand image by generating organic traffic from search engines. An SEO agency can help you build your brand and combine SEO to generate organic traffic. 5 Ways SEO Can Help Boost Brand Awareness Let's begin with a no-brainer. Isn't it true that growing brand awareness entails increasing brand recognition and acknowledgment? Consider the virtual world where SEO reigns supreme. This is where establishing strategic links comes into play. Broken link building, infographic development, and active participation in social media communities are all effective ways to create strong links. When you gain a lot of exposure on sites like Reddit, your brand recognition will skyrocket, and backlinks will inevitably follow. Both the branding and the SEO benefit organically in the end. This is one of the objectives of link building, which is to increase your audience and build your brand. One of the most effective ways to promote your business or brand is by content marketing. When SEO and branding are combined in the form of excellent content, you get a lot of stopping power. To do this, the focus must first and foremost be on the content itself. There's a two-pronged approach to producing great content: satisfy the audience's need for new knowledge while still keeping search engine crawlers happy. If you stick to good SEO practices, your brand can only grow stronger. The basic logic behind keywords is the consumer’s intent when performing a search. These can be summarized as: Navigational – The goal is to get to a specific website, individual, or brand. These are very unique, and the majority of them search for a specific domain (Facebook, Nike, Coca Cola, etc.) Informational – These searches are looking for content that is more common and appears on several web pages (headache cure, laptop reviews, etc.) Transactional – The aim is to find help to complete tasks (subscribe, get, buy, etc.) Commercial – This is your usual, run-of-the-mill search that precedes a purchase (price, description, etc.) The rules of the game are simple: long-tail keywords enable a brand to target very specific audiences that would otherwise be difficult to reach. Longtail Keywords If a company makes custom decorative boxes, it should prioritise ranking high for terms like ""custom decorative boxes prices."" Given that any serious SEO campaign can target thousands of long-tail keywords, you can start creating your own market rather than relying on anyone else's. Instead of simply engaging with your audience, you should enlist their support in building your brand in the modern era. Small companies can use smart keyword research to gain an advantage over the competition and build a hyper-focused brand for the big win by targeting a niche audience. Here's how narrowing down keywords to a niche will help you grow your brand: by narrowing down keywords to a niche, you have a much better chance of engaging with potential customers, interacting with current customers, and successfully targeting your offers. The mantra here is simple: a focused brand is a successful brand. Keyword research can help you dominate your chosen niche. Controlling the brand image is the end boss in the game of brand recognition. You will see a significant rise in sales if you can effectively create a strong brand picture. But how can SEO assist you in gaining more influence of your brand's perception? Optimize the content with the keywords you want to be associated with the most. When your keyword strategy and brand strategy are in sync, SEO can be used to shape brand perception. Also, don’t forget to measure. You will get real-time insight into how your brand is performing by analysing clicks, overall traffic and engagement, and conversion rate as soon as your plan is up and running."

12,These 6 Google Analytics Mistakes Should Be Avoided,business," If you're making mistakes in Google Analytics, don't beat yourself up. Seasoned SEO experts make mistakes too. The good news is that they are easy to spot and solve. Overreporting may be caused by duplicate tags, for example. You might not be tracking conversions or clicks correctly if you have the wrong event or target tracking set up. You may be losing out on which forms of traffic are successfully being directed to your website if you don't recognize individual traffic categories. In this column, we'll go through 7 of the most popular Google Analytics mistakes, as well as how to spot and correct them. You can over-report your data if you have multiple instances of Google Analytics tracking code. Over-reporting can lead to erroneous evaluations of your site's true Google Analytics results. Since you use this data to make decisions, having incorrect data will cause your whole plan to fail. You won't get reliable performance data unless you monitor the correct event clicks. Let's say your users click call button B, which is located further down the page than call button A. On the other hand, you're including tracking code on call button C. You're missing the mark on both call buttons A and B, and as a result, you're missing out on a lot of conversions. You've just started working on a client's website, and traffic is steadily increasing. Is this a sign that you're doing a good job with SEO? Just wait a moment. Investigate the company's IP address by digging deeper into Google Analytics. You can block traffic from your own IP address from Google Analytics if you see it. Inflated visits from your own IP result in more erroneous results. Certain types of advertisement campaigns, such as those on third-party sites like Facebook and Twitter, benefit from the use of UTM tags for monitoring. UTM tags can also be used on advertisements and television commercials (it may be less effective but can be done). How would you guarantee the accuracy of your traffic reporting if you don't ensure the right UTM tags are placed on your ads? Parameter URLs are fine before they are bombarded with traffic and become a nuisance. Due to the high volume of traffic, reports can be hundreds of pages long. Filter out those parameter URLs from your Google Analytics reports if you know they shouldn't be monitored. You will increase the accuracy of your monitoring and build better attribution models for your search traffic by filtering out parameter URLs where they make sense. You're tuning out vital chunk of decision-making data when you neglect individual sources of traffic. For example, if you only look at the surface-level reports (in all versions of GA under version 4.0) under Acquisition > All Traffic > Channels, you’re reporting on all of the channels that Google Analytics reports on. But if you drill down further (for example, into organic search as opposed to direct or social) you can see performance as it relates to organic search traffic. This is a fantastic way to see how your site is doing and whether your SEO expert and you are on the same page. If you need any help with these contact your local SEO company."
13,More content isn't necessarily better for Google rankings.,business," In the SEO industry, the phrase ""content is king"" is frequently heard. Although I agree with that point, it should not be applied universally to every site in every circumstance. In reality, for SMBs and local businesses, too much low-value content may have the opposite impact. This is the situation. Last year, one of our clients struggled to rank with some of their most important keywords. The firm had another company set up hundreds of boilerplate service area pages targeting social security disability terms before partnering with us. Each page was dedicated to a specific city or service area, but the users who visited those pages received no real benefit. The issue. The pages had the following characteristics: Content is very similar. In most of the service area pages, the location was the biggest difference. This is a popular strategy used by businesses who want to target several areas in the hopes of attracting searchers searching for ""keyword + location."" Designed with the aim of ranking in those cities. Since the content was created solely for the purpose of appearing in search results, it did not meet the needs of the searchers. No links. There were almost no incoming links (or internal links) on the individual service area websites, making it difficult for search engines and searchers to locate them. No traffic. Because of the above reasons, the services area pages were not supporting the local business site in any way and may have contributed to cruft. The solution. We decided to remove all of the pages and redirect them to the main social security disability pages on the site because they weren't adding value to the site, mostly due to points three and four listed above. The result. My client saw significant improvements in their local pack rankings for ""social security disability attorney"" within weeks of implementing this strategy. In certain industries and markets, service area pages can be extremely effective. However, before introducing a plan like this one, it's important to assess the impact of the content you're adding to your web. Why we care. When you invest time and money into an SEO strategy, it's critical to have a testing strategy in place that iterates and produces the desired results. Every circumstance necessitates a thorough examination of each customer, their market, and the SERP landscape to decide if they need additional content on their site and, if so, what the best form of content is for the target audience they're attempting to reach. Connect with your local SEO company. Rather than writing and uploading a lot of content without a plan or strategy to back it up, make sure you have a plan in place to develop links to the content — including internal links — and check to see if the pages you've already built are attracting traffic. Connect with your local SEO company to help you strategize your plan. Instead of adding 50 of these service area pages as a first step, it would have been easier to add a few service area pages and see how they do."

Mexican rustic furniture one of my absolute favorites when it comes to rustic furniture is furniture where the wood has been extracted from old barns and stables throughout the flatlands and mountains of Mexico. Some of this wood is well over 100 years old and thereby giving an incredibly unique feel and taste of outdoor natural history. Furniture manufactured in Mexico utilizing this wood produces some of the most incredible rustic furniture available today. Each piece is unique in the fact that the wood itself comes from a much larger piece thereby highlighting the knots and rustic stress cracks throughout the wood itself. Hand forged many of my favorite pieces of rustic furniture also utilize hand forged Spanish iron hardware. By combining Spanish iron hardware with reclaimed wood, the skilled workmen can create unbelievable rustic furniture masterpieces. The iron is hand forged just like it used to be over 100 years ago, although some of the tools have been improved over the years the manufacturing techniques are still basically the same. With each piece being handmade it is extremely easy to look and really appreciate the way these are manufactured as opposed to mass-produced rustic furniture that looks like a good imitation but fake.

3,How to run a Group Action,business," Every year there are thousands of class action lawsuits around the world, some that have obvious merit and requisite compensation required, and then some that are seemingly can only be described as both egregious and vexatious. Most of us are aware of the major class actions of the last few decades, like those brought against the large tobacco companies. And of course, we have seen popular movies like Erin Brockovich or at least tangentially aware of the central legal plot. Essentially a class action is where several parties have the same or similar claim against the same company, and subsequently group their claims together into a single legal action. This is theoretically far more expedient than running each case separately because as a group action many of the core costs are shared across all claims and therefore economy of scale can be realised. Until now these group actions are run manually by deploying large amounts of human resources to meet with each claimant face to face to establish the merits of every claim within the group, to gather any necessary case documents, identity documents, proof of address, power of attorney, authorisation, and any other facts and artifacts necessary to initiate their claim within the group. Additionally an extraordinary magnitude of additional operational resources, such as office space, workstations, computers and IT infrastructure, file storage, transport and telephony. So this initial step is extremely labour intensive and additionally prone to human error, typically causing lengthy delays further along the litigation process, and therefore further increasing already substantial costs. It takes a long time, sometimes years, to gather all the necessary information in order to create, copy and store all the resulting files just to initiate the case, and just getting to the end of this initial claim registration phase is a complex undertaking and a prohibitively expensive process. Unfortunately for the uninitiated, the breathtakingly large bill accumulated to simply get out of the starting blocks. So buckle up and add several blank pages to your existing case budget, because this is where the real fun starts. Given that these group actions are typically only brought against wealthy corporate companies, and the total punitive rewards and pecuniary damages they could be liable for should they lose, normally running into the tens or hundreds of millions, you can be rest assured that the defendant will assemble a formidable and experienced legal team to defend the action. So in this David versus Goliath battle, the defendant's expert legal team's typical strategy is to bully the litigators with their substantial cheque books, and they achieve this by creating sequential obstacles, even based on seeming minutia, but each requiring the litigators to re-focus their resources to operationally deal with each obstacle. This iterative process is terminally disruptive and typically drags the case out for years beyond even the most generous initial estimate. So now your costly resources are deflected, there is very little progress, and no end in sight as you watch your budget burn down toward zero. They will actively drive the costs so far beyond any worst-case case budget, in many instances dragging the smaller law firm under and ultimately into bankruptcy. GMT's Group Action Platform (GAP) solves all the common issues faced when running a group or class action through: comprehensive ""lean-back"" automation, from registration to administration to case close-out; highly flexible, self-service configuration to suite each case requirement; reducing time-to-market (switch a new case on in minutes) reducing costs (operational, logistical and human resources) requiring minimum intervention (maximum automation, management by exception) “Our comprehensive GAP class action management platform is a highly flexible, easy to use, game changing online technology, automating the end-to-end turnkey case management processes, materially reducing both the time and cost, essentially approaching zero.” says Deon Robertson, Technology Director, Group Management Technology"
4,3 Key Benefits of Digital Transaction Management,business," 3 Key Benefits of Digital Transaction Management In recent years, cloud-based services have taken the business world by storm. The benefits are many, from significantly reduced operational costs to improved business efficiency and data security. As a result, more and more companies of all sizes and in all sectors are making the shift towards cloud computing solutions. Digital transaction management, aka DTM, is a category of cloud-based services that allow users to digitally manage their document-based transactions. Digital signing, workflow automation, secure cloud storage, real-time monitoring, and role-based access control are just a few of the functionalities that put DTM software at the heart of digital transformation. Hence, it comes as no surprise that the global digital transaction management software market is expected to reach €14 million by 2027. How can your business benefit from digital transaction management? Companies everywhere use documents to transact business with their customers, recruit and hire new employees, and share information about their business activities and financial performance with stakeholders. Making the shift to digital transaction management can transform the way you manage documents for the best and boost efficiency across your whole company. In this article, we focus on the  3 key benefits of DTM for businesses. Digital transaction management software helps you automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks related to document-based transactions. This minimizes the risk for human error and improves consistency significantly. Let’s say you need to send a contract out for signing. The contract needs to be signed by multiple parties in a specific order. A DTM solution allows you to set up a predefined document route based on specific rules and conditions. Once the predefined route is created, all you have to do is click send and the system does the rest. DTM provides a quick overview of the status of your documents and allows you to set up automatic reminders to make sure all agreements get signed on time. With repetitive tasks being handled by DTM software, employees have more time to focus on the work that matters and provide a better customer experience. Digital transaction management platforms allow businesses to digitize their signing processes and get contracts signed faster. With digital signatures, customers, candidates, employees, and other stakeholders can sign documents and agreements conveniently from anywhere and on any device. By making it easier for customers to sign agreements, you will reduce the number of lost leads and improve contract turnaround time. Providing an effortless, digital signing experience will help you outperform your competitors and close more deals. The cost of printing, storing, retrieving, and filing paper documents represents a significant business expense. Even though paper, ink, stationery, and postage may seem relatively inexpensive, they can easily add up to large costs for your business. On top of that, storing paper documents in-house takes up valuable office space which could otherwise be put to better use. Storing physical records in a secure offsite facility also comes at a cost. Not to mention that it makes it much more difficult to find and retrieve critical documents when you need them. Digital transaction management software securely stores your documents in the cloud so you can easily access and retrieve them in a matter of minutes. The best part? DTM ensures your data is stored in a safe and GDPR compliant way, so you don’t have to stress about it anymore. Say goodbye to legal risks that arise from poor document storage and achieve effortless regulatory compliance. In today’s business environment, digital transformation is a must. And there is no better way to start than by implementing a digital transaction management solution."

9,Title: Covid 19 Stimulus for the Malaysian economy: A consultative role for newly globalized unions to play,business," There is no denying the all important requisite of unions existing and supporting the pillars of a system of social democracy. The existence of trade unions in today’s Malaysia is pertinent to the existence of state sovereignty ; workers rights being a necessary subset in the equation and equilibrium of social union, which is the common fabric holding together the dynamics of statehood. In the realm of decision making of a state albeit in smaller way , trade unions foster and encourage as well as stand as a precedent for such decision making by being an entrenched and well accepted norm or fabric of an associational network of civil society. The decisions that unions make in respect to the interest of the workers in tandem with the needs and the welfare of the state contribute and make clear its role on self determination; which is an essential pillar of statehood. Even the small decisions of such unions help shape the more distant determinations of state and economy. This role is necessarily enhanced in today’s more networked, seemingly borderless and prima facie egalitarian society , bound and evolving in the melting pot of globalization. The problem it seems, in simple words, is the unavoidable clash between the market or market forces/success/relations and/or economic competition policies against the communitarian stand of workers rights. Market imperialism, at its worst could be seen to be a nightmare for workers, albeit a fantasy fulfillment of the capitalist whereby the single mindedness of such imperialism necessarily confronts and compromises fundamentally, the notion of the democratic state ( and industrial democracy ) ; being advocates of privatization and laissez-faire. The ideal of the capitalist here is that of a society where all goods and services are provided by entrepreneurs to consumers. In the idea of just rewards of market success, inequality is a necessary price to pay by the consumers ( and in this case workers) ; such market forces in a capitalist ideal necessitates disorganization of workers, and where workers are not united to voice their concern, they would find themselves as helpless in the marketplace, to the great glee of the proponents of a purist market forces success.  The more successful the imperialism, the greater the inequality. What such proponent perhaps fails to understand is that in Malaysia, being a pluralistic society, fundamentally dictates the necessity of the union being a legitimate member of the associational network of civil society in Malaysia. This makes it necessary and even sustainably wise to consult such a network member; the market again being embedded and entangled in a network of associations, where the forms of ownership are pluralized, ( note the Malaysian society is pluralistic in nature often termed masyarakat majmuk ), in order to legitimize a sustainable set of market relations, which would be a win-win outcome for both sides ; or in the case of a smart partnership, 3 parties namely the worker , employer and the ruling government ) . Recently, many entrepreneurs of small and medium industries ( henceforth referred to as SMEs’) have been called to pay attention and take up the opportunity and direction and leadership given by the launching and implementation of the AEC ( ASEAN Economic Community). The level of awareness amongst SME entrepreneurs in Malaysia, is quite low, including the knowledge about the Silk Road Initiative ( henceforth SRI ) . It is difficult for entrepreneurs to reap any benefit from various agreements and its surrounding circumstances if there is still widespread ignorance about FTAs’ ( Free Trade Agreements), the AEC and ‘SRI’. It is submitted that this is a vital gap and an opportunity for a  role for unions to play as  a consultative body for the best interests of the workers in Malaysia. SMEs’ are found to play an important part of the engine to propel the growth of a national economy such as Malaysia. SMEs’ can help improve the earnings of the workers. There is a need to understand in depth the sectors that have great potential in the economic growth of Malaysia. Fundamentally, the SME plays an important role in the economy; namely to stimulate growth and rise in the economy, to aid in reducing poverty levels and to increase the basic standards of living of the people. An increasingly flat world couples with an internet-set borderless environment seems to , on the face of it, increase and perpetuate the entrepreneurial spirit; a personality which is paid focused attention by the stakeholders of the national economy, predominantly because of the fact that it can be a pertinent driver of the economy without being held back or curtailed by details such as fixed working hours or other constraints of the ordinary working personnel. A sustainable partnership between the Government, employers and unions/workers is essential in todays globalized world. The role of the Government as a protector and provider of the people, and in this case, workers cannot be underestimated. The metaphor of a smart partnership is being widely used here as an attempt to describe an objective of securing better co-operation and therefore competitiveness through power sharing. This is especially important with regard to the SRI, the public being generally unaware of the full ambit and details of the said agenda. Unions can play an active role as a tripartite partner with regard to the education of workers about the TPPA. Where a business or a service depends heavily for its success on its employees exercising their discretion intelligently, using all its skills and knowledge, the advantages of achieving co-operation through consultation and management by agreement become greater. It is the humble submission of the author that sustainable globalized unions  with its unique and very experienced industrial relations leaders  and the special officers in the same organization are equipped to deal with the various implementations and re-education of the workers with regard to the ‘SRI’. The social knowledges’ in a political economy such as justice, otherwise in economic terms known as production in view of the common good, arise when peoples ( here, in the context , the SMEs’) ; bringing their own particular experiences to bear, actively co-operate and communicate in response to the common experience of a dynamic trade melting-pot to which the SMEs’ are exposed to, in view of recent developments such as the ‘SRI’. In general, the Malaysian SMEs’ are unique beings in a culturally diverse multiracial space; brings about a commons that is both interesting and diverse , so as to inform such industries as the SMEs’ that if this need of common good is addressed, the SMEs’ would finally gain an edge in the realm of competition ; albeit in its own form and right. By exercising the approach stated above, there would be a sustainable and enviable relationship of laws to businesses in Malaysia. Joseph Raz  a prominent philosopher in both Kant and Mill’s theories sums up the combined position of the best of both worlds in the following four precepts or principles for the business world namely: i) people’s lives are successful and fulfilling to the extent they are spent in whole hearted and successful engagement in valuable activities and relationships , ii) for most people today, autonomy is arguably an important if no the most important component of living a good life , iii) moral pluralism is favourable and iv) governments have a duty to promote  the well being of people. Such unions are well aware of these fundamental precepts in labour laws and principles and is well equipped to look into the matter as to how to implement reform in a form or application/implementation  suitable for the welfare of the workers."
10,The new Malaysian Companies Act and Covid 19 challenges to small and medium enterprises,business," THE NEW MALAYSIAN COMPANIES ACT 2016 – a growth stimulus for SMEs’to meet challenges of covid 19 factual circumstances. SMEs’ are found to play an important part of the engine that propels the growth of a national economy such as Malaysia. SMEs’ can help improve the earnings of the workers. There is a need to understand in depth the sectors that have great potential in the economic growth of Malaysia. Fundamentally, the SME plays an important role in the economy; namely to stimulate growth and rise in the economy, to aid in reducing poverty levels and to increase the basic standards of living of the people. An increasingly flat world coupled with an internet-set borderless environment seems to, on the face of it, increase and perpetuate the entrepreneurial spirit; a personality which is paid focused attention by the stakeholders of the national economy, predominantly because of the fact that it can be a pertinent driver of the economy without being held back or curtailed by details such as fixed working hours or other constraints of the ordinary working personnel. I)The New  Malaysian Companies Act  – introduction for SMEs’ role play The previous Companies Act 1965 underwent a rigorous change process to keep up with modern business expediencies in the form of the Companies Act 2016 (Act 777). The said Act was passed at the Lower House (Dewan Rakyat) on the 4th of April 2016; and passed by the Upper House (Dewan Negara) on the 28th of April 2016. The Act came into force on the 30th of January 2017 ( save for section 241 and Division  8 of Part III). The objectives of the new Act is said to be two fold namely : to accord sustainable protection for not just directors but all other stakeholders of a company , as well as to provide an up-to-date regulatory legal skeleton to better enable business start-ups that involve small and medium enterprises ( SME’s). II) Malaysian Companies Act  and SMEs’ – a hindrance or aid to SMEs’? There is no clear or rather obvious pigeon – hole characterized answers as to what is. It would rather be premature or even dangerous to attempt a generic definition of what is or what should be the role of the new Companies Act 2016 with regard to SMEs’. There are many schools that attempt to answer this question, with various and often contrary viewpoints and outcomes. For example, the Austinian school equate law with force; commands or orders backed up by a ‘sanction’ (a threat of harm) in the event of non-compliance with the command. This ‘black –letter’ approach is equated with the narrow study of legal rules, a perhaps traditional or even gothic  semblance of what the laws could or should be in its proper context especially when set within a practical arena, the social context,  or in better words for the relevance of this assignment , the business context. To ensure that laws that govern businesses are best or equitable, the main question that needs answering is ‘what is that makes law into good law for the business context?’ It is necessary at this juncture to limit the scope of argument, lest it is impossible to discuss all ramification within a succinct assignment; that the limits be set only to tarry along the common law. The origins of common  law  , being rooted in Roman Law and the medieval writ of system of English Law presented law as a series of individual problems or disputes to be given specific answers .Laws are connected to business or businesses in various contexts; such as rules of civil liability for accidental and/or intentional infringements of other people’s liberty and property; legal rules regulating agreements that the court will enforce; and rules governing relationships between owners or original holders of right regarding property and tenants or users who pay monies or other form/s  of consideration for legal use of those rights. With regard to civil liability, primarily there are two schools of thought: one grounded in the economic analysis of law that sees law about maintaining efficiency, and the second emphasizing correctional justice aspects i.e. that law is all about wrongdoers compensating victims for the damage the wrongdoers caused. The same arguments described for civil liability; namely the two schools of thought are also applicable with regard to contractual business disputes. There is an idea in legal theory with regard to property that private property (in other words privately owned businesses) has its origin and form in each person and also in his or her own labour. It is also common to see property referred to, not as an isolated right that stands on its own, but as a “bundle of straws” (bundle of rights, a series of claim-rights and duties generally associated with ownership, but where certain aspects may be subject to alteration in different contexts, depending on the public interests. In light of new laws coming into the picture of the realm of businesses, for example the Companies Act 2016; it is all the more necessary to remind and /or educate the stakeholders involved of a potent and better model of laws to govern businesses. III) Some important provisions for SME’s in the Malaysian Companies Act Section 196 (1) (a) and (b) of the new Act states the minimum number of directors for public and private companies. The idea here of a “Single Member Company” finds fulfillment in that for a Sdn Bhd, a company can be incorporated by a single member and the former can also be the sole director.  Note that for a public company (Bhd) it is similar except for the fact that there need be two directors. This is a great advantage for one-person businesses to convert from being a sole trader to a one-person company , because the latter affords limited liability, which is a viable and sustainably shrewd economic advantage for the SMEs’ having a shield from premature closure in the playing field that can come from having unlimited liability. The various technical difficulties faced previously by SMEs’ will be simplified with regard to the incorporation  process; in that previously many forms ( Form 6, 48A , and a copy of Memorandum and Articles of Association) were required, but now all those forms will be merged into a “Superform” process by the promoters or shareholders. The Memorandum and Articles of Association (see s31 (2) and (3) of the new Act) as well as the appointment of company secretary is optional. These effectively increase the transparency and perceived viability of SMEs’ as a whole. Section 19 of the new Act state that notice of registration is conclusive evidence. Section 21(1) and 14(2) effectively removed the archaic stringencies of the old Companies Act 1965 which required that any SME company should adhere to the objects clause in the Constitution of a company to determine what a business can or cannot do. With this restriction removed, the opportunities and flexibility of business scenarios for SMEs’ are greatly enhanced. Of course the only restriction that exists is a logical one, namely that the SMEs’ company concerned should not engage or be formed for unlawful purposes. IV) Conclusion: Companies Act is a viable Social construct for SMEs’ A good way of rebuilding ownership from below is to have more or if possible complete democratization of knowledge; this can be seen to be a doctored version of sustainable socialism; i.e. knowledge being a social product, not a property in any one person’s hands. The question now arises as to how, on practical terms to implement this idea of democratization of knowledge in our economy. It is submitted that where the economy is concerned, the law should not just be a superstructure that protects the upper classes but such production of goods from the SMEs’ should be done in view of the common good as the goal and pivot of all economic law. Such democratization of knowledge, being a third way between sustainable socialism and fragmentation of individual knowledge, characteristic of the market; would prevail over casino capitalism ; as macroeconomic planning would not just rest in the hands of big ideas, but the SME would have a more level playing field in the agenda . The new Malaysian Companies Act  is well equipped to supervise and lead the SME’s enabling them in the process to work together with the Federal Government to build a viable national economy... The SMEs’ would clearly prevail using the concept from the viewpoint of the common good. SMEs’ would be judged of their capabilities for funding from the National Economic Plans as well as the Yearly Financial Budgets using the platform of a work-related productive sphere. This however must not be confused to be an argument for deregulation and more privatization. On the contrary, the black letter of the law in terms of sustainable statutes such as the Companies Act regulation and planning must be held and placed to prevail, guided by a concern for life and the common good."
11,5 Simple & Effective Tips To Spring Clean Your Business,business," Spring is the perfect time for fresh starts and new beginnings — and that goes for your business too. Spring cleaning may normally involve physically cleaning, decluttering, and organising your space, but in business, it can extend to so much more than that. For example, why not declutter your digital files, organise your budget, optimise your processes, and more? With the five simple and effective tips below, you will learn how to spring clean your business in easy and impactful ways. You can help your business from the inside-out, improving and refining inner workings such as processes, budget, and workplace culture, through to outward-facing areas such as reputation, accreditation, and outreach. Read on to discover where to start when giving your business a spring clean, and watch your business grow and thrive as a result! An important first step in spring cleaning your business is to revisit its crucial core elements — especially budget and processes. Your budget should be as flexible and adaptable as possible. It should be easy to maintain, and most importantly, regularly reviewed. Otherwise, it is easy for costs to creep up and for the business to become unprofitable. You can use this as a time to assess exactly how and where your business is spending money, and assess whether you are receiving enough benefit from these expenses. Perhaps there is one area of outreach or advertising that is working well, for example, and another that is weak. Maybe it would be a better decision to invest more in the effective area, and stop paying for the other. Depending on the size and scale of your business, budgets and processes can quickly become overwhelming and time-consuming — especially if they need to be regularly reviewed. This is a great time to embark on our second tip, getting a fresh perspective from a knowledgeable professional. No matter how experienced and accomplished they are, the best entrepreneurs know when others know better! They enlist the help of experts, specialist advisors, and those with specific skillsets, on a daily basis. A great way to update and upgrade your business is to do the same. Identify the areas that you most want to improve or seek advice on — such as processes, budget, or advertising, for example — and enlist the help of an expert. Many companies rely on copywriters with experience in search engine optimisation, for example, or bid and tender professionals who can identify the best opportunities and help to win more work for their business. An expert professional can help you to gain an overview and see the bigger picture in your business, or else home in on the fine details and the specialist support that they can provide. Rather than trying to learn and execute everything yourself, rely on the knowledge and experience of others, thereby growing your business as a team — whether as a one-off consultation or a more sustained, regular collaboration. Select the areas of your business on which you wish to focus, then research and reach out to the best professionals who can help. A spring clean of your business should also involve the help of your team. Now is a great time to discuss your ideas and goals with them, and to get their input. Not only is this a great way to gain additional insights on where your business might be thriving or underperforming, but studies also show that employees who feel involved and consulted are more likely to be invested in the outcome, and in the business overall. Additionally, seeking the opinions of your team and genuinely trying to implement their advice, suggestions, and preferences is a great way to foster a strong team dynamic and grow the business organically. The best leaders are not only concerned with what their employees can do for them, but also what they can do for their employees. Make an effort to foster a workplace culture that is inclusive, communicative, and mutually supportive. Your business will soon reap the rewards of a happy workforce, with increased productivity, better employee retention, and faster growth! A great way to upgrade the inner workings of your business — as well as its image and public reputation — is by seeking official accreditations and certifications. Certifications and accreditations are a great way to instantly communicate your legitimacy, experience, and trustworthiness to your potential clients. They help to show that you are fully up-to-date with all the necessary safety protocols and procedures, for example, and that you have undertaken the relevant checks, examinations, and more. An accreditation or certification can communicate all this with just a simple logo or 'stamp of approval'. In a competitive marketplace, more customers than ever are seeking the fastest and most reliable ways to decide which company to purchase from. A trustworthy stamp of approval or accreditation could therefore be the difference between standing out from your competitors or slipping under the radar of your customers. The best choices of accreditation will depend on your industry and sector. Respected accreditations in construction will differ from well-known certifications in accounting, for example, but both would serve the same function as a great way to immediately demonstrate your expertise to potential clients and customers. Whatever the time of year, be sure to regularly assess your business goals and whether they still align with your overall values and vision. This might include factors like your working hours, workplace culture, as well as the growth you want to see for your business in the next few years, the problems you hope it will solve, and the customers you want it to serve. As a business evolves, so too does its owner. Schedule regular and methodical times to take stock of your progress and evaluate your next move. This way, you can be sure that both you and your business are progressing in ways that always align with the principles, goals, and lifestyle that you value!"
12,How First Corporate Clothing Helped During A Time Of Crisis,business," It's fair to say that a little over a year ago the world changed in a way that made how businesses operate so profoundly different to what came before that many of us were expected, at the drop of a hat, to adapt and survive. The pandemic affected not just how our businesses operated but how we thought about business as a whole. Suddenly there was the expectation not just to change our mode of working but to do so without suffering from those changes financially. Except that's still not the whole story. For over 20 years First Corporate Clothing has been designing and manufacturing corporate branded clothing and corporate wear here in the UK. The fine quality fabric and smart, comfortable designs have been a part of the hospitality, travel and health care industries for more than two decades and First Corporate has been proudly tailoring away from the small coastal town of Port Talbot. They've been proud to ""Make it in Great Britain"" because this allows them to manufacture, store and ship to the UK quickly. This also put them in a prime position to help when Covid-19 suddenly forced us all to start being cautious about spreading the virus. When lockdown was first initiated in March 2020 the UK was taken almost completely by surprise. Cases rose so quickly and widespread panic caused shortages of some of the most basic of products. Volunteers needed to step up and help the NHS cope under a surge in nationwide cases left them buckling under the strain. Masks needed to be provided to people who were required to keep calm and carry on working while many of us were forced to stay at home. This is where First Corporate Clothing stepped up to the plate. Using the already established modes of operation that have allowed them to design and manufacture the uniforms necessary for the health care industry First Corporate Clothing were able to focus on providing the uniforms and PPE so desperately needed for the influx of volunteers. They were also able to start to manufacture cloth based masks that protected people from the spread of the virus, especially those working with those who are most vulnerable to its effects. Being able to help during a time of crisis once again made First Corporate Clothing proud to ""make it in Great Britain""."
13,A Newbie in the Freelancing World,business," As a beginner in this field of Freelancing, there’s excitement, struggles, and an unending learning process in every lesson. These three are just what I encounter as a newbie in the freelancing world as of this time. I’m still in the process of growing about being a freelancer. Excitement, because I am able to test myself with the things I thought I can’t do but I can, in a slow phase but at least still going. Struggle, in every lesson/activity, struggling to finish it on time. Struggling to focus on what needs to be done, struggling to be consistent, and doing it without thinking negatively. Learning every day. This phrase is just so common, or let say the basic one that we also do in our daily lives. We keep learning, we never stop learning. Starting in the World of Freelancing I may say that my freelancing journey started when I enrolled through FVA (Filipino Virtual Assistance). Though I can’t fully say that I’m a certified freelancer yet, but being one of the students in FVA I gain more knowledge about this field, the Freelancing World. And I know there’s more learning or knowledge coming on my way. While other students sharing their winning moments like being hired while still taking the course, getting clients, it inspires me more to do good. I really want to enhance more skills though sometimes it feels so unlucky being rejected. Being almost scammed while trying to apply, sometimes belittled by others. But I guessed that’s just part of growing. As one of our coaches said, apply and apply, no one cares if you failed as long as you didn’t give up. Rejection is a way for the right direction of being a newbie in the freelancing world. And I will remember that until one day I will be able to call myself a Certified Freelancer."

Shocking! A: What motivated you to write books? Besides books do you also contribute to the media? If so, in which format? I learned that you have also heart-touching poems and you have a passion for singing also. Can you tell us a little more about these passions? M: The motivation behind the quest to write books came about when I felt a need to alert and warn and steer people in a direction of peace and tranquility with words of caution. I love people and consider myself their keeper on earth no matter how bad things may look! Yes, we submit close to 3k promoted and tracked event notifications nationwide monthly. I was walking in a grocery store at midnight singing to piped-in opera music when the artistic director for south bay opera came around into the aisle and heard me. He asked me if I was singing and I said yes. He handed me a business card and asked me to call him for an opportunity to sing in the production…cosi fan tuti. I raced home and the next day I was in his studio with a 300-page opera score. I had to learn Italian within 2 weeks and there I was in peasants clothes on stage. I ended up becoming the managing director of his opera company. I learned to speak, write and sing in all the major languages, and until COVID-19 Pandemic hit the universe, sung sacred classical songs in churches across the state. Now that they are re-opening that again will be my give back.

15,Bitcoin Arbitrage For Beginners. What Is It And How To Make A Profit?,business," Despite global pandemic and economic issues, the desire of people to make a profit on digital assets doesn’t diminish. On the contrary, many are getting more interested in cryptocurrency. Have you ever heard about crypto arbitrage? What is Bitcoin Arbitrage? Before starting an explanation of what crypto (or bitcoin) arbitrage is, let’s have a look at the word “arbitrage” itself. Cambridge dictionary defines arbitrage as “the method on the stock exchange of buying something in one place and selling it in another place at the same time, in order to make a profit from the difference in price in the two places.” Accordingly, bitcoin arbitrage is the process of buying bitcoins on one exchange at a low price and selling them in another exchange where the price is higher. Just like there are different foreign currencies and currency exchange offices, there is also a bitcoin exchange which is a digital marketplace. The price for bitcoin on each cryptocurrency exchange can be different, and this is where the arbitrage phenomenon originates from. The reasons why many are willing to try crypto arbitrage: Speed and profit. If everything goes well, you might increase your capital quickly. Over 200 exchanges, hence, ample opportunities. Less competition compared to traditional markets. Bitcoin price differences often range from 3% to 5% and can be much wider in some extreme cases. Possible Barriers to Bitcoin Arbitrage Crypto arbitrage is still not as easy as it sounds. It’s a complicated process and involves certain risks. When arbitrating you may experience the following problems: The price of cryptocurrency may change while you’re waiting for transaction verification. Yes, it takes some time. If you are trading a large number of bitcoins, the verification process will be considerable. The exchange process is not free. Transaction fees may influence the expected profit. The transaction volume must be high enough on each exchange, or you may not be able to sell all the currency you bought at the cheaper exchange. Traders need to research the exchanges before actual trading. Some exchanges with low prices may have technical or trust issues. Where Does Bitcoin Price Come From? Normally, the price of cryptocurrency is determined by the last trade occurred on the exchange. There are many bitcoin exchanges, and each of them has a different number of buyers and sellers with various preferences, so exchanges a priori can’t have a fixed price for digital assets, but there is an order book – a list of all the prices that other people are willing to buy or sell the assets for. Another factor that influences the value of digital coins is the news and global events. For example, last October bitcoin jumped from $7,400 to $10,332 only within two days. Why? Many cryptocurrency market analysts attribute this sudden change to the speech given by China’s President Xi Jinping on October, 25. Although cryptocurrencies were banned in China since 2017, President Xi stated that the country “should seize the opportunity of blockchain technology”, “must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.” As a result, Chinese cryptocurrencies began to rise in price. How to keep up with the news, track the best opportunities on the bitcoin market, react quickly, and make profitable transactions? It’s possible to do it manually, but arbitraging is about speed and fast decisions. Thereby, you will compete with bots and you may need one for yourself. Otherwise, you are out of the game. Arbitrage Cryptocurrency Bot Arbitrage cryptocurrency bot is a tool that assists you in making a profit through arbitrage trading. They surely make your work easier. This bitcoin arbitrage software often provides statistical calculations to search for your potential chances; some bots study your profile and show risks that you may encounter while investing in the exchanges. Many bitcoin arbitrage bots are available on the crypto market, and they may have different key features. Generally, there are two kinds of bots: the cross-exchange arbitrage cryptocurrency bot and the triangular or cross-asset bot. The first one checks price differences on top of different exchanges, and the second one – on top of one exchange. Such automated option is in high demand, however, risks are also there. Those who choose to apply arbitrage software must be careful as there are many scammers ready to deceive traders. Crypto arbitrage process explained So you’ve decided to try your hand at trading. What do you need to do? Step 1. Analyze and choose the most convenient and profitable crypto exchanges. Take into account that verification on some exchanges might take several weeks, and a specific minimum deposit is often necessary to begin trading. Most exchanges will also ask you to pass KYC/AML. It’s better to register, verify, and fund your accounts in fiat and cryptocurrencies on numerous exchanges. Once you start trading, it will save you time. Step 2. Before trying: do as much calculating and planning as possible, evaluate the fees or wallet costs, consider withdrawal and transfer time, market volatility, rules, and conditions. Depending on the country’s legislation, some profits may be taxed. Step 3. Find crypto arbitrage opportunities by tracking the price of cryptocurrencies on different exchanges. Bitcoin arbitrage bot serves this purpose as well. Step 4. Take action: continue your trading process or wait for another chance. As you can see, this process requires a lot of your efforts, knowledge, investment, and a developed strategy. If you decide to join this cryptocurrency race, with the assistance of bitcoin arbitrage software, your chances definitely increase. Take into account all the recommendations, do everything correctly, and you will become a worthy player of the cryptocurrency market."

19,Starting an Online Business from Zero,business," Starting online business is not an easy feat. Many things need to be considered, from selecting a product to sell online to building your presence online. Here is a step by step guide to help you establish a business online easily. •	Find a Need and Fill It This step needs to be approached systematically. To find a business idea, you must first identify the problem that needs to be solved and then think about solving that problem. On identifying the problem, figure out whether people even care for the solution to that problem. On identifying the problem and ways to solve it, the next step should be to study how the competition solves that problem. This step involves studying the feasibility of your business idea, and the best way to do this is to answer the following questions: Size of Potential Opportunity- The best business opportunity comes from products that have repeat purchases. The market size might be small for some products, but the product's price is high, and the repurchase rate is also high, then it will also be a lucrative opportunity despite the small market size. The Trajectory of the Market- If you want your business to grow and last forever, it is important to understand the market's trajectory and not just the current state. Study the demand for the product and analyse whether the demand falls into a fad, trend or has a growing and stable market. Who is Your Competition- Study how many people already exist in your niche, how you will differ from your competition in solving the problem. If many businesses are competing in your niche, it implies huge demand exists for the niche, and you must have a competitive edge over your competitors to capture market share. •	Define Your Brand Identity The next step is to choose a business name and a domain name. You get an added advantage if your business name and domain name are the same, as it is easy for your customers to remember only one name. Also, get a nicely designed logo for your company as it reflects your brand's personality. Focus on the colour scheme, fonts, typography, and graphics to have a consistent brand personality across all online mediums like your website, social media accounts, and the offline world. •	Design and Build Your Website Once you have nailed your product and designed your brand identity, the next step is to build a website for your business. A website acts as your 24/7 salesmen. Make sure it has a user-friendly interface and a clean design. It must be easy to navigate and has a consistent look and feel. You have a few seconds to grab the visitor's attention; if they find the web design complicated or confusing, they will immediately abandon the site. Your website is your online store, so make it responsive and mobile-friendly. •	Using Search Engines to Drive Traffic Organic and paid advertising are the two ways to drive traffic to your website. Organic methods include SEO and content creation, which are slow in generating traffic, but once your content starts ranking higher, you will get consistent traffic. Creating free high-quality content will help you establish yourself as a leader and get you more traffic. Pay-per-click or PPC advertising generates traffic immediately, but as soon as you stop advertising, the traffic also stops. You should use a mix of organic and paid methods to generate traffic on your website. •	Upselling and Back-end Sales As per facts, people who have once purchased from you are more likely to repurchase from you if you follow up with them. Approach your existing customers with promotional offers, and they are more likely to make a purchase again. These are the basic steps to start your online business, and following these steps will help you lay a strong foundation for your online business."

1,How to Stay Away From Scam Products or Programs in Order to Become An Authority Blogger in Your Niche,business," An Authority blog is a place where people look up to for information. An authority blog is considered to provide authentic and correct information about the niche or a product/ service. It gives detailed content and valuable information to the readers. Today, the Internet is full of bloggers and to stand out and be an authority is something that cannot be achieved overnight. There is no secret formula to establish yourself as an authority in your industry. Understanding your audience and consistently providing them with high-quality content is what can make you a leader in your niche. To be an authority blogger, you must build trust with your followers. It would require you to provide your audience with relevant information that creates value for them. You need a strong content marketing strategy for this in place, and you have to ensure that you remain away from any kinds of fraud or scam products or programs. If you promote or recommend something fishy, you immediately lose the trust of your audience and put your credibility at stake. Publishing high-quality content that solves your readers' problem will help you in establishing yourself as a credible and go-to information source over a period of time. If you publish anything that sounds scammy or fraudulent, you tend to lose your credibility in minutes. So, before writing a review or any content about a product or service, it is best to try it yourself and be sure about its quality and performance before you write a blog about it. An authority blog means you have a highly engaged audience. A high number of followers and a highly engaged audience result from sustained time and effort. Once you have authority and an engaged audience, you want to monetize your blog, and for that, you collaborate with brands. Working with brands and doing product collaborations is not only a great way to earn money, but it also helps you in growing your audience and building relationships. Be mindful about your product collaborations, and go for the ones that seamlessly fit into your niche. Any other sponsored content would come as a blatant advertisement and turn off your visitors. No blogger wants to lose the steady flow of traffic, and for this, avoid spammy collaborations or any collaboration outside of your niche. Conduct research about your target audience and find out their taste and preferences so as to understand what your readers want. This will help you in forging brand collaborations your readers will appreciate as they will get something useful and of value out of the partnership. In order to establish trust with your audience and to be on the right path of being an authority blogger, you must be careful about the products you advertise on your blog. The products should not be spammy. A spam product is a product that does not fall into your niche or is irrelevant to your audience. If you are a food blogger, you can write content about recipes, food ingredients, utensils, etc. The moment you stray away and talk about mobile phones, your audience will see it as spam. Promoting products that are spam will cost you your audience and result in a poor conversion rate. It takes time to establish your authority and build your reputation. To retain your authority, you need to publish high-quality content without being spammy or salesy. Be consistent and engage with your audience on a regular basis to build a strong relationship with them. To monetize your blog, collaborate with brands that can provide value and quality to your audience and fits into your niche."
2,Advantages of laser cutting in the business world,business," What does laser Cutting mean? Laser cutting is a thermal separation method by which a number of different materials(metals and non-metals) can cut efficiently, quickly, and precisely, and without reworking. A laser cutter is a computer-guided beam capable of precision cutting virtually any shape. Laser cutters are high-tech machines that factories use to cut apart metal parts.

Before you are able to laser cut a piece, you need to decide what type of material you intend to use and which cutting geometry to use. An image is created in software programs such as CorelDraw, Autocad, and Photoshop on the computer, and the raw data is sent to the laser cutter via a print command. For example, an acrylic plate is placed on the processing table and the start button is pushed. The material does not have to be clamped, and nothing has to be modified at the device. Almost anything can be done on a laser machine. After the process is complete, the workpiece can be removed - without reworking. How does the laser cutting device work? During operation, the laser head captures an image and cuts out the design. If the laser does not impinge on the material with enough power, only one coating is removed (thus laser engraving). The laser beam passes through the material when its power is increased. It is not necessary to rework acrylic to achieve flame-polished cutting edges. Lasers can cut a wide range of materials, including acrylic, wood, laminates, films, signs, paper, and much more.

7,Top Central Air Conditioner Comparison for 2021 Summer — Trane vs Daikin vs Mitsubishi vs Carrier,business," Compared with traditional split air conditioners, whether central air conditioners are good or not for home use is an ongoing hot topic online. Either on major search engines Google or Bing or on home appliances forums, people are always tireless in the pursuit of the answer. It is an indisputable fact that air conditioning has been changing from traditional split type, cabinet type and wall-mounted type to the family central air conditioner. It is not so much a family change in the history of air conditioning as a transformation of the times. As the summer of 2021 is approaching, we will compare several mainstream brands of central air conditioners as a reference for this summer’s decoration. 1.Market share 1.1 Trane As of 2021, Trane air conditioner has the largest market share in the United States. The brand of Trane central air conditioning for home use was born at the beginning of the last century. After a century of development, the achievements of the Trane central air conditioner are obvious to all. In 2019, with a sales volume of 5.89 billion USD, it ranked third across the world. At present, as a high-end central air conditioning brand, Trane has become one of the world’s largest manufacturers of air conditioning equipment. At present, Trane is the world’s largest supplier of heating, ventilation & air conditioning (HVAC) and building automation management systems. Every 24 hours a day, every minute, somewhere in the world, there is a Trane air conditioner installed. Trane has become one of the most famous central air conditioning brands in the world, with a brand value of 10 billion US dollars. Trane mainly provides small household air conditioners and large water chillers. The water system of Trane central air conditioner is known as the best brand in the industry and has a market share of 16% in the mature American market based on 951 customers’ votes on PickHVAC. 1.2 Daikin With the critical COVID-19 epidemic going on, the market analysis report of the central air conditioning industry in 2019 was released, and it added a shadow to the industry. “Electromechanical Information — Central Air Conditioning Market” shows that under the combined influence of many factors, the annual central air conditioning market fell by 3.61% compared with last year, ending the growth trend that lasted for many years. Despite the poor market environment, Daikin, as the pioneer of household central air conditioning, still had an excellent market share of 23.15% in the multi-split air conditioning marketplace as an overseas brand. To analyze the reason, it’s partly because that Daikin is the industry pioneer for a long, but more importantly, Daikin has always been adjusting its pace according to the changing market competition. In various industry reports published one after another, Daikin is firmly in the №1 place in the multi-split air conditioning market, and its market scale far exceeds that of other brands. As a company with nearly 292 production factories and subsidiaries all over the world, overseas sales account for more than 70% of the total sales of Daikin. Daikin is taking Japan, Europe, China, Southeast Asia, North America, etc. as the axis to develop its business, and is actively exploring the markets of emerging countries. According to different characteristics of countries and regions in the world, Daikin is carrying out localized operations in line with local development, striving to be able to cooperate with local enterprises and governments. Its aim is to become a global enterprise with sustainable social development. 1.3 Mitsubishi Mitsubishi takes a multi-brand strategy, with its three sub-brands: Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Haier and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Air Conditioner occupying three positions in the sales ranking. In fact, the market share of the 3 Mitsubishi brands in total has exceeded that of Toshiba, which occupies third place. Looking at the global market, Mitsubishi Electric is the boss of the central air conditioning industry. Seeing its influence and sales worldwide, Mitsubishi Electric is the №1 international brand. Its markets include Japan, Europe, America and all the rest countries in the world. Without any doubt, we can say that Mitsubishi focuses on the whole world. In the Asian market with a huge user base, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Haier has launched the residential air health solution, and its leading technologies and products are highly sought after by consumers. At the same time, in terms of engineering projects, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Haier signed strategic agreements with well-known real estate developers, further enhancing its market share in the real estate field. 1.4 Carrier Carrier is the world’s largest supplier of HVAC and refrigeration equipment. The founder of Carrier company, Dr Carrier, developed the first air conditioner in 1902. He is recognized as the father of air conditioner in the world. The company later invented the world’s first home air conditioner in 1926 and the first home central air conditioner in 1952. In 1911, Carrier invented the principle of Temperature and Humidity, namely the “Enthalpy Humidity Diagram”, which is still widely used in college textbooks. In different historical periods, skyscrapers and other large buildings and household air conditioners are all provided by Carrier. Many buildings around you, such as airports and subways, are mostly installed with Carrier air conditioners. In North America, Carrier central air conditioners and Trane central air conditioners usually take either NO1. or NO2. in the marketplace, repeated in turns over the past years. 2.Brand history The brand is the soul and lifeline of an enterprise. It is forged through the unremitting efforts of several generations. It is a core indicator of whether an enterprise can win and develop continuously, so is the brand of household central air conditioners. 2.1 Trane Trane is the world’s leading provider of indoor comfort systems and combined HVAC solutions, headquartered in Wisconsin, USA. Since its establishment in 1913, it has been committed to providing customers with efficient and energy-saving heating, ventilation and refrigeration air-conditioning systems, services and spare parts, as well as advanced building automation and financial solutions. Trane has branches in more than 100 countries, 29 production factories around the world and more than 29000 employees. As a member of Ingersoll Rand Group (IR), Trane’s philosophy is to create and continuously provide a safe, comfortable and efficient environment for the world. 2.2 Daikin Since its start in 1924, Daikin has been growing and developing, and now has more than 90 branches in Japan, mainland China, Chinese mainland Taiwan, Australia, Southeast Asia, Europe and North America. Daikin group has become a multinational enterprise active in air conditioning, refrigeration, fluorine chemistry, electronics, hydraulic machinery and other fields. In particular, it has developed and sold more than 5000 kinds of refrigeration compressors and air conditioners in the world. The market share of its products in Japan has always been the first. Today, Daikin has set up more than 200 production factories and sales companies in the world, with more than 41000 employees. The group is marching towards globalization with unprecedented speed. 2.3 Mitsubishi Mitsubishi group is a loose entity composed of the companies after the disintegration of the former Japanese Mitsubishi financial magnate. In the name of Mitsubishi, “Mitsu” means “three” and “bishi” means “water chestnut”. Mitsubishi is not a single company. It is a group of many independent companies. Most of them use the name “Mitsubishi”, but will not simply call themselves “Mitsubishi”. There are 28 core members of Mitsubishi Kinyokai (also known as Friday Club), about 500 member companies of Mitsubishi, about 400 companies with “Mitsubishi” in their names, and hundreds of companies without “Mitsubishi” in their names. The business activities of these companies are independent and even compete with each other in many fields. These companies originated from a shipping company operated by Yataro Iwasaki in 1870 and then it began to set foot in mining, shipbuilding, banking and insurance, which laid a solid foundation for the growth and development of Mitsubishi in the future. While it is worth noticing that Mitsubishi Pencil is not a member of Mitsubishi. 2.4 Carrier In 1902, when Dr Willis Carrier invented the world’s first scientific air conditioning system, he created a revolutionary industry and changed people’s way of life, work and entertainment. By providing advanced HVAC products and high-quality service to customers, Carrier has developed into a global enterprise with business in 172 countries on 6 continents. The company Carrier, founded by Dr Willis Carrier, the inventor of modern air conditioning, is a global supplier of high-tech HVAC and refrigeration solutions. Carrier experts bring together energy-efficient products as well as building automation and energy services to provide sustainable solutions for residential, commercial, retail, industrial, cold chain, transportation and foodservice customers."
8,A List of Questions Every Entrepreneur Should Ask Themselves,business," A major factor for almost everyone when considering starting a business, especially an online business is, Will I ever find anybody to listen to me, let alone buy anything from me? Well, I can tell you without hesitation, the answer is Yes! But it may take some time, before you actually begin to see some profit. A few questions you need to ask yourself: Do you have the passion for your business? This is the main one, if you don't feel passionate about your business, you may struggle to keep going, when you do eventually get things going, you may struggle to keep going, you may even give up. Passion drives us all, but not everybody has it in them. There are no short cuts to success. Do you know what you are going to sell? In my experience, the best products, services and anything else you offer up front, tend to sell best. It's almost like you don't have a clue what you are going to sell. To prove this point, I am going to tell you a true story. Do you know how to sell? This is very important. There are some people out there who think they know how to sell but in actual fact, they don't know what they're doing. If you don't know how to sell, then you don't have a clue what you are going to sell. Do you have a business plan? Believe it or not, many businesses don't have a business plan. It is absolutely crucial. Without a business plan, you can be thrown into court for millions of dollars because you never had a chance to properly run your business and demonstrate to a lender you can manage it effectively. A business plan needs to be done correctly. Are you an entrepreneur? I believe any entrepreneur who starts a business without the support and guidance of a mentor, is an entrepreneur who is likely to struggle and possibly fail. Do you have the discipline to do it? You need to have discipline in order to do it. No one is going to take care of everything for you. You need to take care of some things, then hand it over to others. You will need to pay bills, keep account books, make payroll, etc. Have you studied your market? I believe in every entrepreneur's mind they believe they know their market. In actual fact, you know your market but you have never really been able to sell anything to that market. This is something you need to learn how to do. Again, you will need to pay bills, keep account books, make payroll, etc. Are you willing to invest? This is perhaps the most important question an entrepreneur may ask themselves. I believe most people do not want to invest their money because they believe they know what it is worth. You need to learn how to invest your money. This is a very important list of questions an entrepreneur should ask themselves. It is the foundation for a sound, profitable business.  If you are interested in starting, building and growing a current or new business and you can relate to one or more of the questions we posted, you need to check our our website www.businesscoaching101.net.

9,How to select Hot Water Booster Coil and Where Is It Used?,business," Assuming you're in the HVAC business, you've been associated with tasks and establishments that have channel-mounted booster coils. How did the expression ""booster"" begin? Most heating coil applications have a primary heating curl that takes air from the least entering air temperature to an intermediate air temperature. Every individual space has its own heat load, and the pipe-mounted booster coil is the arrangement that considers singular space control. Most conduits are measured for 800 to 1200 feet each minute (FPM) face velocity. This is around 9 to 13 miles each hour (MPH) and gives you a thought of the speed of air as it moves through the air channel. Channels coils for the most part should be estimated between 500 to 750 FPM and require a ""pipe progress"" to have the air slowed down to go through this bigger face area coil. For what reason is this fundamental? There is consistently a supply fan in the system. This fan delivers the whole system air volume (typically estimated in cubic feet each minute (CFM). Assuming you size coils at the pipe size (at the higher speed), the complete static pressure (resistance) will definitely build the functioning brake horsepower to deliver the necessary volume of air. A coil measured at 1200 FPM will have 2-1/2 times the pressure of a 600 FPM coil. When estimating a coil at a higher speed, you consequently have less face and accordingly increment the columns as well as the fins per inch. If you increment the lines toward the air current, another negative is made. You currently need to pump the water through 2 columns rather than one row, and you have expanded the obstruction against the siphon, and it will require more brake horsepower to distribute the water volume in the system. Coming up next are the particular requirements expected to compute a coil: Maximum height and length of the coil Commonly pipes are over a roof and can be in the middle of joists. The curl engineer has to know what direction he can extend the coil to keep the air speed at a sensible speed. Required CFM volume of air Entering air temperature and either wanted to leave air temperature or wanted BTUH load required Entering water temperature and either desired to leave water temperature or desired GPM water volume Entering water temperature and either wanted to leave water temperature or wanted GPM water volume There's a great deal of distinction between a coil determination at 180 degrees entering the water and 140 degrees entering water temperature. There's likewise a huge distinction when the leaving water depends on a 20-degree temperature contrast (Example: 180 degrees in and 160 degrees out) and a 40-degree temperature contrast (Example: 180 degrees in and 140 degrees out). Maximum air resistance (inches of water) Maximum water resistance (feet of water) Spine or slip and drive type mounting Coil construction This will incorporate balance thickness if you need to wash and clean coils and whether you need brazed copper sweat associations or strung MPT associations. There are additionally unique circumstances with booster coils. Here are some of them and what you should reduce issues. Low water stream Low water stream occurs on numerous coils under 500 CFM, on the grounds that the determined water volume (GPM) is low to the point that the coil really creates a ""laminar stream"". This is simply a progression of water so low that it destroys heat transfer. Picture a coil where the genuine water speed falls below .75 feet each second (FPS) and the outcome is a coil without sufficient water along the tube divider. This issue can decrease a coil limit by 75 to 80 percent. Basically, permit the curl specialist to utilize a more modest distance across the tube and the water speed can generally be raised over 1 FPS, and the laminar stream condition vanishes. Air stratification Inconsistent air current across a coil is made when the upstream side of a loop (entering air side) is excessively near a fan or a twist in the ventilation work. A curl's proficiency depends on utilizing the whole successful space of the loop. Air is delivered downstream of a fan in a wavy example, and in the event that excessively near the power source, you can adequately blow the air through the center and lessen the warmth move out and onto the edge of the loop. When coming around a pipe twist, a confound or turning vanes might be needed to have the loop get air appropriately across the successful region. Absence of access Numerous hot water coils mounted in pipes are secured in the channel so firmly that there is no access to the fins and tube surface. We have supplanted a huge number of booster coils throughout the long term, in light of the fact that the fin surface has never been cleaned. It's shrewd to give in any event a hand opening access entryway on one side or the other to clean the loop something like each 4 to 5 years. Messy coil reduces the heat transfer of any coil and unquestionably increments the obstruction and working cost. While you are grinding away – determine heavier blades so the balances will not twist during cleaning."
10,8 Ways To Improve Customer Retention,business," Customer retention refers to the marketing strategies used by a company to maximise the number of returning customers and the profitability of each current customer. Put simply, customer retention is critical for improving the lifetime value of your customers and increasing sales. It's easy to get caught up in concentrating on attracting new customers and conversions, but it's also important to think about your current customers, too. Customer retention is not only cost-effective, but it's also a brilliant branding exercise for inspiring your customers to become brand ambassadors: if they like the service you offer, they'll recommend you to others for free! Read on for our top tips to get you started: Email Marketing. Email marketing is a cost-efficient and effective channel for retaining new clients, and it can be used in a number of ways. Send weekly or monthly newsletters to customers, set up email automation, and reach lapsed customers. Subscriber segmentation allows for more precise targeting and messaging, which can lead to significant increases in open and click through rates. This format can be used to promote new deals, brand changes, or exclusive discounts. Social Media. It's important to remain involved and engaged on social media in order to raise brand awareness and grow your online following. Existing consumers who interact with you on social media, on the other hand, may become strong brand advocates. Creating content that promotes interaction (especially comments and sharing) will help you expand your social media reach and increase your brand's credibility. Create a Loyalty Program. Returning consumers enjoy being acknowledged and compensated, but loyalty schemes, no matter how basic they are, can have a significant effect on customer retention. Customers would feel encouraged to return to your online store if they know they will be rewarded for doing so. ‘VIP’ Discounts. Unexpected discounts, early access to sales, birthday deals, or even a small discount for an item left in an online shopping cart: these are all small but powerful ways to hook consumers and create a memorable experience. Remember that the customer's perception of how they are handled accounts for 70% of the buying experience. A/B Testing.  Experiment with your digital marketing strategy to see what works best for you and where you can develop. To see if customer retention rates improve, use A/B Testing on your email marketing campaigns or on your website. Some businesses find that hiring digital marketing experts like Birmingham Marketing Agency to audit their current strategy can be the most cost-effective way to progress. Enhance Customer Service. Even in our digital world, people still enjoy person-to-person where possible. Research shows that 75% of customers assume that reaching a live agent over the phone or via an online chat takes too long - support systems enable you to connect efficiently with your customers and provide them with the appropriate level of assistance. Take Accountability. Your company's brand is only as strong as its credibility. Admit your mistakes and apologise if possible when issues occur. Honesty demonstrates authenticity, which is particularly important in today's world where brands are expected to take a stand on social issues. It also shows consumers that you're willing to fix faulty systems to avoid errors in the future. Ask for Feedback. Send your customers an online survey to fill out so you can learn more about what's working and what isn't. You'll never be able to please every customer on every topic, but surveys will help you spot trends you would otherwise overlook. A successful survey should include both multiple-choice and free-text response areas, allowing customers to express themselves more fully where appropriate."
11,How Do I Make Money From My Network Marketing Business?,business," Even though Network Marketing has been around for many many years and even decades now, there are some people out there that think it is a well crafted scam. The truth is, the network marketing business vertical stood up in a court of law, when it was legally challenged in the 1980's. However, if you are going to consider a network marketing business, you must consider a few key things such as the company, the marketing plan and the business compensation plan just to get started. There are many companies out there who will tell you that they are the best network marketing company and in that short span of time they might become the best network marketing company but in reality, they will fade away in the next one or two years if they do not get the right support plan and the right training plan for their associates. The main business compensation plan that many companies follow is the binary plan and the reason why many people do not get on the bandwagon is because they can not generate enough leads within their list. After all, the whole purpose of network marketing is to build a list of prospects and build long-term relationships with them. The fact is, people do not care how great the product is, they want to know how it benefits them in the long run. If you want to build a huge and long-term downline, you will have to learn how to make your business profitable within the first six months of starting up your business. However, if you do not have the right skills, you will have to build up your business as a retail business because most people do not know how to generate leads on their own. It is of course critical that you have the right skills and know how to generate leads by the right marketing strategies to build a huge downline. The fact is, most people do not even know how to do online marketing so they will have to learn the fundamentals for themselves. The more you rely on the internet for your business, the more you will see your downline grow exponentially. This is where the online marketing becomes even more crucial because if you do not know how to market online, it will take you a lot of time and effort to try and figure it out on your own. On top of this, most people do not know how to generate leads on the internet either so they will have to rely on the internet for that as well. The biggest point of this is that if you are starting your business offline and you don't know how to generate leads online, you will have to go back to the offline mode to try and figure out how to market online for the first time. So if you want to grow your downline and see a steady flow of income from your network marketing business, you will have to learn how to market online using pay per click marketing, article marketing and blog marketing so you can generate an endless flow of leads into your business.  The time and effort you will have to put into online marketing will save you a lot of time and effort and eventually you will see your network marketing business grow. In recent years we have redefined a few of the biggest headaches that surround the traditional network marketing industry.  One of the biggest traps is that statistically 80% of anyone you prospect, will not be initially interested in your business, the opportunity or the products.  However, they are highly likely to purchase training and tools if they are an option and even more likely if they are approached with this first versus trying to ""sell them"" on any opportunity right out of the gate. If you want to take a look at what we have done take a look at the Simple Business Start-Up Model at https://bit.ly/SBSModel and see just how effective making the smallest change in strategy can exponentially change the results are getting in your  business."
12,Why You Should Promote Recurring Affiliate Programs,business," So, you're an affiliate marketer or on the verge of becoming one. Now what? Well, as soon as you start calling yourself an affiliate, getting some marketing work done is what comes next. Naturally, joining affiliate programs have to be step one of your journey. Which ones, though?  There are so many of them - hundreds, probably even thousands. Why should you choose a particular affiliate program over another one? There are a couple of reasons, but they all come down to the fact that affiliate programs differ from one another. Since you want nothing but the best, let's concentrate on the good ones and what makes them such. Relevance - is the affiliate program you're eyeing at the moment relevant to your audience?  If it's not, promoting it won't make any good for your bank account at the end of the month. Value - is the product you're planning to promote valuable?  Will that product help your readers solve their problems?  If not, you have to look for an affiliate program elsewhere. Payout - does the affiliate payout makes your promotional effort worth a while?  Some affiliate marketing programs will pay you peanuts.  That makes them an undesirable choice if you're planning to earn a living as an affiliate. Recurring Commissions - does your chosen affiliate program offer recurring commissions?  That's probably the one metric to consider when deciding on a program to promote. Here is the deal: The possibility of earning recurring payouts is where you need to direct your attention. Earning repeatedly for the same sales is how you'll build a passive income stream. That's what experienced marketers mean when they talk about making money while they sleep. Isn't making money on autopilot why you're getting into the affiliate marketing field as well? If it's not, maybe you should consider it sooner rather than later. A couple of words to keep in mind about affiliate networks that pay recurring commissions: Try to connect with well-known and respected affiliate marketing programs.  There is a reason why they are the most popular - they have proven themselves over time. Never pay to be able to join an affiliate program. Most of the time, the legitimate networks are free to join. If you have to pay a fee just to become an affiliate, the network you're interested in might not be a legitimate one. On another note - don't overdo it with your promotional strategies. Pushing too hard will most likely have the opposite result. When the product is good, it will sell well without you cutting your reader's throat. And the recurring payouts will keep coming month after month. As long as your prospects find the product valuable and keep using it, your income as an affiliate will always be safe. If a reader decides to cancel the subscription, there is no reason to panic. There are plenty of recurring affiliate programs out there, so just move on to the next one! Keep going down this road, and your passive income will keep growing as well."
13,What Message Are You Sending Your Business Contacts?,business," This morning I was at one of my business networking group meetings and there were a few minutes for a discussion topic. I decided to bring up a couple of pet peeves I have about small businesses and received an unexpected overwhelming agreement from the others in attendance. The first subject I brought up was about how others perceive a business owner and operator that does not have an email with their own domain, but instead uses a generic public domain from a free email service provider. I’m talking about the part of your email that comes after the @ symbol: autoinsurance@GMAIL.com  VS.  autoinsurance@YOURBUSINESS.com Your email is a part of your image and your company’s image. How are we supposed to take you and your business seriously if you are unwilling to invest in your own business? If you work for a major company, they typically provide employees with a corporate email address, but when you own a small business such as a solo practitioner lawyer or CPA, business consultant, or have a single location retail shop, why would you want to advertise anyone’s name but your own? It doesn’t cost a lot of money to purchase a domain each year and Google offers a service to host your email on their platform with your own domain. Additionally, I brought up how I felt it was important to have a professional voicemail on all of your phones, including your cell phone. Many times we give our personal cell phone numbers to our business clients as a way of offering additional value to our client services. Well, I have called many numbers over the years and an overwhelming amount still have a generic voicemail offered by their carrier reading the number I reached, instead of a voicemail personalized to state who I have reached and any pertinent information they want us to know. This is yet another way to professionally make people aware of your business and what you do. Free marketing of your services to anyone who calls and gets your voicemail. Think of it as your own commercial directed to friends, family, clients and business associates. Would you pass up free air time on the radio to your direct market? So as I sit here in my office trying to assist my clients, friends and family in growing their businesses, I urge you to take a few minutes and make sure you have a personalized domain for your business emails as well as verify that all of your voicemails properly promote you and your business effectively. If you don’t have these simple things in place yet, take a few minutes and take the necessary steps to make a few adjustments. I think you will find that others will respond much more positively to you and your business with a simple makeover, and you will find yourself even prouder of the amazing business you have created and grown"
14,How to Start Dropshipping Business Without Expensive Budget,business," Dropshipping has gained popularity as a business model. This business can be started with limited funds as you do not have to handle or stock items you are selling. Dropshipping business model is a great way to earn money as an e-commerce business because this model allows you to sell products without the hassle of managing inventory and has minor risks. Consider these points before starting a Dropshipping business to make it successful: Choose a product for dropshipping after carefully considering the characteristics and features of each product. It is advised to start with products that you are familiar with and passionate about as this would reduce the amount of research required. Check the legal laws to ensure the product you want to sell does not require any kind of license or permit. Some other points you should consider when choosing your niche are: •	Seek Attractive Profits- In a dropshipping model, the focus is always on customer acquisition, marketing, and the hard work involved in selling low-cost items is the same as required to sell a higher-priced item. So, select a niche with higher-priced products that can give you more profits. •	Low Shipping Costs- In dropshipping, the manufacturer or supplier handles shipping, but customers do not favour high shipping costs. So, find products that are inexpensive to ship as this will help you attract more sales. •	Make Sure the Products have Demand and Appeal to buyers- Selling products that trigger impulse buys and appeals to high-income groups will mean a higher conversion rate. Use Google's Keyword Planner and Trends to find out the terms your niche searches. It is important to ensure that people are searching for what you intend to sell. Also, sell something that is not readily available in the market. This will help you attract more customers. •	Create your own brand- Rebranding will add more value to your dropshipping business. So, look for products that you can label as your own with customised branding and packaging. Selling products with little or no competition is a sign that there is no demand for that product. Study your competition to find out products with high demand as selling them will help your business sustain itself. So, study the competition before you begin. Identifying the right supplier requires due diligence. Before zeroing on the supplier, check their production quality and ensure their production is scalable in case your business grows exponentially. Also, pay attention to language issues as most of the suppliers will be located in different countries, so make sure you can easily communicate with them. A supplier can make or break your business, so select one after conducting proper due diligence. There are two ways to do this. First, build your own website from scratch, but this will consume time and will require investment. The other way is to use platforms like Shopify to launch your website; it is fast, and you don't have to be someone with a technical background. The best way for beginners is to use such platforms, and when your business scales, you can have a full-fledged website of your own. You need to have a robust plan in place for customer acquisition. SEO, email marketing, social media ads and other promotional methods such as discounts etc., should be an important part of the customer acquisition strategy to scale quickly and generate sales and revenue. Analysing the data and metrics will help you optimise your website and eliminate unnecessary elements. Tracking data will provide you information about the customer's journey, such as from where it originated, what pages he visited, what led him to make a purchase decision etc. Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel can help you to track the data. With careful research and planning and eliminating potential pitfalls, one can easily start an online drop shipping business."

16,For what reason Does Yelp Filter Reviews and What You Can Do About It,business," As an entrepreneur, you may invest a ton of energy and exertion in gathering genuine and legit online audits about your items and administrations. You probably definitely realize that surveys fuel your online business, and you are intending to give quality client assistance. At that point, something messes up your system. You hear that Yelp, one of the top survey and suggestion administrations, is separating your tributes. Cry has in excess of 100 million special month to month guests across work area and cell phones, which implies there are a great deal of eyes that could go over your business. That is the reason numerous organizations don't care for missing out on those sifted surveys. Why is Yelp separating my audits? What would i be able to improve? Does Yelp have it out for me and my business? These are for the most part regular inquiries, and we plan to answer them in this post. Reasons Why Yelp Filters Reviews: The survey is composed by another client with no profile data The audit is excessively sure or negative The audit is too short to even consider helping different perusers The survey abuses Yelp's rules We are additionally demonstrating how to work out your Yelp presence paying little heed to the audits that get sifted through. Comprehensively online audit the executives programming demo Reason 1: The audit is composed by another client For what reason Does Yelp Filter Reviews - New Users Howl created and actualized a computerized channel that conceals some audit trying to guarantee that solitary the most fair and accommodating tributes are shown. While the objective of the channel is to kill counterfeit surveys or clever audits on Yelp, there are times when authentic audits are escaped see. The principal reason a survey may be covered up is that it was left by another client with almost no profile data. To Yelp's computerized channel, this can undoubtedly resemble a bot or a phony profile. Consider it: When you see anybody's social profile with no photograph and scarcely any posts, don't you see some warnings go up? This is a similar point of view applied to the Yelp channel. One workaround to this issue could be that you help legitimize the audits by including the commentator as a companion or maybe casting a ballot their survey as ""cool"" or ""accommodating."" A little commitment on the survey could assist Yelp with considering the to be as a genuine individual. This abandons saying, yet you ought to never pay anybody to leave you a survey, either. At the point when you pay for audits or purchase counterfeit surveys, they normally come as ""another client"" and will be sifted through at any rate. Reason 2: The audit is excessively certain or negative As indicated by Yelp, it's obviously pretty uncommon for a human to be astoundingly dazzled or neutral with a business. In the event that an audit appears to be excessively sure or excessively negative, the Yelp channel believes it to be phony. Since that may not generally be the situation, it is anything but difficult to get disappointed with the possibility that a portion of your absolute best surveys could be covered up on the grounds that they were excessively certain. Appears as though you're being rebuffed for working admirably, isn't that right? Despite the fact that we can't control the Yelp channel, we can control a certain something: letting family leave surveys. We as a whole realize our mothers are pleased with us, yet here and there that pride goes over the edge on the web. Obviously, your mother will rave about your organization—same with your loved ones. To help lighten the chance of positive audits getting covered up, don't ask your loved ones to leave any. Cry can track down that predisposition from a mile away. Comprehensively online audit the executives programming demo Reason 3: The survey is excessively short With the possibility that surveys ought to be useful, Yelp accepts that very short audits don't take care of business. For instance, a survey that says, ""Horrendous client assistance!"" doesn't give any clarification or educating insights about the visit. To Yelp (and us, frankly), that appears to be somewhat fishy. It would appear that an awful endeavor at utilizing counterfeit surveys to slam business. On the off chance that you can, one arrangement might be to urge commentators to leave definite audits. Maybe remember a short note for your site close to your Yelp page connect or in your Yelp profile. Odds are your clients have no clue about this separating issue and they don't understand their short surveys are being covered up. Just telling them that subtleties are significant (on the grounds that they assist you with improving for the wellbeing of they) could be a decent method to diminish the quantity of audits that are short and unhelpful. Reason 4: The survey abuses Yelp's rules For what reason Does Yelp Filter Reviews - Violates Rules Maybe the most coherent purpose behind a survey to be sifted through from your page, an audit that abuses Yelp's rules won't make it far. The overall rules for Yelp surveys are as per the following. Anything that falls under these classifications will probably be sifted through. Improper substance, for example, adroit language or realistic subtleties Irreconcilable situations, for example, companions or family composing audits. Moreover, as indicated by the arrangement, try not to be legitimately requesting Yelp audits (more on that later) Special substance, for example, advancing your own business on a contender's surveys to attempt to take business Importance, for example, blusters about a business' political belief systems or work works on—anything not identified with the shopper experience is viewed as insignificant Protection, for example, posting close-up photographs of different benefactors without consent, individuals' complete names, or other private data you were not allowed to share Licensed innovation, for example, reordering another person's audit Requesting installment, for example, attempting to extricate installment from a business utilizing your audit as a danger. The main special case is requesting a discount following awful help. Most of these rules are to your greatest advantage as the entrepreneur, but since Yelp's sifting framework isn't human, some incredible, genuine surveys get shadowed in light of the fact that they appear to disregard a rule. Rather than grieving the loss of those separated audits, however, you should keep on being proactive in gathering much more Yelp surveys and maintaining a heavenly presence on the stage. More Yelp Review Tips To keep improving your Yelp presence, there are a few things you ought to do out of sight. You ought to be reliably refreshing your organization data, for instance, as it changes. In the event that you move, include an area, or offer new/various administrations, make certain to keep your page refreshed consistently. Clients are significantly more prone to draw in online with an organization (leave an audit) in the event that they realize the organization will see it. Show your clients how dynamic you are on the web—they will respond that exertion. To add to that point, when you do get another Yelp audit, don't simply let it stay there. Reacting to audits—regardless of whether they are negative or positive—is so significant for your online presence and consumer loyalty. At the point when individuals take the opportunity to help you out by leaving a survey, the least you can do is express gratitude toward them. In the event that the survey is negative, your answer may should be somewhat more nuanced—here are some useful negative audit reaction tips. Obviously, now and then Yelp's channel doesn't find everything. At the point when you do go over an audit on your page that appears to be phony, you can follow a few stages to hail it for expulsion. You should express your case to Yelp clarifying why it disregards their rules, and you should give proof that it is fake. The more data you can offer, the almost certain the audit is to be eliminated. With everything taken into account, Yelp is an unfathomable online audit stage that can truly help your business by method of client reference. The key is, you need to carry on honestly. However long you do that, you ought to have no issue getting astonishing surveys on Yelp… paying little heed to the channel!"
17,Making More Money: Real Estate Investment Tips And Tricks,business," Being good at real estate investing takes a lot of patience and knowledge of how the market works, but in order to do that you need to understand a few basic tips. Thankfully, the article gives you all the basics of how to succeed in real estate. If you want to learn more, then proceed to article below. Speak with a real estate expert to help you with your plan and see whether or not there are holes in your strategy. This will help you to get a good idea of where you stand and what you need to do to accomplish your goals. They may tear the plan apart and give you an alternative plan instead. Don't invest in property that has not been personally inspected by a third-party or neutral professional. A seller might pay for the inspection, but can you really trust them if they use someone they know? Always get a neutral report or a lookover from someone that you personally trust. Location is critical in terms of successful real estate investing. You can always change carpets or the exterior of a home. Do not purchase properties that are in bad areas. Always do your research on a property before investing any money. Search out and speak with other investors. Get advice from people with experience. Their knowledge can prevent you from making mistakes and save you some money. A great way to find some is by using the internet. Read over some online forums and meet like-minded people. When you invest in real estate to rent the property, make sure you're able to get your money back within a reasonable amount of time. If it takes you years to get the money back in rental payments, then it will be hard for you to use the money on anything property related. If you're going to want to do some home projects on your property, then you need to make sure you know what you're doing. When home improvements are done wrong, it could really make your real estate drop in value. It may just be best to hire someone that knows how to fix the problems the property has. Don't think that you always have to pay the list price for a piece of property. A lot of the time an owner will make the price higher than it should be because they expect people to try and negotiate with them. Don't be scared to give them a lower offer because they may just give you that money off. Beware of buying single-family homes in a neighborhood that is full of rental property. Typically, a rental neighborhood is not a desirable location for buyers who want to raise a family. The value of single-family homes in this type of neighborhood will not likely go up very much because of their location. Think about partnering with a company that specializes in property management. It costs money to do so, but the investment can be worth it. They take care of checking out possible tenants and they also make arrangements for necessary repairs. This frees up time to look for more properties. Get along with others. Rather than seeing other real estate buyers and investors as your competition, work with them. In this way, you can share resources and client lists as well as pooling your collection of properties on offer. When you help everyone out, you can get people as clients that are satisfied. This will surely enhance your reputation. The best real estate investment you can make is purchasing and renting out one bedroom condos. Most people that are in the market for a rental property are single may they be young singles, divorced middle-agers or older widowed people. It is not only the easiest property to rent, but also the simplest to manage. Sign up to receive news about foreclosures, this way you can jump a very good deal right away. This can save you time since you won't need to contact lenders, real estate agents, and county courthouses. These are likely to be current so that you can get accurate information. Look for distressed properties at bargain prices. You can often find these well below market value. Buying these and fixing them up can net you big profits. In the long run, you will make a lot more by following the strategy than you would by purchasing homes that need little or no work. Know a little about the neighborhood you are buying in. If you are just looking to buy cheap properties, you may in fact lose money if you purchase a building in a rundown area. Find out as much as you can about the neighborhood before you put any money into a building there, and you may avoid losses. Don't expect to get rich overnight in real estate investment. On the contrary, it may take up to a decade for your investments to really pay off and many new to the business fail to realize this. With some exceptions, you need to be in the position to hold your properties before seeing any major profits. Survey the market often so that you can see when trends are beginnings so that you can get in on chances like that when the opportunity for profit is the best. When you see that there is a demand for a certain type of property, then you know what types of properties you have the best chance of profiting with. If you are thinking about long-term investments, consider buying foreclosure properties. These areas can come back, and those that buy when the market is low can make a lot of money. Remember, however, that it may take a while to realize your gain. As stated in the above article, it really helps to be prepared with great tips when you enter the real estate investing market. It is difficult to succeed when you don't prepare yourself well, but now that you have good solid tips, the sky is the limit! Remember to constantly study investing tips, and keep this information close by whenever you make your next investment."
18,The Best Gifts Are Personalised,business," How To Give Personalised Gifts Any time someone asks for a recommendation about gifting, I have without a second thought, always recommended personalized gifts. Personalization is not only a classic idea but a trendy one too. The goal should be to make every gift given special by including a personal touch. This makes your gift seem more planned, thoughtful and personal. And personalised gifts are perfect for nearly every occasion. Personalized gifts are ideal for lovers, parents, grandparents, siblings, friends, and even kids. Gift giving is certainly a tricky venture. There is nothing that scares me more than giving a gift that is of no value to the recipient, so I try to make it meaningful by looking at several angles. Give A Feeling Not Merely An Item The price tag or size of the gift isn’t what makes it truly important or valuable. In itself, gifting is always an event, giving us a chance of letting someone know how deeply we feel and care about them. The person receiving a personalized gift will value it more because they know you have gone the extra mile to make it special for them. No matter the recipient or occasion, giving a gift should never be done simply because we have to. Rather, it ought to come from the heart, reflecting your relationship with the person receiving. Simply put your heart into it and personalize the gift in a way that conveys your deepest feelings. Give Something Practical Can't figure out what to buy for someone in your family or a friend? When in such a position, I always look for something that is not only unique but practical for their everyday lives. If he drives, why not give a personalised keyring? If they are running a business from the home, a personalised business card could be the ideal item to gift believe it or not. You can assist in helping them look very professional when conducting business! Think About Their Lifestyle Focus on the gift recipient. What kind of gift might be of more use to him or her? Is there a specific kind of gift you know they like but don’t have? Or even a gift they’ve never thought about but you know they would love and cherish? Then personalize the gift to match those traits. For example, both my grandparents are retired and are now enjoying their lives in tranquillity at home. With this hindsight, when I came across a lovely personalized photo gift option, I knew I had hit a jackpot. These were the ideal items to help them cherish memories of their children and grandchildren. My grandfather particularly loves the personalized lenticular flip photo gift I ordered for them, even though at first the effect was a bit overwhelming as he'd never seen it before, but once he got used to seeing it on the wall he completely loved it. My Final Word When looking for the perfect gift, I recommend a gift that is not only practical but personal. It doesn’t have to be expensive. Let the gift speak your feelings. The personal touch is what gives value to the gift."
19,5 Reasons To Move to Digital Documents,business," Recent global events have accelerated to move to digital. Businesses across all industries are starting to digitise their documentation. Let’s take a look at some of the motivations that have driven businesses towards digital solutions and explore how digital documents can drastically improve your business’s performance, saving valuable time and money. Scale Many businesses struggle with information management, with paper documents being difficult to scale, it’s hard to keep things organised. Teams are consistently being asked to do more in less time and how your business spends its time is paramount to its success A typical employee can spend on average, 1.8 hours per day looking for information. Over 9 hours a week. This means that for every five people on the payroll, only four are actually able to focus on their jobs. Imagine having that time back? What if you could have all your business-critical documents available at your fingertips. Now imagine those digital documents in an organised and structured environment allowing for targeted results so you aren’t spending time searching for documents. Location - Where are your documents? Many businesses are geographically dispersed, with different departments or different buildings altogether. How does your paperwork get from one place to another? Let’s take HR documents as an example. Typically hiring is done at an individual office or department and the documentation is centralised. How does the hiring manager access those documents, do they keep copies, how much back and forth occurs ensuring paperwork is completed and filed correctly. Employees move departments. How does the paperwork get from their former manager to their new manager? What if an employee moves locations to a different office, how does the new office gain access to the employee file, are multiple copies being created for that one person. When disciplinary action is needed the chance of non-compliance and an incomplete employee record can land your business in hot water. Digital documents solve the problem of having multiple documents in multiple locations. Access – who can see your business data In today’s modern world you need an easy and secure way to access and share your business documents internally and also with external third parties such as government authorities, auditors and solicitors. The primary goal in sharing documents is to control the access and security of your business information. A survey of HR professionals found that 69% of those surveyed share important documents with an external third party at least once a quarter. 11% needed to share externally at least once a week! The same survey also found that 76% use email as their primary delivery method for documentation, and 67% deliver physical copies of the files. Let’s look at this issue in more detail: A sensitive document is scanned from a multi-function device and is in your inbox. You forward that email, with the document attached, to the person who needs it. Now a copy of that document is in your outbox and in the person’s inbox. Let’s assume you delete those copies, they still reside on the email server. Also, you have no idea what the receiving person has done with the document. Printed it? Forwarded it? That one sensitive document can potentially turn into multiple unsecured copies It’s the same with the physical documents. Copies are provided to the requesting person but then what? What happens to those copies? Do they sit in an unlocked drawer in someone’s desk? These documents should never leave your control. You should have a complete audit trail of who has accessed, viewed or edited them. Digital documents give you the control to restrict access to view only, so no extra copies are made or forwarded. Confidence – how do you know the files are complete? How confident are you that all your documents are complete? Can you be confident that you have complete control of your sensitive information? Are you sure it is all up to date? Unfortunately, our documents don’t tell us when they are missing. The time when you need a document is the wrong time to find out you don’t have it. What if you could know with certainty that your documents were complete? Would you feel more prepared for that internal audit? With strong workflow and monitoring controls, your document management system will constantly scan through all your digital documents, testing for completeness and looking for expiring documents and those that need updating. Retention – are you keeping only the documents you need? Your business probably has a document retention policy. Due to the different silos of information throughout your business, paper documents and emails with attachments. Can you be confident you are following your companies retention policies? Any documents containing personally identifiable information should only be kept for as long as are required. For example, the GDPR has rules that documents cannot be held longer than necessary as a form of personal data protection (Article 6 GDPR) So what happens to your documents once the required period to retain them has expired? You must therefore establish clear processes for both retaining and deleting documents. With digital documents in a document management system, this process can be automated and securely controlled. Why move to Digital Documents? Digital documents reduce storage costs, are easy to find, can be shared globally and increase compliance. Digitising your documents into a document management system allows you to have complete control of your business data, set rules, restrict access and track all of your business data in one place. How does digital document management help? A digital document management platform will integrate all of your company information and documents for greater control, access and process efficiency. It offers significant advantages, such as: Document security Access control Centralised storage Audit trails Search and retrieval Digital Documents help enforce compliance Each of these five reasons to move to digital documents ties back to compliance. As a business professional, you have a range of responsibilities, but it is important to recognise that creating a proper environment for the safe, secure, and compliant management of your business documents is key to achieving them. Moving from a paper-based document environment to digital documents is a big leap forward in your ability to perform this critical responsibility. However, moving to digital documents is more than just scanning documents and attaching them to a bunch of different systems. To get the true value out of taking your business digital, you need a document management system that drives compliance and visibility into your documents to ensure completeness."

3,Ventilation system in the workshop,business," Ventilation in a production workshop is a complex of interconnected processes and equipment aimed at creating high-quality air exchange inside the production facility. The workshop ventilation system plays a much more important role than a similar system in any other room. The main emphasis is that this is a whole system of engineering developments is designed to ensure uninterrupted filtration of air from harmful and toxic impurities and its functional circulation.  At the same time the course of the technological process is not disrupted contributing to the creation of favorable conditions for their successful implementation. Depending on the method of air movement ventilation of production workshops can be: natural, mechanical. In the first case air exchange occurs due to the temperature difference and the difference in the pressure of the air flows. This type of ventilation can be unorganized (based on elementary physical phenomena - for example, a draft) and organized (aeration). To do this the use special structures (for example, boxes with shutters) allows to adjust the amount and strength of the air flow. Mechanical ventilation allows for preliminary treatment of the supply air (cooling, heating, and humidification) and filtration of polluted air before being released into the atmosphere. The main task of local ventilation is to localize and subsequently remove harmful and toxic substances and emissions directly at the place of their origin. In practice the source of pollution is covered from all sides by the so-called shields forming a kind of cap. Inside such a shelter a rarefaction occurs when air masses are sucked out because the pressure inside is below atmospheric. This measure prevents the entry of harmful impurities into the room. The local ventilation system of the workshop copes with air purification quite effectively and its organization is quite budgetary. In cases where local ventilation cannot fully localize pollution sources a general exchange type of ventilation is used. Its purpose is to comprehensively purify the air in all industrial premises (or a significant part of them) by diluting the concentration of harmful impurities, dust and dirt, heat radiation, etc. General ventilation does an excellent job of absorbing heat and is mainly used in cases where there is no emission of harmful impurities into the atmosphere of industrial premises. Mixed ventilation is used (general exchange + local suction) if the specificity of production involves the emission of gases, harmful vapors, carcinogens and dust. In some cases enterprises whose production is associated with significant dust emission or the release of toxic impurities completely abandon general ventilation. This is explained by the fact that a powerful general exchange system can simply carry these hazards and dust throughout the entire workshop. The key concept of building ventilation systems is: removing the maximum amount of harmful substances using local suction, diluting the remaining impurities with an inflow of fresh air reducing their concentration to the maximum permissible level. And this is the main basis on which industrial exhaust ventilation is built. The supply ventilation system of the workshop is aimed at ensuring a free flow of fresh air in volumes which will be sufficient for the full functioning of the production. In supply type systems duct fans are used which take air from the outside and then pass it through the heaters where heating and humidification occurs (if required). Such systems are capable of fully ensuring the forced flow of air masses into the workshop. At the same time the air pressure increases in comparison with the atmospheric pressure which contributes to the natural unorganized squeezing of the exhaust air out into the street through slots, exits or openings. The exhaust system removes polluted / humid / hot / toxic air and its replacement with clean air occurs unorganized - through window and door openings, etc. Such workshop ventilation is very important in technological processes that involve a large release of heat, moisture, harmful fumes, etc. with a significant staff of employees involved in production. All types of exhaust ventilation units in production workshops consist of several components: suction (open type - consisting of a protective casing, an exhaust hood, articulated telescopic / onboard suction, air inlets; or closed type - which include fume hoods (for industries with increased emission of toxic gases and poisonous vapors), chambers, shelter boxes (for working with highly toxic and radioactive substances), fan (centrifugal or axial), exhaust duct, filter, ductwork. Supply and exhaust ventilation of the workshop removes dirty air with simultaneous supply of fresh air masses. The distribution of streams can occur in two ways: by stirring, by displacement. Ventilation design for a workshop is a complex engineering task. It is necessary to perform careful calculations which largely depend on its purpose. Industrial ventilation must remove all hazards including hot air, explosive impurities and poisonous emissions, water vapor - everything that is released during the production process by products, equipment and personnel. The creation and design of ventilation in production workshops for any purpose is entrusted exclusively to professionals who will ensure compliance with all necessary standards and perform calculations taking into account the specifics of the production process."
4,Hull business partners with charity that empowers widows and orphans in Sierra Leone,business," A Hull-based business has partnered with a charity in Sierra Leone that supports widows and orphans through education and economic development projects. The Jamil and Nyanga Jaward Foundation supports people throughout Sierra Leone, where 86 per cent of the rural population live in extreme poverty. Hull has a strong relationship with the West African nation. The country’s capital, Freetown, is twinned with the city. The Jamil and Nyanga Jaward Foundation runs a number of community-based projects assisting women in agricultural development and empowering them to become financially stable through entrepreneurship. The foundation also runs projects for young children attending various local schools in Freetown, giving them access to much-needed educational resources. The foundation has partnered with Hull-based marketing agency Assured Marketing to raise awareness and support the foundation’s various projects. Connor Hewson, Assured Marketing director, said “Our aim is to use our organisation’s experience and resources to create a marketing strategy that, not only generates awareness of the outstanding efforts of The Jamil & Nyanga Jaward Foundation, but also ensures that they are able to welcome more donations to help fund their causes.” Hull’s link to the West African nation can be traced back to the early days of the abolition of the slave trade, a campaign that was led by Hull’s William Wilberforce MP and a group of friends who became known as the ‘Clapham Sect’. In the early days of abolition, the British Navy would patrol the seas off West Africa and seek to intercept slave ships. The people were then returned to the African continent and Freetown was one of the first settlements, so named because the people received their freedom there."

7,The Metaphysical Challenge to the Reasonable Man Test in Law,business," The Metaphysical Challenge to the Reasonable Man Test in Law So far, the procedure is one of rejecting demonstrably fallacious beliefs in regard to the general order of things, substantially on the lines on which tested and testable conclusions have been substituted for old delusions in what we term 'the sciences.' At every step the rationalist is assailed, just as were and are the reformers of the sciences; first by angry epithets, then by bad arguments as to 'evidence,' then by cooler attempts to demonstrate that his method will lead to moral harm, whether or not to present or future punishment at the hands of an terrestrial supra-legal omniscient authority. In particular he is assured that on his principles there can be no restraint upon men's evil proclivities; and that even the most thoughtful man runs endless dangers of wrong-doing when he substitutes his private judgment for the 'categorical imperative' embodied either in religious codes or in the current body of morality. To such representations the critical answer is that undoubtedly the application of reason to moral issues incurs the risks of fallacy which beset all reasoning in science so-called; but that, on the other hand, every one of those risks attaches at least equally to all acceptance of 'authoritative' teaching. There, it is submitted no prospect of our ever seeing, unanimity of moral opinion among even the most disciplined types of religious believers in 'authority.' Even in the Catholic Church it would be difficult to find any two men of judicial habit of mind who agree in all points as to what is 'right.' Nor is the reasonable man test's position a whit more open to utilitarian criticism (for his religious opponents, it will be observed, are narrowly utilitarian even in professing to combat his utilitarianism) when he is challenged upon his acceptance of 'the voice of conscience, 'otherwise the 'categorical imperative.' The Kantian argument on that notion is a juxtaposition of shifting terms. Mental hesitation as to obeying the sense of 'ought' is the proof of the vacillation of the perception of 'Oughtness.' When I feel, first, that I 'ought' to forgive a wrongdoer in a legal sense, and then that I 'ought' to give him up to 'justice'; or, alternatively, that I ought to rise earlier, and, again, that I may as well enjoy more sleep, I have reduced the 'categorical imperative' to the last term in a calculation. And exactly the same thing is done by the metaphysically inclined who is perplexed as to the need of balanced objectivity in a legal sense. Metaphysical subjective recording of history and biography are full of avowals, on the one hand, of the murderous clash of convictions alike resting on mental isolation of the reasonable man in a morally biased jurist of all kinds, and, on the other hand, of the agonies of ecclesiastical equities single mindedness in likely objective arbitrariness to know what is really the right answer to a legal situation. The life of the great parliamentary reformer Oliver Cromwell illustrates both orders of dilemma, with a sufficiency of resultant moral evil to arrest propaganda on the side of faith. And the philosopher of the 'categorical imperative' miscarries as instructively as does the soldier of divine will. Kant, on the one hand, vetoes even the telling of a lie to a would-be murderer to put him astray, and, on the other hand, commends to 'enlightened' ecclesiastical personalities the systematic preaching of their metaphysical beliefs in a double sense, because ""the people wish to be deceived"" ( an infamous Latin maxim ). The 'categorical imperative,' as propounded by him, is a form of self-deception. When, again, the psychic facts are critically faced and the 'categorical imperative' is rationally recognised as either the sum of the persisting moral judgments or the mere verbalism that we ought to do what we feel we ought to do, the rationalist is still at no disadvantage, utilitarian or other. It is not there that his tether tightens. Ecclesiastical morality, as finally ratified by the more thoughtful among religious men, is but the endorsement of 'natural' morality. There is not one social commandment, as distinguished from metaphysical or repetitive dogma, that did not emerge as a prescription of the natural moral sense, primitive or otherwise--a supererogatory proof that the religious prescriptions are from the same source. All surviving ecclesiastical ethic is to-day actually accredited as such, precisely because--and only in so far as--it conforms to natural judgment. Without resort to that tribunal, the ecclesiastical order could not discriminate between the sanction of the people of the book and the law of the levirate, which he has cancelled. The a posteriori argument for religious conformity has thus come to nothing; and the process of argument has revealed the religio-utilitarian champion of morality as traitor to that cause. There is left him, indeed, the plea that religious fears and sanctions are good for the ill-disposed believer, who ought, therefore, not to be disillusioned. As regards the simple dogma of deity, the position has the emphatic support of Voltaire. But Voltaire declined to use the favourite menaces of faith, as do many religionists of to-day; and if those menaces are to be rationally vindicated, there must first be raised the question whether they could not be improved upon for the purpose professed. Leaving that task to those who affect them, the rationalist may claim to be justified in acting on the maxim that honesty is the best policy in the intellectual as in the commercial life. There has been no such historical harvest of moral betterment from the religion of fear as could induce him of all men to employ it as a moral prophylactic. Thus far he figures as the vindicator of simple veracity against those who, in the name of morals, would make it of no account. He has still to meet, indeed, the challenge: What of the ill-disposed among your own way of thinking? If an unbeliever should see his way to gain by falsehood or licit fraud, what should deter him? Much satisfaction appears to be derived by many well-meaning people from the propounding of this dilemma. They may or may not be gratified by the answer that if a rationalist should not be, by training and bias, spontaneously averse to lying and cheating, or generally unwilling to do otherwise than he would be done by, or sensitive enough to the blame of his fellows to fear it, there is indeed no more security for his veracity or honesty than for that of a typical objectively challenged bigot. One can but add that, seeing that in the terms of the case he began by unprofitably avowing an unpopular opinion, he is presumably, on the average, rather less likely to lie for gain than those who confessedly find the sheer fear of consequences a highly important consideration in their own plan of life, and who have at the same time the promise from their own code of plenary pardon for all sins on the simple condition of ultimate repentance. Reasonableness broadly, implies the habitual resort to reason, to reflection, to judgment. The reasonable man in effect, says, 'That which I find to be incredible I must disbelieve whatever prestige may attach to its assertion; that which I find to be doubtful or inconceivable I will so describe.'"

9,Lawsuit alleges AFFF firefighting foam exposure caused firefighter’s cancer,business," A lawsuit filed on March 24 in federal court in South Carolina alleges that exposure to aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) caused a Georgia firefighter to develop cancer. The lawsuit names multiple defendants, including 3M and DuPont, and alleges negligence, battery, inadequate warning, design defect, fraudulent concealment, breach of express and implied warranties, and wantonness. The complaint seeks punitive damages, accusing the defendants of demonstrating “a conscious and outrageous disregard for their safety with implied malice.” AFFF is a type of firefighting foam which is used to put petroleum-based fires out. It contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which the complaint describes as “toxic.” PFAS can bind to blood proteins, stay in the body for a long time, and accumulate, building up with each exposure over time, according to the lawsuit, which accuses the defendants of making and selling AFFF despite knowing it was toxic, would enter firefighters’ bodies, and would persist and accumulate there. Animal testing done by defendants, according to the complaint, had established by 1970 that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a PFAS, was toxic, and had established by 1990 that PFOA caused testicular tumors in rats, leading to DuPont classifying PFOA as a confirmed animal carcinogen and possible human carcinogen. Additional research by defendants, including at least 3M and DuPont, according to the lawsuit, found by 2000 that PFOA caused testicular, liver and pancreatic cancer in rats. The complaint argues that when something causes cancer in animals and it is not known how, that something must be assumed to be a possible human carcinogen until it is known how it causes cancer. No known mechanism behind PFAS causing cancer is currently known. Research and testing done by defendants, according to the lawsuit, had established by 1980 that PFOA and another PFAS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), can bind to blood proteins and accumulate in the body, persisting there for a long time. By 1990, defendants, including at least DuPont, according to the complaint, were aware that their workers exposed to PFOA saw elevated cancer rates, and additional research and testing done by 2010, done by at least 3M and DuPont, also found elevated cancer rates in workers exposed to PFOA. Defendants in the lawsuit at some point, according to the complaint, stopped using certain PFAS after being asked to by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, switching to newer PFAS, including “short-chain PFAS.” Defendants in the lawsuit, according to the complaint, are aware that short-chain PFAS can also accumulate in the body and cause testicular, liver and pancreatic cancer in rats. An independent science panel called the C8 Science Panel published a report in 2012 which stated they found a “probable link” between exposure to just 0.05 parts per billion of PFOA in drinking water for one year, testicular cancer and kidney cancer. PFAS, according to the complaint, are found in 99% of the United States population. The lawsuit argues there is no acceptable level of PFAS in human blood. The complaint argues that defendants in the lawsuit repeatedly argue against the validity of scientific evidence of the dangers of PFAS, yet “knowingly, willfully, purposefully, intentionally, recklessly, and/or negligently refuse to fund or conduct any scientific study” which could produce data valid enough for their stated standards. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages based on an allegation of negligence, or the failure to be reasonably careful to prevent harm from occurring. The complaint argues the defendants had a duty of care to be reasonably careful to prevent PFAS in AFFF from entering, persisting in and accumulating in the blood of people, and failed in this duty. The lawsuit argues that the defendants knew PFAS could accumulate in and cause harm to people, but proceeded to act negligently, causing the plaintiff to develop cancer. The complaint seeks damages based on a battery accusation, arguing that the defendants failed to ask for or receive permission or consent from the plaintiff to allow PFAS to enter and accumulate in his body. This entry and accumulation, according to the lawsuit, is an unlawful, offensive and harmful physical invasion of the plaintiff which unreasonably interferes with his use and possession of his body. Inadequate warning is alleged by the complaint, which argues the defendants knew or should have known that AFFF exposure was harmful to human health and that exposure to AFFF was likely based on the way they were making and selling AFFF. The defendants, according to the lawsuit, failed to warn that PFAS would enter and accumulate in the body where they would then cause harm. The complaint argues that AFFF is defective by design because it is toxic, making it unreasonably dangerous. Defendants, knowing that it was toxic, according to the lawsuit, could have made and sold alternative formulations of the product which did not contain toxic PFAS, and these formulations were “available, practical, and technologically feasible.” The lawsuit accuses defendants of fraudulently concealing the toxic nature of PFAS from consumers, knowingly making false claims about the safety of AFFF in order to convince people to purchase and use AFFF. The defendants, according to the complaint, expressly and impliedly warranted that AFFF is safe to use as directed when, in fact, it is not because it can cause cancer. The wantonness allegation in the complaint argues that the actions of the defendants “were willful and wanton and exhibited a reckless disregard for the life, health, and safety of” AFFF users."
10,What Amount Of Time Does It Require To Plan And Construct A Site?,business," As you think about your new site, one of the inquiries that you're certain to pose is; 'how long is this going to take?'. More often than not somebody who is looking for an upgrade is managing a site that was last refreshed in 3 to 4 years prior. In web terms, the innovation changes that have come around in those 3+ years are huge. You've seen every one of these extraordinary new plans on different locales and it's become clear exactly how dated your site is. Since you've settled on the choice to proceed with your task, naturally you're restless to get your new site done. Before you select the webshop that has disclosed to you they can assemble your new webpage snappier than the remainder, there are a couple of interesting points. What can the course of events inform you concerning your chose site supplier? Do you have all your everything together? What's the most noticeably terrible thing that will occur if your new site takes somewhat more to be done? I've just at any point met a modest bunch of forthcoming customers who didn't need their task began and completed for some reason. For some, not having the option to begin immediately is a sufficient motivation not to choose a specific accomplice. This implies that most organizations you could decide to work with will have different undertakings in a hurry. Be careful when one of those organizations proposes that they can convey your undertaking in generously less time than the others. An organization that isn't occupied will actually want to complete your work all the more rapidly — they don't have different customers to stress over. That sounds incredible, yet it merits inquiring as to why they're not (and don't plan to be) occupied. At the point when an organization reliably conveys excellent work, it will be more sought after. An organization that accomplishes great work AND isn't occupied is an extraordinariness. Past the bustling element, there are a couple of different things that a course of events can advise you. A more limited task cycle may imply that your picked creator is doing less ""thought work"". It very well may be an indication that your substance will be shoehorned into a ""standard"" site layout. Maybe a wide range of colleagues will each have a little part in your undertaking, permitting the work to complete sooner. Try not to limit the chance of helpless time assessment. Understanding the elements incorporated into your timetable will help set the gauge for your assumptions. Building another site is difficult to work, and not only for the company, but you've also employed. There are sure things that no one but you can do. Social event content, surveying expectations, giving criticism, responding to questions. Rarely does it happen that a customer is searching for a site when they're not occupied? Setting aside the effort to react and give a vital contribution to your task isn't generally helpful. We comprehend that you're occupied, the vast majority are. Some portion of what goes into deciding the course of events for a task is realizing that occasionally we'll be pausing. Numerous customers throughout the years have disclosed to us the amount more exertion there was their ally of the task than they anticipated. We give a valiant effort to make it as basic as could be expected, however actually, your website specialist can't work effectively without your info. Dispatching your task right will mean investing the effort and at times will mean expanding the course of events so you can make everything fit. Cutoff times can be something to be thankful for in the event that they consider a practical timetable in any case. Tossing a dart at the schedule and concluding that where it hits is the day your new site will dispatch isn't the correct method to settle on a cutoff time. Odds are, when you're choosing an organization to construct your site, you've been considering everything for quite a long time. It tends to be not difficult to need to leap to a cutoff time starting there, however it merits inquiring as to why. I'm not recommending that you shouldn't have a cutoff time, you ought to. All things being equal, I'm recommending you consider the explanation you've set the cutoff time. Is that reason significant enough that you may bargain your choice of who to work with? What's the most exceedingly awful thing that could occur in the event that you miss your cutoff time? In the event that missing methods monetary misfortune, botched freedom, or falling behind the opposition, that is awful. On the other side, if missing methods you feel a smidgen of disillusionment however have a superior venture, which is not all that terrible. Keep in mind, since somebody has disclosed to you they can complete your venture by your cutoff time, it doesn't mean they can follow through on that guarantee. The lift has dispatched many sites throughout the long term. Through that experience, we've come to comprehend the time that it takes to dispatch an incredible site. Most web activities ought to consider 12 to about four months from the time that the task commences to the time that the site dispatches. Where intricacy is higher or the extent of the venture is especially huge, undertakings can require a half year or more. Indeed, finishing a venture in less time is conceivable. Indeed, we've done it. No, we don't suggest it. Your task is best served by having a course of events that is sensible, practical, and feasible."
11,Tips You Need To Know About Cell Phones,business," Cell phones are an amazing device, especially if you know a lot about them. For those who aren't in touch with the modern world or just want to learn more about cell phones, they have come to the right article. Below, you will find some great tips that can help you understand more about cell phones. To extend the battery life of your cellphone, make sure that apps are not running in the background at all times. Some apps will continue to run unless you disable them, and this can drain your battery quickly. Check your settings to see what you need to do in order to turn these apps off and make your battery last longer. Do not use a screen protector on your phone. These may look like a practical investment at first as they will reduce the amount of glare that you have during the day, but will also reduce the visibility on your phone. Air bubbles will also result if you do not put them on properly. Make sure to consider data minutes when signing up for your cell phone plan. Some plans have very restricted minutes, and this can turn into a bad deal if you use your phone to access the Internet or play games often. If your phone is capable of doing these things, get the most out of it by purchasing a plan that supports adequate usage. Remember that age will slow down a smartphone. There is truth in the fact that software updates can keep these phones current for a while. That said, the updates tend to get bigger and more powerful. It's possible that your old phone might not be able to handle them. Use Talkster if you want to have free international calls during the day and night. This service will give you more ads than you are used to but will reduce the high costs that you will have to pay for calls outside of the country. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. If you want to call someone and have the call go straight to voicemail without it ringing, you can use Slydial. This is a feature that eliminates the risk of someone answering your call. If a number has been calling you and you do not know who it is, this is a great service to employ. There is reason to believe that the radiation produced by cell phones could cause brain tumors and other health problems. While there is no direct proof that this is true, it is better to be safe than sorry. Whenever you can, put your phone on speaker or plug a headset into it. Your cell phone should be kept away from water. It is common to accidentally drop a cell phone in a body of water and destroy it. Your best bet is to not let your phone near water in the first place. Though you may feel confident in hanging on to your phone, accidents can still occur. If your cell phone is capable of charging through a USB interface, make sure you know which version of USB it needs. Some newer phones require USB 3.0. This can mean that plugging them into a USB 2.0 port will just make them power down for lack of juice. Obviously, they will not recharge this way. If you like to take pictures with your cell phone, be leery of using the zoom. It does not zoom in the way cameras do. You may just end up with an image that is fuzzy. This is because it enlarges the pixels rather than actually getting closer to the image. Audit your cell phone plan for a few months to make sure you have the right one for you. If it looks likely you're almost always going over your data limit or talking minutes, then you likely need to upgrade. If you're constantly well under your limits, you may be better off saving some money with a lesser plan. If you have a child with a cell phone, teach them responsible use of their phone. Since most cell phones are capable of getting online and texting, using a cell phone can come with many possible problems. Set rules for your children when it comes to cell phone use and monitor how they use it. Make sure your plan is the right one for you. There are many, many plans when it comes to cell phones and it is important that you get the one that best fits your needs. For instance, if you text a lot, make sure your plan covers this or you could be left paying a lot of overage. If your cell phone has a clock, it also has an alarm. You can use this for waking you up or reminding you of virtually anything. It saves you from needing a watch. You will not lose track of time if your phone reminds you when you have an upcoming event. Poor reception and searching for signals will deplete your cell phone's battery quicker than you may think. Leaving your cell phone on during long flights is a sure way to not have battery power when you land. Subways and rural locations will also tax your cell phone's battery. Turn your phone off in these situations to save power. Turn off your phone or use flight mode in areas where signals are sparse. It will use up the battery if there isn't a signal. When your signal should be good, you can turn it back on. The best way to conserve the battery on your cell phone is by turning it off when you are not using it. Of course, this may not be possible if you need it for work or other important purposes. But, if you don't need to have it on, turn it off. Knowing how to purchase, use or get great deals on cell phones is vital. Most people have cell phones, but don't know how to get in touch with all of their capabilities or how to buy a new phone when the old one breaks. Just keep these great tips in mind, and you will be more in touch with the modern world."

Keep in mind that these layers should interlink with each other. The first layer of content should, the part that establishes YOU as the expert, go into the relevant problems as well as manageable solutions that quite possibly should be considered. Establishing a connection When your content is read the feeling that you actually “get it” should strongly resonate, come across. A voice of authority offering trusted information and expert advice means you won't come off as a total stranger just out to make a sale. Genuinely caring about the problems your visitors are experiencing as you’re walking them through a solution can be very instrumental in gaining valuable rapport. you want to come off as frank, honest and sincere. Once that connection is made, getting them to move on to the next piece of content in your three-layer content marketing strategy should be an automatic response. Now comes components to the various types of products that will ultimately make up viable solutions that they may be searching for. This layer of content lays out the various options and varieties, if you will, of fixes available and along with each one, the up side and the down side. While your content is still somewhat reserved, in that it's not specifying choosing any particular product it does or should however answer the demand for adequate avenues for suitable results. The visitor should feel confident enough in the information to the degree that they have moved much closer to a solution.

Comparison pages can be constructed in such a way so as to discredit or find disadvantages with competitors products or services. Not only is this practice cheezy but unethical as well. Competitor Comparison Page Our three-layer content marketing strategy will ultimately lead the visitor to this page and the page itself doesn't have to bash anybody's site product's or services that competitors are promoting. What this comparison page needs is three or four of your top clickbank product with your affiliate links, These items or services should be relevant to solving the visitor's problem that you are promoting. Let them choose the product that they want to try from your selection of comparisons. It's pretty safe to say that if the prospect has made it this far through your three-layer content, that you have most probably built quite a bit of trust in their eyes. Everyone who makes it to the comparison page still may not buy, your product. The thing is that these folks are much more qualified ""targeted traffic"" than anyone else who enters your content marketing system. You must now be sure to use an email marketing program to keep in touch with news and upcoming offers, staying completely relevant to the reason they became subscribers. Set the three-layer content marketing strategy up correctly and just drive traffic. Works effectively well with Clickbank or any sales promotion."

14,The Top 10 Reasons Employees Leave Their Jobs — And How To Combat Them,business," Since 2010, the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs has continued to climb. But what accounts for these statistics? Are workers really less happy in their jobs than they were a decade ago, even with more positive workplace changes? Or are the reasons more complex? Studies have found that it wasn’t because workers were unhappy in their jobs as such, but more that they felt there was a better option elsewhere, which could challenge and support them more. Millennials especially were likely to emphasise constant growth and improvement, and often found that moving jobs was the best way to achieve this. While moving jobs can sometimes be a wise and positive decision, it can also present challenges. It can place enormous strain on employers and employees if the turnover of personnel is too regular. Many employers and employees are instead taking steps to ensure that job satisfaction is high, and that workers can be retained. Whether you are an employer, an employee, self-employed, or even a combination of them all, this article can help. We’ll take a look at some of the top reasons employees leave their jobs, and how you can meet and combat the associated challenges. Perhaps one of the most easily understood reasons why employees leave their jobs, is that they identify more exciting opportunities elsewhere. This might mean better pay, more opportunities for promotion, better training on the job, and more. A great way to combat this is with training opportunities at work, or regular communication between employer and employees about opportunities for growth, or more responsibilities. Many workers are trying to balance their work responsibilities with family life, and nowadays there are higher expectations around being able to achieve a great ‘work-life balance’. Many workers leave their jobs because the hours are unsuitable or unsociable, and they are seeking greater flexibility. More discussions around flexibility, as well as offering them the opportunity to work remotely, or from home, can help to combat this. It can be especially helpful when trying to reduce the number of worker absences or sick days that need to be taken. This reason can be more difficult to measure, but is still regularly reported as a reason for leaving a job. When workers feel like their contributions are overlooked, or that they do not receive enough praise and recognition, their job satisfaction — and even their self-worth — can take a hit. Employers are combating this by developing ways to reward employees, such as by offering incentives, challenges, and even awards. On a more micro scale, employers who regularly praise workers and thank them for their contributions, are more likely to retain a happy workforce. Many workers have found that a lack of communication in their job meant they soon looked elsewhere for work. A lack of feedback in the role could mean that they rarely hear whether they are doing well in the role, or underperforming, while not having regular performance reviews can deprive the employee of the opportunity to give feedback of their own. When communication feels like a ‘two-way street’ — with opportunities to both give and receive feedback — employers and employees are much more likely to feel satisfied. Workplace bullying, or cliquey behaviours, are carefully monitored and dealt with in the best workplaces. But they can also be more insidious and difficult to spot. When employees leave their jobs due to a negative work culture, it can often be because the behaviours were difficult to report. Ensuring that there is an open line of communication — with confidentiality assured if needed — can be key to combatting this. Team building activities, socialising, and fostering a considerate, respectful atmosphere can also be essential for worker happiness and retention. Many employees switch jobs because, once in the role, they find that their skills are not a match and that the job is unsuitable. This can be because the job was not advertised in enough detail, because they were not interviewed thoroughly enough, or because the specified role was described in an ambiguous fashion which led to its duties being misunderstood. More employers are combatting this by making use of recruitment professionals and companies who can identify the best candidates at the earliest stages. This minimises the likelihood of unsuitable hires. A bright, clean, pleasant work environment that fosters communication and collaboration can also be helpful to worker retention. It is unlikely to be a frontrunner reason that employees leave their jobs, but an unappealing workspace can definitely influence the decision. Many jobs are sporadic by their very nature. Shift work, irregular hours, or freelance projects may all feel somewhat unstable. But there are ways that employers can help give a sense of stability. Even timely and honest communication, acknowledgement of the irregular schedule, and the effort to make other areas of the job stable, can all be a positive contribution. Employees often like to have opportunity to grow and develop professionally, but it can extend to their opinion of the company as well. Employees are more likely to stay in roles when they believe that the company itself is growing, developing, and expanding. This may not necessarily mean taking on more clients or making more products, for example, but can simply mean that the company has a progressive approach and is always seeking opportunities to improve. The companies that employees perceive as being flexible, progressive, and seeking fresh opportunities, tend to fare better in employee retention. Employees perhaps most commonly leave their current jobs because they are seeking a new challenge. But employers can help to provide this in their current role. With regular communication and honest discussion, challenges can be created through extra training, more responsibilities, the creation of new roles and titles, and more. When employees feel challenged, they often push themselves to perform better — giving greater value to both themselves and their employers. The greater sense of accomplishment, confidence, and job satisfaction that comes from being challenged, means employees are much more likely to stay in the role."
15,Five Ways To Create A More Inclusive Workplace,business," An inclusive workplace is better for everyone — not just those with disabilities. The more diverse your workforce, the broader the range of talent, insights, and innovation that you are inviting into your company. A diverse workforce is also much more likely to understand and cater to a varied customer base, ensuring that your company reaches the widest audience possible. Supporting those with disabilities and different needs in the workplace is also an ongoing effort — it is not simply about ‘ticking boxes’ or meeting requirements. A genuinely inclusive workplace should have support, adaptability, and communication built into its very core. Current studies show that nearly one in five people has a disability. This may be an invisible disability, like a long-term health condition, mental health issue, or disorder such as dyslexia or dyspraxia. It could also be a more obvious impairment, like hearing loss, sight loss, or a physical disability, for example. Disabilities are as varied as people, and it is important for employees and employers to feel they can have supportive conversations around these topics. Beyond the requirements of the Equality Act — which states employers have a duty to ensure that employees with a disability are able to work effectively — there is so much more that can be done. In this article, you’ll learn five key ways you can help to create a more inclusive workplace in your own business. You can support those with disabilities in the workplace by adapting the working environment physically. It can be especially helpful to first discuss with employees any individual needs they may have, and what would best support them in their work. Changes can be as simple as removing physical barriers and obstacles, rearranging certain areas, or adjusting desk and seating arrangements. Alternatively, more in-depth alterations might be required - such as introducing specialist working equipment or computer software, for example. Professional advice is available — as well as financial support if you are eligible. Not all modifications need to be costly or substantial, and even small changes can have a big impact. Many people with disabilities in the workplace have found that information can be shared in a way which is not always accessible to them. For employees with sight loss, for example, emails or bulletin boards may not be the best way to receive crucial information. Consult with colleagues and employees about what is the best way to communicate information with them, and whether they require the details presented in a different format. Sharing information consistently and in a variety of accessible forms is not only vital for ensuring everyone feels included, it is also key for high productivity and good overall communication in the workplace. Maintaining an inclusive workplace is often an ongoing project – constantly adapting and changing the space to support the needs of new personnel. Part of facilitating this is creating an open dialogue, where everyone has the opportunity to voice their concerns, questions, or feedback about what is working well – and what needs improvement. It can be helpful to schedule regular reviews or workshops to assess whether the workplace is as accessible and inclusive as it could be, and what the best ways to support people going forwards are. Employees should be encouraged to feel confident in approaching their employer with suggestions or concerns. Happy employees who feel heard and supported are more likely to be loyal, productive, and creative in the workplace. Consider having trained healthcare professionals on site — especially ones qualified in mental health first aid. A greater understanding of mental health in the workplace has been a crucial development in recent years, leading to millions of employees receiving far greater support. Of course, having trained professionals on the team is especially helpful, but so is fostering an overall culture of sensitivity and awareness around disabilities in the workplace. This can be encouraged through additional courses, training, or educational workshops. Sensitivity, positivity, and high levels of awareness are all important to nurturing an inclusive workplace — especially for understanding areas such as invisible disabilities, or mental health issues. Everyone can benefit from more flexible working options, but for those with disabilities this can be especially crucial. Flexible working options might include working from home on certain days, staggered start or finish times, as well as phased return to work options — such as after an accident, or a medical procedure. Studies have shown that flexible working options do not have to be erratic or disruptive in any way. On the contrary, they have often led to more productive, satisfied workforces, and stronger results over time due to improved energy levels, a better work-life balance, and higher job satisfaction. Offering a more inclusive and accessible workplace will also benefit you in terms of the calibre of candidates you will attract to job roles, and in the quality of work they will produce. For more resources and further advice, be sure to visit specialised websites such as AbilityNet, the government’s Access to Work programme, and the relevant sections of the Equality Act."
16,Character Building: 3 Unexpected Ways Animation is Used in Marketing,business," As the importance of social media as a marketing platform has risen, it’s become harder than ever to stand out. Companies are going to extraordinary lengths to attract (and maintain) the attention of potential customers, and one of the more modern tools they’re using to achieve this, is animation. Animation and CGI have made a major impact on entertainment industries such as film, television, and videogames, over the last few decades, but now they’re being used prominently throughout other fields too. Did you know that some popular celebrities, models, and social media influencers are not even ‘real’? As some of the bullet points below show, they may be entirely digital; a CGI mirage that can be used to market to millions. This is no longer the stuff of science fiction, but instead it may become the next crucial marketing tool for your business — however large or small — and a way to take your online reach to a whole new level. The world-famous American talent agency, CAA, recently made headlines by signing its first official CGI client. ‘Miquela’ may look like any modern girl on Instagram (she has her own account and millions of followers), but she is entirely CGI. This ‘virtual influencer’ has been used in major marketing campaigns for brands like Samsung, Calvin Klein, and YouTube. She has amassed 2.2 million followers, and it is unclear how many of them are even aware she is computer generated… She is not just a virtual model either. Miquela (also known as Lil Miquela) is also used to raise awareness around social activism issues, like homelessness, LGBTQ+ people, and displaced women. In this regard, Miquela is used in almost the same way as a real-life model or spokesperson. Some may find it uncanny, but her signing with CAA proves that virtual influencers are on the rise, and can be considered an area with major business potential. Some businesses are going beyond conventional animation to create characters that achieve the maximum reach, engagement, and impact. Companies such as Digital Puppets, for example, use state of the art software to create animation in real time. This means that an animated character can be used in live Q+As and streaming, where someone speaks, and their character appears to be speaking for them. Real-time animation has already overtaken conventional animation in terms of its sheer speed. Regular animation can take months to produce even seconds or minutes of content, whereas live animation is rapid. Live animation also eliminates the need for lip-syncing, as this is done automatically, side-stepping what is often a major headache in the conventional animation process. Another benefit of live animation which has proved to be of particular interest to clients, is the ability to use the characters for live presentations and speeches, where the character will be on stage, engaging the audience, while the person controlling them can be hidden away in a quiet room, using their character to hold the audience’s attention far more than they might be able to by themself. Because of these factors, and more, interest in live animation is soaring. Graphics Interchange Formats may sound dry, but GIFs (as they are known) are undeniably fun. Essentially a moving picture that repeats on a continuous loop, GIFs have made their way into popular culture, and into communication. Many smartphones now include a library of GIFs that can be included in text messages, emails, and chat services. This means that your reply need consist of nothing more than a moving image which captures your feeling; it could be something from a popular film, perhaps, or a television show, or even a quote from a song. GIFs which show facial reactions from hit TV shows like The Office, are especially popular. Not all GIFs are animations, but many are moving images or pixels, so can be counted as such. They are also being used more regularly on business websites, and for online promotional materials. Logos and text that would ordinarily be static, can now be made to move in eye-catching ways. This can be remarkable useful for drawing the reader’s eye to important product details, offers, or unique selling points. Whether it’s a few moving pixels, a CGI masterpiece, or a compelling real-time animated character conducting a live Q&A, the use of animation for business is on the rise. Companies in a wide range of industries are exploring this new avenue of marketing, and trying ‘character building’ activities of their own. Perhaps you should consider joining them?"
17,Business In The 2050s: How The Future Of Work Might Look,business," Predictions of the future are often wildly inaccurate. For example, Back To The Future promised us hoverboards, while almost everyone who saw Blade Runner couldn’t wait to get their hands on a flying car. Unfortunately, neither are readily available to the general public yet, which is a crying shame. Casting an eye into the future and speculating how the world may look at that time, is never an easy task – there are simply too many variables involved. New technologies which no-one saw coming may be pulled from the aether, while existing fields which have substantial growth potential, may fail to develop as expected. A good example of this is 3D films; time and again they’ve been touted as the future of the film industry because production companies have thought consumers would jump at the chance to become more immersed in the worlds that films create. While this is true to an extent, the popularity of 3D films is currently declining quite significantly – as it has done several times before. Instead, consumers seem far keener to increase the resolution they can watch their 2D content on, which is seen in the meteoric rise of 4K and UHD televisions over recent years. Looking at current trends and ideas, and considering how they may progress over time, can help us form a mental picture of how the future might look if things continue on their current path. Applying this approach to the workplace is simple enough to do, because recently there have been a great many new ideas and perspectives on how the world of work should develop over coming decades, proposed by politicians, academics, think tanks and business leaders, among others. By considering these new ideas, and taking the changes which have already happened in the workplace over recent years one step further, this is how the workplace of the 2050s might look… Remote Working – The New Normal? Remote working is rapidly on the rise all over the world, and the stats are striking. For example, a 2019 study by Forbes found that there has been a 159% rise in remote working in the USA since 2007, while the same study estimates that before 2020 is over, 50% of the UK workforce will work remotely, at least part of the time. Allied to this development, is the decline across much of the western world of the traditional ‘job for life’, whereby employees stayed with same employer throughout their working life, and their concept of career progression was seeking a promotion within the same company. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted, but it is something which has arisen in part due to the desires of both employers - who responded to economic recessions by calling for greater flexibility with regards to labour rights - and employees - who responded to a decades-long period of wage stagnation by becoming more willing to switch employers (or even careers) in search of greater opportunities and better working conditions. As well as the decay of the ‘job for life’ contributing to greater flexibility for both employers and employees, it has caused a substantial increase in the number of people who have become self-employed, work multiple jobs, have a side-business on top of their day job, or take on freelance work in their spare time. All these factors are combining to produce a vast number of highly productive, well trained and well-educated workers, who do not need to be physically present at the office of a primary employer between the hours of 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday. However, many people who enjoy working from home do not enjoy working alone, and this has caused a massive rise in co-working over recent years. The growth of co-working spaces looks well-set to continue into the 2050s and beyond if, as expected, more and more of the workforce begin working remotely. Indeed, as co-working spaces become busy activity hubs populated by skilled and enterprising people from a variety of different backgrounds, it is only natural that these people connect, network and synergise with each other – all of which means co-working spaces could become a fertile source of fresh innovations and vibrant new startups all over the world, not just Silicon Valley. The 4 Day Workweek Even for those people who have jobs where remote working is not an option, changes in their working patterns may be afoot, as the idea of switching to a 4 day workweek has been suggested by a range of academics, think tanks and employers. For example, the Exeter-based travel company STC Expeditions recently completed a 12 week trial of the 4 day workweek, while during the 2019 UK General Election, the Labour Party had an official policy to make the 4 day workweek the UK’s standard schedule, before 2030. The logic behind working 4 days a week instead of 5, is that several studies have shown peoples’ productivity tends to decline after about 32 hours work per week, meaning that the other 8 hours of the 40 hour workweek could be given back to the employee with little, if any, loss of productivity. In fact, a 2019 study by Microsoft Japan found that employee productivity actually increased by a staggering 40% when they trialled a 4 day workweek for the duration of the summer. Whether a 4 day workweek is sustainable in the long-term, not just over a limited period of time, and to what extent Thursday afternoons become the new Friday afternoons with regards to productivity, are issues which will need to be investigated over the coming years, and by the 2050s, we will likely have our answer. The Robots Are Coming For Us All! And there’s no escape. Like it or not, automation and technological advances mean that sooner or later, our jobs will be done by robots who can complete the work quicker, cheaper and to a better standard than we ever could. This is not a change which will take place overnight, but by the 2050s, across an enormous range of industries and workplaces, highly skilled custom-made robots will be doing the jobs humans used to do. This is not a new idea, nor is it a new phenomenon. Consider the industrial revolution, when vast numbers of textile workers found themselves surplus to requirements due to the invention of machines which could do their jobs without requesting break periods, days off or overtime pay. In more modern times, think of self-checkout machines in the supermarket, where a dozen or more self-checkouts can be available for customers to use, with only one or two store assistants being present to supervise. The process of specially made robots replacing people in their job roles is called automation, and you’re going to be hearing a lot more about it in future, because right now in a number of very large and very important industries, robots are being developed which, by the 2050s, will have taken the jobs of hundreds of millions of people. For example, in the USA one of the largest sources of employment for non-college educated men is vehicle driving; either as a truck driver, taxi driver, Uber driver, courier, or something else along a similar line. Even today, self-driving cars are semi-operational, and with the amount of research funding that is currently being invested into making fully functional self-driving vehicles not just a reality, but the norm, sooner rather than later, it seems logical to suggest that by the 2050s the vast majority of driving jobs will be done by robots, not humans. No-One Is Safe! By no means is this a phenomenon which is unique to the automotive industry. Across all industries and all walks of life, the expectation is that robots will be doing the jobs that people currently do, within the next few decades. For example, a 2019 study by Oxford Economics found that 20 million jobs in the manufacturing industry alone could be automated away before 2030, and that many of the people working these jobs would then tend to seek employment in related industries which are also highly vulnerable to automation. In truth, this scenario of widespread global job losses is not as cataclysmic as it may appear, because ever since capitalism has become the primary method by which human societies have organised their economies, innovations and technological advancements have created new employment opportunities, as well as eliminating existing ones. A commonly cited example of this, is how the invention of social media platforms has created the job of Social Media Manager, which is a position that would not have been close to existing even 20 years ago. And returning to the example of the industrial revolution – this is a development which created an enormous number of new employment opportunities in factories and mills, while eradicating many of the existing jobs in farming and agriculture. However, the sheer scale of the automations which will almost certainly come over the next few decades, may present a challenge of the like we have not seen before. For example, a 2015 study by the Bank of England estimated that nearly 50% of the UK’s workforce risk having their job automated away, with those most vulnerable working in admin, manufacturing, clerical, care, and customer service jobs. Crisis Management And Free Money For All With so many people at risk of having not just their jobs, but their careers, automated away, the next question that arises is, ‘how do we respond to this?’ One potential solution which has gained support from people on all sides of the political spectrum, is the idea of a universal basic income (UBI). UBI can be defined as, ‘a model for providing all citizens of a country or other geographic area with a given sum of money, regardless of their income, resources or employment status,’ while the essential principle behind UBI is the idea that ‘all citizens are entitled to a liveable income, whether or not they contribute to production.’ In short, in a world where huge numbers of people will have their livelihoods and skillsets automated away, leaving them unable to compete against robots in a free-market economy, how can we ensure that these people are still able to have a standard of living which affords them some dignity? Many brilliant minds both past and present have supported the concept of a UBI because (among other reasons) it could present a solution to this problem. Some of the more well-known supporters of UBI include: Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Bertrand Russell, Franklin Roosevelt, Margaret Mead, Martin Luther King, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. It is also important to note that support for UBI has come from groups of people who would normally have diametrically opposed political views. For example, one of the best known modern proponents of UBI is Andrew Yang, an American tech entrepreneur who recently ran to be the Democratic nominee for the 2020 presidential election, while on the other side of the political divide, support for UBI has come from the neoliberal economist Milton Friedman, and the political scientist Charles Murray, whose views on the issue of race relations could generously be described as ‘controversial’. It is also worth noting that the American state of Alaska, which is heavily conservative, has had a form of UBI since 1982. Every year, residents of Alaska receive up to $2000 simply for living there, with barely any conditions attached. What’s more, studies have shown that Alaska’s UBI program has helped to wipe out extreme poverty in the state, without increasing unemployment. Releasing The Shackles The relative merits of UBI, and how it should be implemented, are issues which require serious studying and many more words of explanation than I am afforded for this article, but there is one more point which is vital to understand in the context of UBI and how it may affect business in the 2050s. Consider for a second how many frustrated entrepreneurs you know. How many people in your life would love to start a business if only they weren’t so beholden to the everyday pressures of working long hours to pay the bills and support their families? If by the 2050s, UBI has been successfully implemented in a number of countries, how many people across the world would have been able to use the extra freedoms afforded to them in terms of both time and finances, to start businesses and pursue their true calling? With some of the pressure to pay household bills and expenses relieved, how many bold new services and groundbreaking products would be developed by skilled and educated individuals, who all of a sudden had more time to work on their passion projects? The Future Is Yours Whatever your views are on any of the ideas I’ve presented in these articles, it’s worth remembering that nothing is inevitable, and that the world of the 2050s will be shaped by the actions and desires of ordinary people, all across the world. As Abraham Lincoln said, ‘the best way to predict the future is to create it.’"
