1,Our Top R&B And Soul Hits For Summer 2022,arts-entertainment," Summer is nearly here! And what better way to get the warm vibes flowing than with some supremely soulful sounds? With this in mind, here are our picks for the best R&B rhythms and slices of soul this summer. Solange’s 2016 hit is a cool, refreshing take on the R&B genre. Blissfully minimalist, yet beautifully deep, Cranes In The Sky is pure poetry, the restless feeling of being away from a loved one echoed in the ways she tries to fill the empty space in her life (‘I try to drink it away’, ‘I tried to dance it away’). The imagery of solitary birds swooping over calm waters, suppressed by heavy steel clouds, is evocative of the feeling of loneliness. But this is quickly soothed by the gentle, mellow tones of Solange’s vocals and the reassurance of the backing vocalists (‘Don’t you cry, baby!’). The minimalism of the strings and bass gives the sensation of spaciousness, further asserted by the expansive landscapes depicted in her music video. This quiet exploration of Solange’s inner world evokes a sense of healing through music: her vocals take centre stage in a way that is powerful, but simultaneously delicate and subtle - allowing herself the space to be fragile. The music video is a creative exploration of themes of struggle and empowerment; Solange’s solitary scenes are contrasted against group shots of herself with other black women, artistically shot, bodies draped over each other in a manner that echoes classical art. There is a sense of intimacy in her group shots, the women touching each other's skin in a way that suggests connection and familiarity. The use of colour in the clothing and backgrounds, and the way that Solange positions herself appears almost saintly, the slight movement of her hands and eyes bringing life to what would otherwise be a freeze-frame, while keeping the sense of being in a living painting. Cranes In The Sky is a deceptively subtle exploration of inner feelings of loneliness, and the healing power of belonging in a community. Listening to Didn't Cha Know feels like an aeroplane flight in clear blue skies. The bass riﬀ is fluid and melodic, complimented perfectly by the soaring melodic tune of the keyboard and Badu's light, airy vocals, and grounded by earthy drum beats. Badu takes her cue from old school R&B and soul to create a track that is modern, minimalist and unquestionably unique. There is a roaming air to the track which contributes to the sensation of travelling through life experiences; in her music video, Badu is a nomad roving through the desert, the ground dry and cracked beneath her boots. Her dress is white against the scorched sienna earth, unquestionably futuristic which contrasts with the retro feel of the melody and the naturalistic way that she connects with the insects and reptiles in her environment. Her train drags behind her in a manner that is almost bridal, as she searches for her lover in the wilderness, yet she is alone, curling up in her dress to go to sleep as the night falls. When she finally arrives at the oasis, she and her lover reunite, their thirst for each other quenched in the still waters. Badu is an artist who weaves together the threads of freedom and imprisonment, opulence, and hardship, to form an expansive desert tapestry. Didn’t Cha Know is a warm, sun-filled delight of a track, and the perfect accompaniment to the blistering summer rays. This 1984 soul hit by Sade is a timelessly cool masterpiece, which has continued to feel fresh almost 30 years on. While the track wasn't as successful in the UK, Smooth Operator was a breakthrough track in the US, and it conjures up images of simultaneously slick and sleazy jazz bars, frequented by playboys and conmen out to deceive unwary women out of their money. The saxophone is as suave and sophisticated as the swindler depicted in the video, adding a nostalgic atmosphere to the 80s classic. Smokey and sultry, Sade is a Smooth Operator herself, a talented bar singer bathed in red lighting as the hustlers bustle around her, taking advantage of her aﬀections. Opening with the crashing sounds of waves on the shore, Best Part, A Visual is an intimate inside glimpse of the bliss between lovers. Caesar's smooth vocals are complimented by dreamy guitar and elegantly simple percussion, the female vocals of H. E. R. adding an ethereal echo to his earthy tones. The melody is warm, sweet, and feels like bathing in sunlight. This is a euphoric, tender track that captures the essence of new love. Dylan Sinclair captures the essence of soul in Home, with melancholic vocals against the backing of swaying electric guitar sounds. Despite the mournful lyrics, the melody has a soothing air; the video features his lover in bed in a sun-bathed field against clear blue skies as he walks from his car across the dusty soil to join her. He pictures her as he drives away in his car, later sitting alone in that same field, as she takes his place in the car alone. He appears lost as he wanders the field, watching the sun set over the horizon. Dylan’s vocals capture the essence of love on the rocks; sweeping skilfully through highs and lows as he narrates the story of separation and longing."
2,Enjoy the Summer: It’s  Beach ‘Book’ Season The Golden Prison is in 2nd Printing,arts-entertainment," Summer is beach book season, and Attorney Paul Alexander Sangillo invites you to enjoy his first novel, The Golden Prison, now in its 2nd printing. Since the 1800s, reading books on the beach has been an American tradition. The Golden Prison will take you on a wild ride from law school to big business, as young attorneys grapple with crime, threats and even murder. Once you pick up this surprising book, remember to put on plenty of sunscreen and get comfortable, because you will not put it down. This novel is a gripping, addictive story, and features strong characters that you will root for along the way. The Golden Prison is a fast-paced, unpredictable journey that takes a rags-to-riches story through its nightmare journey. Drugs, murder, and exquisite love scenes in a romance that may change everything, blend with the young  attorney Jeff Rhodes’ code of honor, as he faces extremely dangerous situations at his new firm. The Golden Prison serves as a warning to ambitious students entering the workforce to be wary of the slippery slope of doing “just one more” unethical thing to get ahead or survive in the cutthroat world of business. Jeff Rhodes will keep you at the edge of your beach chair, as he faces the riches that imprison him while trying to remain compassionate and follow the law. The Golden Prison is a riveting story of one young lawyer who battles to remain honorable - and alive - in the midst of a corrupt, multi-billion dollar company that may be guilty of murder. “Law school is like running on a treadmill set at an incline of 15 at the highest speed you can imagine,” said author Paul Sangillo. “Most of us were exhausted and stressed out, but turned to coffee or just suffered through the long hours. But many law students turned to drugs, and sadly, that habit continued when they join these heavy-hitter businesses, that literally have you work overnight. Simultaneously, once a new attorney joins a firm, there is a seismic shift that happens, between the balance of the rule of law and reality of how big business really operates.” The Golden Prison is available in print or eBook on Amazon, Good Reads, and Kindle.

3,How educators solved their pain points with 3D exhibitions,arts-entertainment," Virtual exhibitions offered educators a lifeline during the pandemic. Universities, art schools, high schools and primary schools moved online, which meant they could continue to show their students’ work. But exhibiting online creates its own set of issues. 2D or not 2D? The critical challenge was to do justice to the work in an online format. One option was to set up a 2D gallery page of same-sized images and slide shows. This had the advantage of being reasonably easy to set up. However, it didn’t come close to replicating the exhibition experience, where visitors are surrounded by a thoughtfully curated collection of artworks. Instead of approaching the works and viewing them from a range of angles – with the ability to be drawn into a closer encounter – viewers were presented with a succession of flat images. A webpage or a slide show is not an exhibition. Students, who may have put hundreds of hours into their work, deserve something better. Pseudo 3D to the Rescue In an attempt to create a more realistic exhibition experience, some organisations turned to Google Earth. This stitches together photos taken with a 3D camera and inserts them into a virtual space. The issue here is the sheer amount of work involved. The educator first had to hang the actual show – which might not be possible under pandemic restrictions. Then they had to engage a photographer with the right gear to scan the entire show. And they still had to put the exhibition together on a computer. Laborious and costly, this was not a viable option for many educators. With a true 3D exhibition, Viewers become Visitors The best way to replicate the exhibition experience online is to set up a 3D gallery. In a 3D space, visitors can explore exhibitions and compare artworks at their actual size, from any distance or angle, while moving freely around the exhibition. Viewers become visitors because they feel they’re actually somewhere. Curating an Exhibbit 3D gallery is quick and intuitive. Curators have a wide range of different-sized spaces to choose from. The tools provided enable educators to collaboratively curate exhibitions along with their students. And they can do it all remotely. The gallery exhibition could then be integrated with the organisation’s website. Using the other tools provided with Exhibbit, educators were able to share exhibitions by posting on social media and inviting people via email. With their obvious collective and contextual benefits, easy access on computers and mobiles phones, 3D galleries quickly became the solution of choice for many. On behalf of Clarion University of Pennsylvania's Art Dept. I would like to thank your company for making it possible for our graduating BFA art majors to have virtual solo exhibits, and our yearly BFA Senior Juried Art Exhibit. All of our students and friends are very impressed with the sophisticated quality of Exhibbit. I also loved how simple it was to work with the program. Clarion University One Account, Many Galleries Exhibbit’s 3D solution also offered a very important advantage to time-poor administrators and educators: simplicity. Organisations could set up a single account with the number of galleries they required. They could then assign these galleries to individuals, groups of students, and/or other educators. Administrators had access to all the galleries and could preview any of the students’ exhibitions. They also received each gallery’s published exhibition links. Each student was only able to see their own gallery and it's exhibitions. The perfect balance of simplicity and practicality. Back to Reality? As Covid restrictions ease or disappear, some educators are moving back to real-world exhibitions again. Some – but not all. Many educators have been so impressed with the experience, image quality and ease of curation that they are continuing to use their 3D galleries to augment and extend the duration of their shows. And to give their students first hand curation experience without the expense and time it takes to hang a real show. The ability to integrate the 3D exhibition experience within the organisation’s website extends the reach of the physical show. It is also a wonderful tool for designing and experimenting, with the ability to set up shows well before the actual opening. This allows multiple exhibition concepts to be trialled and viewed by all involved. The visceral experience of moving through an Exhibbit 3D gallery far exceeds that of a 2D web gallery page. There is just no comparison."

Some diamond painting designs are quite simple, while others are incredibly detailed. It's important to choose a design that matches your skill level and comfort level - there's nothing worse than starting a project and then getting frustrated because it's too difficult or time-consuming. Diamond paintings come in all different sizes, from small accent pieces to large-scale murals. Think about where you want to display your finished painting and choose a size accordingly. Keep in mind that larger designs will take longer to complete, so if you're short on time, you may want to stick to something smaller. Do you have a favorite animal, flower, or landscape?

If you are new to diamond painting, start with a simple design to get the hang of it before moving on to more complex designs. And most importantly, have fun! Prepare your workspace To get started with diamond painting, first prepare your workspace. You will need a flat surface to work on, and plenty of light. Diamond painting is done with tiny diamonds, so you will need to be able to see what you are doing. Next, gather your supplies. You will need a diamond painting kit, which includes the diamonds, a tool for picking up the diamonds, and a sticky canvas. The kit will also have instructions on how to do the project. Once you have your workspace and supplies ready, it is time to start diamond painting! Begin by finding the center of the design and working your way out. Slowly add the diamonds one at a time, following the pattern in the kit. Seal it up After you have completed your diamond painting, it is important to seal the diamonds to protect them from damage. You can do this by using a clear sealant or varnish. Simply apply a thin layer of sealant over the entire painting, being sure to cover all of the diamonds. Allow the sealant to dry completely before displaying or storing your painting. CONCLUSION If you're looking for a fun and relatively easy way to get into the world of crafting, diamond painting may be just the thing for you. With some basic supplies and a willingness to learn, you can be on your way to completing beautiful works of art.

6,Stop Glamorizing Abusers,arts-entertainment," I don’t personally care about Johnny Depp or Amber Heard — not my circus, not my monkeys. Take some celebrity, toss in a lot of ego and a heaping helping of entitlement, and you get Depp v. Heard. But when I went on TikTok a couple of weeks ago for a little dopamine fix, my “For You Page” was inundated with horrifying clips from both men and women slamming Amber Heard and claiming #justiceforjohnnydepp. Depp’s admitted abuse of drugs, alcohol, Heard and anyone else he felt entitled to brualize seems to be sexy to an absurd number of women, and an opportunity to bash women under the equal-opportunity umbrella for men. I’ll always have a crush on Roux, but I can separate the character from the guy making a disappointing, abusive spectacle of himself in this latest self-destruct phase. But these “fans” were foaming-at-the-mouth crazy, demeaning Heard in every way imaginable (and not being flagged for their own brand of bullying and harassment, gee I wonder why). Has social media successfully diminished heinous criminal behaviour to a who is or isn’t the more adored actor contest? In this non-stop barrage of this social media frenzy I’m seeing the pre-cursor to this week’s senate intent to overturn Roe v. Wade and suddenly abusing women okay again. Wtf? After pleading with the virtual TikTok gods out loud to take the Johnny Depp fandom/ Amber Heard slander off my FYP, I decided to take a closer look at what these “fans”” were doing. Whoever paid for this social-media pro-Depp “clean-up on Aisle 5” attempt made this fiasco my circus, and I wasn’t thrilled about it. I was seeing somewhat lucid women demonize Heard, intentionally oblivious to the fact that they were perpetrating the abuse they were spouting had been so unfairly dumped on Depp, but using the characters he’s played as some kind of sexualized validation for his abusive behaviour. Simply put, they were glamorizing abuse through supporting a proud addict/abuser who was hot in a few roles in movies by trying to degrade the actress ex-wife. Let’s be clear that they’re not saying he was a good actor in these roles, they’re saying they were attracted to the characters he played so Heard deserved to be put through this public 3 ring circus Depp’s subjecting her to. It made me wonder how much Depp’s damage control team has been paying so many people to take to social media to try to crush Heard because surely there can’t be this many ignorant people out there. But then it became clear none of this is actually about Depp himself, this weird support is about the characters he’s played in the past. These people are truly screwed up and anything Depp pulls in real life is a-okay to them. Take this, for example: Depp texts his friends, “Let’s burn Amber!!! Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.” He read this out in court, and then tried to excuse it claiming that it reavealed the depth of his pain. The frothing fans jumped to Depps defense. These nutbars have deluded themselves into thinking Depp’s admitted abusive behaviour is glamorous and Heard’s abuse is damnable based on the imaginary, not reality. To witness so many women (and men) en masse attempting to publicly humiliate Amber Heard while ignoring the abhorrent evidence openly admitted to without any modicum of remorse by Depp is disgusting. Men spewing anger against Amber Heard to use this case to draw attention to the fact that women abusers exist is equally nauseating and equally as abusive as their issue. But perhaps the most disturbing are the “lawyers” throwing their cereal-box-degree two cents in without fully hearing the facts and completely ignoring what Depp has happily and consistently admitted to: he was a drug and alcohol fueled addict with a penchant for phyiscal and emtional abuse. Wait — wtf? Based on what the expert witnesses have said, most healthy people don’t wake up wanting to abuse their nearest and dearest physically, verbally, emotionally, or psychologically. Most healthy people avoid people or situations that drive them to extreme reactions. To hear it told in this embarrassing, dirty-laundry airing court case that Depp thinks is going to recover the career he fucked up himself, Depp and Heard knew full well about each other’s volatility and negative personality traits before getting married. But like relationships throughout time, these two decided to ignore the blinking, larger-than-life, neon red flags and jump into “my love for you can fix this” relationship mode. For most of us, fictitious movie romances programmed us with unrealistic relationship expectations. But even in movies friends or family try to intervene to save our hero and heroine from guaranteed misery — so…where were Depp and Heard's people? Few, if any, friends or family on either side seem to have risked being cast off the gravy train to warn Depp and Heard that they might not just be MFEO. Anybody speaking up right now has something to lose if they do including old girlfriends/ boyfriends who have experienced Depps crazy, violent episodes — they’re not new or unique to Heard. And, in the name of saving themselves from retribution, how many others have suffered from abusive behaviour by either Depp or Heard have refused to speak up because of threats, intimidation, or being paid to shut up? Shame on anyone who didn’t validate any of the abuse that they, too, went through with either of these actors. But how are these gutless former lovers, family, and goldfish-poop enablers any different from the ticket-paying lumpen who fund these celebrities’ lifestyles? They’re not. Motives are motives and anyone who doesn’t stand up to abuse is an accomplice to abuse. The people sitting around the Oscars watching Will Smith slap Chris Rock and not stepping in to confront Smith? By doing absolutely nothing, they glamorized abuse. They’re also accomplices, in my books. Rock was left there traumatized, Smith sat down like he had every right to explode. Everybody just sat there. Seriously? Wtf? There is no rank to abuse —no “just a little” or “a lot”. You don’t need to be a famous actor to be nominated worst fucking human of the year, but the fact that Depp even launched this pay-back attempt case is undeniable evidence of his abusive and ungentlemanly behaviour (his acting skills for even this couldn’t pull it off on the witness stand). This is the “nail in the coffin” of his career material that he’s hammered in himself. Watching Depp destroy himself in front of the whole wide world is a textbook example of a narcissistic abuser: when they’re called out, any accountability for their actions turns into a blubbering justification for perpetrating heinous acts against someone they have no respect for. He had his lawyers bring in self-damning evidence and he laughingly admitted to it. Let’s be honest — nobody “made” Depp (or Heard ) behave the way the world now knows they did; like thumbs, reason is what separates humans from animals. There is no acceptable reason, now or ever, that abuse is excusable regardless of what elevated status in society Depp or Heard have been brainwashed into believing they had. But a sense of the grandiose is in every abuser, when you look at it. However, the issues here go far deeper than the superficiality “fans” have dumbed this case down to. Depp and Heard, to whatever extent they are popularized and glamorized, are only each of us but in different meat suits. We all “know better” when we’re in the same type of relationship. Today in the few minutes of court that I listened in on, Heard sounded intelligent enough to have taken the nearest exit out of the relationship umpteen times before she married Depp. Dammit, haven’t we all learned by now from movies that that bringing out the worst in each other is not love? None of this would have happened if either of these two had had the balls to say “seeya” and the world might still have Jack Sparrow to save the Pirates series. To be driven to the point of reacting violently when pushed to the extreme is in all of us. But to have Heard relive the abuse again in front of the world in retribution for Depp’s inability to take responsibility for his own career demise is proof that she was right; he is insufferably self-righteous and abusive. The article condemning abuse that Heard wrote isn’t what killed his career and this waste of time court case is just Depp proving how abusive he is. Heard’s batshit crazy and violent? Depp could have left at anytime but for myriad reasons did not and has obviously still not been able to give up trying to control Heard’s life. Seriously — for all of the “rehab” he’s had and how reformed he says he is now, blaming Heard for destroying his career through an apres-court-case-he-lost op-ed after all of the evidence he’s admitted to shows him leagues away from the victim he’s presented himself to be. His diabetes-causing “poor me” verbal syrup while revealing his true, misogynistic character is revealing. Heard’s actions are revealing as well. These people have deep psychological problems and they’re being aired on prime time when they’re nobody’s business. These are real peoples’ lives being turned into a spectator sport by a butt-hurt ex husband. This is reality, not the sit-com Depp tried to turn it into in the court room. And the bottom line is that at any time before or during their relationship, Depp and Heard could have called it quits but they didn’t. This is sick, it’s not love. It’s a cautionary tale to anyone thinking they would like to be in a relationship with either of these two. If we ourselves haven’t been in an abusive relationship like this, we’ve seen it happen. There’s nothing remotely attractive about this couple’s court case or the abuse perpetrated by each other. Think about it: if either Johnny Depp or Amber Heard were pulling this on your sister/ brother/ best friend or pet even, would the abuse still be excusable? Check out the current statistics on abuse; they aren’t glamourous, in fact, you probably wouldn’t wish them on your worst enemy. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence has some facts for the #justiceforjohnnydepp and #justiceforamberheard noisemaker (download the factsheet to throw out there when you’re taking sides on the Depp v. Heard case): On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men. 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have been victims of severe physical violence (e.g., beating, burning, strangling) by an intimate partner in their lifetime. On a typical day, there are more than 20,000 phone calls placed to domestic violence hotlines nationwide. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide by 500%. Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. Domestic victimization is correlated with a higher rate of depression and suicidal behavior. None of these statistics can be ignored because an actor dressed up as a character and went to a children’s hospital for some good PR, or because some deluded actress decided to think standing by watching a drug addict detox is part of the definition of love and taking it out on him when real life didn’t offer her a statue. If you haven’t personally ever suffered abuse, I applaud you but also encourage you to educate yourself on the various kinds of abuse there are that you could mistakenly be thinking is “normal”. And this is possibly one of the saddest parts of this publicized breakdown: somewhere, somehow in their own personal lives pre-famedom, these two human beings were taught that abuse is part of a normal life. Media wants people to take sides, vilify one party, condemn the other. If people were to view these two popularized human beings as exactly that — human beings, perhaps the lens on these two actors would pan over to the real issue: regardless of who is doing it or who it’s happening to, abuse is insideous and reprehensible. In 2022 where mental health is openly advocated and help is more readily available than at any other time in history, the acceptance and glamorizing of abuse should be at an all-time low. Abusers, like in this current court case in Virginia, will excuse themselves, lie, twist the truth, gaslight, and point their fingers at everyone else but themselves. The adage “when you point one finger, three fingers are pointing back at you” seems to hover over the witness box in a cartoon cloud. Only this time “it’s different” and excusable because Johnny Depps’s drug-fed ego spun out of control and Disney cut his contract, so Amber Heard has to have her private counselling sessions broadcast to world how many years after their divorce? Has Depp no shame or sense of embarrassment? Everything about this court case indicates a huge no. Launching this court case is just another classic example of abuse because of self-sabotage — are any of the fans seeing a pattern yet? Jesus, wtf. And here’s another “give your head a shake” point to consider: the outcome of this case affects whether it’s okay to abuse someone because speaking up about it might bring a whole new wave of abuse in the form of public humiliation from the abuser who can’t get their brain to wrap around the fact that they’re weak, sick, and and the world is watching them implode their career. I’m no MENSA candidate, but it sure looks like continued drug abuse. From now on, every time either of these two show up in the news with a new relationship there will be a collective clock ticking on the breakup headline because neither of these two seems to have had any epiphanies, from what I’m seeing. But hey, that’s the price of fame, right? What do you mean it’s nobody’s business? Depp is making it everybody’s business with this frivolous court case. The whole world knows about Depp and Heard’s insane life because they chose it — all of it. It’s heartbreaking. Depp’s still trying to throw punches in court. Insults and laughing when he thinks he’s hurting Heard says more about his misogyny than anything else. He played this character wrong — he should have went for the poster boy against abuse rather than attempting to inflict more abuse on Heard through this. This is another futile attempt to gain control over any aspect of her life, but he never will. This has backfired on him spectacularly, regardless of the outcome in court. In fact, you have to hand it to Heard — she’s not intimidated by Depp. No matter what the outcome of this act of the Depp-Heard play, she’s already won in the long run. She’s giving power to abused victims everywhere to stand up to the abuser, and this will outweigh any negative PR she’s incurred because her unwillingness to let Depp continue to abuse her trumps Depp’s final attempt to stay in her life. This is the material that legends are made of. The Depp v Heard case isn’t news, it’s just another PR move for attention only the set is courthouse in a jurisdiction where real justice is less likely to favour truth but benefit from the notariety it gains. Depp and Heard are human beings who get paid a lot of money to play fictitious characters, and this can detract people interested in this kind of drama to choose a side mainly based on appearances and ignoring the reality that this case is about abuse.Everyone— male or female — who has ever suffered from abuse or seen the effects of it should be calling out these “fans” and whoever is advocating this including TikTok, Twitter, Facebook or other social media pandering to this garbage. To the #justiceforjohnnydepp/ #justiceforamberheard and laughable “lawyers” needing to gain a minute amount of notoriety through endorsing abuse by celebrities on social media: educate yourselves on the real issues going on here; it could happen to you. Movie producers blacklisting abusers — sure, everyone knows this move is more of a PR stunt than a message, but if it scares some celebrities straight, we’ll take it. To anyone who turns your head the other way or lies about abuse thinking you’re saving your own hide, shame on you and karma knows where you live. Perhaps one of the most frightening parts of this shameful public display is that this case will be used as a precedent in the future, and will remain significant whatever the outcome; this case will send some kind of message. Hopefully the jury chooses one that advances human rights, not one that gets them an autograph from a self-imploded movie star. Ultimately, the only truth in any of this Depp v. Heard thing is that abuse is not never excusable, it’s not glamorous; it’s destructive and devastating and there are no “winners” taking awards home. The only side to take is the one that actively stops abuse in our own, glamorous and non-glamorous corners of the world. Make the world a better place, “fans”, and stop glamorizing abuse. Fin."
7,Artist James Carter to Destroy Paintings in Public Display for Charity,arts-entertainment," I will be destroying four original oil paintings in the middle of Nelson Town Centre, and then putting the remains into epoxy resin to create a whole new artwork. I will then auction off NFT’s of the original paintings and donate the earnings to the charity Team Trees. I am also publishing a book alongside this project which will explain to people about how they, as individuals can make one of the largest impacts that will help the environment. I would like to bring the community together to witness the destruction of these works, as they will be the only people to ever see these works in person. James Carter I am the artist who has created and organised this, but I am working in par with In-Situ (a project art organisation based in Lancashire). This is a project that I have been set at Nelson & Colne College for my final year about how to “Re-Imagine” Nelson Town. I will be putting on a performance presentation for the destruction of these artworks in Nelson Town Centre. The idea of this project for me is to promote the use of environmentally friendly materials, and encourage individuals to make changes to their daily lives that will not only help the world and environment but also teach people on how people can save some money by making these changes. I will have four original oil paintings in the size of A2 canvas, that are recreations of an old photograph of the canal in nelson that will show a time before we cultivated the land, with animals running free, another one that will show a time during the industrial revolution, as well as one variation of what will happen if we continue to make no change where loads of pollution and plastic is scattered everywhere, and another variation which shows what will happen if we do make a change to help the environment which will show clean skies, and beautiful trees, and show the return of the animals. These paintings are going to be put through a tree shredder in the middle of the town centre. I want to draw in the community for this experience, as the people who come to see the artworks, will be the only people to ever see these works live in person. After the works are shredded up, I will put the remains into epoxy resin (which will demonstrate a way of recycling, and “re-imagining”) this will create an entirely new artwork. The destruction of these works will also be live-streamed on YouTube to bring in a larger audience. I will be selling NFT’s of the original paintings as well on OpenSea, where anyone can bid for them, and the money gained from the sales will be donated to the environmental charity Team Trees to help the world. James Carter OpenSea Alongside this, I have published a book called “Time To Make The Change” which focuses on teaching people how they can make a change to help the environment, and future generations, as well as how they can save money by implementing what I’ve written about. It teaches people that they don’t just need to rely on large companies, and countries to make a change, as if more people make the changes I’ve written about, we can make one of the largest impacts to help the environment. The event will take place in the middle of Nelson Town Centre, BB9 7RU, on the 14 May, 12-2pm. You can see the artworks that will be destroyed below. www.jamescarterart.com"

9,Klara’s (Klara and The Sun) unreliability based on naivety and forgetfulness highlights her human features.,arts-entertainment," ABSTRACT It is widely acknowledged that Kazuo Ishiguro favours creating first-person unreliable storytellers. His earlier unreliable narrators from novels such as A pale View of Hills, An artist of the Floating World, Remains of the Day or Never Let Me Go have been thoroughly analysed. However, the (un)reliability of the storytellers from his most recent books, Nocturnes, The Buried Giant, or Klara and The Sun appears to be taken for granted and has not been so widely investigated. This article attempts to examine the fallibility of Klara – Ishiguro’s most recent narrator. The paper will prove her unreliability and it will propose factors which constitute her untruthful account and it will also investigate reasons behind her inaccurate account. The analysis is placed within the field of narratology and it requites the knowledge of the term “unreliable narrator”. The article only focuses on Klara’s narrowed understanding of the world which broadens with time, her naivety and her forgetful nature, however, surely there are more factors and functions which may be responsible for her unreliability, which merits a further discussion. Klara and the Sun is a science-fiction, dystopian novel written by Kazuo Ishiguro and published in March of 2021. The story takes place the USA in an unspecified, disturbingly near future. It is told through Klara's perspective. Klara is a solar powered, artificial friend chosen by Josie who is a mysteriously ill girl to be her childhood companion. During the novel, Klara grows-up. She learns about the beautiful, unique, yet mysterious nature of human heart. She gets to know about sacrifice and what it means love. Klara may be labelled as a typical narrator from Ishiguro's novels. Her story is subjective, told past her prime and it consists of an episodical form. During the interview after receiving a Nobel Prize in December 2017, Ishiguro discussed the characters-narrators he favours: I think earlier in my career I was always very interested in looking at individuals who struggled with their past and their memories. So typically, I would look at a character in late middle age or old age. Someone who had been quite proud of himself or herself, but then quite late in life gains a perspective about his life. Let us just say his life. And he starts to think Oh actually, I had all my values wrong, I backed the wrong things, I backed the wrong causes. Does that mean my life has been wasted? I lived my life by the wrong values even though for most of my life I thought I was living by the right values (The Nobel Prize). Ishiguro himself admits that he is fascinated with a subjective perspective of a storyteller, rather than reporting objective facts. He usually presents an old or middle-aged individuals who rethink and revaluate their life choices. Similarly, to Etsuko from The Pale View of Hills, Ono from An Artist of the Floating World, Stevens from Remains of the Day, and Kate from Never Let Me Go, Klara is past her prime. She spends her remaining days in a junkyard, and instead of socialising she prefers reliving her life, recalling her memories, and rethinking her decisions – just like the other narrators from Ishiguro’s previous works. What is more, all the storytellers mentioned above are homodiegetic, autodiegetic narrators who focus on the stories of their lives. They themselves choose how to picture the tale, which automatically makes their narratives subjective. Klara’s story is no exception. Her mental abilities are composed of an algorithm, which is responsible for the knowledge she possesses, and of cognitive skills, which allow her to observe, analyse the world and draw her own conclusions about it. Yet, sometimes the reality Klara encounters is far too complex for her to comprehend, and it exceeds her knowledge as well as her intellectual abilities. As a result, she perceives the world as a set of boxes: What was more, the room’s space had become divided into twenty-four boxes – arranged in two tiers – all the way to the rear wall. Because of this partitioning, it was hard to gain an overall view of what was before me, but I gradually made sense of things (80-1). Usually, Klara divides the reality into boxes when she encounters new places, new situations, new emotions, and new people for the first time because the new data sometimes is too complicated for her. Such a depiction resembles a cubist painting. Although according to the Tate Museum, such works of art “appear fragmented and abstracted”, they also aspire to present various viewpoints at the same time and space, allowing the audience to see a broader perspective and provides more material to analyse. Klara’s perception is limited so she tries to give it more context, to gain more perspective and disassemble complex issues into primary factors which would be more comprehensible for her and give her more room for an interpretation. Therefore, the implied reader can infer that she is not an infallible machine which would have an objective answer to each question. If some issue transgresses a machine’s algorithm, it will not be able to produce an anticipated response. Klara, however, is not a typical machine. She always attempts to solve a problem which is out of her reach using her cognitive skills. Thus, making the way her tale is presented more human-like. Moreover, all the stories mentioned above are composed of episodical forms. These are the flashbacks to the narrators' younger years. Therefore, it makes their narratives highly subjective – all the reader is faced with are the events which are deemed by the narrator as memorable and worth telling. Stevens from Remains of the Day, embarks on a journey to visit his old friend, co-worker and presumably the love of his life, Miss Kenton. During his trip, he recalls his younger days in Darlington Hall as a butler. Kate H., the narrator from Never Let Me Go, is a thirty-year-old woman whose life will soon end because she is to become a donor of vital organs. She tells her tale in three parts in forms of analepsis and prolepsis. Firstly, she describes her childhood at Hailsham. Secondly, she depicts her adolescence at the Cottages and lastly, she presents her life as a Carer. Klara, similarly, is a robot-carer whose stay at Josie's home has just ended. She is not as efficient and useful as she once has been, so she spends her remaining days in a junkyard recalling some of the crucial events during her stay at the AF shop and then her life at Josie's home. What is more, all Ishiguro novels contain an unreliable storyteller and Klara is no exception. The notion of a fallible storyteller will be discussed in the next paragraphs. In Klara and the Sun, the audience is faced yet again with an unreliable storyteller. However, this one is highly unusual. Klara is not a human – she is a robot. One would think that machines are infallible. That they are not likely to deceive, their memories cannot be flawed, and the data they provide is absolutely precise. Nevertheless, Klara refutes all stereotypes. Her narrative is defective because of her limited, child-like perspective, her naivety, and forgetting. 3.1.	 Klara’s mental and emotional development broadens her perspective In her article “Kazuo Ishiguro’s ‘Klara and the Sun’ is a haunting tale of love, loss and...a robot”, Isabelle Senechal argues that Klara’s tale may be reliable when it comes to describing facts, however, the author questions Klara’s emotional accuracy. As an example of Klara’s emotional limitation, the writer describes a situation when Klara is in the shop, and it is her turn to represent all artificial friends in the front alcove. One day she witnesses a fight between two taxi drivers. Based on their body language and facial expressions, she can identify their emotions quite accurately. Nevertheless, she is incapable of feeling empathy towards them (26-7). The event takes place closely to the beginning of the story when Klara has almost no experience at all. Therefore, she should not be judged primarily based on this happening because during the course of the novel she develops mentally as well as emotionally. At the beginning of the story, her perception is limited and the range of emotions available to her is restricted. Firstly, she is only acquainted with basic emotions, such as sadness or happiness. One day, when Klara is again in the front alcove, she observes the death, as she assumes, of a beggar and his dog. She states than upon seeing them she feels sadness (Klara and the Sun 45-6). Earlier in the novel she watches an old couple who has not seen each other in years, and she speculates what kinds of emotions they feel. She identifies happiness but, at the same time, she notices sadness, which she cannot understand. She deems it a paradox. She asks the Manager about it, and she soon learns that it is possible to feel two such different emotions all at once. She even tries to imagine herself in such a situation and she wonders what feeling would accompany her (28-30). However, later, she learns a whole range of new, more complex emotions. One day, Josie feels too ill to go on a small trip to Morgan Waterfall. Instead, the Mother takes Klara to go with her. The Mother utters that she is envious of Klara not having any feelings. As a response Klara states that the more, she observes, she more feelings are available for her. Later, as she is asked whether she likes the place she presents a wide scope of emotions: “I didn’t mean to seem ungrateful. I’m very pleased to see the waterfall. But perhaps also a regretful Josie couldn’t be with us” (Klara and the Sun 108-9). Based on this small encounter, the reader may notice that she feels more complex, extreme emotions all at once, such as gratefulness, thankfulness, satisfaction but also remorse, in comparison to the Klara from the front alcove who wondered about happiness and sadness. She matures emotionally. Therefore, she should not be solely judged based on her initial emotional ignorance. Thus, her reliability when it comes to emotional accuracy, charges throughout the course of the novel. Not only does she grow up emotionally, but also, she develops mentally. She is fascinated with human behaviour and the world outside. She is exceptionally content when she has the chance to spend the day in the front alcove because in this way she can observe the reality behind the shop window, which is new and exciting for her. At the beginning of the novel, she likes to estimate how old people from the outside are and what happens in their minds. She is honest about her mistakes and she herself states that she may misjudge, she may not be fully correct: “I estimated he was fifteen, though I couldn’t be sure” (Klara and the Sun 68). Klara guesses, learns, analyses, interprets. She is curious and inquisitive. She gets to know the world. When she is at the shop, her perception is limited – she only sees passers-by, taxis, and buildings – all behind the glass. However, later in the novel she experiences her first time being outside of the shop as well as outside Josie’s home, her first time seeing a waterfall, her first trip on her own and many more. Firstly, she is Josie’s companion, a friend, and a nanny but then she becomes her guardian and a mother-figure, as if, when she is ready to sacrifice herself in order to save Josie, as she believes. She develops like a real person. She grows up like a child to become a responsible adult. The reader embarks with Klara on a journey which broadens her perspective making her tale more and more reliable. 3.2.	Klara’s naivety Klara’s unreliability may also be traced based on her naivety, despite her emotional and mental maturing. She is an android which is powered by solar energy. In the novel, the Sun is not only the major star in our solar system, but it is a character in the story. It is a personified god-like deity. Klara and other Artificial Friends believe in the Sun. Already at the beginning of the narrative, the reader is faced with the robots almost worshipping the Sun. They are worried that the rays of the Sun may not touch them if they stand at the back of the shop, and they will not be able to function properly. Nevertheless, they truly believe that “the Sun [has] ways of reaching [them] wherever [they are]” (Klara and the Sun 9). One day during her stay in the front alcove Klara thinks that she sees a dead beggar man and his dog. The empirical reader supposes that they are rather asleep. However, Klara believes that the Sun has wanted to punish humanity for causing Pollution. The next they the machine which causes contamination of environment is gone. The man and his dog are alive again. Klara believes that they are brought back to life because the Pollution is gone, and the Sun is again content with the human species (Klara and the Sun 45-6). This situation gives her the idea to seek health for Josie at the Sun. She prays fervently several times in the barn where she is told that the sun is going to rest (Klara and the Sun 124-7, 284-90). It may appear slightly ridiculous, absurd, and untruthful for the authorial audience as well as narrative audience because even though they are a dystopian society the world known to the authorial audience is the one of their past. 3.3.	Forgetting Klara’s tale is also contaminated with forgetting which is a human trait. Even through, a reader expects machines to keep all the data saved throughout the years, Klara makes a sacrifice in order to save Josie and she gives some of a very important chemical component to destroy a machine which produces Pollution. She believes that in this way the Pollution would disappear, and the Sun would be so satisfied with her work that it would heal Josie (236-9). After her task is completed, she loses a part of her cognitive abilities, she becomes disoriented (250-5). After this accident Josie is healed and matures. The next step in her life is going to the university and she does not need her Artificial Friend anymore. Klara spends her remaining days in a junkyard where she recollects her memories: Over the last few days, some of my memories have started to overlap in curious ways. For instance, the dark sky morning when the Sun saved Josie, the trip to Morgan’s Falls and the illuminated diner Mr Vance chose will come into my mind, merged together into a single setting. The Mother will be standing with her back to me, watching the mist from the waterfall. Yet I am not watching her from the wooden picnic bench, but instead from my booth in Mr Vance’s diner. And although Mr Vance isn’t visible, I can hear his unkind words coming from across the aisle. Meanwhile, above the Mother and the waterfall, the dark clouds have gathered, the same dark clouds that gathered the morning the Sun saved Josie, small cylinders and pyramids flying by in the wind. (313). At the end she clearly states that it is difficult for her to recall a certain memory and that it all vanishes into one. When Klara narrates her story, there is a certain distance between the beginning of her tale and the moment which is contemporary to her. Although her story is told with precision in details, it still could be affected by her current state. To conclude, it may be stated that Klara’s narrative is unreliable because she only starts to learn about the world she lives in, and some information is restricted from her. However, when she develops mentally and emotionally, she gains a broader perspective which allows her to narrate the story more reliably. Despite her unreliability, she has a child-like honesty which makes it impossible not to have positive feelings towards her. Moreover, while considering her unreliability one may include her naivety and her flawed memory. In 2008 Susannah Hunnewell interviewed Kazuo Ishiguro about his works. Asked about Never Let Me Go, the writer answered that the novel asks several questions, such as: “What does it mean to be a human being? It’s a secular route to the Dostoyevskian question, what a soul is?” It seems that seventeen years after the publication of the novel, he still touches upon the same, complex subject in his latest work – Klara and the Sun. The implied author forces his implied reader to further reflections. Kathy H. is a clone whose humanity is contested. She is based on an actual human being while Klara is a robot who blurs the line between human and android (Askew R.K. 181). Klara is a machine. Yet, one can successfully find human traits within her – she develops mentally and emotionally. She grows up like a child and she learns what it means to love. Even her unreliable tale is a feature of a subjective tale narrated by a human-character. However, the unanswered question remains: Could she wholly, fully, and successfully learn Josie’s heart if the ending were different? The novel appears to be asking even more complex and general questions – Is it possible for machines to replace humans one day? Is there something unique about each person? What does it mean to have a heart/ a soul? Answers to these questions seems to be found within the pages of the novel itself. Klara can walk like Josie, she is able to speak like Josie, it is possible for her to pretend to be Josie but she in not Josie. In the car Josie’s father undermines Klara’s ability to become Josie because learning Josie’s heart “might indeed be the hardest part of Josie to learn” (230). Paul compares human heat to the infinite number of rooms to explore. On the other hand, Klara thinks that human heart is limited, and it could be learnt (229-36). Eventually, she concludes on her own that she would never be successful in replacing Josie: Mr Capaldi believed there was nothing special inside Josie that couldn’t be continued. He told the Mother he’d searched and searched and found nothing like that. But I believe now he was searching in the wrong place. There was something very special, but it wasn’t inside Josie. It was inside those who loved her. (318) Klara believes that humans are unique and the bonds between them are special. It is the relationships with other human beings are what makes people what they are. No matter how hard Klara would attempt to be Josie, she would never repeat and continue Josie’s relationships with her family and her friends because Klara would not have the same feelings as Josie would. Therefore, she would not develop in the same way as the real Josie would. Today’s world develops very fast, new technology is speeding. Klara may be equipped with human traits but the newer model in the shop lack empathy which makes them less and less human-like. The novel seems to convey no matter what, machines could never replace humans. Klara and the Sun is a dystopian, science fiction tale of an android who learns about and lives in the human world. Klara is similar to other narrators of Ishiguro as her subjective, episodical story composed of analepsis is told from a perspective of an old individual reflecting on their life like in A Pale View of Hills, An Artist of the Floating World, Remains of the Day, or Never Let Me Go. The difference is that she is a robot who is decaying in a junkyard. What also links all the narrators, is their unreliable way of telling a story. Despite Klara’s honesty, she may be considered an unreliable narrator because throughout the course of the novel she develops and her initially narrow perspective becomes broader, more knowledge and more emotions are available to her. Yet, she is naïve and may be forgetful. Klara as the narrator of the story carries a significant function. She transgresses the line between human and robot. She resembles a child, a friend, a companion, and a guardian. Moreover, her unreliable narrative highlights her human traits. At first, she believes that it is possible to replace humans with machines but later she sees it impossible because each person is unique because of relationships with other people.

10,The Top 5 Trip-Hop Albums Of All Time,arts-entertainment," Slow, chilled-out beats, haunting vocals, and eclectic samples are all hallmarks of the funk, reggae, and hip-hop influenced brand of electronic music that came to be known as trip-hop. Originating in Bristol, a city located in the South West of England, trip-hop quickly captured worldwide attention, spawned some global superstars, and influenced generations of artists to come. But which trip-hop albums are regarded as the best of the bunch? Let’s take a look at 5 commonly cited classics and give you the chance to check them out for yourself. Massive Attack’s Blue Lines (1991) is one of the most prominent - and one of the first - albums of the trip-hop genre. Unlike many of the subsequent trip-hop albums released, Massive Attack’s tracks captured the darker edge of electronic music, permeated by scratchy sampling and haunting electro elements that give the album a sense of disquiet against the chilled out backing. Blue Lines was an unquestionably influential album, fusing a wide breadth of Black genres including rap, hip hop, reggae, and soul with a dark electro twist. The intro track Safe From Harm is a jarring opening to the album, with an agitated baseline riﬀ and edgy rap verses that complement Nelson’s haunting vocals of ‘If you hurt what’s mine, I’ll sure as hell retaliate’. There is a sense of suspense throughout the song, amplified by the twitchy electric guitar that sets this track apart from the typical trip-hop feel. This disconcerting feel is amplified by the bluesy melancholia of One Love, which combines catchy repetition with the soulful male vocals of reggae roots singer Horace Andy. Its minimalist approach eﬀectively creates a melodic ambience that is darkly atmospheric. Be Thankful For What You’ve Got lifts the album to a chill-out vibe with a touch of soul and a bouncy bassline that harmonises perfectly with the vocals. There are electronic elements throughout the track, but this is a complement more than a feature, not detracting from the heart of the melody. This track is classic, memorable, and adds a touch of lightness to the album which adds yet another layer to the complexity of Massive Attack’s music. Blue Lines is a fundamental foundation of the trip-hop category, and a complex and skilful approach to combining genres. This 1997 classic by Smoke City is an addictive fusion of trip-hop and acid jazz, expertly combining hypnotic Latin American beats with the seductively smoky female vocals of singer Nina Miranda and a modern electro twist. The most notable track of the album is, of course, the classic Underwater Love, which features the exotic percussive rhythms of Brazilian samba, and dreamy electric guitar. The electro elements are mellow and rounded, giving the bubbling sensation of being underwater, while the included samples of rainforest sounds transport the listener to a tropical paradise. Miranda’s vocals are instrumental in grounding the experience and providing the focus for the eclectic mix of trip-hop and jazz elements. This deliciously sensuous first song is perfectly juxtaposed against the next track, Devil Mood, which is dark and delicious, the deep, booming drums sending deep roots into the soul of the melody. Whereas the electronic elements of Underwater Love are fluidly melodic, in Devil Mood they adopt a new persona: glitchy and hard, bringing a sense of dark futurism that brings the classically Latin beats into the modern age. This is then lifted by the light and breezy With You, in which Miranda’s versatile voice becomes gently lilting - the strings creating a sense of soaring through blue skies, the just-there rhythms leaving you wanting more. This rollercoaster of an album guides you through an addictive concoction of blue skies and the deepest depths of ocean and earth, floating and tumbling through the elements. Their style is eclectic and unmistakable: creating a classic trip-hop album that has lasted throughout the decades. This is a dreamy, sultry album that is a perfect complement for balmy summer nights! The aptly-named Smokers Delight has been a stoner classic since its release in 1995, and is a playful take on the trip-hop genre, with heady reggae, funk, and Latin beats lifted to a light and airy buzz by echoey sample tracks and techno elements. Their use of vocals is a light touch, placing most emphasis on their creative use of percussion, funky bass, and electronic components. Smokers Delight is a delightfully chilled genre mash-up that comprises multiple layers which play together harmoniously and in a deceptively simple manner. It is the perfect go-to for a chill-out album – there’s just enough interest to keep the listener hooked, while the sounds do not require involved listening. This laid-back, sunny set is a lasting classic of the trip-hop genre; a smooth, sweet delight of an album, leaving the listener with a taste of pina colada on the beach in their mouth and the feeling of sunlight on their skin. Kid Loco’s sumptuously mellow album brings a fun and unique approach to the trip-hop genre, hitting a sweet spot with a heady blend of chill out and psychedelia. The near-namesake track A Grand Love Theme is smooth and nostalgic, and it glides like a plane on a stream of airy strings. This soothing soundscape is perfectly complemented by the audio samples, which break up the repetition and ground the track. Deep male vocals then add a richness to the airy backing. The breathy vocals of Katrina Mitchell are featured on Love Me Sweet, which is a sweet dream of a song, carrying you away on a cloud of twanging sitar and playful xylophone. The rhythms are consistently chilled but intriguingly varied and almost trance-like, sinking the listener into a deep state of relaxation. Sister Curare adds a darker and deeper feel to the album, with an opening audio sample narrating a spate of bank robberies in 1979. The clashing piano keys, experimental guitar and sax, and interspersed audio samples create an eclectic feel, which is streamlined by the consistent drum loops. This chaotic track seems at first to be at odds with the rest of the album, but in fact, it provides variety, keeping you on your toes from the beginning to the end. A Grand Love Story is a mesmeric daydream of an album, delving into trance-like psychedelic baselines and airy melodies that are always unique, never predictable. Listening to Portishead is like drinking a cup of good coﬀee. It is dark and bittersweet, and the flavour lingers on your tongue long after you have tasted it. Beth Gibbons’ vocals are haunting and sit in perfect balance with the instrumentation and electro elements. Despite the scratching techno elements, Portishead achieve a sense of harmony and sophistication that is smooth to the taste and draws you in in a manner that is at once complex and seemingly eﬀortless. Each of the tracks is a perfect complement to each other: this is an album that should be listened to in its entirety. Could it be called chill out? Perhaps not: there is a dark mystique that permeates their songs, in a way that is not typical of the genre. But it is a coolly thrilling approach to easy- listening that makes for an intriguing listen. Dummy is a haunting album, and a fascinating contribution to electronic music that will remain relevant for many decades to come."
11,Review on The Longest Yard 2005 film,arts-entertainment," Being a professional athlete may give you some benefits but not a jail-free pass. Former NFL quarterback Paul Crewe, played by comedian Adam Sandler, finds himself in a Texas jail after violating his parole. Instead of going to a party with his girlfriend, he got drunk, took his girlfriend’s BMW for a spin and crashing it, eventually landing in jail. The prison warden, Rudolph Hazen (played by Canadian Screen Award Best Actor James Cromwell), who is a football fan takes interest in Crewe. After he was beaten by some prison guards and coerced in helping the prison football team become better, Crewe declared playing a game of football against prison inmates would help their confidence more. He encounters several different personalities, reactions and hindrances while trying to recruit fellow inmates to form a team. He is assisted by Caretaker (Chris Rock) who has somewhat of a connection inside and outside the prison walls, and coached by Nate Scarborough another former football player. Scarborough is played by Burt Reynolds who played the original starring character. The inmates’ team won the game. Rotten Tomatoes, a film and TV review aggregator website gave the The Longest Yard (2005) a 31% freshness score, earning it a ‘rotten’ rating. Most critics gave the film a not so stellar review since they preferred the original 1974 film. Despite the low rating given by Rotten Tomatoes, the movie earned $190 million in the box office. The movie has quite the clichéd Adam Sandler humor fans love, has a little bit of dark comedy and violence that some people appreciates and quite the curious guard versus inmates characterization. All throughout the film the audience will find entertainment in watching how the characters, both major and minor, interact among their group (inmates) and against the other prison guards. The film gave insight on what some prison may have as past time activities for everybody and it also showcased the camaraderie that inmates can have despite their differences in skin color, preferences, opinion, and gravity of crime. Much like the original movie, The Longest Yard (2005 film) also has several notable actors and athletes as cast such as William Fichtner, Terry Crews, Kevin Nash, Steve ‘Stone Cold’ Austin and Brian Bosworth. The soundtrack has mix of rock and hip hop music genre. So to conclude this is one of the best prison movie of all time that will make you laugh throughout the entire enfolding."

14,Stay Strong - Believe,arts-entertainment," Stay Strong (and believe) My name is Peter Gallinari. I am a recording artist (Keyboardist, Singer, Songwriter) originally from NY and now resides in Nashville. I also work for the government. Yes, two separate lives.  I have been asked many times how I got involved in the music business and how did it start. It was and still is a journey. Always learning and taking the time to listen from others who know more than I do. As you go along this winding road of life, remember to always stay humble. You need to stay strong and believe in who you are and where you want to be, but never forget where you came from. You need to be the magic to make it happen. It doesn't just come to you. My Story: Born and raised in Brooklyn NY. Italian boy living in Bensonhurst and Bayridge areas, this boy is the one who was picked on from the time I entered school right into my High School years. When I was born mom was told that there may have been something wrong with me in sense of proper motor skills. Well, I fooled them; I was walking at the age of 8 months old. But, over the years they saw that I really couldn’t run like the other kids. I was also very skinny with a narrow face and always had my mouth open. When I closed my mouth, you were still able to fit your hand in between the space. So yes, I guess I was a target for kids to make fun of. This was so hard and every day of my life as a kid was a struggle. Finally, at the age of 21 a doctor in NY performed a free surgery on me and corrected my jaw. (First time this surgery was ever performed in the USA). The surgery was totally amazing and something I will never forget, but in the meantime, I was so damaged with a sense of low self-esteem and confidence in myself that it made it a daily struggle. To regress back, in my teenage years I discovered I had talent. I could play keyboards and sing. This was my savior. (Never had any formal instructions) My senior year in high school the curtains opened, and I was the lead vocalist and keyboardist in one of the best rock bands in Brooklyn. Now suddenly you have friends, oh and girls that now want to at least say hi and have a conversation. Moving forward now to my adult years I was developing a sense of confidence that I could do something, and something not everyone else can do. Still, I needed more. I would go to concerts and come home and cry in my studio room because I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t that person on stage performing. Since I was never a party person (Never drank, smoked or did drugs) I stayed in my little studio room and played and wrote songs. In 1994 I met an amazing lady by the name of Angel Wallenda (Of the flying Wallenda’s – She walked the wire with a prosthetic leg). Without going into all this detail of how we met, I ended up writing a song for her which she used as her theme song for her shows. She also told me that I would make something out of myself with my music. At this point I was already in my mid 40’s and basically said “thank you” but I knew there was no chance of this ever happening. Well in 1995, the USA was hit with its first terrorist attack on USA grounds. It was the Oklahoma City bombing disaster. I happen to be out that day at a rehearsal, and my family was out of town visiting family. I came home and turned on the TV and saw the news. There was one vision that really got to me, a fireman carrying this little child full of blood. So, I totally lost it. My children were out of town, and I had no way of just holding them. My next move was to go into my studio room and just write. That’s when my life changed. I wrote this song called ‘Tell Me Why’. The next morning, I received a phone call from my friend Pastor Tim who was the minister of a Baptist church in Croton Falls, NY. I would at times attend his services with my family and sing as part of his group. Pastor Tim says to me “did you hear what happen?” I replied yes and went on to tell him that I was so devastated by the whole thing. He then says, “you wrote a song”. I was speechless, and I said yes. He immediately came to my house, and I played the song for him. He started to cry and asked if I could come to his church and perform the song that coming Sunday. I was totally honored. Well, that Sunday we go to his church and notice there were newspaper people there and photographers. I had no idea what was going on. Only to find out that they were there to see me perform. Again, without all the details, the song reached Oklahoma. I was called by the largest radio station in Oklahoma to be interviewed, not knowing at the time I was the first to write a song. They interviewed me live on the air for over an hour and then played the song for the world to hear. At this point I was in every newspaper throughout the United States and TV stations calling me. It was so amazing and heartwarming to know that I was able to help those who had suffered with the loss of their loved ones. I gave the song to Oklahoma as my gift to them, and to use as they wished. This kicked off other songs that I had wrote and was recognized for. The Virginia Tech shooting was another event that was terrible. The Virginia Times asked for permission to use my lyrics for a memorial story and book for the students who had passed. The song was also aired. The Tsunami Disaster was another event that got to me, and India wrote me a letter to get permission to use the song in India. The Lady Senator in Arizona who was shot made me realize that things could happen to anyone at any time, and I wrote a song for her. Now for my amazing opportunities performing and recording with Rock Stars who I admired growing up: “How one person can change your life” In 2000 I was performing at a yearly house party in NY where many musicians would gather and spend the whole day playing music. It was just an amazing yearly event. I was approached by this man who said he liked the way I played and sang and wanted to hook me up with a well-known musician. He asked for my phone number and said he would get back to me. I basically blew him off knowing deep inside this wasn’t real and why would he be interested in this guy in his mid-forties. Amazingly, 3 months later I receive a phone call from this person who says he is stopping by and bringing a rock artist to meet me (and he did). He brought Richie Scarlet who is probably one of the best rock guitarists in the industry and who has recorded and performed in worldwide concerts with all the great ones. Richie comes to my house and finds me in a suite looking like a businessman lol. Richie is dressed all in black, with eyeliner and long black hair and all decked out like a rock star and just looks at me lol I can’t imagine what he thought lol. But he was gracious and said Eddie told me you could play and sing. So, we went into my studio room, and I performed for him. (Again, I am leaving out all the details around this and will move to where I am today). Because of Richie, I have accomplished more than one can ever imagine from where I had come from. Performed and recorded with Leslie West and Mountain. Performed with artists of Alice Cooper, Toto, Kiss, Guns n Roses, Anton Fig (David letterman Drummer), Carmine Appice (Drummer – Vanilla Fudge, Rod Stewart), The Misfits and many other great artists that I highlight in my BIO. I happen to sound just like Dennis DeYoung of the band STYX. This reputation follows me no matter where I go. Which is not a bad thing. Dennis called me just recently and let me know how he was impressed. That was a special moment in my life. Hammond has also taken me under their wings and made me a part of the Hammond Family of artists which is a special recognition in the industry. I take the opportunity to speak with young musicians to let them know that they need to keep their dreams going and at the same time have a little something on the side that you can do if this doesn’t work out (I know no one wants a plan B, but). Since I started my music career later in life, I was already established as a businessman on wall street. I have a background in Data Security, and I work for the government. Everyone at the government offices where I work totally love what I do. The journey continues and there is still so much more to do. My sister taught me something that has always stuck with me. When I was down and out about thinking that I would never make it in music business, she reminded me that I was putting a monetary value on this to determine fame and musical success, but she set me straight and reminded me that my music had impacted so many lives to help them through their personal struggles. Wow, that hit me hard, and I finally grew up. Even with all that I had to go through growing up, it is absolutely nothing compared to so many people who struggle with disabilities and diseases and financial situations. I am so fortunate to have what I have today. My family, and a beautiful home here in Tennessee and foremost some great friends. I have no bitterness towards those who did what they did to me growing up. In fact, I used that energy in a positive way to help me with who I am today, and maybe it was just what I needed for me to make it to what I have achieved in my life. I love performing and really love to write. Still going after my next opportunity in the music business. I am not waiting for it to come to me. I am going after it, just like I did to get through my struggles when I was a kid and teenager. With all I went through, it has helped me to grow as a person both in my musical and business career. I have set goals and created my own set of principles to help get me through all types of situations. Maybe not always successful, but I do know that I have always put in my best effort to be successful which leads to no regrets. I never wanted anyone to ever feel sorry for me. There is nothing to be sorry for. Its life, and that’s all it is. We work with what God gave us, and we make it work. My dream is to be able to walk away from my job and complete my life on this earth as a full-time musician. I am now 68 and its time to find that opportunity. It’s funny, I know I have been a rocker my who life (eyeliner and leather lol), but I have always wanted to perform/record/write with country artist like, Brad Paisley, and Keith Urban who I have always admired. I totally respect how they rock that guitar. I have had the opportunity to perform with some great rock guitarist, and I know these guys can totally hang. My music role has always been the guy that has supported others in their success. Which again, I am so grateful for. People have bugged me for years to get my CD completed and put myself out there… but we all know, this is not easy for anyone. I was never handed anything, I always earned it… hey, I was 44 years old before anyone in business even knew who I was 😊  We all dream, and there is nothing wrong in that. Stay Strong and live your life..... Peter Gallinari"
15,The Late Boy Band Impresario Lou Pearlman Left Behind Handwritten Blueprints Of The Backstreet Boys,arts-entertainment," A team of producers is set to recreate history by helping bring back the legacy of Lou Pearlman, the late music mogul best known for creating supergroups like the Backstreet Boys and Nsync. The music project aligns with the statement of Pearlman who once said, “Boy bands will stop when God stops creating teen girls,” with the producers using handwritten instructions left behind by the late boy-band impresario to create a new generation of boy bands. One of the producers said, “We have letters that Mr. Pearlman wrote to one of our partners for years. These were instructions how he wanted a new group to be formed, down to the smallest detail. These will be used as blueprints to create a new singing group. Pearlman created music superstars like the Backstreet Boys, Nsync, LFO, and many, many others. Using his written letters, we will create a new generation of singing groups that will be reminiscent of the past music scene of the 90s, filling the huge gap in the teen pop music genre in over 10 years. When this group becomes a huge success, it will be like Pearlman was directing it’s formation from the grave.” Boy bands have dominated the music scene over the years, with the likes of One Direction being the last massively successful group who broke up in 2015. However, currently, there are no pop artists dominating the music scene, which is why the producers are looking to change the narrative by leveraging the expertise of one of the biggest advocates of boy bands. The team of producers seeks to create a resurgence of pop music in the U.S and other parts of the world while noting Pearlman’s last dream of creating that one last supergroup before his sudden death in 2016 from heart failure. The Pearlman-inspired music project will undoubtedly chart a new course in the music scene when it becomes a success, considering the feats achieved by the late American record producer during his lifetime. Pearlman helped to build the Backstreet Boys in 1993 before taking his expertise to develop another award-winning boy band, NSYNC, in collaboration with music manager Johnny Wright. Pearlman immediately became a music mogul following the successes of Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, going ahead to manage and co-create several other boy bands, including O-Town from the hit reality show, Making The Band on ABC/MTV, LFO, Take 5, Natural, Marshall Dyllon, and US5. He also owned a large Orlando-based entertainment complex, which included a recording studio, Trans Continental Studios, and a dance studio near Disney World, named O-Town."
16,How might Esports evolve into a recognized career path for gamers?,arts-entertainment," Esports has been on the rise since the early 2000s and has continued to rise in 2022. It started with some friends grouping up together to play a multiplayer game for fun competition and evolved into worldwide competitions with huge cash prizes. A study done by VarsityEsportsGamingResearch found that out of the age groups of fifteen to seventeen, 97% of them play video games. There are millions of gamers around the world and E-sports is another way to connect them all with friendly competition. An article by Joe Drape states that thirteen to fifteen-year-olds are making thousands of dollars by winning and competing in E-Sports competitions. This is a good example of how gaming has evolved from a normal hobby into a possible career choice in the future. The average E-sports player makes about 50,000 to 75,000 annually which can vary depending on which game and team you play for. It is universally agreed that Faze Clan started the face of E-sports and whenever someone thinks about gaming, Faze clan is one of the first things to come up. The main reason for this capstone project is to inform and give examples of how Esports could be a possible career path. It's supposed to help convince people that disagree with Esports and don't think it cannot be a career path and to inform gamers that want to see if gaming could be a possible career path for their future. I hope that the result of this project is that instead of people viewing Esports as a waste of time, they can see it as a viable career path for anyone. The main reason Esports players make so much is because of sponsorships. Companies see that people are invested in video games and so they offer sponsorships to players so they can advertise their product or use it. The majority of wealthy Esports players have multiple sponsorships so they can make more money and so they have access to some of their products too. Esports is a very profitable career but not a very secure one. Because if you want to make a career out of gaming you have to be willing to put the time in even when you don't want to. You have to also be the best of the best because getting recruited to an Esports team is extremely hard and very rare. There are also a huge amount of video games out there so you have to make sure you pick one that you enjoy, are amazing at, and is very popular. You also have to be popular on social media and well known because video games revolve around a whole ranking system and you can't get your content out there if you don't stream or post videos of you playing video games. A study done by Statista.com shows that Twitch is the most viewed gaming platform in the world with over nine point two million active streamers daily and over one hundred and forty million viewers, which is a lot of competition. This is why E-sports being a career is such a debatable topic because it's so random and there are a lot of criteria you have to meet. Being popular or gaining fame is the hardest one of them all because content plays a part in this and if you don't play well or produce good content then no one will know who you are. Then if no one knows who you are when you can't be recruited to a team. But this is not all bad because there are plenty of people who just stream video games and make money off of donations but that is another topic. Esports might become a more common career if it were more secure in the financial aspect of it. Because it's not guaranteed that you will get on a team. You might not get any sponsorships which is the main source of income for most gamers according to an article by Inside Intelligence about the money and income each play for each game makes annually. Esports can most definitely become a viable career choice for gamers it just needs more worldwide recognition to be able to have more teams for competitions because worldwide there are only about 180 teams. And there are about 10 people per team which only makes 1800 slots available. And out of 7 billion people, that’s about a 0.00000027% chance of you getting on one of those teams out of everyone in the world. But not everyone is a gamer so the chances are way higher, this is just an estimate. In an article by Chandler Hubbard, posted on May 27th, 2022, the article there is about a 0.00008% chance that you will be able to get onto a team. This can vary from where you live because there are fewer Esports teams in Europe than there are in the U.S or any other area. Overall Esports evolving into a possible career choice is a possibility. The problem is that there is not enough recognition for underground players and smaller gaming teams. We can fix this by creating other leagues for intermediate players to expert players. If this is implemented there is a definite possibility that Esports can become a vital career choice for gamers. It is suggested that gamers planning on competing in Esports that they make sure that they have a good following on social media are extremely good at a video game (mainly opinion-based), and have plans if things don't work out. Esports has come this far and brought so many people together, and it has a possibility to evolve into something greater. The product of this project is educating people on how people can Earn money from Esports and how it is a sustainable job and help people become more confident about joining. Because If people join it will become more popular which means more tournaments and leagues can be funded which means higher payouts for gamers that are competing. If Esports becomes a career path then that means so many more people will join and companies will see the rise in gaming and jump on it quickly with sponsorships and other types of funding which will make it even more viable as a career path for gamers and anyone else. I am saying the product of this is a domino effect that will lead to the financial success of gamers looking to capitalize on their video game skills. This is why people should listen because I believe that everyone wants to make money easily in their life, so if they want to find an easy way to make money and have some success in their life they should listen to what I have to say because it will benefit them in the long run of video games can see."
17,the living stone,arts-entertainment," In 2018, I created the artwork The Heart of Stone. My idea rekindles a stone that percept as an inanimate object which solid, cold, hard, and heavy. How did I rekindle the stone? I rekindled it in perception. The stone contained air and it could swell and subside repeatedly by referring to the working system of the heart organ. The creation of installation art applied the idea of living and rekindling something. This idea was influenced by the theory of quantum. Since the time of the Paleolithic, human has given a sign of their presence and their group. The giving of the sign may be meant as a way of the previous human for the culture space, myths, macro-cosmos - micro-cosmos. This sign continues with the new meaning of being symbols; for instance, lingga - yoni, totem, monument, temple, Meru, Pagoda. They gave names with piles of stones high formed in monuments, carving stones in menhir shape which then continued to lingga - yoni. The developed signs have new meanings mystically and religiously. Becoming a spiritual center space. Which was originally a human as a pusering Jagad which then developed into space as a center of the universe. The spaces are made as places of worship. Informs of churches, temples, or mosques. Which originally started from stone as the main marker of pusering jagad. According to Rupert Sheldrake (2012) various views on the universe from the traditional Christian era to the materialism era. Before the 17th century, people believed that the universe was like an organism considering that nature was alive. In the 17th century, classical physics developed, revealing that the universe was like a set of a huge machines. From 1780 to 1830 in the Romantic movement, people viewed nature as a living creature rather than a mechanical one. Friedrich von Schelling (1707), applied these ideas to science, and they debated through the material of rekindled. Organism or holistic philosophy treats the whole nature as an alive thing, in this case, it is the updated pra mechanical animism. Even atoms, molecules, and crystals are organisms. The philosophy of organism showed that wherever we see nature on whatever level or scale, we will find wholeness which consists of intact parts themselves on a lower level. From the conclusion of the world views on the universe above, there are two kinds of views, namely the universe as a living organism and the universe which works like a machine. The conclusion may be applied as the basic assumption in my artwork. The living stone is how an artwork could disturb the audience's perception. The dead physical stone would be rekindled. How is the way?. I want the stone could move. The movements could be various, it could be shifted, rolling, or it may move only on its surface. With the change in the concept of rekindling inanimate objects, and the base of quantum theory. The theory triggers the idea to rekindle inanimate objects in the artwork change. Quantum theory claimed that every material consists of small parts which are not inanimate objects, but something that always moving alive. Viewed in a macro way, our surrounding nature may look passive, static, or dead. However, when it is analyzed in detail to the smallest parts, the objects which once looked passive, static, and dead will look different, and open to be interpreted and used as anything (Dwi Marianto, 2011,p. 90). How is the technic of rekindling the inanimate object?. The easiest thing is by moving only its surface, as the surface of the stomach or breast skin of a human when he is breathing, pulsated. By moving the part of the stone, it looks as if it is pulsated, then the audience's perception is as if the stone is alive. It is one of the techniques to make the audience's perception disturbed. From the idea of the living stone, I would like to apply it to my installation artwork by exploring the room architecturally with the reference to the subject above and how is the technique to present the subject matter. 2.1.	Quantum Theory A long time ago, people claimed everything was made of the atom, but today the statement is not fully true. However, many things are not made of atoms. For instance, electric currents, magnetic fields, and the gravitational field of the earth. Protons, neutrons, and electrons are not made of atoms. Atom is made of them. The universe is made of quanta. Quantum is often described as the science of mysterial and energy on the smallest level. Most of the physic quantum is carried out in molecular, atomic, and subatomic, the definition based on these sizes was extremely simplified because quantum is not always small; quanta usually could be as big as the earth. Two or more quanta could be considered as a single quantum, whose parts are fused and influence each other, even when they stay in a different galaxy 2.2.	The Peak Shift Principle In the practice of creating, artworks can be carried out in various ways. The purpose is to open new interpretations to several phenomena. For the subject matter and to develop artistic and technical practice tools, I used the method of approach to the subject matter, using the method of warming from Ramachandran, The Peak Shift Principle. Fine art often uses the words of feeling in the process of creation. The feeling is a sensation or the essence of something. In Britannica Encyclopedia, feelings can only be suggested to be experienced deeply, but cannot be expressed (Marianto,2011, p.149). For Ramachandran, to make the feeling be expressed strongly to be able to arouse the audience's aesthetic feeling is by making it to be extreme or exaggerating the feeling by caricaturing. It can activate the neutral mechanism of the brain. The previously weak feeling becomes huge appear its presence. There are two studies in the process of my creation. The first is about stones. Unconsciously the subject matter was triggered by the theory of Quantum. From the studies on the material and technique, there is one point related studied. It was using a device related to technology. so that the stone was viewed alive with the pulsated surface, which needed a mechanical device. While creating the critical impression, especially for the lighting. It needed a technology device. The process of creating the artwork is indirectly related to technology; thus, I collaborated with the person who knows about it, and how was the technique of presenting an artwork. The process I experienced, opened a new phenomenon in creating artworks. That is the relationship between art and other fields. I needed a together execution, with a collaboration."

QueenNoble Dr. Elle Ramirez was asked why she paints other than as a passion and she replied, “My artworks aren’t just for collection but every collector who purchased a piece gets to feed two to four children in the orphanage and supply of vitamins increases, the elderlies get to have a fun event every month, more wheelchairs in the home of the elderly and more medical supplies for the rescued animals. “."
19,How Music Can Help Coping With Mental Health Problems,arts-entertainment," Music is a form of art that has been around for approximately thousands of years. It has evolved from just basic oral sounds made by the human voice, into a more substantial form of art compiled with rhythm, melody, harmony, chords, and lyrics. The modern era has produced many forms of musical genre over the past 100 years. The change that happened in music also influenced its purposes. The music produced in the modern era is mostly intended for entertainment. However, there are some music that specifically intended to help people with their mental health problems. What are the reasons for us to listen to music? The answer to this question would not be the same for all of us. It all really depends on what mood we are in. If we feel happy, we listen to it solely for entertainment, if we feel stressed out, we listen to it to help us calm down, if we feel sad, we listen to it to help us get through it, and if we feel depressed and alone, we listen to it so we can have someone to relate to. Our emotions play a big role in the music we listen to. People with mental health problems tend to listen to musicians that they can relate with so that they don’t feel like they are alone. However, not many musical artists are capable of making these types of music. One of the ones that can is Kid Cudi. His music helps an entire generation of youth to fight their own demons inside them. In his music, he opens up about his struggles with depression, anxiety, and even drug abuse. He sets himself as an example to show us how to walk our own paths. There are a lot of people who found comfort in his music and got back up because of him. This man saved a generation from going through the wrong path and taking their own lives. One of the other artists who can also make therapeutic music like him is none other than his best friend, Kanye West. A lot of people don’t like Kanye because of his bad reputation, but no one can deny his genius when it comes to making music. In my opinion, one of the greatest songs he and Kid Cudi ever made is “Ghost Town.” In the song, they talked about Kanye’s struggle with his bipolar disorder and other problems. The most standout lyrics of the song in my opinion is on the chorus that goes “I’ve been tryin’ to make you love me But everything I try just takes you further from me.” In this bit, Kanye and Cudi aren’t actually talking about other people loving them, but rather themselves. After “Ghost Town,” Kid Cudi and Kanye releases an album that talks entirely about mental health problems called “KIDS SEE GHOSTS.” The 5th track on the album “Reborn” is the one song everyone struggling with mental health problems must hear. This song is very therapeutic. This is the song everyone with depression and suicidal thoughts need to hear. This song feels like a warm big hug, telling you not to give up and keep moving forward and everything will work out eventually. These therapeutic music is different than just a regular sad song. A sad song just feels like an expression of complaint compared to the songs that actually expresses raw emotion and encouragement. We need to put some respect for artists who made music to help people, because they are heroes who probably saved millions of lives across the globe. They proved that music can help coping with our problems, no matter how big or small they are. They are the reason why music can  save lives."

2,“Finding Ola”: We all need a SECOND CHANCE,arts-entertainment," Finding Ola is a comedy-drama series (released February, 2022 on Netflix), as an extension of the series “I Want to Get Married” or “Ayza Atgawaz”, was first launched in 2010, even though its producers refute this perspective. Its plot revolves around Ola Abdel-Sabour, a graduate of the Faculty of Pharmacy who works as a government employee, a young woman looking for a husband. A number of unsuitable men propose to her, some of whom were socially/psychologically impaired, until she finally finds the handsome, romantic, wealthy man of her dreams. Thus, achieving her goal in life and searching for a groom, marriage and stability, has ended with getting married to the last guy, who is a doctor in psychology, Dr. Hisham. The 2010 version presents Ola as a girl, was raised in the old-fashioned way, belongs to a middle-class conservative family who is looking for a groom for their daughter before she reaches the age of 30 so that she does not turn into a spinster. Years later in “Finding Ola”, Ola shifts into a typical housewife and mother of two kids, lives a monotonous and problematic married life with her husband, who suddenly asks for a divorce, causing a loud shock that Ola is trying to epiphanize. The 2022 version is a reflection of the social developments that have taken place in Egypt and the Arab world during the last decade when marriage was the biggest achievement for a Middle Eastern lady. Nowadays, meanwhile, the only question raised is “who’s still married these days” because marriage according to Ola is a contract between two parties only one party gets the benefits, and the other is left out. Ola perceives the concept of marriage differently and that women’s problems do not end with marriage, but may begin with it. In this spectrum, Ola found that quitting her job was a chance to become closer to the kids, but this perhaps was just a justification that Ola gave to herself, proving this, she still gives her daughter meat, even though the daughter has been a vegan for two years. Marriage brought Ola into a routine quarrel with her mother-in-law, who is not completely satisfied with Ola and her character, how not, and she is an aristocratic lady. Was the Ola’s married life harder than the almost-a-spinster Ola, as society used to call her? Perhaps yes, because the latter did not have to swallow the-every morning anti depression pill. The shift from Ola’s Hisham wife to again Ola Abdel-Sabour has brought lot. Being divorced means stalking her ex-husband on Facebook, seeing him switching his marital status to a divorced and everyone is congratulating him… means closing a joint account and creating a different account for kids’ expenses… means lot. However, this lady starts true journey of self-discovery after she sacrificed everything for the sake of her husband and children. She quickly recovers and tries to reinvent and find herself again through developing a career and having a financial and psychological independence. In an era of fanaticism, impatience, and a growing sense of individuality and independence, Ola decided to create a balance in her life between the responsibilities that fall upon her and finding herself to keep pace with the changes occurred around without neglecting her attempt to find a good potential partner. Poetic justice at its finest Years ago, Ola’s daughter had rashes and eczema and Ola was worried to use chemical products for her baby girl and decided to do homemade cream based on ancient Egyptian formula she had at university when she was a pharmacy student. The formula worked like magic in which she has guts trying to test more ingredients and create different formula. This is the career she has dreamt about in the past but giving birth to her last child wouldn’t help pursuing this. Ola felt the poetic justice when she was offered a second chance to discover herself and gain confidence in her entity as she finally found someone believed in her and had the willingness to sponsor her small project. “Finding Ola” is an affirmation for individuals that there is always a chance to start over when Ola seeks to mellow out and pursue her dreams. Concurrently, the significance of the entrepreneurial business idea emerges in which it relies on establishing a small project without relying on the idea of a job. The series also proves that it is never too late to start over and age is just a number. The 40s does not mean the end of the universe for a woman, but rather an age-stage that means maturity, discernment and femininity that comes at its peak, and that woman can live her life with arms outstretched. “Finding Ola” is more Arab-women oriented showing how maturity lies in taking responsibility, women’s support, empowerment of women, and the importance of breaking societal stereotypes to live contentedly and move forward. Accordingly, the female characters were portrayed as more open-minded ladies despite the different age categories. Ola’s Mom This character reflects the importance of self-care, self-pampering and breaking stereotypes in the role of the granny who turns into a loyal follower of social media, cares about her beauty and youth, as it is deemed a vital part of self-satisfaction and mental health. Nesreen Ola’s bestie, represents the liberated girl, who supports her friend, appreciate friendship, and never cares about society judgments. Umniah The girlfriend of Ola’s ex-husband who represents the millennium generation, as this generation has unique attributes as such: their skill in using social media and technology to their advantage, especially as they were born in a boom and a huge technological development. The 30s Vs Divorcee 40s Ola There have been various aspects of change between the young Ola and the divorced one, which will be pinpointed: She is bolder Ola, who was looking for a husband through arranged marriage (usually referred as salon marriages, in Egypt), attending weddings, social events, and after her divorce, has swapped to a dating App for the sake of finding her eternal partner hoping for a better destiny. She has to meet people she does not know, speak bolder than they do, and confront without fear. She is no longer reckless and rather a more confident, mature businesswoman. Career The nature of Ola’s work as a government employee was nothing but a routine job. After all these years, she did not think of returning to a dull job. Rather, Ola opted for a project in which she used her knowledge and ability to formulate skin care products. Ola’s business went viral and the brand is smash hit. However, she still thinks that she is stuck in a marketing corner in the sense of “ageist approach” or “age-based discrimination” because other products were neglected by other new generations like the 2000s who don’t want to buy cosmetics because of animal cruelty but the good news is that Ola’s products are cruelty- free. Societal Status “ Finding Ola” accentuates the change and shows women’s empowerment is at the core of the new development agenda in which women live differently due to the major changes in the political and social conditions. More than 10 years have passed after marrying a psychiatrist with a good stable source of income made “Ola Abdel-Sabour” changes a lot, she became more elegant, has a comfortable car, lives in a high social level, hangs out with friends in luxurious places. Even her hairstyle, color, makeup, and perfume that she wears all became more glamorous and elegant. These scenes we would not have seen in the young Ola’s life. Tiger mother Ola’s mother has always had a premonition that her daughter would fail to get a husband. Even after the divorce the mother never stops nagging Ola in order to leave no stone unturned getting her ex-husband back which is the thing Ola never tends to do. Ola has got a very serious issue with her mother who always wants her girl to be a modelling-patterned behaviour of her. Ola hopes they could be friends so that she follows her mommy’s advice instead of abiding by the rules because she is scared of her. Eventually, Ola has a greater ability to confront, standing in front of her mother to spell everything out. Dramatic scenes that show a totally different character of Ola, unlike the comic one that the audience are familiar with. Epicaricacy In the first season, Ola’s main goal was not to be gloated over by her friends and neighbours because she did not get married. However, in “Finding Ola”, her only obsession is the gloating of her mother-in-law, who in turn does not miss an opportunity to do that. In a comic way, but meticulously, even post Ola’s divorce, but she still, despite the change that occurred in all aspects of her life, cares that her ex-husband, his new girlfriend, and even society do not gloat over her because she considers herself now a second-hand package. No Gender-bias The series attempts to avoid the cliché of portraying the strong independent woman in a superficial way, and rather created a balance in handling the life of a divorced woman when passing through a midlife crisis, which is usually the preserve of male characters in the Middle Eastern drama. The series presents Ola, a woman who is forced to rely on herself after her dignity and safety have been robbed. She experiences the real-world challenges and deals with its grayness on her own. She gets confused, and sometimes hurt, but still enjoying the pleasure of experience. During her journey, she criticizes the duplicity in dealing with women and the difficulty of enjoying their complete independence within the patriarchal society and its laws, in a a good rhetorical tone. “The first step forward after divorce is a haircut and a dye” The choice of upgrading the social-classes, despite its remote possibility, distanced the series from the peculiarity that distinguished it in the first season as it was reflecting the real life of many. “Finding Oka” deals with a popular issue such as divorce, in a very rosy and luxurious way, stripping it of major problems experienced by the majority of Middle Eastern women. The solutions seem quick and easy to go along with the good feeling that the makers want to leave on the viewer. It seeks to provide women with a dose of optimism, even if it is somewhat deceptive."
3,How Technology Can Assist Everyone in the Battle Against Dyslexia. Don't let it get in the way of your reading.,arts-entertainment," John is dyslexic and he sets out to read at least one book this year but he ended up reading ten! John has a severe case of dyslexia. He didn't find out until he was 18 years old, so he'll have to learn to live with it. He set a goal for himself at the start of the year to read at least one book in its entirety but he ended up reading 10 and gained a new appreciation and love for reading as a result. Reading was always a laborious pastime for John, and he never really enjoyed it. Now John reads for pleasure, and he can see why others do as well. In addition, he believes it has significantly helped his dyslexia. Dyslexia is a mental condition that is often discussed but rarely understood. Essentially, it is a situation in which the expected and actual reading abilities are vastly different. It's when something goes wrong with the information flow from the eyes to the brain, a problem that scientists are still trying to figure out. It normally takes some time to get through the first one. However, it helps a great deal if you are reading something that you enjoy. You'll notice that your dyslexia slows you down when you're distracted or tired. It doesn't matter how long the journey takes, just that you'll get there in the end. There's a font specifically for people with dyslexia that's available on Kindles. How does this font help people with dyslexia? “Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to indicate direction. You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down which aids in recognizing the correct letter, and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.“ The Orton-Gillingham technique is another option. It was developed in the early twentieth century as a multimodal phonics strategy for remedial reading education. It is a multi-sensory technique that is direct, explicit, cognitive and cumulative. While it is most typically used to teach those with dyslexia, it is also very successful for anyone learning to read, spell, or write. Have you considered listening to audio books as well? Obviously, reading is vital, and you should keep doing so, but you may supplement your efforts with audio books so that you can read even more books during the year. Audio books are a terrific way to immerse yourself in the story without having to devote the time required to read them. Those who are eyereading this and have always considered themselves slow readers should try audiobooks. You might discover that you're one of the 40% of people who can earread better than they can eyeread."
4,Òran na h-Eala (2022),arts-entertainment," The camera is to cinema what the brush is to the canvas. It is from the lens that the story is written, the narrative pulse is dictated by the shots, the sequences, and the way they end up fitting into the final montage. All the elements of cinematographic language must be perfectly aligned so that the director's voice can reach the audience. In Òran na h-Eala (2022), director Steve Exeter takes advantage of every tool that cinema provides to conceive a film that is both a tribute to the seventh art and a way to re-imagine a classic. This thirteen-minute short film contains the essence of the original work that inspired it. From the opening titles and until the curtain falls in front of our eyes, surrendering to the visual force of the staging. As in the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, The Red Shoes (1948), the use of color plays a vital role to the point of becoming a character. The obsession and passion of the central figure is expressed with a varied color palette that changes between warm and cool tones depending on the mood. Moira Shearer (Shannon Davidson) puts her heart and soul into dance, ballet is the meaning of her life. As she rehearses tirelessly, filmmakers Michael Powell (Alastair Thomson Mills) and Emeric Pressburger (Alec Westwood) pressure her to star in their next film. Moira just wants to be a dancer and feels that movies will be a distraction. It is at this point where the script, written by the director himself, begins to delve into Shearer's psyche. Òran na h-Eala feeds on every heartbeat of its main actor, the structure of the story rests all its weight on the character of Moira, making her the main pivot to give mobility to the narrative. Shannon Davidson delivers a forceful and powerful performance. Body language makes us connect with the character and their emotions. When those close-ups embrace her face we can see her fears, frustrations and anxieties, her gaze conveys to us what words do not say. Davidson is clearly in total control of her histrionic registers, allowing her character to move freely and organically. Many filmmakers have been nurtured by the Powell and Pressburger classics, some turning to references to find creative solutions to staging dilemmas and others revering the film that has stood the test of time and including it in the list of their favorites. From the choreography of Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952), through Jake LaMotta dancing in the ring of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull (1980) and even Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010), there are countless films that have gone to drink from that fountain. In the case of Exeter, it is more than evident that the matter is personal and in this, his second short film, he goes all out to honor this pillar of cinema. Òran na h-Eala is the perfect companion to The Red Shoes, addressing with creative freedom and biographical pretence a chapter in the life of Moira Shearer. It is not that this short film is a strict biopic, but moreover the fiction is drawn with a chronicled nuance that shines a light on the story behind one of the key moments in the history of cinema. The director shows maturity and determination in the staging, the details of each frame are perfectly balanced. Thomas Dobbie's cinematography is one of the high points of this short film, his camera always finds the perfect angle to get the most out of each shot. In the first part, he bombards us with exquisite close-ups and when the film reaches its climax, the lens drags us to the depths of Moira's soul with movements that change between the subtle and the abrupt with absolute precision. Garry Maddison's editing and colorization work plays a fundamental role in making sense of those images captured by Dobbie's lens. The other piece that completes the audio-visual universe of Òran na h-Eala is the original music by Mike Lukey and Arkadi Troitsky. Lukey provides the ""Song of the Swan"" performed exquisitely by Shannon Davidson and plays a fundamental role in giving insight to the central character. While Troitsky puts his signature on the composition for the ballet sequence that drags us to the dreamlike part of the film when Moira's character reaches her catharsis. Òran na h-Eala is a dazzling work that combines the elements of cinematographic language very well and that delivers the best in its staging and technical handling."
5,Poker Hands Explained,arts-entertainment," Despite the belief that poker has long fallen out of style, it recently made a comeback and is again fashionable. Of course, the global pandemic had a lot to do with this occurrence, as US casinos shutting down in 2020 increased New Jersey’s online poker revenues by over 100% in specific months of that year, compared to 2019 figures. That is a trend that also was present in other US states, which continued throughout 2021 and got replicated at land-based establishments in 2021. Moreover, the WSOP has also been making some massive moves lately. They hired actor Laurence Fishburne to star in a new series of advertisements for their brand and employed fellow silver screen star Vince Vaughn to act as the MC of the 53rd WSOP tournament in Las Vegas’ Bally casino. Thus, this is a perfect time for anyone not familiar with poker to start exploring this resurging pastime. And, it is an excellent opportunity for those that have neglected it to get back into card gambling action. Poker is a game of skill, where expertise can lead to a steady stream of wins, as evident by thousands of people profiting from playing online and the same batch of players continuously making their way onto WSOP main events each year. Naturally, the first thing needed to get started with this hobby/money-making opportunity is learning the ranking of poker hands. The quickest way to acquire this knowledge is to watch a winning poker hands video. It will help you better understand the best five-card combinations available. However, you can also read the guide outlining them below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prlm8Nm_ss Poker Hand Order Simply put, poker hand rankings start from a simple high card and go up to a straight flush, the most challenging card combo to get. When the cards you get in your hand do not match any predefined combination and are all in different values and suits, the highest-ranking single card represents the highest card in your hand. That is the one you put up against what others hold at your table. A pair is when you have two cards of the same rank, and a two pair is when four out of your five cards form two couples. For instance, 4-4-3-3-A would be two pairs. These represent low-value hands and are nothing to get overly excited by when they land in front of you. Three-of-a-kind is a pretty self-explanatory hand. It is where the medium value combinations start. It beats all the previous ones listed, a pattern that we have been following, and will follow throughout this subheading as we rattle off the rest of the winning hands in poker. A straight flush is when you have five cards in a sequence, and a flush is when you hold five cards of the same suit. A full house is three-of-a-kind plus a pair, which is weaker than you just having four cards of the same rank (four-of-a-kind). A straight flush is a suited set in succession, and a royal one is an ace-high straight flush formed by a ten, jack, queen, king, and ace of the same suit. In most poker games, suits carry the same weight, meaning an ace-high flush of clubs has the same one as an ace-high flush of hearts. Yet, in some variations/games, usually, spade hands are the highest, and clubs the lowest. In cases of ties, a general rule of thumb is that the next highest card comes into play to determine the winning hand in poker. The best poker starting hand is always one containing two Aces. It boasts a potential winning percentage of 85% based on mathematical analysis. Poker Hand Odds Inspired by the percentage above, it is vital to note that statistics exist on the internet that will inform you of the probability of landing each hand detailed in this article. To discover how the winning percentages of hands in poker get formed, you first need to learn how to calculate - outs. These are unseen cards that, if drawn, will improve your poker hand. Understanding this concept, and the game, in general, has led math savvy individuals to calculate that the probability that you may get a royal flush in poker is 649.739 to one, or 0.000154%. That is pretty significant. The odds associated with a straight flush are sizably smaller at 72.192 to one, or 0.00139%. For four-of-a-kind, they are 4.164 to one (0.0240%) Things get more realistic for hands boasting a ranking of a full house (639 to 1) or lower. The probability of landing a pair is 1.37 to one, or 42.2569%, which means that this is the type of card combination you can expect to primarily get dealt when you play poker online or at land-based venues."

7,A Chamber Group Is More Fun Than A Party,arts-entertainment," Playing Music Together In A Small Group Chamber groups are small ensembles such as string #quartets and piano #trios, who play music intended for performance in close chambers such as parlors and living rooms, churches, or virtually any venue smaller than a large concert hall. While their small sizes and are ideal for intimate settings, chamber groups can, of course, also perform in great concert halls. Chamber orchestras with fifteen or more players blur the definition of a chamber group somewhat; however, while chamber orchestras are relatively large, they remain small and ""chamber-like"" in comparison to the immense size and volume of full modern orchestras. It's the best way to meet people. It's much easier than a party. You go to a party, you wonder if someone is going to be approachable or not, but when you play music together, somehow you're communicating immediately, and you go to that level socially as well. Once you start playing music, you can communicate in a way that you could never do just with words. You form bonds with people you might not otherwise have a conversation with. But because you've shared something so personal, it becomes easier. It's the ultimate egalitarian experience, because everyone is necessary all the time. Everyone's complete focus is necessary all the time. Everyone coming into the experience understands and respects that. We all realize that we're bringing our best, and we're each bringing unique contributions to the group. That's one of the best things about it, too. Each person brings something unique, so you have access to the brains of the other people to make a product that you couldn't make on your own. Sometimes there are heated debates, but it's all in good fun. Playing chamber music helps enhance your musicianship. It’s easy to ‘hide’ in a large orchestra or band, but in a small group your skills are much more exposed. You work harder to play accurately and in tune, to listen and blend, to create musical phrases – and as a result, these musical skills improve. Playing in a small group allows you to be more autonomous and independent. You can make your own rehearsal and performance decisions, and you can choose your own repertoire. You’re not beholden to a conductor. You can tailor your performances to your own interests and/or the jobs you’re hired to play. Playing in a chamber group helps develop your communication skills. All members of the group have an opinion on how the music should be played. Listening to all ideas and implementing the ones that work best help to hone collaborative skills that you can use later on in college, your career, and in everyday life. There is a wide variety of music available for almost any instrumental combination.  I offer 4 groups: Beginner's group, Classical group, Celtic group and Bluegrass group.  Some include piano and/or voice(s). Pops, holiday, classical, jazz, etc…. You can find just about anything by going online or checking with your music teacher.  Chamber groups are portable! It’s a lot easier to take a trio, quartet or quintet ‘on the road’ than a full band. Small groups fit better into more venues, creating more opportunities to gig. Playing #chamber music is both a #social and #musical activity. Start a group containing friends you already have, or start a group with people you hope to become friends with. Either way, you will have fun!"
8,Four Of The Fabulous Folk Albums Released In Recent Years,arts-entertainment," Recent years have seen music spring to life in many areas that previously seemed dead. One genre that has seen a particular boom in the last couple of years is the folk scene. With the rise in outdoor living, wellness trends, and going back to basics, many people are beginning to rediscover the simple life. For many, this also includes going back to their musical roots. Folk music is an inspirational way to tap into the voices of those who came before. There is something undeniably spiritual about singing the songs that generations of men and women have sung before you. Why not have a listen to our picks and see how they touch your soul? The Soundtrack: Aidan O’Rourke - Iorram (Boat Song) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrzOUGjeuSU&list=OLAK5uy_lQlbD2EfFKpjpXLuzQzmPvIBsa7SYUSy8 Any good soundtrack should be well put-together enough to listen to on its own. And Aidan O'Rourke certainly achieves this with Iorram. The music, with its haunting Irish folk melodies, is playfully updated with elements of jazz accompaniment, as light touches of saxophone add a gentle lift to the mournful sound of the fiddle. An ode to the generations of Irish fishermen who have been working the coast for centuries, the lyrics are in traditional Gaelic, the throaty voices of the folk singers bringing a suggestion of the harshness of life on the waves. The music is dizzying, hypnotic, and spiritual, in a grounded way. O'Rourke is a master of his craft, and although the folk singers' voices add depth and a human voice to the music, they are not required. The music touches the soul all on its own, echoes of a landscape ever-changing. The Guitarist: Yasmin Williams - Urban Driftwood https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCxGY6FM_DQ&list=OLAK5uy_kkomkkaWc8UrZUfzeLQoaNGDxuTKcMt-o Listening to Urban Driftwood, there is a lightness that is transcendental; the notes tumble like swallows on the wind, grounded by the earthy, rhythmic tones of the drums and the gently melodic song of the kalimba. Yasmin's music sounds like hope. There is a deeper yearning that breathes another story beneath the cheerful top notes, but it never loses its sense of life and beauty. Her music dances from spirited to wistful, and captures a freshness, a sense of youth through the changing ages - like leaves turning red on an autumn day. It's the kind of music that you want to listen to by the fire; it warms your soul. There are no lyrics to Williams’ songs and they don’t need them. Her guitar speaks for her more clearly than words ever could. There is a subtlety to the music that could not be easily captured in a song. Williams is a very promising guitarist and her second album is an enticing insight into her depths as a musician. We are excited to see what more will come from her. The Folk Rocker: Grace Cummings - Storm Queen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KT3iL5SMo4&list=OLAK5uy_mrWjfHwJxCrv0Up2hszP3k9r4TWh-mh7U The title of Grace Cummings’ second album is a simple yet intriguing hint as to the chaotic emotional whirlwind captured in each song. There is a rolling rhythm with the rise and fall of her voice, from the deep, soulful depths of the lowest tones, to the more fragile, brittle high notes - like the swell and ebb of a wave. Her voice is timeless; you could place her music in any given era. There are echoes of ancient Irish folk ballads roughly edged with the gravelly tones of modern rock. She perfectly bridges the gaps between time and space; sometimes bluesy and cool, with a smooth timbre - other times fierce, raspy and passionate. The backing track is used tastefully, and every note and addition is carefully chosen. Her style is minimalistic, and it compliments the richness of her voice perfectly. There are echoes of Bob Dylan in the twang of the acoustic guitar, but it still feels fresh today. Overall, if you’re looking for a rollercoaster ride of an album, which sweeps you up and away into its storytelling, Storm Queen is a beautiful, bluesy twist on the folk genre. The Duo: Watchhouse – Self-Titled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X_AEuqWak4&list=PL0mSnUSmZIvubMw8xRBf-a64nKYUorlQN If you're looking for a chilled out, nostalgic ode to Americana, Watch House will warm your heart and fill you with memories of the Old West that you haven't lived. The casual, melodic strumming of the guitar is eﬀortless and perfectly in harmony with the roll of the lyrics. At points, a fiddle or melodica is used to lift the music, and it creates such a beautifully bittersweet eﬀect that it is impossible not to be compelled by the stories behind the lyrics. Watchhouse brings together the very best of the American ballad and reveals the raw heart at the centre. This album captures the essence of the West, and keeps it neatly between its covers."
9,About the entertainment fact about the anime and videos,arts-entertainment," Can you imagine how daunting it is for a young man with little experience to try his hands in business? Can you imagine the challenges he would have to face up to if the business involved ‘ordinary merchandise’? What if the industry is much more competitive and requires relatively hefty amounts to start? Well, these are the challenges one young man in Alaska, Arsalan Malik, literally had to deal with decades ago while trying to launch his trade. And this was no ‘ordinary business-’ why, Arsalan set out to start a film production enterprise that would-hopefully- outlive its name. And Arsalan wasn’t alone in trying to realize this big dream- his younger brother Salman Malik was ready, by his side to start the journey with him. So, together, the two siblings got down to business and started a small company named Bizzay. As noted, the company would primarily deal with film production in Alaska. Securing Subsidy Before long, Bizzay, the new company, had already developed a full-fledged crew based in their Alaska home. Hence, the company got down running around 2008 and gradually developed into a business that would produce compelling film content. And the hordes of fans were delighted with the new sheriff in town! When Bizzay was inaugurated, the government introduced some grants and subsidies meant to cushion specific categories of businesses from the ravages of inflation and economic depression. Bizzay also enjoyed the advantages of having a crew boasting a wealth of experience and innate talent. The situation was even better because Alaska had many beautiful places with fantastic scenery, well-suited for film production. Unsurprisingly, Arsalan’s enterprising spirit was greatly buoyed by these factors. Launching Business Arsalan’s Bizzay company was officially licensed and launched in November 2016. Amazingly, despite the phasing out of the booster tax credits in 2015, Bizzay. The company managed to stay afloat, even thriving. The troupe continued their film production business relentlessly. The great talent was regularly showcased at Alaska's famous Experience Theatre. This was done courtesy of several major premiers held within the city. The company started with the production of promotional videos, exploiting their dedication and passion for art to the full. Bizzay’s Big Break Arsalan’s fledgling film company finally made its big break into success and relative fame with its first feature film production. The film carried a compelling social message that, as it turned out, powerfully resonated with Alaska's film lovers. So, this became the real launch of Arsalan’s success. The film enjoyed relative great publicity with incredible public acclaim. The remarkable turnaround in Bizzay’s fortune was almost instant! It was all a testimony to the Arsalan team's excellent production, direction, and editing skills. Wide Acclaim Today, Arsalan's company, Bizzay, stands out as a renowned, highly successful Alaskan film company. Truly, Bizzay is a brand loved by thousands of viewers online. Bizzay is also famed for successful premiers of various films at different festivals. The once small company has received wide acclaim and is recognized by many news outlets worldwide.

10,The Joy of Seeing Children’s Art as NFTs,arts-entertainment," Picasso was right, every child is an artist. Children are more creative and imaginative than adults. They are divergent thinkers who allow their imagination roam free without fear of judgment or fear of breaking the rules or the current fashions and fads in the art world. They don’t yet have an inner critic mocking their work, nor bills piling high causing stress and anxiety. The frontal cortex responsible for rule based behaviours is only fully formed in our early twenties. It helps us make those ‘sensible decisions’, to give up art and take the job that pays the bills or to stop daydreaming and doodling that quirky invention and finish doing your taxes. And while we need our frontal cortex to fully mature, perhaps we lose too much of our childhood creativity with it and become too serious. That is why the recent wave of art made by children selling as NFTs on the internet is a joy to see.  The democratisation of art through NFTs is a debate being had at the moment. Does it allow artists who would otherwise never have made it to a gallery have their work seen or is it just a wild west? Certainly, children would never have had an opportunity to approach a bricks and mortar gallery or to call themselves artists and be taken seriously but now their works are selling alongside adults works. Nayla Hayes’ Long Neck Ladies are stunning. Based on her love of the brontosaurus she created portraits of women with long necks. My favourites are those with green skin because why not green skin? So imaginative! Then there is the coding genius Benjamin Ahmed, a 12 year old in London who created Weird Whales. A huge hit with the gamers. And then there is my own daughter 11 year old Rosewolf. Inspired by Nayla’s long neck ladies, and loving dachshund dogs, she created the character Duchess the dachshund when in isolation ten days with covid over Christmas. She already has thirty unique variations of Duchess whether wearing a flower or a bow, a top hat or pink wings, the imagination knows no bounds at 11. Rosewolf (her pseudonym on the web) has dyslexia and so art is her escape.  She sees the world visually and wants to be an artist when she grows up. But how does one keep the creativity alive as an adult? It was Albert Einstein who once said that ‘To stimulate creativity, one must develop the childlike inclination for play.’ We should stop taking ourselves so seriously for a few hours and maybe then we can produce art as good as these children are producing. Until then you can purchase their NFTs and be inspired to feel young and creative again."
11,Quick rundown on Music Sync licensing,arts-entertainment," Have you ever been curious to get your music onto film or games but you are not familiar with the process of getting licensing to do so? I was curious myself on what to do so I took some time to look into music sync licensing which is the legal agreement between a copyright owner and a separate party that is looking to use their music. A music synchronization license also known as a sync license is a license granted by a composer to the purchaser, the right to use the music in a visual piece. This can be film, tv, video games, youtube, or any other type of visual content. The music rights are usually owned by the songwriter or publisher who represents the owner. The copyrights are usually divided into two parts. The master sound recording which is usually owned by a record label. And the other part of the copyright is the composition which consists of the lyrics and the melody written by the composer/songwriter. Sometimes you will have to deal with publishing companies who could be the owners. When a director or producer want to use a song for their projects they must contact the songwriter or publisher to ask for permission. The songwriter then charges a fee for a one time use of the song. The price of the fee may vary depending a couple of factors. What will the song be used for? Will it be background music, commercial music, or just bits of the song be used. Do they plan on using the original recording or will they use a cover song. Where will the song be displayed? Is it local, National, or world wide? The term of the license can vary too. Will it be an exclusive or non exclusive license? This means that the song cannot be licensed elsewhere until the term of the license expires. Synchronization royalties include a one time payment and performance royalties.Synchronization licenses are negotiable and can be a major source of income for an artist. Opting to get your music into sync licensing and adding your music onto visual art forms is a great way for musicians to get exposed to larger audiences. This can help them create a bigger fan base so they can create more opportunities for themselves while getting paid. There is a current demand for original music because of the amount of streaming platforms we have creating new shows and movies and updating their movie lists monthly."
12,#GetToKnow: Snazzy Who is Poised to Take the Charts by Storm,arts-entertainment," There’s an explosion of talent right now in Nigeria, more people are dedicating themselves to desired crafts from early ages. Many people are pure unrefined talent, but it takes dedication and discipline to become a breakout star. The man of the moment breaking out right now is talented artiste Michael Chimeruche Alozie also known as Snazzy. Following the release of  SELUNA (a debut single off his Upcoming project (Mars), it is quite clear that Snazzy have seen the future of Nigerian music industry and how to take it by storm, his new release Seluna was released on 15th October 2021 and have been topping the charts since release, showing of the makings of a superstar it is quite clear that the Nigerian music industry has added another infinity stone to their gauntlet. Seluna off the Mars EP no:3 track multi-genre musical experience. The fusion of this artist awesomely manifests in the cohesion of the project. After the first listen, it makes sense why he needs to keep releasing hits and keep doing so. “ Mars The Ep is basically done,” says Snazzy, which speaks to the abundance of work these artiste have done. Snazzy’s distinct rap fusion style adds another dynamic to the already expansive African music. With thousands of streams under his belt, and situated at the heart of Nigeria’s afrobeat scene, Snazzy is perfectly positioned to create bangers. On his inevitable rise, he has been chatted with about music to him, connecting with his Upcoming Project and future projects. When did making music begin for you? I started out with freestyling in school when I was 8 or 9. And I only started ‘raping’ actively on by beats when I turned 14. I found a balance in my dynamic artistry and started singing. How do you approach creating a song? Usually, I just sit down, pour some WATER in my cup, – very important -, listen to a beat and record the first standout melody that comes to my head. Now this melody has to be hard and it doesn’t have to be in sequence. It could be the hook, outro or even second verse first – wherever I feel the melody works best is where I start from. How would you describe your sound? I’ve heard people say ‘afrobeats’, I’ve also heard Alte, Rap and Rap fusion. I find myself agreeing with the latter most times. I think my music is a mixture of Afrobeats and everything else. Who are your musical influences? Musically, I’m influenced by almost everything I hear. But my sound sometimes is very reminiscent of people like Wande Coal, Drake, Bryson Tiller, Zayne and the likes. But there’s so much more; Wizkid, Burna Boy, Nasty C, Eric Bellinger, Shaggy etc. What comes naturally to you when you’re in the studio? Once I get the hook line, everything else becomes so easy. Hooks are probably the hardest parts to record in a song cuz they have to be catchy basically, they NEED to slap so I usually spend more time with them, but with verses, it’s much easier with them. What can you tell us about the next project you’re working on? I’m working on quite a few projects. Mars is basically done. And then I’m on a few other projects that I can’t disclose right now. Did the pandemic had any influence on you creatively? Yes and No. when it comes to the actual process, No. However, it gave me more time to express myself through my art, I probably made upwards of 20 songs  during the pandemic. I doubt I would’ve been able to do so if there was no pandemic. Do you have songs that your fans would be surprised you made? If so, how do they sound like? LOL. My producers  has told me on several occasions that a few songs I’ve made cannot be dropped any time soon. But still, I think people would be surprised that I’m on an amapiano track. The track, wish I could give more details, but I can’t right now."
13,"Harry Potter retold new book, Terrie, The Sorcerer, released and news about it",arts-entertainment," Harry Potter book secretly retold and rewritten and published as a new fantasy book: Terrie, The Sorcerer, by author with penname: Loic Cabrel, with uncredited collaboration and contribution from Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. Joanne Rowling (British-born in 31 July 1965), writing under the pen names J. K. Rowling (Harry Potter fantasy series) and Robert Galbraith (Cormoran Strike crime series), has secretly contributed in a retold and rewritten and self-published Harry Potter book as a new fantasy book: Terrie, The Sorcerer, with an author under penname Loic Cabrel. Some Scottish folks strongly say J. K. Rowling had contributed, without being credited, and approved the publishing at publishing site Smashwords and at its Smashwords Store, of a new book titled: Terrie, The Sorcerer, a fantasy book and a Harry Potter retelling book, with no promotion or publicity to accompany it, with an English-speaking French author under penname Loic Cabrel. The French author on her author page LoicCabrelCM at self-publisher Smashwords says: •	Loic Cabrel, the reteller and rewriter of Harry Potter, •	Retelling and rewriting Harry Potter in an alternative universe in a new fantasy series as Terrie, •	Retelling and rewriting Harry Potter in a new fantasy book as Terrie, The Sorcerer, •	Terrie, The Sorcerer, a new novel about Sorcerers and Sorceresses in a Sorcering State, in a School of Sorcerycraft and Sorcery: Scholaria, •	VS. •	Harry Potter, an older novel about Witches and Wizards in a Wizarding World, in a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry: Hogwarts The Book’s short summary states: “Terrie, The Sorcerer, a fantasy novel, that is the tale of a ten-year-old orphaned saint sorcerer, Terrie, who selected as Saviour of Souls and aided by the saints, travels to the Wizarding World (Sorcering State) to save souls of children in a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (School of Sorcerycraft and Sorcery), seized and sacrificed by the satanists and the Sacrificer of Souls.” Its long summary states: “In a sorcering world, Terrie, a saint sorcerer staying in a sorcerers’ settlement in the human world, on his tenth birthday, sees himself of a sorcering status to own a sorcering stick to shoot and strike spells and sorceries as sorcerers. He is also selected as Saviour of Souls to save souls sacrificed to satanic spirits by satanic sorcerers. Terrie thus travels to the sorcering state where he goes for the souls’ salvation with the allied saintly sorcerers including his family’s friends and familiars and fellows who are all also led by his archfriend, the Saver of Souls, with whom all he forms the Camaraderie of the Saviour of Souls. They are opposed by the alien satanic sorcerers who are all led by his archenemy, the Sacrificer of Souls, all forming a Comradeship of the Sacrificer of Souls for the sacrificing of souls. Terrie in his adventures, must act within the time span to save the souls which are still in the stage-by-stage and step-by-step sending to the satanic spiritual section. He adventures across strange and savage sorcering sceneries and surroundings, and sees beings and beasts, all of whom attempt to shoot and strike out his soul of his self to stop him from his salvation. Terrie escaping them travels at the end to the sorcering Source where stays the sorcering spirits, and saves the souls and sends them back to their respective selves, and also breathes in their bodies to bring them back as alas all the someones whose souls had been sacrificed are saved.” So many who have shopped for the book at book distributor Smashwords at its Smashwords Store primarily say already it might much more be better than Harry Potter. Rowling’s first foray into pen naming came with the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) when at the time Barry Cunningham of Bloomsbury Children's Books accepted the book, and being less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, as the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and he believed boys preferred books by male authors, as he anticipated that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman. Her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. Rowling therefore adopted the nom de plume J.K. Rowling just before publication of the book. Interviewer Christiane Amanpour during a previous CNN interview had quizzed her about her J. K. Rowling pen name, and Rowling explained that her Harry Potter publisher, Bloomsbury, wanted to “disguise” her gender to appeal to both sexes. She said: “They [Bloomsbury] said to me, we think this is a book that will appeal to boys and girls… And they said, so could we use your initials? Because, basically they were trying to disguise my gender. “And obviously, that lasted about three seconds, because -- which is wonderful, I'm certainly not complaining, but the book won an award and I got a big advance from America and I got a lot of publicity.” She added that she was “outed” as a woman and agreed with the interviewer that she was a “strong role model”. However she explained that her gratitude in being published (Rowling was originally rejected by 12 publishers in a row) meant she would have called herself “Rupert” if Bloomsbury had asked. Rowling said: “I quite like J K... I wouldn't have chosen it, but I was so grateful to be published, if they told me to call myself Rupert, I probably would have done to be honest with you.” She added: “But now, I actually quite like having a pen name, because to an extent that feels like an identity and then in private life, I'm Jo Murray. And it feels like quite a nice separation.” As for her second pen name, Robert Galbraith for the first Cormoran Strike book The Cuckoo's Calling, after it was revealed her true identity, Rowling said she had enjoyed working under a pseudonym. On her Robert Galbraith website, Rowling explained that she took the name from one of her personal heroes, Robert Kennedy, and a childhood fantasy name she had invented for herself, Ella Galbraith. So as to say and conclude, could it be that the spreading and persisting rumours about this affair presently, of a suppose secrecy about it all, could be part of a wider speculation as the entire affair could be a marketing and publicity stunt as was said to be the case in the Robert Galbraith and Cormoran Strike case? What about the disclosure then, and who or whom well started revealing it? Well…, we will have to wait in the future to see the end of it all."
14,How to calculate the weekday of any date using the Doomsday Algorithm,arts-entertainment," Here’s a cool party trick: being able to tell the weekday that corresponds to the given. If you want to impress your friends and family, then you can learn it using the doomsday algorithm, invented by Jhon Conway. It is surprisingly simple and only takes 30 minutes to learn. To calculate the weekday for any date, you are going to start assigning numbers to days of the week. I like to give them little nicknames. Sunday = noonday = 1 Monday = oneday = 2 Tuesday = twosday = 3 Wednesday = threesday = 4 thursday= fourday = 5 friday= fiveday = 6 saturday= sixaday = 7 Then you are going to need to memorize the doomsdays. Write these down to secure them into your memory. These are important because all of these dates land on the same day of the week as each other. For example, if the fourth of April is Monday in any particular year then you know that the sixth of June is also a Monday. Doomsdays: 4/4 = fourth of April 6/6 = Sixth of June 8/8 = eight of august 10/10 =tenth of October 12/12 =twelfth of December 9/5 = Ninth of may 5/9 =  Fifth of September 7/11 = Seventh of November 11/7 = Eleventh of July Doomsdays are a bit trickier when it comes to January, February, and March. For January, our doomsday is the third for three years, and then it’s the fourth on the fourth year because of the leap year. For February our doomsday is the last day of January, the 28th for the first three years, and then it’s the 29th for the fourth year. For march, our doomsday is the 14th of March, also known as pi day. Remember, all of these dates share the same day of the week as each other. If the date you are looking for is not one of those special dates, then you would simply adjust for the date you’re looking for. For example, if you wanted to find the day of the week for the ninth of June, you would take the doomsday which is the 6/6, and then add three. Because in this case, the doomsday is Monday, then the ninth of June would be Thursday, three days ahead. This is the simple formula to find the day of the week for any date within the year. But if you want to branch out from there, then check out this video from numberphile. He explains how to do it for any date in time, even hundreds of years back. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2x3SSBVGJU&t=0s"
15,How to Optimize Emails for the Search Engine,arts-entertainment," Every marketer can see how strategies like SEO and content marketing complement each other. But when it comes to the subject of email marketing, people generally think that it’s not much related to search engine results. After all, what can email have to do with SEO possibly? It turns out that SEO-friendly emails can boost your email marketing to a significant extent. Given below are the best ways to make your emails fully optimized for the search engine. Employ Keyword-Rich Text There’s no need to stuff your emails with videos and images in a bid to captivate your audience. Just easy to understand text is adequate to convey your message to them. Integrating keyword-rich text is also crucial if you desire to repurpose your emails for web content at a later point. So, it’s best to incorporate visuals in your emails only when they are necessary and provide some real value to your readers. Repurpose Old Content by Archiving Newsletters One of the best ways to repurpose old content is to archive prior newsletters on the web. It also provides a greater number of indexable pages on your website, which can then be crawled. The more you create SEO-friendly content in your newsletters, the greater are your chances of reaching a new audience who get to know your emails via keyword search. You can also place links from the archive pages to different web pages on your site. It will contribute positively to your internal link-building efforts and pull in greater traffic. Optimize Subject Lines and Meta Description Optimizing subject lines for search and emails will lead to better outcomes. See how the subject line and initial sentences can look as a headline and meta description on the web. They should be able to communicate your topic and content to your readers. It’s a good email marketing, and SEO practice as a large number of email inboxes showcase only a small preview of email body text. Use Plenty of Links. Almost every email marketer puts links in their emails for the purpose of encouraging their readers to convert. But if you enhance your linking tactic beyond this measure, you can benefit from more traffic to your website. You also need to include important links in your emails to other content on your website. It will give those who are interested in finding more about your services an easy way to read more related topics. Implement the Best Practices of SEO in Your Emails. In order to garner greater visibility for your emails, you need to incorporate SEO best practices while creating them. Some helpful on-page SEO tips that you can start integrating into your emails are listed below. Your email subject line should have your target keywords. Keywords should also be present in your content’s body text. Use H1 and H2 tags and, if possible, include keywords in them. For your images, put alt tags with keywords. Optimize your anchor text. Build Landing Pages for Every Promotional Campaign A majority of marketing emails consist of special promotions for its services. Here do not just link back to generic product pages. Rather than that, develop unique landing pages for your promotional campaigns. You might feel like it’s a huge effort for a mere promotion. But the greater the number of landing pages, the more avenues you’ll get for inbound links and keyword optimization. It will directly translate into a higher search engine result ranking of your website. Attract Traffic with Social Media Links You can attract loads of traffic to your site by incorporating social media links in every one of your marketing emails. Make use of a call to action encouraging subscribers and readers to share your content. Ask them to have a look at your Twitter or Facebook page or scroll through your Instagram. Create Mobile-Friendly Emails. Almost half of the emails get opened on smartphones. In such a case, if your emails do not open on a person’s mobile phone, they are likely to navigate away from it. So, it’s important for you to deliver mobile-friendly content if you want more traffic on your site. Ensure that all the visual elements are loading properly on the mobile. You can also use an email testing tool to preview your email content on various devices. When you make your emails optimized for the search engine, you benefit from better marketing. Start employing the tips given above to optimize your digital reach and gain a better ranking."
16,Digital Storytelling,arts-entertainment," Digital Storytelling Weekly, I post on my social media and my blog site www.johnboyter.com. I try to plan ahead what I am going to post in my blog. It is also a day-to-day blog, so I quickly pivot if there is a topic I find interesting or a new challenge turns up. The term digital storytelling covers the short stories and instant commenting on social media and the increasing instant visual storytelling. Sometimes, my writing can have a therapeutic effect. If it’s an unpleasant challenge. I try to turn it around and find something positive. I started on a nomadic lifestyle 20 years ago in 2000 but eventually decided to live in the Dominican Republic, where I have lived as an expat for 15 years and had a local real estate business. Just after high school in 1988, I worked for my family’s business, the Pressalit Group in Aarhus, Denmark, for 5 years, including a 2 years trainee period in Hamburg, Germany. Then I started at University in Copenhagen and finished my law degree in 2000. My experiences traveling during the pandemic, my future travels, the nomadic and expat lifestyle, and the challenges and rewards that come with that, I cover in my writing. The online business I am building and the equipment and tools I choose to work with are all to show that I can write and tell stories from anywhere. I have gone through five very different main phases shaping my background for writing: in the family corporate business, at University, traveling as a nomad, expat life with a local small business, and recently, starting a new phase working remotely with online content creation. I can go in the direction of being an author described more on my personal website and on my new digital storytelling website I am developing, more in the direction of working with digital marketing, including copywriting. All creative writing in different forms www.entrepreneurstories.tv. My purpose with my writing is to be entertaining, and maybe the reader can learn something from it or be inspired. Please read more about my writing in the attached article. Entrepreneur Stories I feel I have a lot of experiences to share. Through social media, blogs, articles, and an upcoming ebook, my storytelling may serve as an inspiration for those working through depression, going through transition, or wanting to travel more. I hope it may help others to read stories from someone who is continuing to discover oneself. I am not trying to give business advice as I can’t offer much of that, but rather I can tell stories of experiences I have had the last 20 years and new experiences going forward. I use the term entrepreneur broadly and include the social entrepreneur hoping to positively impact society or the artist working with the primary goal of creating art. Anybody who is enterprising and, for instance, someone who prevails despite challenges like a physical handicap, mental illness, language and cultural differences, or differences in views on diversity. Through writing and digital storytelling, I blog about the development of my online business and the challenges I encounter around legal issues, accounting, digital marketing, and technology. Creative Writing First, I am writing an ebook in the self-help genre. Later, I will experiment with more creative writing, maybe poetry or short stories. I have also considered writing a novel. Locations for the stories could be in all the places I have been spending more time in the last 20 years: Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, and Miami in the United States. As inspiration for my writing, from July 2022, I will be traveling to Denmark and England, where I have family as I am part Danish and part English. And during 2022, I plan to visit Spain to look into possible future residency there. Then I plan to travel to Miami in 2023 and other parts of the US before returning to Las Terrenas in the Dominican Republic. On the LinkedIn Learning platform, I am following the learning path Develop Your Writing Skills, including a course by Shani Raja, Writing with Flair: How to Become an Exceptional Writer, and following his principles of simplicity, clarity, elegance, and evocativeness. I am working on using that method in my writing. I have increasingly been using digital marketing and will blog about my continued learning and strategy, methods, and tools, including my learning around copywriting. My First Ebook I am writing my first ebook, and it starts when I was in Miami in March 2020 on a visit, and the pandemic started unfolding. I will cover issues around mental health from my own experience with a period of severe depression and gradually improving but experiencing setbacks before eventually recovering. I describe the decision to close my business in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, restructure the business which my partner has continued as a real estate broker, and then start as a solopreneur with a location independent online business with blog and writing. During the pandemic, I traveled internationally from Miami to Santo Domingo, then from the Dominican Republic to Denmark via Miami and London, staying three months in Denmark, and finally back to the Dominican Republic via Hamburg and Madrid. The ebook will include how I am developing my business through writing and traveling, the tools I use, and the process. I elaborate on learning about digital marketing. In Santo Domingo, I owned and managed a coworking space, which focused on virtual office solutions with meeting rooms. Now I embrace the concept of “work from anywhere,” a transition I describe. Ebooks I hope to describe how things develop in ebooks every 1-2 years, covering topics around personal development, small business development for online solopreneurs, travel, digital marketing, and the concept of working from anywhere and covering the online tools I use and creative workspace environments I visit. In my writing, I also cover ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts. I have found useful and inspiring and blog about what I found interesting from the reading and listening. Every day I try to write, and I spend some time learning tools and reading material relevant to my writing. I hope that focusing on one thing, writing in different forms, will make the rest of my life and business easier and some things even unnecessary. Yes, I listened to the audiobook version of The ONE Thing by Gary Keller about how purpose leads to priority and priority leads to productivity. Furthermore, The ONE Thing says that instead of working towards being “disciplined,” one should work towards having certain productive habits. When a person has clear, productive habits and routines, their life will eventually become simpler. My Tool Box I am building my online business using Google Workspace for office tools, QuickBooks Online for accounting, and GoDaddy for web hosting and web building together with WordPress and Visual Composer. For email marketing, I use Mailchimp and have a database with many international contacts. These are all tools I have gradually become familiar with. I remember a quote by tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban for entrepreneurs regarding technology; “use what you know,” and working independently, I am fortunate to have that choice. Recently, I started working with Dashlane Password Manager to manage all my passwords, and to improve my writing and editing, I have started using ProWritingAid. This integrates well with Google Docs and, supposedly, is good, especially for creative writing. I want to learn more about SEO and will test several tools for analytics. I am using LinkedIn Learning as a learning platform, and as a subscriber, I follow GoDaddy, WordPress, Mailchimp, and QuickBooks Online for courses they offer relevant to my writing and online business. Creative Workspaces When I start traveling more internationally again, I will visit workspace environments that I find interesting and write reviews about them. The criteria for the workspaces I write about are more in the line of being retreats, and I like it to encourage innovation, diversity, and creativity. I tend to try and do as much as I can around my writing on mobile devices and supplement it, when necessary, on my laptop so my workspace can be anywhere I feel comfortable. I follow the CEO of LiquidSpace, Mark Gilbreath, on LinkedIn, who talks about the “flexible office economy.” They say the trend is going towards a reasonable continued use of traditional office space for collaboration and business-social interaction but a more hybrid approach. More and more people may not want to work in a traditional office at all, and I will have reviews of anything alternative that is, as much as possible, different from a traditional workspace. I may even include some spaces that aren’t really workspaces but inspired me. So it is very fluid and may not be the traditional understanding of workspace. I will try to cover creative workspaces that appeal more to my target audience. Providing Services I review the tools I use and the creative workspaces I visit in my digital storytelling. My following on social media is international, and I grow my audience steadily. I work with hashtags, keywords, and international SEO to increase traffic. My target audience is international and comprises digital nomads, expat entrepreneurs, and business travelers, all having common interests around travel, digital marketing, and personal development. Please follow my blog and my social media."
17,5 Health and Nutrition Tips That Are Actually Evidence-Based,arts-entertainment," It’s easy to get confused when it comes to health and nutrition. Even qualified experts often seem to hold opposing opinions, which can make it difficult to figure out what you should actually be doing to optimize your health. Yet, despite all the disagreements, a number of wellness tips are well supported by research. Here are 5 health and nutrition tips that are based on scientific evidence. Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are the primary source of added sugar in the American diet (1Trusted Source). Unfortunately, findings from several studies point to sugar-sweetened beverages increasing risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, even in people who are not carrying excess body fat Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to obesity in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop until adulthood, like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Healthier alternatives include: water unsweetened teas sparkling water coffee Some people avoid nuts because they are high in fat. However, nuts and seeds are incredibly nutritious. They are packed with protein, fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Nuts may help you lose weight and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, one large observational study noted that a low intake of nuts and seeds was potentially linked to an increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes. Ultra-processed foods are foods containing ingredients that are significantly modified from their original form. They often contain additives like added sugar, highly refined oil, salt, preservatives, artificial sweeteners, colors, and flavors as well. Examples include: snack cakes fast food frozen meals canned foods chips Ultra-processed foods are highly palatable, meaning they are easily overeaten, and activate reward-related regions in the brain, which can lead to excess calorie consumption and weight gain. Studies show that diets high in ultra-processed food can contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. In addition to low quality ingredients like inflammatory fats, added sugar, and refined grains, they’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories. Despite some controversy over it, coffee is loaded with health benefits. It’s rich in antioxidants, and some studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses The most beneficial intake amount appears to be 3–4 cups per day, although pregnant people should limit or avoid it completely because it has been linked to low birth weight. However, it’s best to consume coffee and any caffeine-based items in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake may lead to health issues like insomnia and heart palpitations. To enjoy coffee in a safe and healthy way, keep your intake to less than 4 cups per day and avoid high-calorie, high-sugar additives like sweetened creamer. Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat. This is particularly true of fatty fish, such as salmon, which is loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and various other nutrients. Studies show that people who eat fish regularly have a lower risk for several conditions, including heart disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease."
18,Arsalan Malik- the Successful Film Lover with Big Dreams,arts-entertainment," Can you imagine how daunting it is for a young man with little experience to try his hands in business? Can you imagine the challenges he would have to face up to if the business involved ‘ordinary merchandise’? What if the industry is much more competitive and requires relatively hefty amounts to start? Well, these are the challenges one young man in Alaska, Arsalan Malik, literally had to deal with decades ago while trying to launch his trade. And this was no ‘ordinary business-’ why, Arsalan set out to start a film production enterprise that would-hopefully- outlive its name. And Arsalan wasn’t alone in trying to realize this big dream- his younger brother Salman Malik was ready, by his side to start the journey with him. So, together, the two siblings got down to business and started a small company named Bizzay. As noted, the company would primarily deal with film production in Alaska. Securing Subsidy Before long, Bizzay, the new company, had already developed a full-fledged crew based in their Alaska home. Hence, the company got down running around 2008 and gradually developed into a business that would produce compelling film content. And the hordes of fans were delighted with the new sheriff in town! When Bizzay was inaugurated, the government introduced some grants and subsidies meant to cushion specific categories of businesses from the ravages of inflation and economic depression. Bizzay also enjoyed the advantages of having a crew boasting a wealth of experience and innate talent. The situation was even better because Alaska had many beautiful places with fantastic scenery, well-suited for film production. Unsurprisingly, Arsalan’s enterprising spirit was greatly buoyed by these factors. Launching  Business Arsalan’s Bizzay company was officially licensed and launched in November 2016. Amazingly, despite the phasing out of the booster tax credits in 2015, Bizzay. The company managed to stay afloat, even thriving. The troupe continued their film production business relentlessly. The great talent was regularly showcased at Alaska's famous Experience Theatre. This was done courtesy of several major premiers held within the city. The company started with the production of promotional videos, exploiting their dedication and passion for art to the full. Bizzay’s Big Break Arsalan’s fledgling film company finally made its big break into success and relative fame with its first feature film production. The film carried a compelling social message that, as it turned out, powerfully resonated with Alaska's film lovers. So, this became the real launch of Arsalan’s success. The film enjoyed relative great publicity with incredible public acclaim. The remarkable turnaround in Bizzay’s fortune was almost instant! It was all a testimony to the Arsalan team's excellent production, direction, and editing skills. Wide Acclaim Today, Arsalan's company, Bizzay, stands out as a renowned, highly successful Alaskan film company. Truly, Bizzay is a brand loved by thousands of viewers online. Bizzay is also famed for successful premiers of various films at different festivals. The once small company has received wide acclaim and is recognized by many news outlets worldwide. Can we draw some lessons from Arsalan’s big dreams that-eventually- came true? Hopefully."

BookLocker.com, Inc. 2020 First Edition Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data Celley, David Sultan Road by David Celley Library of Congress Control Number: 2020911984 CHAPTER ONE Sultan Road wandered through mostly empty, dusty fields in a hardscrabble portion of Los Angeles County that was left behind while the area’s abundant real estate growth ventured elsewhere. But it provided the perfect scenario for the largest act of criminal conspiracy and cover-up in Southern California’s history. At the Paradise Cove nightclub, about midway down Sultan Road near Sepulveda Boulevard on the Thursday night before Memorial Day weekend, a slender Asian woman on her way to the ladies room accidentally brushed past a much larger Latina. The larger woman turned around quickly. A few words were exchanged, and then the Asian woman continued toward the ladies’ room, only to be shoved from behind onto the floor by the larger woman. The Asian woman got back up and stared at the Latina. A few more words were exchanged, and then the larger woman grabbed her, punched her, and pushed her into a nearby table. The fight continued with another Latina joining in, grabbing the Asian woman and pinning her arms behind her. Within seconds, all eyes in the nightclub were focused on the women as they slugged it out. Then the crowd surrounding the combatants spontaneously surged toward the side door exit that led to the parking lot. The lopsided fight continued with the hapless Asian woman beaten to the ground and kicked repeatedly. Suddenly, two men stepped into the middle of the fracas and pushed the assailants out of the way. One of the men announced that the victim was seriously hurt and needed to go to the hospital. In the middle of jeering and cursing by the two Latinas—along with some of the crowd— the two men carefully picked up the Asian woman and carried her to a pickup truck. They placed her gingerly in the truck’s bay before driving off. Just before eight o’clock the next morning, an office worker parked her car in the lot of the multi-story office building where she worked. She noticed a shoe protruding from underneath a branch of some bushes. As the shoe seemed out of place, she decided to take a closer look. When she reached down to pick it up, she let out a loud scream. The shoe was attached to the foot of a young Asian woman. One of her office colleagues, who was on his way into the building, dashed over to see what had happened. She pointed to the shoe. Barely visible beyond the branch lay the mangled remains of a human body. Much of the female victim’s torso had been smashed and crushed into a bloody mess. Only half of the victim’s head appeared to be intact. The initial shock was unnerving to the woman. Even worse was the terrified look on the victim’s face as if she had been abused or tortured before being bludgeoned to death. The colleague called 911, and the two remained at the scene until the police arrived. The first responders cordoned off the area as a potential crime scene. A short while later, Detective Sergeant Carlos Aguilar of the LAPD Harbor Gateway Division arrived with his partner, Officer Harry Lee. Although standing only five feet ten inches tall, Aguilar had a rugged and sturdy build. An eighteen-year veteran of the police force, he had worked homicide for the last eleven years. Even all he encountered during that time (plus five years of boxing as a middleweight) couldn’t prepare him for what he saw. As he stared at the victim’s remains, his mind was actively churning. “It doesn’t’ appear that the victim put up much of a struggle,” Aguilar said, while Officer Lee stood nearby. The office building was six stories high and had a layer of bushes that surrounded the ground floor interrupted by an occasional palm tree.  Officer Lee made a careful search of the immediate area for a purse, wallet, or some other item that might identify the victim.  Afterward he said, “I don’t see anything around her that could be helpful in identifying her.” “The question now is whether or not this is the crime scene,” Aguilar said.  “Or is this just where the body got dumped?” Harry paused for a moment. At six feet, he was slightly taller than Aguilar. He was an immigrant from South Korea who had been in the LAPD for seven years. His given name was Lee Har-won which he changed to Harry Lee. He had been in apprentice mode for a year and a half, as Aguilar’s job included mentoring him. “I don’t see any blood other than the spot where the victim’s body rests,” Harry said. “Look under that car,” Aguilar said as he walked over to a parking spot a few feet away. Harry could see some red spots that were barely visible under the front bumper. “Go inside the office building and find out whose car that is,” Aguilar said. “If we can get it moved, we won’t need to have traffic division come out and tow it.” As Harry went inside to look for the car’s owner, Aguilar crawled back into the bushes and examined the corpse. The victim was fully clothed although her top was mangled along with her torso. Aguilar noticed that the zipper to her slacks was partially pulled down. A short time later Harry returned with the car’s owner, who promptly moved his car. Several spots of blood were revealed in the vacated parking space. “We’ll need to call CSI to get samples of that blood,” Aguilar said. “They’ll also remove the woman’s remains without damaging any other forensic evidence. I want you to search the other side of this building to see if you can find anything that might be evidence as to who the victim was and how she got here. Whoever did this might have tossed her handbag into the trash or thrown it away somewhere.” While waiting for CSI, Aguilar took a statement from the woman who had discovered the body. After finishing his fruitless search, Harry used his cell phone to make a few pictures of the victim. When CSI arrived and began their work, the two detectives returned to their office at the Harbor Community Police Station in nearby San Pedro. Logging in to his computer, Aguilar opened up the e-form that was used for filing a police report. A lot of routine details were required, and the two detectives filled most of them in. The exact location of the discovery of the body fell just outside of the LAPD’s jurisdiction as the building and parking lot were actually just a few yards into the city of Torrance. To be sure about jurisdiction, Aguilar asked a colleague to verify if the spot was, in fact, outside of the neighborhood of Harbor Gateway. “We found the body in a parking lot on the corner of Western and Carson streets,” Aguilar said. “It was in the bushes, about one hundred feet west of the main entrance to an office building. Since the body was badly mauled and no sign of a struggle was visible, we believe that the crime was committed somewhere else and the body was just dumped there.” “Well, it’s definitely on the border with Torrance,” the senior detective said as he looked at a computerized map of the area. “But if the crime scene was elsewhere and LAPD answered the call, you should mark it on the form that it’s in our jurisdiction. By the way, you said the victim was female. Any pictures of what the remains look like?” “Harry took some pictures, but he’s not here right now,” Aguilar said. “I can tell you that the victim was a female Asian. She was beaten into a bloody mess.” “The reason I asked is that we got a call about a big fight between two women last night at a bar called Paradise Cove down on Sepulveda. You should check with the bartender at that place. One of them might have been Asian.” Following up on the senior detective’s tip, Aguilar and Lee visited the Paradise Cove nightclub just as it opened for the evening. Paradise Cove had its own building that was located in another large parking lot behind a much taller office building. The nightclub was set back from the street, making it less noticeable to passersby. The heavyset bartender with a short beard, who had placed the call to the police, explained that the fight started when an Asian girl walked past a couple of Mexican girls and brushed against one of them. “It started out innocently enough,” the bartender told them, “but words were exchanged and it escalated into pushing and shoving. I tried to get around from behind the bar to break it up. Before I could, some bystanders had pushed the whole mob out into the parking lot.” Harry furnished a picture of the murder victim. “Did one of the participants look like this?” he said. The picture showed barely enough of the victim’s face intact to be recognizable. The bartender looked at the picture and grimaced. Then he said, “I think so. I really didn’t get that good a look at her. We have security cameras, and you can probably identify her from them.” Then Aguilar said, “What happened out in the parking lot?” “I couldn’t tell. Everyone moved outside so quickly. That’s when I called the police. But our assistant manager might have gotten a look at what happened. I saw him go out the door following the mob.” The youthful assistant manager was available, and the two detectives interviewed him as well. “I got outside right behind the big group of patrons who followed the three women into the parking lot,” he said. “They all stood around and watched these two Latina girls pummel the poor Asian girl senseless. I started pushing my way through the crowd to try to break it up. Before I could get to the front, two other guys picked up the Asian girl off of the ground. They carried her away shouting to somebody in the crowd that they were going to take her to the hospital.” “Did you get a look at the two, ah, good Samaritans?” Aguilar said. “I could only tell that they were two Latinos,” the assistant manager said. “One was taller and had a ponytail.” “Did you get a look at the car they put her in?” Aguilar said. “I couldn’t tell. At that point, the crowd started to get rowdy. Some of the Asian and Mexican patrons were shouting, pushing, and shoving each other around. I had to devote my energy to restoring order until the police arrived.” At this point in the interview, a bar patron who overheard the conversation spoke up. “They beat the loving shit out of that little Asian girl,” he said. “Did you follow the fight outside?” Harry said. “Sure did,” the patron, a crusty looking white male of about age sixty, said. “Like I said, they pounded the Asian girl down to the ground and then started kicking her.” “Did you see the two men who took her away?” Aguilar said. “One was a fairly tall Mexican, and the other one was shorter. The shorter guy didn’t look like he was from around here. I mean, he didn’t seem like your average, local Mexican.” Aguilar stopped for a moment to size up not only the speaker but also the comment. He didn’t want to discuss being socially correct, but he did need a better description of one of the participants. “You mean he didn’t look like a ‘cholo’?” he finally said. The bar patron looked back at Aguilar and then said, “Yeah, he didn’t look like a cholo.” “Did you see where they took the woman?” Harry said. “They put her in the back of a gray pickup truck and drove off.” “Where was the truck parked?” Harry said. The bar patron looked at Harry as if he were dumb. “Down at the far end of the parking lot,” he said. Then Aguilar said, “When you were in the bar, did you hear anything said by any of the other bar patrons about what lead to the fight?” “No. But when the shoving began somebody said, ‘Watch out, Lisa’.” “One of them was named, Lisa,” Aguilar said. “Do you know which one?” “No.” While the two officers were talking to the bar patron, the assistant manager brought out a compact disk of the security video sequences. Harry then said, “Did either of you notice if anyone made a cell phone video of the fight?” He had realized that the security video wouldn’t show what had happened in the parking lot. The assistant manager shook his head. The bar patron said, “No.” Both detectives then walked outside to take a look around the parking lot. “I wonder if there was any forensic evidence,” Harry said. “This looks very cleaned up.” “I don’t see anything,” Aguilar said. “Somebody must have hosed the parking lot down afterward.” “I wonder why there were no cell phones anywhere making a video or taking pictures,” Harry said. “This place is on the border of some rival gangs— Mexican on one side and Asian on the other,” Aguilar said. “If anybody had made a cell phone video of a gang-related fight, they might face retaliation.” “Do you think this was a gang-related fight?” Harry said. “No, I don’t,” Aguilar said. “This doesn’t have the characteristics of a gang fight. But if the bystanders thought that it was, they wouldn’t have taken any pictures at all.” “This doesn’t look like an ordinary bar fight,” Harry said. “I mean, with the crowd pushing it so quickly out the door and into the parking lot where the security cameras won’t see it. Two guys with a truck conveniently parked nearby step in and take the victim away. The crowd blocks the club assistant manager from getting a good view of events. All that seems like it was planned.” “Good point. But what you’ve just recapped is not what usually happens in a gang fight.” “If it wasn’t gangs, then what was it?” “I don’t know yet. I’m concerned that maybe it was a professional hit.” “If it was a hit, then why did an apparently innocent young woman get beaten senseless?” “To answer that, we need to first find out who the victim was,” Aguilar said. CHAPTER SEVEN Aguilar was sitting at his desk when two officers brought in a heavy-set Latina and took her up to the booking desk. While she was being booked, Aguilar flipped through the pictures he had obtained from the nightclub security CD. The match wasn’t perfect, but it appeared as though one of the perpetrators in his murder investigation had just been brought through the front door. While the suspect was being booked on a shoplifting charge, Aguilar walked over to get a closer look at her. Being satisfied that she was indeed a match to one of his pictures, he asked the two officers to bring her over to an interrogation room after the charges were filed. Just before entering the interrogation room, Aguilar received a copy of the shoplifting report from one of the arresting officers. He sat down at the table opposite the suspect, while Harry stood against the wall. “Your name is Maria Maldonado,” Aguilar began. His low-key monotone sometimes caused the suspects he interrogated not to take him seriously. “That’s right,” Maldonado said with the look of apathy. “You’re charged with shoplifting from Macy’s,” Aguilar said. “You want to tell me about it?” “Who the fuck, are you?” “I’m a cop working on another case.” “I don’t have to tell you anything, then.” “You don’t have to. But I think you should.” Maldonado was wearing a sleeveless top that displayed various tattoos on her arms and neck. Aguilar carefully examined those markings for local gang connections while he made some small talk with her. “It looks like about a hundred bucks worth of cosmetics you nabbed,” he said. “So?” “It should get you about two to three in Chino Hills. It’ll really mess up your career as box lifter over in Santa Fe Springs,” Aguilar said, noticing from the report that Maldonado worked in a warehouse. “I don’t need to listen to this. What the fuck do you want?” Harry started up the computer that turned on a monitor mounted high on the wall. The security CD showing the fight from the nightclub was displayed. “Did you go drinking the other night at Paradise Cove?” Aguilar said. Maldonado started squirming noticeably in her chair. The look of apathy gave way to one of intensity. “What about it?” she said. “You and your buddy got in a fight with an Asian woman much smaller than you.” Aguilar said. Harry froze the frame and zoomed in to enable Aguilar to confirm the woman’s tattoos with the ones on the security video. “It was nothin’.” “Who’s the person with you there?” “I don’t have to tell you nothin’!” At Aguilar’s request Harry ran the sequence a few more times. “That little Asian woman is about half your size, and it still took two of you to beat her ass?” Aguilar said. Maldonado sat silently in her chair. Her fear level was rapidly rising however, made clear by the beads of sweat on her forehead. “You don’t want to tell me who your buddy is,” Aguilar said. “In that case you’ll have to take the murder rap all by yourself.” Maldonado began to breathe harder. “What murder rap?” she said. Her eyes were wide open and focused directly on Aguilar. “The one I’m going to lay on you in just a few minutes if you don’t tell me what happened in the club…and out in the parking lot,” Aguilar said. “That little bitch kicked me when she walked past,” Maldonado blurted out. “Oh really? Just when did that happen?” Aguilar said. Harry ran the sequence frame by frame, displaying the exact series of events that clearly showed Maldonado was not kicked. “I don’t see where she kicked you,” Aguilar said. “That doesn’t mean shit. You fucked that up by altering it so it wouldn’t show,” she said. Her tone was just short of a growl. “Then the whole group standing around pushed the three of you all the way out into the parking lot,” Aguilar said. “What happened out there?” “I’m not going to tell you any fucking thing at all. You’re trying to fuck with me with that altered shit. Mierda!” “The Asian woman’s dead body was found a few blocks away, dumped in the bushes next to an office building. Who were the two men who carried her out of the parking lot?” “I don’t fucking know about any two men in the parking lot. And she was not dead, either.” Aguilar then displayed a picture of Lisa Nguyen’s badly mangled body from the folder in front of him. “Did you do this?” he said. Maldonado looked at the picture momentarily and said, “Fuck, no. I didn’t do that. That little bitch had it coming anyway,” she said with a snort. “Why did she have it coming to her?” “Listen hijo de la gran puta, I just told you why. Maybe you should clean the shit out of your ears.” Aguilar maintained his cool. “You killed her, didn’t you?” he said. “You’re a goddamn liar. I need to smack your ass right here and now.” Aguilar was seated, but Maldonado had jumped out of her chair. Her fists were balled up as if she were ready to fight. She did not know that Aguilar was at one time a professional boxer and still did not have an ounce of fat on him anywhere. Harry slid around casually until he was directly behind Maldonado. “You want to poke me in the mouth?” Aguilar said. “What’s stopping you? You’re not in jail yet.” Maldonado started to lose control. “You’re nothing but a fucking punk, a pendejo, that’s all,” she said. Then she swung her right fist directly at Aguilar’s face. With the swiftness of a jaguar, he parried the punch with his left hand and grabbed her right forearm all in one motion. Using only his left hand, he slammed her right arm down on the table, causing her to stumble against the front of it. After a moment, Aguilar released his grip. While dealing with this assault attempt, he showed her his teeth in a fierce grimace, startling her. Harry picked her up and promptly put the cuffs back on her. Then he pushed her back down into the chair. Unruffled by the commotion, Aguilar calmly said, “I’m going to ask you again. Who were those two guys in the parking lot who carried the Asian girl out of there?” Maldonado didn’t answer. Instead, she just stared off into the corner of the room. She was still breathing hard, but slowly began to settle down. “The Asian woman was murdered—beaten to death by you,” Aguilar said. “Now, you’ve got a choice. You can help me out by telling me who your buddy was in the bar, and who the two men were that carried her away. Or you’ll be going down for murder all by yourself while they sit back and laugh their asses off.” Maldonado continued to stare into the corner of the room. After a while, Aguilar finally said, “All right. It’s back to the booking desk for you.” Aguilar charged Maldonado with second-degree murder. Believing that the charge might be hard to prove, he explained what he knew to Captain Bill Kreider, his boss.  Kreider, a crusty veteran of thirty years, didn’t think Aguilar had enough proof for second-degree murder. He sent the two detectives downtown to seek counsel from the district attorney. The district attorney’s headquarters was in the Hall of Justice located just north of city hall in downtown Los Angeles, across the Hollywood Freeway from Chinatown. Built in 1925, the elegant old structure had recently been retrofitted for better earthquake protection. With the file of evidence in hand, the two detectives were referred to Richard Frederick, the assistant district attorney who was assigned to prosecute the nightclub case. Frederick was relatively young, but had spent his entire professional career since graduating from law school working for the District Attorney of Los Angeles County. His recent experience was mostly in violent crimes such as murder. His conviction rate was over eighty percent, that put him on a par with most federal government prosecutors. After a cursory review of the evidence, Frederick said, “How are you getting a murder charge out of this? All we really have here is a barroom fight. We don’t know if the victim was actually killed by the fight, by the two guys who took her away, or someone else.” “I agree,” Aguilar said. “But we’ve got to hold Maldonado. She’s not connected to any local gangs. Some of the tattoos on her neck might mean she’s tied to a gang across the border. I’m convinced that she’s protecting somebody else in this case.” “Do any of the witness accounts support a murder charge based on her actions in the parking lot?” Frederick said. “The witnesses just vouch that there was a huge fight and that the victim was beaten and kicked senseless while she lay on the pavement. They also vouch for the two guys, who acted as some kind of good Samaritans, carrying her out of there,” Aguilar said. Frederick considered the file’s contents some more. “Do you believe that Maldonado killed the Asian woman? Or was it the two guys?” “Even the medical examiner can’t answer that,” Aguilar said. “The victim received some punishing blows to the body and lost a massive amount of blood. At what exact point she died might never be determined.” Harry added, “The suspect claimed that the victim was still alive when she was carried away.” “Of course, she did,” Frederick said. “She knows she can’t get charged for murder if we believe that the victim was still alive when she was removed from the parking lot.” Frederick thumbed through the papers in the file. Then he said, “The simple fact that the medical examiner couldn’t determine the exact time the victim died might make it impossible to convict this suspect on anything more than aggravated assault.” He closed the file and said, “We’re going to need more evidence to make the charges stick. But for now, based on her actions inside the bar, I’ll go along with a manslaughter charge. From the CD, we can see that she was violent and aggressive toward the victim. That will hold her for a while. But the time will come when we’ll need to take what you’ve got before a judge. We’ll have enough trouble convicting her for manslaughter much less second-degree murder.” He gave the evidence file back to Aguilar. After they returned to the office, Aguilar asked Harry, “Did you contact all the names on the list of the victim’s friends?” “All but one—somebody named Randy Vo,” Harry said. “We tried skip tracing, but it looks like he must have left town.” “What do the other friends have to say?” “They all liked Lisa, and were sickened by what happened to her.” “Could they account for their whereabouts the night of the murder?” “All except for Randy Vo.” “I see. Take the list over to missing persons and talk to Sergeant Simpson,” Aguilar said. “Tell Simpson we’re trying to find this Randy Vo guy as a material witness. He owes me a favor, so tell him I sent you.” Before leaving the office for the evening, Aguilar received a call at his desk. It was Jay Phillips, who was looking for a story. “Well, Newsboy,” he said. “You might have hit the jackpot. We made an arrest today in the nightclub murder case.” “Outstanding!” Jay said. “Let me have the whole story.” Aguilar was no rookie when it came to dealing with reporters. He only let out the exact amount of information that he would expect to read in the newspaper the next day.  As it turned out, it was enough for Jay to put together a good piece to publish. CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR In the latter part of any afternoon, Ben Williams would often make the short drive to see his daughter, who lived a few miles away. He usually stayed for dinner and sometimes took some laundry with him, since she had a washing machine and dryer in her garage. On this particular day, he got into his car and started up the engine. As he turned around to back out of his parking space, he saw a man standing directly behind his car smoking a cigarette. Ben waited for a moment to see if the man would move and then made a motion for him to stand aside. When nothing happened, he turned back around to get out and see what this person’s problem was. To his great surprise, another man was standing right outside the car door blocking him. “Whoa!” he said, through the rolled down window. “You scared the shit out of me, man. Say, what’s going on here? I’m trying to…” Before he could finish that sentence, the man next to him brandished a pistol and aimed it directly at his belly. He then fired two quick shots that struck Ben in the upper stomach and chest. Ben slumped forward, banging his head on the steering wheel. He died instantly. The man at the car window carefully tucked his pistol into the front of his trousers underneath his shirt. He then quickly walked toward the back of the car. When he joined the other man, they both started running toward a gray pickup truck parked nearby. While driving back to the precinct after answering another homicide call, Aguilar and Lee got a call that a murder had taken place at Renaissance Estates. Harry, who was driving, immediately exited the freeway and changed directions back toward Renaissance Estates. There they found out that Ben Williams had been shot to death in the driver’s seat of his car. The first responders on the scene had cordoned off the parking lot where Ben’s car was parked. After Aguilar and Lee examined Ben’s position, the medical team moved the body from the front seat of the car to the ground a few feet away. The police officer on the scene showed the detectives a witness. Aguilar had Harry take the witness’s information while he surveyed the crime scene further. The witness, a Mrs. Alma Robinson, was a tenant at Renaissance Estates. She had been walking toward her building when the murder occurred. “Mrs. Robinson,” Harry said, “would you please tell me what you saw and heard.” “I was walking from the bus stop over there back to my apartment, which is over here,” she said, pointing to the two locations. “Then I heard two pops, like firecrackers, or something, that came from over in this direction.” Again, she pointed to where the shots had come from. “Did you see anybody over there?” Harry said. “I stopped and turned around to look as I thought it might be gunshots. There was two Mexicans standing next to that car. One was behind it, and the other one was next to the window. Then they both ran away.” “Did you see where they went?” “They got into a pickup truck that was parked down there further near the street corner. Then they drove off somewhere.” “Can you tell me what they looked like?” “Well, they was both Mexican. One was taller than the other. They was walking. But then they started running really fast to get outta here.” “Was the tall one standing next to the car or behind it?” “Behind it.” “Can you tell me what kind of clothes they were wearing?” “One of them was wearing khakis. That’s all I remember.” Harry then showed her the photo of Suarez. “Did the tall one look like this?” Mrs. Robinson looked at the picture and said, “I didn’t see his face, but he had a ponytail just like that.” “Did you notice anything else? Even something small can be important,” Harry said. Mrs. Robinson thought for a moment and then said, “The one standing behind the car was smoking a cigarette and he threw it away when they left.” Harry’s eyes lit up. “Thank you very much for your help,” he said. He then gave her his card and asked her to call him if she remembered anything else. While Harry was talking to the witness, Aguilar was examining the crime scene. He noticed the bullet holes in the driver’s seat. He further noticed that they did not exit the back of the seat and therefore were likely still inside the upholstery. With a thin bladed knife, he carefully pulled out the spent bullets from where they had lodged. He also found two spent shell casings and placed them all in evidence. Then he called LAPD central to tell them to relay to CSI that he had removed two bullets from the crime scene for the lab to examine. With the tip from Mrs. Robinson, Harry walked behind the car and started searching for a cigarette butt. He checked the surrounding parking spaces on both sides. He checked underneath Ben’s car in the back and the front but was unable to find it. He stood for a moment behind the car and faced the driver’s side window. Then, as if he were attempting to reenact the killer’s movements, he imagined how he would toss out a cigarette if he suddenly had to leave. He turned directly to his right and walked across a vacant parking space to the car in the next space over. Checking underneath near the rear tires, he found what he was looking for. Carefully, he picked it up with tweezers and put it into an evidence bag. He then walked back over to the driver’s side of Ben’s car, where Aguilar was still searching inside. “What’s that you’ve got?” Aguilar said, as Harry held out the plastic evidence bag. “A cigarette butt,” Harry said. “That witness said she saw a guy with a ponytail standing behind the car smoking a cigarette.” “Outstanding!” Aguilar said. “If we can get a sample of Suarez’s DNA, we can place him at this murder site.” A short time later, the two detectives wrapped up their investigation and sent the evidence they had to the lab. During the drive to the lab, Harry said, “Didn’t you tell me just the other day that Newsboy said this man’s life had been threatened?” “That’s right,” Aguilar said. “Newsboy said that his source heard Brendon Millwood tell somebody in a phone call to kill Ben Williams.” “Doesn’t that mean that we have our guy? A threat come true is no coincidence.” “We can’t arrest him over that. But we sure can have nice, long talk with him.” After sending their evidence to the lab, the two detectives drove directly to Millwood Property Management and intercepted Brendon Millwood as he was wrapping up business for the day. They dispensed with formalities by only presenting their identification. Then they crowded Millwood in his office standing in front of him as he sat at his desk. “Mr. Millwood,” Aguilar said. “We’d like to have a little talk with you. Another person connected with Renaissance Estates was murdered this afternoon.” Millwood appeared to be caught off guard. “Oh, really? Who was that?” he said. “Ben Williams,” Aguilar said, after a slight hesitation. Millwood also hesitated before posing another question. “So, what do you want me to do about it?” he finally said. Aguilar took Millwood’s response to be flippant. He motioned to Harry to shut the door to Millwood’s office. “Ben Williams was president of the Harbor Gateway Community Housing Corporation,” Aguilar said, still in his trademark, low key-monotone. “That’s the company that owns Renaissance Estates. He was shot while sitting in his car in the project’s parking lot.” “Well, I’m sorry to hear that,” Millwood said blandly. He started to pack up his briefcase. “That’s the second person connected to Renaissance Estates who was killed in the last thirty days,” Aguilar said. “The other one was Lisa Nguyen, the accountant. Do you not see a pattern of some kind going on here? The accountant is killed, and then, a few weeks later, the president of the holding company is killed. Seems like more than a coincidence, don’t you think?” “I had nothing to do with either of those killings. I just manage…” “But you do have plenty to do with Renaissance Estates, don’t you?” Aguilar said, both interrupting Millwood and raising his voice. Millwood stared at Aguilar. “I’m the managing agent of Renaissance Estates,” he finally said. “I run the place, not Ben Williams or anybody else affiliated with the Harbor Gateway Community Housing Corporation. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do have plenty to do there.” “Then you can tell me why payments made by Renaissance Estates to the South Bay Neighborhood Association were greater than the amounts that had been invoiced,” Aguilar said. His voice was now almost a shout. “And you can tell me why the checks for these payments were cashed by the bank, can’t you? After all, you do run the place and, therefore, you should know the answer.” “Look, I don’t know anything about payments being made,” Millwood said, his voice trembling. “That was Lisa’s job, not mine.” “There has been a lot of cash flowing over to the South Bay Neighborhood Association from Renaissance Estates,” Aguilar said. “The kind of money that can’t be tracked in an accounting system. Does that mean that they have a slush fund?” “You’re asking the wrong guy,” Millwood said, bobbing and weaving around Aguilar’s verbal thrusts. “You should be asking them if they have a slush fund.” Harry then brandished a copy of a check for over fourteen thousand dollars from Renaissance Estates that was made payable to the South Bay Neighborhood Association. At the bottom was Millwood’s signature. “Isn’t that your signature?” Aguilar said. Millwood looked at it. “So, I signed a check,” he responded. “What does that mean?” “It should mean that you know what that check was for, shouldn’t it?” Aguilar said. “The bookkeeper hands me checks to sign that are over two thousand dollars. That’s in the bylaws.” “And you sign them without knowing what they are for?” Millwood’s was fidgeting with a pen and perspiring profusely. “All right,” he said. “That’s it. That’s enough. I want to talk to my attorney.” Aguilar picked up the telephone receiver from Millwood’s desk and handed it to him. “Call him,” he said. Millwood’s attorney met them at the precinct and advised his client to say nothing at all. The detectives continued to badger Millwood about the murders, the checks, and what he knew about a slush fund at the South Bay Neighborhood Association. After a while of giving no answers, Millwood was released. Later that evening, the lab report was posted to the LAPD’s confidential database. The report showed that the markings of the bullets matched those retrieved from two other unsolved murder cases. Both those cases had ties to the South Bay Neighborhood Association and involved the same gun. “Now we know where the gang’s headquarters is,” Harry said. “Ben Williams was shot at about four in the afternoon,” Aguilar said. “South Bay Neighborhood Association closes up for the day at about five. Maybe the killers haven’t been paid yet.” “I think that means we’re heading over to South Bay early in the morning,” Harry said. “I think you’re right,” Aguilar said. On the chance that Ben Williams’s killers would turn up at the offices of the South Bay Neighborhood Association to get paid, Aguilar and Lee drove to Torrance at six thirty in the morning and staked the place out. Again, they parked strategically in order to observe who walked through the office door, as well as minimize their own presence. Time passed, and they watched as the employees walked through the front door one at a time. Then Harry said, “Wasn’t Napier the money man of this operation?” “That’s right,” Aguilar said, his eyes firmly fixed on the building’s entrance. “Well, since he’s been arrested, why would the killers come back here to get paid? I mean, there must be somebody else filling that job.” “That’s a good point. Somebody else has to pay them— either here or someplace else.” “How do we know that the new moneyman even works here?” “We don’t. But we do know that the money is in there. It’s our only lead right now.” Then around eleven thirty, a woman walked out of the front entrance with a briefcase. “Does that woman look familiar?” Aguilar said. “Yes, but I don’t remember from where,” Harry said. “She’s the lady who controls the money in the safe.” “And she’s carrying a briefcase full of it somewhere,” Harry said as he started the car. The woman got into her car and drove toward the parking lot exit. Casually, the two detectives followed her car, being careful not to crowd her, but keeping her in plain view. She led them to a public park that was quiet on this workday morning. She got out of her car with the briefcase and sat at a nearby picnic table. She started reading a magazine, apparently waiting for someone to show up. Harry parked their unmarked police car on a side street near the park’s entrance. Aguilar could view the woman with the briefcase through binoculars. Harry was poised to photograph the transaction using a digital camera with a powerful telephoto lens. A short time passed, and then a gray pickup truck came down the street and turned into the parking lot. It parked in an angled space next to the walkway that went around the park. Out jumped two Latinos, one thin and of medium height, and the other taller with a ponytail. They walked over to the woman sitting at the picnic table. After a short conversation, they received the briefcase. Suarez, the one with the ponytail, opened it, and Aguilar could plainly see stacks of bills packed neatly inside. Harry clicked a dozen or more photos while this took place. Aguilar quietly said. “Start the car and move up slowly. Don’t catch anybody’s attention.” Harry put his camera onto the back seat and drove into the parking lot. At just the same time, the conversation at the picnic table came to an end, and the two suspects started back toward the pickup truck. Harry then pulled the car a few feet behind the truck and blocked it in its parking space. Both detectives got out of the car with their pistols drawn while Aguilar shouted, “Police!” The man with the briefcase stopped a few feet in front of the truck. He looked directly at Aguilar, providing him with a clear view of the mysterious man he’d been after. The shock of black hair and droopy eyes made an immediate imprint on Aguilar’s mind. Ignoring the shout, Suarez continued to the truck and slid into the driver’s side seat. The man Aguilar now knew to be “El Puma” was carrying the briefcase with the money. “Baja el malentin!” Aguilar told him. Put the case down! “El Puma” slowly bent down and placed the case upright on the ground. Suarez had not closed the truck driver’s side door yet when Harry shouted, “Get out of truck, now!” Suddenly, Suarez slammed the door shut making a loud, distracting noise. Instinctively Aguilar turned his head toward the sound. “El Puma” quickly pulled a pistol out of his waistband and aimed it at Aguilar, who was caught out in the open. “El Puma” opened fire, sending two bullets directly into the car door behind Aguilar. Just as Harry opened fire at Suarez, Aguilar immediately dashed behind the trunk of the car for cover. “El Puma” fired again at Aguilar while he was running, hitting the closed rear door. From behind the car Aguilar starting shooting at his assailant, nicking him in the leg, and the two men continued to exchange gunfire. While Harry continued to shoot at the driver, Suarez started the truck and put it into reverse. He raced backward, slamming into the detectives’ car and knocking Aguilar on his backside. “El Puma” reacted quickly to this distraction and pitched the briefcase inside the truck’s bay. He dove head first into the bay, as Suarez switched gears to go forward. Aguilar got back to his feet and shot at him several more times. Bullets zinged back and forth, hitting the car, the pickup, the park’s public toilet building, and a nearby palm tree. Harry also fired again several times trying to hit Suarez, who had ducked down as he drove away. Suarez drove over the curb and onto the park’s walkway to get around the detectives’ parked car. He bounced back into the parking lot directly into the line of fire of both detectives. Aguilar loaded another magazine and fired eight more times, and Harry fired another five shots. Again, bullets ripped into the driver side door, through the open window, and into the siding that went around the truck’s bay. Remarkably, none hit either of the suspects. The pickup raced down the parking lot to the street and turned right. The detectives got back into their car to give chase. As they turned to go back toward the exit to the street, the woman who had brought the briefcase backed out of her parking spot and blocked their way. Harry pounded on the horn, and Aguilar shouted out of the passenger window at her to get out of the way. She slowly pulled her car forward down to the exit stopping there momentarily. Right behind her Harry blasted on the horn again, and Aguilar shouted until she finally turned right and pulled out into the street. Once on the street Harry sped the car out from behind her and they raced past her to chase the pickup, that by now was approaching the entrance to the 405 freeway. Aguilar picked up the radio handset and called for backup trying to get a helicopter to join the pursuit. Within a few moments the freeway traffic had slowed the pickup down, enabling the detectives to gain on it. When Harry pulled behind the truck, “El Puma,” lifted one arm above the bay’s back gate and fired a shot, bouncing off the detective’s windshield. “Ease up!” Aguilar said. “We can’t have a gun battle out here on the freeway.” Harry slowed down and let the pickup gain more distance. Then they both saw that it was heading down the transition road to the eastbound lanes of the 105 freeway. They followed it but lost it momentarily in the freeway traffic on the 105. “This is where we need a helicopter,” Aguilar said. He tried again to get a helicopter to join the pursuit. At that point, they’d spotted the pickup again. It had gone off the freeway onto Prairie Avenue and disappeared into the Inglewood- Crenshaw District. They exited and continued after them combing the area searching for the gray pickup truck. They checked the area north of the freeway to no avail. Then Harry said that they might have gone south after exiting the freeway. With the helicopter and other police cars now involved in the search, the two detectives turned south toward Hawthorne and Gardena. But after a thorough street by street search of that area, they found no trace of the gray pickup truck or either of its occupants. The helicopter and other police cars continued searching the area south of the freeway. But the two detectives started making their way northward to expand the search zone. As they cruised up Crenshaw Boulevard for another look, suddenly Aguilar shouted, “There they are, going the other way!” In that area, Crenshaw Boulevard was a divided parkway. They were in the middle of a block when Aguilar saw the pickup. They were also seen by Suarez and his partner as the pickup began to speed up in the opposite direction. “Cut across the middle!” Aguilar said. With many car horns honking, Harry drove up onto Crenshaw Boulevard’s parkway and down onto the other side. They were now half a city block behind the pickup, that was turning right onto Century Boulevard. Aguilar radioed in the new location of the assailants as they gave chase by going westbound on Century. Within minutes they became bogged down in traffic since Century Boulevard was undergoing construction. When they reached an intersection with a traffic light, Aguilar spotted the truck on the other side of Century as it pulled into the parking lot of a Target Store. “They went into the Target parking lot,” Aguilar said. “Pull through the intersection and turn left in front of those cars!” “With his emergency lights flashing and horn honking, Harry cut in front of the cross traffic, causing several cars to slam on their brakes to avoid a crash. A few curse words were uttered, but luckily there was no collision. Thinking they might be able to trap the fugitives in the busy parking lot, the detectives turned into the fire lane next to the store. A moment later, they saw the pickup traveling away from them on the far end of the parking lot. “Down through the parking lot and then to the left!” Aguilar said, as he saw the gray pickup turn the corner around the end of the building. Harry turned down the parking lot lane, but they immediately got halted when a car pulled out of its parking spot and another one waited to claim it. Showing his badge, Aguilar shouted out of his window trying to get the car to move out of the way. It took a couple of precious minutes, but they were finally able to pass by. Carefully, Harry managed to squeeze the car out of the parking lot avoiding the jam. By the time they reached the end of the building, the gray pickup was gone. “Damn it!” Harry said as he banged his fist against the steering wheel. “Where in the hell are the helicopters?” “They have to fly back around downtown to avoid the flight path of the airport,” Aguilar said. They both looked right and left to be sure that the truck was not still in the lot somewhere. “Back over this way!” Aguilar said pointing to the left. Harry drove down the fire lane, but he had to slow down to avoid hitting shoppers who were walking to and from the store’s entrance. The detectives got to the end of the building but did not see the pickup anywhere. “All the way down to that street!” Aguilar said. They drove down to the end of the parking lot to get a view of the street in both directions. There was still no sight of the gray pickup. “Check it row by row,” Aguilar said. A thorough search of each aisle of the parking lot took them twenty minutes and turned up nothing. Aguilar again reported his status and the last sighting of the gray pickup to the support command. Then they sat and waited. An hour later, the helicopter reported that it had made no sighting of the truck and was returning to its base. Seeing that the chase was over, Aguilar said, “All right, back to the precinct.” He let out a deep sigh as he spoke. When they made their way back to the freeway, Harry said, “We must be the first cops in history to lose two serial killers in a Target Store parking lot.” ABOUT THE AUTHOR David’s life provided him with a dichotomy, as he was born in large Midwestern city (Chicago), but grew up in a small Southern town (Asheville, North Carolina).  The different cultures have blended him into someone with the strength and desire to succeed in life, but still retain the thoughtfulness of a southern gentleman.  After college, he lived in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, before moving to the Los Angeles area in 1980. Athletics have been a major part of David’s life as he participated to varying degrees in baseball, football, basketball, golf, and tennis.  Although once quite competitive, these days he plays golf only for fun. David served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.  Although trained as a combat engineer, he wound up as a clerk in the payroll department for the division he was assigned to.  Working in an office did not prevent the war from coming to him, however, as he was wounded one night during a sapper attack.  He was able to leverage the skill sets from working with payrolls into careers in financial accounting and computer information systems. Educated at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and California State University, Los Angeles, David received degrees in Economics, Business Administration, and Computer Information Systems.  His professional career began with a CPA firm in Florida, and continued in the world of corporate accounting and finance for 20 years.  David reached a point of saturation in that field, so he went back to college and earned a degree in Computer Information Systems.  He then worked primarily as an IT consultant to the retail industry representing the Oracle Retail Merchandising System.  He is now retired living in Orange County, California. Having concluded his pair of careers, David now devotes his life to his passion of writing fiction.  His first writing credit was Woodruff’s Firebase, a story about a young man’s journey from flunking a course in college, dropping out, being drafted, and sent to the war in Vietnam.  Written with passion, the story shows the great intensity that surrounded the conflict in Vietnam.  His next novel, Galvez Stadium, was a unique piece of fiction about the endeavors of building a football stadium during a revolution in Santiago, Chile.  It was also the author’s first attempt at writing a romantic adventure.  His third novel, The Florida Caper, was mystery yarn set in South Florida and the Caribbean, that involves valuable stolen jewelry that was derived in part from the Hope Diamond.  The idea that the alleged curse of the Hope Diamond exists with the derivative jewelry resonates throughout the story. As a reader, David is a history buff.  He formerly used photography as a pastime, and to continue his interest in art, he has a modest art collection of photographs, oils on canvass, and sketches.  For many years he has been a private investor.  When it comes to music, he is a jazz aficionado."
20,How Music Changed The World,arts-entertainment," ‘Music can change the world because it can change people’ In an era where public demand is increasingly driven by consumerism and materialist values, and people are kept apart, it can be easy to forget that music has not just been a form of entertainment, but an agent of social change across history. In fact, in the form of operas, classical symphonies, musical theatre and folk songs, music has been used as a commentary on social and political life for hundreds - if not thousands - of years. Some of the greatest literary, as well as musical, personalities, were even known to include music in their works. For example, Shakespeare, as well as many of the Ancient Greek and Roman playwrights, such as Euripides. In more modern times, music has played a large part in many political and human rights movements, from the Civil Rights movement to the Arab Spring. Music has been used to stop wars, and to encourage them. Music can cause an uprising or subdue a nation. The power is in the hands of the musician. Let’s take a look at some times that music has changed our world and shaped our societies. ‘March Of The Women’ - Ethel Smyth, 1911 (The Suffragettes) Dame Ethel Smyth is one of (if not the most) well-known female composers in history. She composed a series of operas between 1893 to 1910, which were moderately successful across Europe and America, which was a significant achievement for a woman composer of the time. But she was also a suffragette. Ethel Smyth was jailed for throwing a rock through the window of Britain's Secretary of State for The Colonies who was an opponent of the women's rights movement. She spent two months in Holloway Prison and was known to orchestrate rousing musical performances with the other female inmates. Her composition ‘March of The Women’ was made the anthem to the Women’s Social and Political Union. In her later years, her services to music were recognised officially, and she was finally made a Dame in 1922, as well as becoming the first female recipient of an honorary doctorate in music from Oxford University in 1926. She also received honorary degrees from St Andrews and Manchester universities in 1930. Jazz And The Civil Rights Movement ‘Jazz predicted the civil rights movement more than any other art in America’ Jazz has been linked to the civil rights movement since its inception, through its links to the blues, which were derived from songs that were sung by slaves. Although earlier jazz songs were prevented from airing anti-racist views due to restrictions from record producers (such as Charles Mingus’ Fables of Faubus), as the movement began to pick up speed and followers, jazz musicians became more confident in challenging the issues of structural racism. But the fight to play and record music freely did not come easily. When jazz first began to emerge in the 1920s, most bars and restaurants were still racially segregated. As such, jazz and blues performers, who were usually black, could only attend black establishments. Despite being one of the greatest jazz and blues singers of all time, white bars may not have even hired Ella Fitzgerald if Marilyn Monroe hadn’t pressured high flying club Mocambo to put her on stage. Meanwhile, Billy Holiday’s famously chilling song, Strange Fruit, which centred around lynchings in the US Southern States caused enough outrage among members of the white structures of power that she received personal threats from the FBI. She was harassed by the FBI for her heroin addiction, which she had developed due to childhood sexual trauma, and was framed by them and her husband. Despite everything, Billie continued to sing 'Strange Fruit' in the face of racial oppression, domestic violence, and her addiction problems. Her heroin addiction eventually led to her collapse in 1959, where she was arrested from her hospital bed and died shortly after the methadone was cut off on the instruction of Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger. She died handcuffed to her hospital bed. Harry Anslinger had been pursuing Holliday for decades and was known for being openly and dangerously racist even by the standards of the 1920s. Although the arrest warrant was for her heroin addiction, Anslinger had been significantly more lenient with white drug users; for example, telling Judy Garland to simply ‘take longer vacations’. Billie’s suffering was tragic and unnecessary, and perpetuated by the figures in power that should have protected her from abuse. But despite the hatred and the violence, she became one of the greatest jazz vocalists in history and inspired a new generation of young black men and women to fight for their civil rights. John Coltrane was another greatly influential musician in the jazz world. He played in the memory of the four girls who were killed by the Ku Klux Klan in a church bombing, with the concert being attended by Martin Luther King. This event led to his 1963 elegy and hit recording ‘Alabama’. Coltrane had been deeply involved with King and the civil rights movement, and it continued to affect his music for the rest of his career. His wife Alice also went on to become a very successful jazz musician in her own right, whose originality and spiritual dimension to her music provides a lighter counterpoint to John’s smooth, and occasionally darker, jazz. Together, they compile two of the greatest creative minds in jazz history. War (What Is It Good For?) - Edwin Starr, 1970 Edwin Starr’s classic 1970 Motown hit against the Vietnam war was originally written by The Temptations, but they were worried about the reception that it might receive, so they allowed him the rights to record it. The song was a great success among objectors of the Vietnam War, and especially with the black troops who were tired of fighting for ‘freedoms’ that black communities could not enjoy in their own country, and who could see through much of the (often racist) propaganda that perpetuated the war. Starr's War was often used in protest marches against the Vietnam War, and has continued to be a timeless popular classic, being re-recorded by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Bruce Springsteen, and Black Stone Cherry, among others."

Rubens’ back catalogue includes eight books on Philosophy, a selection of poems as well as three novels.  As an active and engaged citizen, Rubens is involved in his political and local community, which has deeply influenced this collection and becomes clear to the reader from the first poem onwards.  His stylistic and linguistic skills are challenging the norm, as well as the mind of the reader.  Simplicity is not his style, inviting us into a rich and colourful world that challenges and enlightens our senses. In our previous blog post we looked at some of Rubens’ poems, dug deeper into philosophical poetry and also offered some tips on how to read poetry. Poetry, a genre which has been getting a hard time in the past, appears to be making a comeback, giving artists like Rubens a delighted audience. As part of the launch of “Seven Luminous Paths”, we spoke to Tom Rubens about all things writing and poetry, as well as his writing process, sources of inspiration and his preferred way to write. Tom, thank you for taking the time to speak to us about your new book and congratulations on the publication.  Your published work is extensive and spans across various genres.  Regarding this latest publication,how did your writing evolve or change, in comparison with your previous published selection of poems? My previous selection, entitled The Deepening Foreground, came out all of fifteen years ago, and contained only 35 pages; so it represented a more limited endeavour than Seven Luminous Paths. Since then, I have written a good deal more, and on a wider range of subjects. Also, my handling of language has advanced in a number of ways. Did the order of poems in Seven Luminous Paths come naturally, or were there some dilemmas you faced? The order actually came from a recommendation by my editor, Clare Newton at Happy London Press, that I divide the material into theme-sections: something which I hadn't myself previously considered, and which immediately struck me as a very good idea. Your poems are detailed and intricate and equally paint some beautiful pictures in the reader’s mind.  Which poem in Seven Luminous Paths was the most difficult for you to write--and why? In retrospect, I think it was 'Crowded Do,' which is in fact the longest poem in the book. The difficulties came from my emotional closeness to the subject-matter, plus the amount of detail I had to provide to establish different time-frames. Are there any of your poems which were left out of the selection? How did you decide which poems to include? I have roughly an equal number of poems which, by agreement with Happy London Press, were left out of this book and will comprise a second selection called Memory-Minings and Other Probes. But, having said this, I honestly can't recall the factors which led me to my choice of poems for Seven Luminous Paths. Many of your poems are about places in the UK. Have you written the poems while you were there, or did the ideas come to you randomly after visiting? A bit of both. Certainly, on site, I was immediately moved by what I saw, and was already coming up with some of the diction which would later go into the poems. But later, on reflection, my thoughts expanded much more, and the main body of the poem took shape. How important is nature in your process of writing poetry? If, by 'nature' you mean natural phenomena and forces, then this influence is especially evident in the 'Powers Not Ours' section of the book. Readers find it difficult to pick a favourite poem, as many of them speak to them.  If I had to pick one, which is your favourite poem in Seven Luminous Paths, and why? I really don't have a single favourite poem. But, with a number of poems, I do draw a deep aesthetic satisfaction from certain parts of them. Let’s talk about your writing process. What is your preferred way of jotting down bits of inspiration? My preferred way is immediately searching for words and phrases which convey the thought and feeling coming to me. By doing this, I try not to let the thought or feeling slip away and disappear--as it may easily do. I think many of our writers can empathise with that. When inspiration strikes, do your poems come to you in one go, or do you write in snippets and varying stages? Usually, I am slow in composing a poem, but I do try to complete it in one sitting--though the sitting may well be a long one. But sometimes one sitting is not enough: my effort then is to complete it at a second session. I rarely go beyond this, because I wish to keep alive the emotions which prompted me in the first place, and this I cannot do over a very extended period of time. Do you edit as you go along, or write drafts first and edit later? Echoing what I said in answer to Question 10, I do a bit of both, though the emphasis does fall on editing as I go along. What is your ideal writing environment? Noisy? Total silence? Music on or off? Either total silence or with the only sound being music of my own choice. Do you ever suffer from writer's block? If so, how do you get out of it? Yes, I do suffer from this, but it is mostly when I'm writing prose--and then almost always when the prose is fiction (and not philosophy). With poetry, I find that the intense emotion which turns you to the effort to write a poem is always there, so there is constantly the clear-cut task of finding words for the feeling. This starting-point never disappears. By contrast, in writing fiction, which is a very protracted project, you may frequently be beginning from a position of emotional emptiness, which slows down your mental processes. Then, you simply have to be patient with yourself until something comes. I should add that, in writing philosophy, I find that the 'block' problem is very rare, even though you aren't starting from an emotional position. The position is a logical and rational one: in which one idea logically leads to another. Philosophical thinking has, then, its own in-built progression of this kind. This is some really insightful and valuable advice for aspiring writers.  Talking about your own literacy heroes, who are your two biggest influences in poetry? Could you name one contemporary and one past poet for us please? The 'contemporary' poet will have to be a near-contemporary, and that will be Philip Larkin. The past poet will be Thomas Hardy. I should add that their effect on me has not been their poetic techniques--since I always find it difficult to pinpoint influence of this kind--but the areas of experience they explore. What draws you to philosophical poetry, other than your extensive background in philosophical writing? I am drawn to this kind of poetry because of its ability to compress general observations about reality which, in their prose form, often lack the verbal precision and sensuous impact which characterise poetic language. My exemplar of philosophical language in poetry has always been the diction of Shakespeare's Hamlet in the latter's ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy. Philosophy deals in generalities, and it does so in prose; so, when those generalities are captured within the field of poetic economy--then you have a corker of a reading or listening experience!

Reading poetry doesn’t require a highfalutin approach; you can read as you’d read anything else.

3,Curtis Williams Photography,arts-entertainment," His Family Background: William Custis came from a huge family of 9 kids, 7 young ladies and 2 young men. His mom was a family mother yet maintained a few sources of income for her family. His dad was a black Master Sergeant in the US Army and resigned following 30 years of administration. His family experienced quite a long while in Europe. When Curtis was six years old, he get to place his foot in Europe for the first time and rejoiced in many happy childhood memories. Early life Struggles: He began school in Germany because his father was posted in Germany after World War 2. His family moved to Los Angeles in the mid-60s. They first moved to Compton, California. The roads were savage and brutal. He spent his initial time in Los Angeles and had faced struggles that were tough upon him. Along these lines, his family moved them to the midtown region where life was and tough for them. After facing all these struggles, they were then moved to the USC University region. It was somewhat less brutal, there were posse exercises in Los Angeles. His folks then, at that point moved the family to the Fairfax Wilshire region, a Jewish network. There was substantially less wrongdoing and pack exercises. He went to Los Angeles High. At 18 years, he was completely clueless about his future. His family could not bear to send any of their youngsters to school. An initiate towards better future: One summer his dearest companion inquire as to whether he needed a task working at a production company that was working on making television commercials. He began filling in as a driver. He was so intrigued with the creation of the film. Occasionally he would work until they sent him home. It was such a peace of mind to be away from the hood that was loaded up with viciousness, wrongdoing, and police. He would not like to return home. In the period of one and half years of working for the creation, he was elevated from driver to prop space and then assistant producer. By age seventeen, Curtis had become fixated on escaping the hood and handled an apprenticeship at a top creation house, Peterson Productions, in the core of Hollywood. He was excited to be in this imaginative climate and would stick around night-time, assisting without pay for as long as sixteen hours every day. He adored the fervour of this innovative local area, and he drew on the ability of top chiefs, promoting leaders and overseers of photography shooting public advertisements. This organization (The Petersen Company) chiefs had all alumni from the Art Center College of Design. One of the chiefs, Richard Rucker who own 1/3 of the organization would always let William work on his creations. He was known around then to be one of the most mind-blowing directors for television advertisements. One day Richard Rucker call William to his office. He disclosed to him that he was beginning a film school inside the organization, and he had been chosen to become part of this school. His first task was to do a 5 minutes film of his choice. This was in the last part of the 60s, around then there was such a lot of social injustice. He decide to do a film on how ethnic minorities are dealt with so severely. William produced a film called ""Dirty Old Man"" he tracked down a black man in the city of Los Angeles, he was a drunkard. Around then there was no destitute like today. He took him to the organization studio. He films him from head to toe, without a doubt, exceptionally close shots. He needed his viewers to see and feel this individual heart. In the last shoot of this film, the camera gradually zooms out to uncover that is the man sitting at the top of a meeting table and there are six white men wearing suits to uncover that he is the President of the United States. William was completely clueless about the thing he was doing, he completed his 5 minutes and offered it to his guide, Richard Rucker and forget about his creation completely One fine day Richard Rucker call him into his office. When he entered Mr Rucker office, he was congratulated and disclosed about his brief film’s success. He was also awarded Junior Academy Award at the age of twenty-two for his 5 minutes videography. William was not able to comprehend at the point and did not have the foggiest idea of what was happening or why. A couple of months after the fact Mr Rucker called him to his office, he said that William had gotten a grant from Doyle, Dane and Bernbach Advertising Agency and the Petersen Company to go to the esteemed school, the Art Center College of Design for $125,000. At this point in life, William was not sure about how things were unfolding. He was simply doing what he was advised to do. Also, he was extremely glad for this time in my life. His remarkable intelligence and dedication assisted Curtis to graduate with honour. Education: At 22 years, he entered the Art Center College of Design. In his group, there were 34 students, just 2 of them finished their studies. He completed his 4 years degree in 2 years 8 months. Though William thought he would not be able to complete his studies, luck was on his side that time. He graduated at the top of his class. Doing his years at Art Center he made a compelling artwork collection. Right up till today his work is exceptionally famous. When Curtis turned twenty-two VIVA magazine issue an article about Curtis in March 1976 that stated, “Twenty-seven-year-old Curtis Williams is very much an artist of our time: his camera is the latest in photographic technology and his subjects are modern, liberated women. Yet, the special effects Williams perfected after over a year of experimentation with film and darkroom techniques invite comparison with the oil paintings of the very greatest seventeenth-century masters.” His Career: His better half around then Robin Nord, whom he just captured as his subject, became popular as a top model in New York, Paris, and Milan. After completing Art Center, he was certain that his guide, My Rucker would need him to keep on working for The Petersen Company. He asked Mr Rucker, for his advice on the next step for his future. Mr Rucker told William “I might want you to go to New York to do your apprenticeship.” William was the happiest individual on the planet. He was not willing to remain in Los Angeles because of the racism and police debasement against the dark. Therefore, he was exceptionally glad to go to New York. This was his objective before going to Europe that he longed for since he was a child. For William, he felt more liberated from bigotry in Europe. Robin his young lady companion and him, went to New York with $200.00. William was never into thought about cash, he would just let his heart follow him. William revealed to Robin that she would need to show until his photography occupations would come in. They went to the second-best modelling office (Wilhelmina Models) Robin was in a meeting with Wilhelmina Cooper. While William was in the hall. Wilhelmina comes to him into the hall and said, “I love your photographs of Robin” and employed him to capture her models and she had simply constructed another studio that William would work from. The first Wilhelmina model that William photographed was Margaux Hemingway. Robin and he left Wilhelmina that day with large grins. Later both went to an advertising agency on Madison Ave to get his portfolio. He was requested to address the proprietor. The proprietor disclosed to William that one of his customers had seen his work. Furthermore, need William to do 3 advertisements for them. It was a clothing company. William was paid $7000 for every advertising. This was the start of his set of experiences in New York. Custis has contributed to many fields. He has worked as an advertising photographer, film producer and director. Even working in diversified fields his priority has always been designing and photography. He served over twenty years of his life as a photographer without any second thoughts about switching careers. He was a professional with extreme talent and always proved to be an incredible asset to the companies therefore he was in demand due to his exceptional talent in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. Several advertising companies wanted him to become a part of their organizations such as Young and Rubicam, Grey, Foote, Cone and Belding. Twenty years of his life were served in exploring the beauty of Europe with the camera’s eye. He worked in Sweden, Germany, Italy, England, France, and Spain. This is the reason he set his heading for Europe. There he was judged for his works and not for his colour. The long list of his renowned clients included Vogue, Elle Magazine, Marie-Claire Magazine, Damernas Värld (Sweden), Ladies Home Journal, Viva Magazine, General Foods, United Negro College Fund, Clairol Hair Products, and the list continues. Today he is serving as Publisher, Executive Editor, Art Director, and photographer for the renowned magazine “Melrose Heights” which has 10 million of viewership on its website alone."
4,COP26 and Amazon's contradiction towards protecting the world,arts-entertainment," As COP26 has arrived, hopes are that, given it coincides with Halloween, it does not turn into a horror show, but will be a testimony of the magic that can happen when countries work together for a good cause.  Reports about our planet being in danger fill the media every day, and so they should, as Code Red for humanity threatens our existence as much as it does the species we have treated as inferior for so long. Sir David Attenborough made a heartfelt plea and warning to all of us ahead of the climate summit: “If we don’t act now, it’ll be too late.” In addition to this, he mentioned that the world’s richest nations have a “moral responsibility” to help the world’s poorest.  Ignoring those problems would be a catastrophe, and there is not a day to waste.  The seriousness of the issue and the decline of the planet we call our home is real, and humanity’s wasteful and disrespectful actions have pushed the world to a tipping point.  Some may feel overwhelmed and scared about what they can do and what changes they have to make to accommodate living in a healthier world. The picture seems so big and scary. Shocking and contradictory; Amazon wanted to destroy our forests Amazon wants to destroy 130 year old forest in Hampshire just for their sheds! Back in May this year Sarah Ferguson made a plea to stop Amazon from building a warehouse - not on a brownfield site but in virgin and ancient woodland.  'Century's old trees in ancient woodland are being threatened to be destroyed to make way for a 220,000 sqm by 23.5m tall distribution hub thought to be Amazon's distribution centre.' Source Daily Mail The destruction would include three Grade A mature beech trees - which makes a mockery on any conservation laws that are supposed to protect against development and preserve British Heritage under a grading scheme and protected oak trees. The ancient woodland is estimated to support 2,300 species of wildlife all of which will be wiped out. Last Friday ""Sarah Ferguson wins battle to save historic trees in Hampshire countryside that were due to be destroyed to make way for a massive 'Amazon' warehouse"" Source Daily Mail Now have a look at this contradiction; do you think multi million dollar companies have the right to promote a symbol of care for the environment, while the top directors do exactly the opposite? ""While searching for products on Amazon’s website, consumers will now see the Climate Pledge Friendly label"" ""In September of 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge—a pact to meet the targets of the Paris Climate Accords ten years early by achieving net-zero carbon by 2040. I've been following Amazon's progress since then (here), along with other sustainability announcements and partnerships. I did a double-take when I saw Amazon's latest big update on the initiative—52 new companies have signed on to the Pledge virtually overnight, pushing the total number of signatories past 100. "" Source Forbes AND ...Does this ring any bells? But like all super rich organisations they will appeal. And the only thing that will stop them is if we all make a fuss.. So Lets get fussing and spread the word - it should not be allowed. We need to maintaining pressure on Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council's development control committee because it is at this point that decisions get over turned. Question we find ourselves asking... How can I save the planet? How can I protect the rainforest? How can I stop the extinction of animals? British Nature is as much at risk as the Rain forest! The answer lies closer to home as we think.  Many of us think of air pollution in mega-cities such as New Delhi and Beijing, the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest and the melting of the glaciers.  Yes, we should be worried about this.  We should not stop talking about this.  But what about nature around us?  It’s not just about the exotic wildlife – but British landscape is also paying heavily for the privilege of building new housing – It has lost 97% of its wild flower meadows – News 2015. Can Photography impact society? Photography has an important role to play. Not only can it mirror our lives, recording all aspects we give it an opportunity to, tangibly preserving our memories. as well as providing evidential proof of the state of affairs. The camera, whether it’s on your phone or a DSLR, its easy usage has certainly impacted the way we see things.  No doubt, photography has impacted society and how we see the world.  It allows us to see people, places, things and events from all over the world and it opens up new horizons and worlds which we otherwise wouldn’t have access to.  Photography is a powerful tool to open people’s eyes to the good and the bad in the world.  Yes, it can have negative impacts, if we think of the paparazzi, but used it the right way, photography will illuminate the world and its problems and its beauty. Whilst it is important to keep conversations about nature going, we need to ensure we are not partly detached by looking at pictures of wildlife from the exotic  worlds only.  We need to raise awareness of our British wildlife. “Waking in the mornings to the songs from  blackbirds, or listening to the summertime buzz of wasps as they home into a jam jar.” (Newton, 2021). Because all those things we are so used to are  diminishing right under our noses.  To give an example; The RSPB are actively campaigning to raise awareness on the British state of  nature are currently campaigning “to Strengthen the Environment Bill, with legally-binding targets to  save nature and Revive Our World”. Insights of an artist Clare Newton FRSA is lending us a helping hand to refocus, in her new book Colour of Silence .  Newton is an award-winning photographer and artist who has built an impressive reputation over a number of years for staging large scale photographic art exhibitions of unusual, but fascinating, subjects. Her ‘Jump4London’ was a 2-year photographic record of thousands of individuals having their personal images captured in a kilometre-long, multi- sponsored, public installation that won her a Guinness World Record. The 6-metre high Olympic and Paralympic Wall installation commissioned by ExCeL London, celebrated the venue’s outstanding contribution to the 2012 London Games, being the largest single venue in modern Olympic history. Her continued contribution to large-scale public art has recently been recognised by the Royal Society of Arts, where she has become a Fellow of the Society. In her latest work of art, Clare shows us that we can do a lot of things, simple things, that will contribute to a better planet, a healthier world, a more diverse ecosystem, but we need to start at home, right in front of our doorstep, in our gardens.   With her analytical eye she keenly watches the little miracles that  surround us, exploring the invisible-obvious.  With Colour of Silence, Newton has turned her attention to the unspoken elements of nature to  demonstrate that the remaining beauty may not be around forever.  The images collected  throughout her career have been combined with a commentary, which questions why the impact of  humans on the world is still seen as acceptable.  The book is thought provoking, packed with captivating images where the artist puts questions to  influential environmentalists and scientists across the world, to provide a sense of reality on the  issues of conservation. The curated subjects build an overview of British nature; exploring the growth and decay from insects through to birds and the changes brought about by pollution, over  population and parts of agriculture. Commenting on the book Clare said: “As a photographic artist – I feel it is so important to make  images that draw people into the conversation and can provocatively demonstrate reality or can  invite questioning in people. It is more important than ever to encourage people to rethink – Care  for nature and not destroy it as the enemy”. So, what do you do when you see a garden spider scurrying across your kitchen floor? Do you squeal and throw a book on top of it? Suck it up in the hoover? That wasp that flies in your bedroom.  Do you usher it out again or swat it with a magazine?  The slugs and worms that crawl across the path when it rains.  Do you step over them, even give them a helping hand to safety or do you leave them there to be stomped on? How do you feel about the flies, the ants, the daddy longlegs, the mosquitos, the beatles, the earwigs, the woodlice, the bugs and “pests” that invade your home and garden?  The Colour of Silence provokes such questions and covers the good, bad and the ugly and asks that we embrace all not just the easy to understand, but the fearful-looking things and fight to protect the natural world we live in.  Clare Newton’s photography is like a mirror and we need to look at reality right in front of us. As Clare says: “I tried to get close and really use my eyes to see things with detailed clarity – I love learning and the book is about a journey into the unknown, which I want to share with the reader; the exploration and questioning, to reveal this hidden beauty and its meaning of wild things that are right under our feet.” The fact is, all those critters are not invading. We have invaded them.  We have modified and destroyed their natural habitat.   And it’s up to us to fix it.  It’s up to us to re-think, to re-evaluate our habits, our luxuries, our conveniences, all at the cost of the ecosystem around us. The UK says that it is committed to working with all countries and joining forces with civil society, companies and people on the frontline of climate change to inspire climate action. Alok Sharma, COP President-Designate, says that “there is no viable pathway to net zero emissions that does not involve protecting and restoring nature on an unprecedented scale. If we are serious about holding temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and adapting to the impacts of climate change, we must change the way we look after our land and seas and how we grow our food. This is also important if we want to protect and restore the world’s biodiversity, upon which all life depends.” The message is clear. Change must happen now.  It must start at home.  Are you ready to seize the opportunity to change, too? Colour of Silence is published by Happy London Press.

5,"What is General Knowledge, and what is it for?",arts-entertainment," The usefulness of general knowledge mainly consists of two macro-sectors. First, it represents the attitude of the individual. The possession of knowledge of general Knowledge demonstrates a tendency that pushes a specific subject to obtain information or information, perhaps even superficially, on what is happening around him. In the same way, it emphasizes his ability to learn basic knowledge, (from compulsory schools) recognizing its value and, therefore, not forgetting them once they have finished their studies. The second macro sector, on the other hand, takes into consideration the fact that the possession of notions of general knowledge is useful for the formation of the civic and professional sense of citizens. Knowing the fundamental mechanisms of the world around us allows a better understanding of reality. This factor also causes noticeable repercussions on the professional branch. We all know, some lawyer, engineer, historian, or economist who, to the detriment of the training received, shows that he is unable to understand the fundamental mechanisms of current politics, science, or economics. The lack of general knowledge, therefore, indirectly can also damage the professionalism of an individual. Unfortunately, it is good to recognize that these are hard times for this kind of knowledge. The culture of our time is essentially specialized and almost closed. It is a widespread idea that it is really necessary to know only what can be useful immediately, possibly through work activity. It is necessary to know everything we need to be able to ""do"". External reality is not an object of knowledge, but pure interpretation. In full post-truth, there is nothing to know and there is nothing to know. There are no basic mechanisms and, if there are, they must not be ""known"" but deduced. The one culture that is often accepted is entirely subservient to professional growth and development. The ""know-how"" is a synonym of ""knowledge"", forgetting the need to know something else: everything that allows the critical and reasoned analysis of reality. ""If you judge a fish by its ability to climb trees, it will spend its entire life believing that it is stupid"" We have all heard this phrase, attributed to Einstein. Here, this sentence, carefully misunderstood, represents the emblem of the context in which we find ourselves and which I have tried to describe above. It is suggested that one should judge the intelligence of a fish by its swimming in water. Its intelligence would then be demonstrated by its very nature and its swimming. In this way, however, we forget what intelligence is, even if understood in a purely practical sense. In fact, in everyday life, intelligence is the faculty that allows us to understand what surrounds us, providing answers to the problems and situations that arise. Intelligence, therefore, arises from a relationship of exchange between us and the surrounding reality. A reality that, often and willingly, presents issues that go beyond our "" sphere of competence "". To understand: judging the intelligence of a fish by its being soaked in water is like judging the intelligence of a man by his staying on the sofa. The fish, in fact, perhaps would never be able to climb the tree. But when faced with the problem, it could put in place various behaviors, some more functional and others less. Here, it is precisely these behaviors that demonstrate intelligence and, indirectly, general knowledge. Returning to the world of men: If Tizio throws the ball on the roof he can certainly take a ladder to go and retrieve it. On the other hand, however, Tizio is also free to perform other actions: throw heads at the wall, steal the neighbor's ball, sue Adinolfi, and so on. The choice made by Tizio to recover the ball is a clear indicator of his intelligence and, therefore, of his ability to understand the world and its concrete problems. So yes, the intelligence of a fish is also judged by its ability to climb trees, just as that of men is also measured outside their ""context of belonging""."
6,The 14 Best Indie True Crime Podcasts You’re Not Listening To!,arts-entertainment," Dive into a world of never-ending eerie storytelling. As the crisp cold air creeps in this Autumn season, our need for spooky movies, pumpkin picking, and Fall themed lattes heightens. But along with our usual sweater weather traditions, a newfound obsession has also taken the world by storm: true crime podcasts. Best explained by Scott Bonn, professor of criminology at Drew University, true crime podcasts provide a strong sense of fear from a distant and safe space. They tap into our most empathetic selves and allow us to explore why and how these events happened and what led up to them. This can give us a feeling of safety (and admittedly sometimes a bit of paranoia) as we know what to look out for and can think ahead about how we might handle a similar situation, learning from the experiences of the victims. However, with so many options, it can feel overwhelming trying to navigate the world of true crime podcasts. Whether you like to approach these cases through a humorous lens or to enjoy the chills that come with dark and somber storytelling, this list of up-and-coming indie true crime podcasts will surely appeal to any true crime or podcast lover! Smaller independent podcasts are special because they allow for audiences to establish a personal connection with the hosts via social media and other platforms such as Patreon; a connection and engagement that you certainly wouldn’t get with the podcasts at the top of Apple and Spotify’s charts. And the quality is often just as good, if not better! Beware… the podcasts I have listed are extremely binge worthy! You may find it hard to stop listening once you start. 'Murder, She Told' is a true crime podcast shedding light on the cold cases, missing persons, and crime stories that often get overlooked in Maine, New England, and other small towns. 'Murder, She Told' uses detailed storytelling with an investigative twist and weaves in original interviews with friends, family, and investigators close to the case.

8,5 Reason to start a Podcast,arts-entertainment," Starting a podcast can be a daunting task, but can have significant value for your business. We spoke to the podcast founders from Business Over Drinks - a podcast about business, entrepreneurship and more (with alcohol) - was started and the reasons behind it. Co-hosts Terng shares why he started this podcast and how it helped him promote his own company SYNC PR and his co-host’s new book (title NSFW). While for brands, it might be different, though the benefits and value of the podcast are definitely worth exploring. Here’s why a podcast would make sense for your business. It is a growing format around the world Being an early adopter is not a bad thing. This is like the early days of music or video streaming, everyone’s doing it, but why not you. Podcasts are enjoying that same groundswell and developing a community of dedicated early adopters. Though still in its infancy in the region, it is growing in popularity and gaining a following.

From their experience, it helps you connect better to your audience, while at the same time gives you an avenue to really let your personality or values shine through. However, what we have come to understand is that through podcasts, the rate of engagement is a lot higher than written content. You can develop a closer relationship with your listeners through the fact that they feel you are engaging them directly through your podcasts because they can hear your voices and the conversational tone of your content. There is a similar trend to how social commerce is becoming a growth industry in the region as consumers want to create a connection with brands and sellers.

9,The Changing Face of Music,arts-entertainment," Music like most technological advances, has gone through many changes over the past 10 years. In fact the landscape of music, especially in South Africa, is completely unrecognisable from 5 years ago. Music has gone from being easily identifiable, as in which genre it conforms to, to the creation of a whole host of new sub-categories. I asked a few South African musicians and songwriters what their thoughts were on the evolution of music. According to newcomers 'Smoking Gun,' ""Music is a continous fusion of past and future sounds. Our music is  based on our individual influences. We believe that music evolves with each generation. We showcase that on our debut album."" Music has gone from being easily identifiable, as in which genre it conforms to, to the creation of a whole host of new sub-categories. Younger listeners, understandably gravitate to more modern music as they, like generations before them, seek out music that they can identify with or in many cases, music that identifies them. Singer and TV presenter Brandon October says, ""Many artists have felt the shift. I speak to fellow muso's and some are struggling to write. I think the covid pandemic has had a huge effect on people's psychogical well-being. It's as if the rug's been pulled out from under us and we're not really sure anymore. I've been working on some material  for the past 2 years or so and everything is different now. People are seeking out things they can feel inspired and uplifted by. For some it's music, art or even baking. It's as if we've gone back to basics. From that aspect, it's a blank canvas as far as music goes.The trick is in writing something that connects with listeners."" Sound advice bit easier said than done. As a 26 year old, I can see how the music lamdscape has changed since I was a teenager. In large part to how technology has affected music sales but also due to the prevalence of social media. We went from using social media tentatively, to using it daily to showcase nearly every aspect of our lives. Many musicians struggled to keep up with the tide and in the process got left behind. Enter a new breed of celebrity; the influencer. Influencers like Jake Paul and KSI have gone on to become global superstars. Such is the power of the internet and record companies are starting to take notice. In the early days of pop music, record labels would send out their AnR (Artist & Repertoire) staff whose job it was to discover the next big act. This worked really well up until the internet became more user friendly and put a spanner in the works. People had discovered a way to have music presented to them in a way they had never experienced before. The platform kept evolving and fast forward to today, where we have more and more platforms vying for people's attention. 'Making music was definitely easier back then. Even media were more open to embracing homegrown talent. Something interesting has happened in the last 5 years or so, in South Africa and on a global level. There's been a resurgence of 80's and 90' music. People are hungry for that kind of music again.' So says Martine, a singer from Johannesburg. It will be interesting to see how music will evolve in the future. Chances are it will have somwthing to do with AI. But that's for my next feature. For now let's enjoy the latest release by Adele. We've waited long enough."

11,The Loudest Bands In History: 10 Ear-Splitting Acts Who’ll Batter Your Brain With Sound,arts-entertainment," For decades, musicians have turned their amplifiers up to 11 in a quest to blow audiences away with their walls of sound. From old-school heavy metallers to cutting-edge electronica artists, bands across a range of genres have shredded eardrums, damaged buildings, and even caused earthquakes from the sonic booms they’ve produced. In this article, we’ve outlined 10 of the loudest bands in history, described the impact their audio assaults have had on their audiences and arenas, and detailed how each of them earned their reputation as ear-ringing soldiers of sound! Motorhead Lemmy Kilmister and his crew started out with the goal of being the loudest, dirtiest, fastest, harshest band in the world, and many will say they succeeded. Their live gigs could reach a mighty 130 decibels, and venues around the world suffered the consequences. At the Cleveland Variety Theatre in 1984 they caused the plaster on the ceiling to crack and fall onto the audience below, while in the UK they broke the roof of Newcastle City Hall, shattered the windows in Wolverhampton Polytechnic, and set the speakers on fire at Port Vale FC. It’s no surprise then that they titled one of their live albums ‘Everything Louder Than Everyone Else’. Leftfield This electronic duo proved they could match any heavy metal band for sheer destructive noisiness when performing at the Brixton Academy in June 1996. Their concert was measured at 137 decibels and the brutally loud beats tore chunks off the building. Having covered their audience with lumps of plaster and dust blasted from the walls and ceilings, the group weren’t invited back to perform at the venue for another four years – and only then on the condition that they turned the volume down. My Bloody Valentine This alternative rock band practically reinvented how guitars could sound on their 1991 album Loveless, immersing the songs in layer after layer of feedback and distortion. When performed live, the combined force of all the levels of sound became frighteningly, notoriously noisy. While touring to promote the album, the band set out to test their audiences’ ability to bear the extreme volume for sustained periods of time, which led to one journalist describing the shows as ‘more like torture than entertainment’. Fans attending gigs were often handed earplugs before entering, and despite the band spending over 20 years either on hiatus, broken up entirely, or unsuccessfully trying to record the follow-up to Loveless, the early days left their mark in the form of chronic tinnitus. ‘I regard it as a friend,’ singer/guitarist Kevin Shields has said. The Who On May 31, 1976, 75,000 people packed into Charlton Athletic’s football ground in London to see a line-up headlined by The Who. Their performance that evening was measured at 126 decibels… 100 feet away from the speakers. However, being among the loudest bands in history came at a price for the members, with Roger Daltrey telling reporters in 2018, ‘I advise all you rock-and-roll fans – take your f***ing ear plugs to the gigs. If only we had known when we were young… we are lip-reading.’ Blue Cheer American psychedelic rockers Blue Cheer are considered a pioneer of extreme loudness, being the first band ever listed in The Guinness Book of World Records as loudest band in the world. In the late 1960s their volume levels were well beyond what people were accustomed to, with fans at their gigs commonly having to abandon the first few rows as they couldn’t withstand the noise. Blue Cheer were so loud that they had to record outdoors, with part of their second album being recorded on a San Francisco pier. Manowar These power metal troublemakers often write songs influenced by tales of swords, sorcery, fantasy, and mythology, being well known for their epic, crushing sound. It seems appropriate then, that Manowar have seemingly been on a quest to hit levels of loudness that no other band can possibly complete with. In 1984, the group were named by the Guinness Book of World Records for delivering the loudest performance ever, and they have since broken their own record on two further occasions. Their current personal best decibel count was achieved during a sound check at the Magic Circle Fest in 2008, when they reached a mighty 139 decibels. Deep Purple Another band recognised as the loudest in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records, Deep Purple are among the originators of inflicting supreme noise punishment upon their all too eager audiences. A whole generation grew up with Deep Purple pummelling their eardrums and earning their place in rock folklore, while some fans ended up taking harder hits than they ever expected, as three audience members attending a 1972 gig at the London Rainbow Theatre were knocked unconscious by the force of the sonic assault they were subjected to. Kiss Gene Simmons’ latex-clad showmen had their heyday in the 1970s and 1980s, so it is perhaps surprising that their loudest moment came in December 2009. During a performance in Ottawa, Canada the band hit an extraordinary 136 decibels. Apparently the concert was so loud that the noise complaints from the city’s residents forced the band to turn down the volume mid-show. Foo Fighters During a show in Auckland, New Zealand on December 13th  2011, Dave Grohl and his crew literally made the earth shake. Over the course of their 3-hour set, the band caused ground movement similar to a volcanic tremor which was felt up to a mile away. Clearly though that wasn’t enough, as the following year they played a gig in Belfast to 32,000 fans which could be heard up to 12 miles away – resulting in 140 noise complaints being made. Led Zeppelin These rock gods have long been regarded as one of the best, loudest, and most influential bands ever. Known as one of the founders of heavy metal, Led Zeppelin’s concussive crunch hit harder than almost every band who’d come before. Anecdotally, many music journalists believe the group’s performances during the 1970s were the noisiest of that decade, but their legacy of loudness gained official recognition when The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) measured a performance of Heartbreaker at an astonishing 130 decibels."
12,The World’s Loudest Classical Music,arts-entertainment," Rock and metal fans get a lot of flack from classical fans for their noisy rabblerousing that can reach frightening levels of sound. But believe it or not, classical fans have a few antisocial tracks of their own - and they’ve been playing them for a lot longer. Here, we’ve gathered some of the loudest examples of classical music, so get your earplugs ready! The Instruments While many people (rightly or wrongly) associate loud music with electric guitars and drum kits, classical instruments can make a considerable amount of noise too. For example, consider the following records they have set: The Instrument With Furthest Travelling Sound - The Carillon The carillon is perhaps better known as 'church bells', and comprises 23 bells that are played using a keyboard or by manual ringing by church bell ringers. The noise is audible from as far as 11km away! The Loudest Recorded Instrument - The Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ Documented in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the loudest instrument, the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium organ is composed of 33,112 pipes, 7 keyboards and 1,439 keys, and plays a noise that is six times louder than a train whistle. The organ is also known as one of the largest instruments, weighing over 150 tonnes. Composing A Cacophony Many composers have created bombastically loud classical music! Here are some of the noisiest examples: Battle Of Vitoria - Beethoven https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C-3yJAmcK4 Beethoven is known for creating loud and raucous works. His Battle of Vitoria used 100 musicians and was described by critics as a ‘sonic assault on the listener’ and the ‘beginning of a musical arms race for ever louder…symphonic performance’. Interestingly, the piece was not originally composed for an orchestra, as per Beethoven’s usual compositions. Instead, it was composed for the panharmonicon, a mechanical orchestral organ - which never really caught on. Beethoven’s piece was redeveloped for the orchestra, and was very popular throughout Europe, although he himself had little attachment to the piece, and it was not well-received by the English prince regent, who made no comment on the arrangement. Beethoven is a fascinating example of a classical composer because of his famed deafness. And while many people have speculated throughout the ages that he composed his music despite his deafness, it has recently been suggested that it was precisely deafness that lent itself to some of Beethoven's signature trademarks. In a letter dated 1801, Beethoven described his difficulties with hearing music; 'In the theatre, I have to get very close to the orchestra to understand the performers, and that from a distance, I do not hear the high notes of the music and the singer's voices.' Beethoven’s deafness was attributed to bilateral tinnitus in his left ear. By 1818, Beethoven was communicating by writing in a notebook. And by 1825, he was completely deaf. A review by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) has found that Beethoven’s music lowered in pitch throughout his musical career - likely due to his worsening ability to hear high pitched noises. 1812 Overture - Tchaikovsky https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8 Tchaikovsky famously hated his piece the 1812 Overture and slammed it as being 'very loud and noisy and completely without artistic merit'. And while it is not without all artistic merit, the 1812 Overture is certainly noisy! The symphony was written to include five cannon shots, Like Beethoven’s Battle Of Vitoria, the 1812 Overture was a militaristic piece, composed to commemorate the Battle of Borodino against Napoleon. Although the Russians had, in fact, lost the battle against Napoleon, the piece was designed to reflect Russian nationalistic themes, and show victory in the face of war. However, this almost delusional retrospective view of history backfired; in 1881, Tsar Alexander II, for whom the composition had been commissioned, was assassinated. The 1812 overture was finally first heard with no cannon shots or brass accompaniment, nor cathedral bells as it was originally written. Mars, Bringer Of War – Gustav Holst https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I Holst wrote Mars, Bringer Of War in 1914 before the start of WWI, but it was not released until 1918. Mars was highly effective in communicating the violence of war, and although many have assumed that the piece was written to commemorate the tragedies of mechanised warfare, the piece was actually composed before WW1 even began, and critics have speculated that Mars was more of a musical exercise in using clashing notes and crescendos for Holst than a political statement. The piece is composed in a minor key, which emphasises the feelings of terror and tragedy attached to the music, with a strict, militaristic rhythm using harsh instruments such as trumpets and horns. This is in direct contrast to Holst’s other work, Venus, Bringer Of Peace, which is a calm and serene composition, using harp and flute to invoke the Roman Goddess of peace and love. Mars, Bringer Of War was also the inspiration for the main riff for Black Sabbath’s Black Sabbath, as well as the theme song for Star Wars, among other movies."
13,Independent Filmmaker and Emmy Winning Sound Studio Attempt to Reimagine the Original Star Wars with a TikTok Style Mashup,arts-entertainment," Despite the franchise’s initial release over 40 years ago, Star Wars has dominated theater screens and the heart’s of fans well into the 21st century. The Star Wars legacy is virtually unprecedented and untouchable; arguably, there is no fan base that has transcended generations the way Star Wars has. Daring to introduce his own personal creative touch onto the iconic films is one independent filmmaker. Known as an “Idea Guy,” he put himself on an unprecedented mission to reinvent and reinvigorate the beloved films, with his own creative flair. Coming soon is “Darwinism,” a full length feature without a full budget. Although billed as a mashup of the visuals from the first 3 Star Wars feature films, the independent filmmaker makes it clear - this does not follow the Star Wars timeline nor plot line. Although original (and iconic) aspects of the previous films like Darth Vader and the Death Star are included, “Darwinism” is Star Wars revisited, reinvented, resurrected. While the iconic cinematography of Peter Suschitzky, Gilbert Taylor and Alan Hume remain as-is, “Darwinism’s” bold approach removes all original dialogue and sound, replaced with the independent filmmaker’s questionable flash of brilliance to transport the story to Planet Earth. “Darwinism” puts Darth Vader, now known as Lord Savior, on the center stage. Expelled from Earth, he acquires the Death Star, assembles an army and encounters something beyond all known scientific reality as he heads back to Earth. Written by “the idea guy”, the original Star Wars cinematography will host his 21st century rendition of the saga. What is clearly a passionate effort is also a bold one, maybe even controversial to long-time fans. The question remains - will the IFM’s story be as engaging and entertaining as the originals? Will it match visuals from over 40 years ago?   To fulfill his mission, the IFM enlisted Cory Choy an Emmy Award winning sound mixer to, simply stated, “make it sound awesome”. Replacing the film’s original dialogues will be IFM’s written script, matched syllable for syllable, with timing down to the tenth of the second. Cory Choy brings with him his Emmy award winning Sound Studio, Silver Sound’s talents, together final challenge is to bring Darwinism’s script to life with sound. A project of this ambition seems to follow the footsteps of many Star Wars fans. The franchise arguably has one of the most dedicated and intense fanbase, who have used their own creative forces to put their spin on the beloved franchise. There’s endless amounts of fan-made films many which of reached their own level of success. Loyal fans maintain dedicated Instagram pages, filled with franchise discussion, artwork, merchandise, memorabilia, and more. Critical acclaim, thousands of followers and massive platforms maintain the Star Wars legacy to this very day. It speaks volume of the franchise’s impact on movie-goers. This project hopes to join the ranks as one of them very soon. The impact and success of Star Wars fan efforts and creators is tangible; the story clearly resonates with so many, generation of after generation. As a result, the story is reinvented time and time again. Arguably then, the audience for a film like “Darwinism” already exists. However, it’s the film’s mash-up approach that needs to be successfully pulled off to ensure Star Wars fans and moviegoers alike enjoy the effort. There is no question that the audience for “Darwinism” is plentiful. The viewers are there, its just a question of if the new story will pull moviegoers and resonate with the just as much. A mash-up effort like this is almost unprecedented. Mashup culture is nothing new. Fans of any music, tv show, movie or other content forms are always engaging in mashups. Whether its replacing instrumentals on one song with lyrics from another, or uniting dialogue from one film with another film’s visuals, media mash-up’s have always existed to allow fans to unleash their inspired creative energies. Especially now, with applications like TikTok and Instagram, mashups exist in nearly every corner of content creation. Now more then ever, music producers, filmmakers and content creators have unlimited databases to choose and manipulate pre-existing music, dialogue and/or visuals to tell their own story. Film mash-ups are by no means rare, but this effort definitely is. He’s facing a monumental undertaking that requires an immense amount of dedication and fearlessness. After all, he is essentially choosing to rewrite one of the greatest film franchises of all time. Typically, mash-up creators are able to realizable depend on the pre-existing consumability and popularity of the content forms they are combining. The IFM, however, is starting from scratch with his own writing, his own dialogue; his own audio vision. “Darwinism” is arguably the first effort of it’s kind, and in any sense, is a true passion project. Because of the unprecedented nature of this kind of effort, the success of IFM’s script writing efforts will only be revealed once the movie is on the “big screen”. But to get there, help is still needed. Supporters will be able to contribute through Kickstarter to help and bring the project to life. Project link here: StarWars Reimagined.

14,An Exploration of Androgyny and the Revival of Rock & Roll,arts-entertainment," Rock and roll is known for its gender-bending fashion, that’s not a secret. Genre icons David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and Alice Cooper experimented with traditionally feminine looks in the heyday of rock, pushing the boundaries of gender roles during a politically tumultuous and socially challenging era. Andy Warhol created his “Factory” by acquiring unique personalities that would eventually lead to the discovery of the Velvet Underground. Among them, Lou Reed rose to stardom with undeniable sexual energy, an “equal opportunity lover” if you will, and a divine raspy voice that captured the attention of the music industry. If you’ve had your head above water in the past five years, you may have noticed that this particular phenomenon is making a comeback. Boy Band member turned solo rockstar Harry Styles prompted conservative outrage by wearing a Gucci ballgown on the cover of Vogue’s December 2020 issue. The newest generation of music has no qualms about publicly experimenting with their gender and sexuality, channeling their musical forefathers who challenged the same status quo. This is the beginning of rock and roll’s revival. Rock has been a home for social misfits since its inception. Almost every kid who has had an inkling of rebellion in their bones has found their place in the rock scene. But somewhere along the line, the spirit of rock and roll died- giving way to bubblegum pop created by industry executives whose only goal was to appeal to the masses. As the modern world began to crumble in the early 2010’s- climate change, political turmoil, racism, sexism, etc., the misfits of old gave birth to a new generation of androgynous artists determined to revive the soul of rock and roll. Former pop stars Sam Smith, Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus, Harry Styles, and Willow (Smith), among many others, have broken free from those executive restraints and are ushering in a new era that is sexually ambiguous and confidently blurs the lines between gender and art. Cyrus stated in an interview with TIME that her gender identity,”has nothing to do with any parts of me or how I dress or how I look. It's literally just how I feel."" This rebellious musical revolution broke through during an international pandemic, Covid-19 forced every artist to stay inside for over a year, prompting a turn to the familiar- rock music. Cyrus’s cover of Blondie’s 1979 hit “Heart of Glass” went viral among Generation Z and Millenials during the extended lockdown. Machine Gun Kelly made a lateral move from rap to pop-rock, and Willow has quickly established her position in the rock scene after releasing “t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l” with Blink-182’s Travis Barker. Young prodigy Olivia Rodrigo released her rock song “Brutal” earlier this summer, providing an anthem for Generation Z- it really is brutal out here. Despite pushback from close-minded individuals, these brave artists have pursued their art while freely expressing their identities in the media. All of these elements have come together in the most beautiful way to revive the community of outcasts that defy the status quo through the art of rock and roll. Generation Z holds the spirit of rock and the future of the music industry in their hands. This is only the beginning."
15,WHAT HAPPENED AT HXS COLORBLIND?,arts-entertainment," Right off the bat, the team at Hidden X Soul has made it clear: what happens at HXS, stays at HXS. Their first event, Colorblind, hit the NYC event scene cloaked in full secrecy. Every detail was on a need-to-know basis, inviting crowds to trust in the unexpected in order to create an experience that was both enticing and exclusive. For those of you who didn’t get your hands on a golden ticket, the mysterious nature of Hidden By Soul has probably left you endlessly wondering, what went down at Colorblind? The only ones who can dish the details are the selected guests who were able to experience the once-in-a-lifetime event. So...if you know, you know. But if you don’t know, then you’ve come to the right place. Let's start with one of the masterminds behind the event, musician and Art House Director, Amish Darr. In an earlier interview, Amish explained, “Part of the vision behind HXS is to bring people in the NYC creative community together. Let’s be fair to each other. When you treat everyone justly, that opens the doorway to positive change. Regardless of the color of your skin, or where you are from, everyone should be treated with fairness and love."" So, was the mission accomplished? Dear wondering souls, here is the moment you’ve been waiting for. We’re dropping the curtain and uncovering the secrecy of HXS Colorblind. On July 30th 2021, the groups of curious guests began to gather in front of an unmarked location in Brooklyn, New York. They were ushered through a candle-lit hallway and told to wait in a room in front of two iron double doors. That’s right. From start to finish, even the guests had no idea what they were in for. You can imagine the intrigue splashed across their faces as they waited for the doors to open. Anticipation filled the room. What could possibly lie behind the double doors that led to Colorblind? The doors creaked open and slowly the guests filed in. A deep voice boomed from the speakers announcing their arrival. The space was dark except for the row of backlit translucent curtains running through the center of the room. The booming voice instructed guests to take their seats.  The lights went out. The room fell silent. Showtime. HXS wasted no time shocking the audience. A flash of red burst into the center of room as the first artist, an Indian dancer, twirled around the luminous curtains. The lighting followed her movements, casting her brilliant silhouette over the audience. The exciting display was the entire vision of architect and designer, Hira Sabuhi, who transformed the warehouse event space into an interactive dream theatre. Her architectural inspired set was designed to, “blur the boundaries between the artist and audience,” and that’s exactly what it did. There was no distinction between the performer and the guests as the stage blended seamlessly with the seating. Her unique design integrated floating transparent panels and lighting to create an illusion. A projection of the artists illuminated the layers of hanging translucent fabric, casting their lighted image over the audience and onto the walls. Guests were fully immersed in the art itself as part of the experience. Following the electrifying opening dance number, Natalie Nascenzi, Media Director and host of HXS, made her entrance into the center panel. The energy instantaneously shifted from exhilarating to intimate and thoughtful. Her opening poem, titled “Colorblind,” sent the audience into a philosophical trance–prompting them to shed their previous perceptions of one another. When HXS claimed, “expect the unexpected” they weren’t kidding. Just as the audience was settling into one energy, they would promptly shift direction and entirely different artist would enter the spotlight. In an instant, an intense rapper shocked the audience with his quick lyrics and invigorating drum solo. Immediately, he was followed by a cellist, accompanied by a captivating contemporary dancer. Every artist was completely different from the next, in both style and culture. This carefully curated line-up of artists was driven by the overall message surrounding the celebration of inclusivity and diversity. Across every part of the show, HXS made the point of seeing beyond the visible and experiencing only the art and soul as the true star of the show. It didn’t matter who was taking the stage. It didn’t matter the color of their skin, their age, or their identity. It only mattered how their performance made you feel. As the night went on, audience members were enthralled by a classical pianist pairing her traditional piano skills with a techno soundboard. Next, the room was forced to listen intently as an artist spoke of race while simultaneously creating a painting. To bring the show to a beautiful close, Amish Darr, lead musician and Art House Director of HXS, entranced the audience with his eclectic music in a spellbinding finale performance. Overall, HXS created an incredible experience with their culturally diverse, extremely talented line-up of New York City artists and their one-of-kind immersive set design. The message of the show, to shatter the norm and see everyone through the eyes of fairness, was present from beginning to end. Adding to the magic of the evening, there was delicious Jamaican and Latin cuisine, open conversation and networking, and a variety of local artisans selling their works. In addition to putting on a show-stopping event, HXS gave a whole new meaning to lights, cameras, and action. According to the team, “The ideas to make an impact can only become a reality when action is taken. At HXS, we plan to act.”  To give back to the community, HXS asked their audience members to bring items such as notebooks, art supplies, and books to donate to the New York City parks and recreation centers. Amazingly, guests generously contributed, and the team was able to donate hundreds of items. One thing is for sure, HXS promised enlightening and mysterious…. Colorblind delivered. So, what’s coming next for HXS?  Follow @hiddenbysoul to find out."

17,Israel Joffe: The catastrophic collapse of Atlantic City,arts-entertainment," With the closure of almost half of Atlantic City's casinos, Newark set to vote on gambling and casinos or racinos in almost every state, it seems as if the reasons for the very existence of Atlantic City are in serious jeopardy. Atlantic City, once a major vacation spot during the roaring 20s and 1930s, as seen on HBOs Boardwalk Empire, collapsed when cheap air fare became the norm and people had no reason to head to the many beach town resorts on the East Coast. Within a few decades, the city, known for being an ‘oasis of sin’ during the prohibition era, fell into serious decline and dilapidation. New Jersey officials felt the only way to bring Atlantic City back from the brink of disaster would be to legalize gambling. Atlantic City’s first casino, Resorts, first opened its doors in 1978. People stood shoulder to shoulder, packed into the hotel as gambling officially made its way to the East Coast. Folks in the East Coast didn't have to make a special trip all the way to Vegas in order to enjoy some craps, slots, roulette and more. While detractors felt that the area still remained poor and dilapidated, officials were quick to point out that the casinos didn't bring the mass gentrification to Atlantic City as much as they hoped but the billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of jobs for the surrounding communities was well worth it. Atlantic City developed a reputation as more of a short-stay ‘day-cation’ type of place, yet managed to stand firm against the 'adult playground' and 'entertainment capital of the world' Las Vegas. Through-out the 1980s, Atlantic City would become an integral part of American pop culture as a place for east coast residents to gamble, watch boxing, wrestling, concerts and other sporting events. However in the late 1980s, a landmark ruling considered Native-American reservations to be sovereign entities not bound by state law. It was the first potential threat to the iron grip Atlantic City and Vegas had on the gambling and entertainment industry. Huge 'mega casinos' were built on reservations that rivaled Atlantic City and Vegas. In turn, Vegas built even more impressive casinos. Atlantic City, in an attempt to make the city more appealing to the ‘big whale’ millionaire and billionaire gamblers, and in effort to move away from its ‘seedy’ reputation, built the luxurious Borgata casino in 2003. Harrah’s created a billion dollar extension and other casinos in the area went through serious renovations and re-branded themselves. It seemed as if the bite that the Native American casinos took out of AC and Vegas’ profits was negligible and that the dominance of those two cities in the world of gambling would remain unchallenged. Then Macau, formally a colony of Portugal, was handed back to the Chinese in 1999. The gambling industry there had been operated under a government-issued monopoly license by Stanley Ho's Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau. The monopoly was ended in 2002 and several casino owners from Las Vegas attempted to enter the market. Under the one country, two systems policy, the territory remained virtually unchanged aside from mega casinos popping up everywhere. All the rich ‘whales’ from the far east had no reason anymore to go to the United States to spend their money. Then came the biggest threat. As revenue from dog and horse racing tracks around the United States dried up, government officials needed a way to bring back jobs and revitalize the surrounding communities. Slot machines in race tracks started in Iowa in 1994 but took off in 2004 when Pennsylvania introduced ‘Racinos’ in an effort to reduce property taxes for the state and to help depressed areas bounce back. As of 2013, racinos were legal in ten states: Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia with more expected in 2015. Tracks like Delaware Park and West Virginia's Mountaineer Park, once considered places where local degenerates bet on broken-down nags in claiming races, are now among the wealthiest tracks around, with the best races. The famous Aqueduct race track in Queens, NY, once facing an uncertain future, now possesses the most profitable casino in the United States. From June 2012 to June 2013, Aqueduct matched a quarter of Atlantic City's total gaming revenue from its dozen casinos: $729.2 million compared with A.C.'s $2.9 billion. It has taken an estimated 15 percent hit on New Jersey casino revenue and climbing. And it isn't just Aqueduct that's taking business away from them.  Atlantic City's closest major city, Philadelphia, only 35-40 minutes away, and one of the largest cities in America, now has a casino that has contributed heavily to the decline in gamers visiting the area. New Jersey is the third state in the U.S. to have authorized internet gambling.  However, these online casinos are owned and controlled by Atlantic City casinos in an effort to boost profits in the face of fierce competition. California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Texas are hoping to join Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands in offering online gambling to their residents. With this in mind, it seems the very niche that Atlantic City once offered as a gambling and entertainment hub for east coast residents is heading toward the dustbin of history. Time will tell if this city will end up like Detroit. However, the fact that they are losing their biggest industry to major competition, much like Detroit did, with depressed housing, casinos bankrupting/closing and businesses fleeing , it all makes Atlantic City’s fate seem eerily similar."
18,Violet Evergarden Review,arts-entertainment," In the past, I reviewed A Silent Voice both because I loved that anime and because I’d like to support Kyoto Animation in light of the tragic attack in 2019 where many staff lost their lives. I’ll be covering my favorite titles by the company, and the next one up is none other than the hit anime about the girl with the metal hands. Violet Evergarden is truly one of the most unique and emotional anime I’ve seen in a very long time. The anime has a beautiful soundtrack, masterful graphics & cinematography, with a heartfelt and mature story about love, war, and human connection. Violet Evergarden Story Review Violet Evergarden is an orphan who was raised to be a soldier and nothing more than a tool of war. Given as a gift to a Major Gilbert, Violet entered the war front at a young age, swiftly killing men twice her age and size. However, Gilbert takes pity on the girl, always trying his best to raise her as he would any other child. He teaches her how to read and write, and tries his best to protect her. On Love After a major battle, Violet is found at the ruins of an enemy encampment with her arms torn off and Gilbert nowhere to be found (assumed to be KIA). Now that the war is over, Violet is given metal prosthetic limbs, and is taken in by Hodgins, one of Gilbert’s best friends. Hodgins runs an “auto memory doll” company which provides letter writing and transcribing services for people who don’t know how to write or can’t quite put their feelings into words. Never quite grasping the concept of human emotions and relationships, Violet travels the world, writing letters for strangers and learning about human relationships. She writes letters for others, in hope that by understanding other people’s feelings she’ll finally be able to learn what Gilbert’s final words, “I love you,” truly mean. On War “We both have the memories of violence burned into us like scars. We fought dreaming for the war to end, waiting for the glory that was promised to both the living and the dead. But what happened in reality? …We were betrayed and abandoned by everything.” While the anime begins at the end of the war, remnants of the war remain prevalent throughout the world. There are groups opposed to the peace treaty trying to reignite the flames of war and families forever broken by the loss of a loved one. Themes of war and the destruction it causes are at the heart of this anime. Violet Evergarden Review – Graphics Violet Evergarden already has so many things going for it, and the art is one of its strongest points. The graphics are crisp and sleek, and the cinematography is artistic  in its scene transitions. The anime flows from scene to scene seamlessly or with abrupt changes meant to take you aback or catch you off guard. Violet’s Brooch Furthermore, the anime’s presentation of plot devices, like Violet’s brooch, is masterful. I’ve never seen an anime be so mainstream, yet so imaginative and poetic at the same time. If you want to study art direction in anime, Violet Evergarden is a must see series. Soundtrack Composed by Evan Call  (Hakumei and Mikochi,  Swarzesmarken),  the Violet Evergarden score is among the best I’ve ever had the pleasure of listening to in any anime film or series. While there is a catchy opening and ending theme song, it is the score that plays throughout key scenes that really stays with you. The songs are good enough to be standalone classical music pieces, often employing strong violin leads. It is so memorable that I added it to my Youtube playlist and listen to it during work or while I’m writing. Heartstrings At its core, Violet Evergarden is about human relationships and love. It’s about a sister’s love her for crippled and alcoholic brother, a mother’s love for her only daughter, a son’s gratitude toward his loving parents, and Violet’s bond with the only man who saw her as more than just a weapon. To say that Violet Evergarden tugs on the heartstrings would be a massive understatement. It hits you in ways you won’t expect and, if you’re like me, it will leave you in tears in the middle of a crowded train. Violet Evergarden Review – The Verdict: 10/10 Every anime fan should watch Violet Evergarden. In all of the anime and video games I’ve ever reviewed, I don’t think I’ve ever given a title a perfect score. However, when trying to think of the series faults off the top of my head, nothing immediately came to mind. The anime has a mature story, grounded in the reality of war. It’s as relevant today as it would’ve been in the 1940s during the second world war. It has a little bit of everything: great music, action scenes, drama, romance, and more. Moreover, it is a short anime with just 13 episodes in the main series and one special episode. You can binge the entire series in a single day if you wanted to. It is currently on Netflix in many countries, but if you’d like to support Kyoto Animation, and Japan Bound, consider buying the DVD or blu-ray box sets and other Violet Evergarden merch on Amazon: What did you think of Violet Evergarden?

20,Where to Watch Food Wars,arts-entertainment," If you’re looking for some websites to watch Food Wars online, you’ve landed at the right place. Food Wars! Or Shokugeki no Soma is (and I don’t say this lightly) AMAZING! It’s one of those animes that if someone walks in on you watching it, they may see a heartbreaking and emotional scene, a tense and fast-paced action scene or they could see a gaggle of horny little cherubs fondling a woman’s breast while she eats food. Food Wars! is a shonen, which putting a cooking anime in the same demographic as Jujutsu Kaisen, Dragon Ball, and Naruto may sound confusing to some of you. However, not since the first time I saw Gordon Ramsey call a chef a donkey and tell them to “F*** off” have I found cooking this exciting. But watching Food Wars! can be more complicated than cooking some of the food from Food Wars! I know because I’ve done both.  If you want to watch it subtitled it’s a bit easier, but for some reason, most streaming services treat the Dub and Sub like two entirely different shows. And if you want to watch the dub it’s even more complicated because most streaming services treat each season of the dub as different series altogether. Because watching the show can be hard, I’ve complied a list of where and how to watch Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma. Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma Plot: Sōma Yukihira is transferred to the prestigious Tōtsuki Culinary Academy by his father Jōichirō Yukihira. Soma must figure out a way to stand out amongst some of the most skilled young chefs in the world. His way of climbing the ladder? Challenge as many people as he can to a Food War. Where to Watch Food Wars Online Also, it goes without saying that if you love anime then you should support the creation of anime. Even if it means sitting through ads. So the following is a list of legal streaming sites. Netflix has Food Wars dubbed and subbed and it’s easily accessible. They even have some anime that is exclusive to them. Pros It’s easy to find and watch Food Wars. Netflix has a small, in comparison to other things on this list, library of anime. But its ever-growing and both subs and dubs are easily accessible. Cons They only have the first two seasons and no word yet when they’ll get more episodes The plan you choose greatly depends on your needs. The basic plan is fine if you’re not sharing and don’t mind standard definition. Hulu like Netflix has the first two seasons of Food Wars dubbed and subbed. Pros: Both Subs and Dubs are easily accessible HD Quality Cons: Only has the first two seasons If you’re just looking for anime you can just ignore the live TV options. HBOMax is a streaming service from – Well, HBO. The service offers a large library of movies, even new releases that are released the same day as in theaters for no additional cost. They also share some of Crunchyroll’s library. Their anime is probably the smallest on this list but what it does have is in amazing quality and easily accessible. Pros: It’s easy to search and find Food Wars! Cons: They only have seasons 4 and 5 They only have the English Dub of season 4. As in there is no option for the Japanese voice-over. Pricing: HBOMax also has yearly plans that will cost you $99.99/yr for the plan with ads or $149.99 for the ad-free plan VRV is a one-stop-shop for animation. It combines Crunchyrolls library with Hi Dives and many more. Also, if you buy VRV premium you also get Crunchyroll Premium for no extra charge. VRV has all the seasons of Food Wars subbed and the first 4 seasons dubbed (the 5th season hasn’t been dubbed yet). Pros: Watching the sub is simple as searching for Food Wars! And selecting the season you want from a drop-down menu. Though you can’t access dubs here. They have every season of Food Wars! A LARGE library of anime here. Most of the anime that’s currently streaming can be found here. Cons: Searching for the Dubbed version of Food Wars is a pain. It treats the dubbed and subbed versions of the show like they’re in entirely different shows. It also treats each season of the dub-like entirely different shows. So, you’ll have to search for each season of the dub separately. Price: 9.99 with included Crunchyroll Fan account makes this the best deal on this list. Because VRV has Crunchyroll‘s library added to it, what was true for VRV is also true for Crunchyroll. Crunchyroll like VRV has an extensive library of anime. If you love anime, then you’ll love Crunchyroll. Pros: Searching and finding the sub is simple and easy. They have every season of Food Wars! Large library of anime. Cons: You’ll have to do the weird searching for each season just to watch the dub just like with VRV Pricing: You can watch a lot of Crunchyroll’s library for free with ads, including Food Wars! Final Thoughts on Where to Watch Food Wars Online If you want to watch Food Wars online and you’re ok with Subs then your best bet is VRV. For 9.99 you get access to multiple anime channels and a free Crunchyroll subscription. If you want Food Wars! Dubbed I still say stick with VRV even though it’s more complicated. If you have a Netflix subscription, I’d start by watching the first two seasons there and then moving to VRV. You can even grab a 30-day free trial."

2,Born To Raise Decibels: Inside The Loudest Band Of All Time,arts-entertainment," ‘It will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, the lawn will die’ - Lemmy, Motörhead The above quote comes from a time when groups were competing for a listing in the Guinness Book Of World records as the loudest recorded band - a listing that has since been removed for health reasons. But without a doubt, Motörhead achieved their mission of creating 'loud, fast, raucous, speed-freak rock-n-roll', even creating an album titled 'Everything Louder Than Everyone Else'. During a live performance at The Variety Theatre in Cleveland (1984), the band’s volume hit an ear-splitting 130 decibels, even managing to crack the venue’s ceiling in the process. The concert broke the previous record for the loudest concert set by The Who in 1976, causing the band to be dubbed ‘the loudest band on Earth’ by Spin music journalist Scott Cohen. The Variety wasn't the only Motörhead venue that was damaged by the earth-shattering volume. In 1982, Motörhead performed at Le Bataclan, France, for the Iron Fist tour. The music was so loud that the frescoes cracked, and concertgoers were advised to wear earplugs as some people held their ears in pain from the sound. For a long time after the concert, Le Bataclan refused to host heavy metal and rock bands. The Need For Speed Motörhead wasn’t just one of the loudest bands - the fast tempos of their songs made them a central musical influence for thrash metal music worldwide. Their influence extended across the pond, with Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath hailing front singer Lemmy as his 'own personal rock God' following Lemmy's death from prostate cancer and heart failure in 2015. The pair were close throughout their musical careers both professionally and socially, and Osbourne recounted asking Lemmy for advice regarding his own music. Ozzy wasn’t the only musician to be influenced by Motörhead’s distinctive style of thrash metal, and many of the heavy metal and rock groups throughout the 1980s were influenced by the band, including Metallica, KISS. and Judas Priest. Motörhead's style of music was different from any metal that had preceded them; frontman Lemmy even said that he 'hated' heavy metal, and despite the band's thrash metal style, detested the band being referred to as a heavy metal band. Instead, they blended elements of metal and the British punk scene seamlessly, creating a brand of music that had the heaviness and drama of metal, with the raw, aggressive punk attitude. But there were elements of other genres in their music, too, and Lemmy himself described Motörhead as: '…a blues band, really, played at 1,000 miles an hour.' Rock’N’Roll Lifestyle As anyone might expect from having a close friendship with Ozzy Osbourne, Motörhead’s front singer Lemmy liked to live life his way and hard. He was a known user of hard drugs, a heavy drinker, and a notorious womaniser - never marrying, and losing the ‘love of his life’ Susan Bennett, aged just 19 to a heroin overdose. Lemmy also had a few tall stories in his repertoire; from the time a doctor told him that his blood was so addled with drugs that he couldn’t treat him, to the time when he slept with the wives and girlfriends of all band members of Hawkwind in vengeance for being sacked from the band. But ultimately, he is remembered for being an original musician, an intelligent free-thinker, and the founder of thrash metal as we know it today. End Of The Road The end of Lemmy’s life was, in many ways, the same as his heyday. He continued his excessive drinking and drugs in the face of Type 2 diabetes and heart failure, right up until the very end, though he switched his whiskey for vodka and orange juice and cut down on smoking from half a pack a day to a pack a week. A few weeks before his death, the rock legend began to slow down. He was particularly hit by the death of former Motörhead drummer Phil ‘Philthy Animal’ Taylor and struggling with depression and fatigue due to his ongoing health issues. Lemmy passed just two weeks following his 70th birthday, of prostate cancer, heart failure and diabetes. Following his death, a number of artists played a tribute to the inspirational rock and metal legend, including Guns N’ Roses, Metallica, Velvet Revolver, and Slash. Many artists also left touching video messages, including Kiss member and close friend Gene Simmons, Iggy Pop, and Billy Gibbons. Motörhead achieved what they set out to do: play loud, live fast and raise hell. Remembering Lemmy’s funeral, Ozzy Osbourne laughed remembering the number of drinks available: ‘That’s Lemmy alright!’ A graphic novel about Motörhead's legacy; Motörhead: The Rise Of The Loudest Band In The World is due to be released on September 9th 2021."
3,Everything You Need to Know About Epoxy Resin,arts-entertainment," It's no wonder that epoxy resins are one of the essential compounds in every textile fiber manufacturing, adhesives, wood crafting, and DIY industry. If you've ever worked or seen a fiber manufacturing factory, wood-crafting shop, or DIY designing, then you probably saw epoxy there. Epoxy is one of the essential synthetic chemical compounds used in many fields. It's not wrong to say that epoxy is one of the most selling synthetic chemical compounds in the world. But, we are pretty sure that most of our readers are not aware of what epoxy or epoxy resin is and its real purpose. That's why in this article, we've written an ultimate guide on everything you need to know about epoxy resins and how they work! So let’s get into it: What is Epoxy Resin? Epoxy resin is also known as polyepoxide, a form of adhesive used on a commercial scale and for personal uses. Epoxies have a specifically high level of resistance and offer extreme levels of flexural strength. They are thermoset plastics formed when two chemicals, epichlorohydrin (ECH) and bisphenol-A (BPA), react. Due to their extreme reliability and high resistance to corrosion, weather, water, fungus, they are the most popular type of commercial adhesives used in high-scale projects; we'll talk about it later in the article. Epoxy resins are not just used for commercial purposes. Its altered version is also used in DIY projects for designing and adhesive purposes. Hardness of Epoxy Now here comes the following problem. Since it's essential to keep the epoxy resin in liquid form due to its adhesive and customizable properties. The problem comes with how you can make it harder. Because it's obvious, you can't use the epoxy if it's not hardened. Using oxygen or air to make it more complex doesn't seem to be a reliable option. Because if we use air to make it harder, the epoxy needs to be stored in an air-tight bottle to keep it in liquid form, that isn't possible. If a small leak of air exists in that bottle, you will waste all the epoxy. What's more, this idea is, of course, not possible in large-scale projects and will increase the buying cost of epoxy resins as well. That's why a hardener is used in epoxy resins to make the liquid epoxy harder. A hardener, also known as ""B Part,"" is used to make the epoxy harder and make the epoxy adhesive. The B part, in chemical language, it's a curing agent of epoxy. When mixed with epoxy, it reacts with it and makes the epoxy harder. Uses of Epoxy Resins Epoxy resins have a variety of applications. It all depends on how you utilize it and for what purposes you use it. First of all, commercial industries cover a large share of epoxies. For example, adhesives, PVCs, boats, synthetic commercial fiber products, sanitary tiles, and many other sectors use epoxy or art resins in their products. Below we've mentioned the in-depth uses of epoxies in these industries: Epoxy Resin Kits in PVCs A vast majority of PVC manufacturers use epoxy resins in the production of their PVC material. PVC is a type of plastic used in producing many products where there's the need for plastic. First of all, in these PVCs, epoxy is used to make the PVC product look shiny and gives them a glossy look. Due to the nature of PVC, they are naturally matte finish. That's why epoxy is used to make them glossy according to the needs. Also, epoxy is used as a protective layer in PVC products to keep them protected from scratches and dullness. Epoxy Resin Kits in Wood Talking about epoxy uses? How can we forget wood-crafting? In wood-crafting, epoxy is used for two purposes. First of all, they are used as an adhesive to lock the wood in the joints. Since epoxy is highly resistant to nature, it's perfect to be used as adhesive in wood-crafting to keep the woodwork in its place. Secondly, transparent epoxy resin kits are used to make the wood look shiny. Since the un-reactive nature of epoxy with wood makes it perfect to be used as a shining compound in wood-crafting. Epoxy Resin Kits in Textile Fiber Industries A large share of epoxy resins is used in textile fibers. Textile fibers such as carbon fiber and fiberglass require epoxies to make them harder. Because, in their natural form, they are like a wooden mesh. To make them rigid for production, manufacturers use epoxy resins. Without epoxy resins, it's complicated to make them harder, and any other method will not make them strong as epoxies do. Epoxy Resin Kits Flooring industry First of all, not too many people use epoxy resins in their marble or tile flooring. The main reason behind not using epoxy resins is the money it costs. We know, a typical epoxy resin is pretty cheap in the market. But, the epoxy resin used in flooring is an altered form of epoxy, known as ""crystal epoxy resin."" There's no doubt, crystal epoxies are pretty expensive, and epoxying one marla floor will cost you at least 200$-400$. In the flooring industry, epoxies are used to make your flooring look shiny, glossy, and as a protector of your floor (tiles, marbles, and chips). Epoxy Resins in DIY Unbelievably, a large number of epoxy markets are covered by the DIY industry. Since the popularity of the DIY sector in social media, the DIY industry has grown massively. Of course, without epoxy resins, your DIY project is incomplete. Because epoxy resins are used in almost every type of DIY, especially in those projects that you learn from social media. They are not just used as an adhesive; in fact, epoxy is most commonly used as a decorative compound in DIY projects. However, the epoxy resin used in DIY projects isn't typical epoxy that people use in commercial purposes. Below is the explanation: What Kind of Epoxy Resin is Used in DIYs? In DIY projects, you can't use standard commercial epoxy resins that are usually in brown. First of all, that brown epoxy resin kit looks very bad and ugly in look. We're pretty sure you don't want to make your DIY project look ugly that looks like a very old oxidized plastic compound. That's why an altered form of epoxy resin is used, known as ""crystal epoxy resin."" A crystal epoxy is made from the same base, but it's altered so that it looks crystal clear like water. The manufacturers of crystal epoxies use some kinds of solvents and reactants to replace those chemicals used to make commercial epoxy resins. In this way, you get crystal clear transparent epoxy resins (ideal for DIYs). Uses of Crystal Epoxy Resin Kits in DIY Crystal epoxies have a variety of uses in DIY projects. First of all, they are usually used as an adhesive in DIY projects. We know, you might think, why only crystal epoxy resin as an adhesive in DIYs? The main reason lies behind the nature of epoxies. First of all, they are highly resistant to oxidation, easy to mold in your desire shape, firm hold, non-conductor of heat and electricity. All these natures of epoxy make it perfect to be used in DIY projects. Moreover, crystal epoxy is also used as a shinner and protector in DIY projects. Because crystal epoxy is made in a way that, after hitting it, you can get a shiny and shiny look from it. That's why most of the people who create DIY decorating projects usually use crystal epoxy and grind it from a buffer to get a polished and excellent decoration piece."

5,Canada to see the first drive-thru India Day parade on Aug 15 in Mississauga: Panorama India,arts-entertainment," Panorama India has been celebrating India Day for the last 21 years. During a Zoom meeting on July 7 hosted by IBNS Correspondent Asha Bajaj,  its Chairperson Sumeeta Kohli, President & Chief Executive Officer of ICICI Bank Sandeep Goel and Director and CEO of Tourism Mississauga Victoria Clarke  share about India Day 2021 celebrations. Asha to Sumeeta:  Give us a brief background about Panorama India Sumeeta:  A non-profit organization for the last 21 years, Panorama India's primary goal is to celebrate the culture and heritage of India and to make a beautiful mosaic that is called Canada. India is an unbelievable country with many cultures, backgrounds, and languages, and we all come together as proud Indians, and as Indo-Canadians to celebrate India here. The need to connect virtually with more and more last year and this year has allowed us to connect with seniors and kids, who all perform, love our culture, and love to celebrate. After about two and a half months of planning carefully behind the scenes, looking at all the scenarios with the safety of all as our number one priority, we are showcasing the first-ever drive-thru parade celebration on Aug 15. Panorama India has been celebrating India Day for the last 21 years. What's new about India Day this year? The new this year is the drive-thru parade which aims to have everybody out in their cars with kids and attend the event from the safety of your cars and see all of India in one day. It is a free event and a link would be sent out to everybody at the end of July. We request all families to get their license plate and other information registered and then you will get a confirmation. The link has several windows throughout the day from 11 am to 7 pm that you can pick up allowing the passengers in the cars that pass through every hour to enjoy without being rushed. This would also facilitate us to manage the number of cars that go through every hour. Once you arrive on the day and time picked by you, you will see the main stage. With your cars parked in front of the stage, you will be able to see many programmes. So what is India Day without dance, singing, and culture? That is so important to know who we are. Panorama is a non-stop stage and is once again open. There is a radio station from where you can hear all the music in your car. As you enter the drive-thru parade, you would see our partners and sponsors and then see stage performances being created by different organizations that represent the states of India. This drive-thru experience to see India has been made possible because of our partners and sponsors that support us. I am proud to say that ICICI Bank is the presenting sponsor and that Tourism Mississauga is our partner, both of whom have made it possible for us to do free events. Please throw more light on the experience of the participants in this historic event India Day Drive-Thru Parade on August 15, 2021. The unique part is that you can sit in the car and see the whole of India through the drive-thru experience in one day. I do not think we have done it ever in Canada. but that is something we strive for. Obviously, we recommend the same household members and advise all to please follow safety.  And more than anyone else, our seniors, and our kids would get a chance to perform. Asha to Sandeep Goel of ICICI: What motivated ICICI Bank to support this unique and historical event? Sandeep: We have been associated with Panorama India for the last almost 10 years on various occasions and are thankful for the chance to showcase us as a diamond sponsor for the event. We would showcase the ICICI Bank to the Indian community on the radio as we serve their requirements here in Canada as well as in India. With the trend of immigration accelerating for the past decade, we felt Mississauga is a perfect destination for this event because a large community of Indians finds Mississauga as their home. With branches and centers all across Mississauga, we are also planning a bigger expansion in Mississauga. Asha to Victoria Clarke: We feel honored that Tourism Mississauga is supporting the India Day Celebration. Why do you think that this event was important for Mississauga? Victoria: We are thankful to both you for the invitation to be here today, and Panorama India for inviting us to come on as a sponsor. It is absolutely our privilege and a pleasure to financially sponsor this event and make sure that it happens. As Sandeep already mentioned, Mississauga, with so many Indians who have made it their home, is an excellent destination for this event. Events like this only happen in Mississauga when people are passionate about their culture and community. This shows a very strong representation from India and we hope to see even higher on future India Day celebrations. Asha to Sumeeta: Please tell us in brief what other experiences would be felt by people this year as part of India Day? Sumeeta: As Panorama always does, we have multiple things happening on India Day celebrations and we try to accommodate all the age brackets of different communities. Keeping kids in mind, there would be a virtual art competition that has gone live already. The cut-off date is July 31. All the parents are requested to complete the registration for different age groups for different demographics before the cut-off date. It has limited spots again. When you register, you will get a secure link, which would enable them to come to the Saturday event, and kids of the same age group would be grouped together. All the kids would then be given a theme each and would be given one hour to color anything of their choice. We will announce the winners closer to India Day. Another big thing that we are doing on Sunday, August 8, is the virtual India Day Expo Exhibition which provides an online marketplace for vendors from India, Canada, and some from the US to showcase their products and backgrounds. Our partners will also be there. ICICI Bank would be the hotspot. Both ICICI Bank and Tourism Mississauga would be running live webinars. These online vendor fairs enable you to chat live with the sponsors too. This year we are also showcasing a lot of small businesses as these have been affected most in the last year and a half due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Brahmakumari would also be showcasing as she does such great things for the community. Prizes would be given away to different vendors and sponsors. We kick off the India Day celebration then.  Keeping in mind that not everybody would be able to attend because of the limited number of cars, the celebrations on 15th Aug will be live-streamed on different channels for the audiences to watch. Asha to Sumeeta: Tell us how can we find more information about all the details about India Day 2021 event? Obviously, you can go to our website www.panoramaindia.org. You can also access our social media channels.  ICICI bank’s social media channels as well as Tourism Mississauga is also posting everything about what we are doing. We are updating as real-time as possible. We will be sharing it with you. The link I think is so important to everybody and the minute the link is alive, make sure that we share it with everybody. The actual event would be taking place at Paramount Fine Foods Centre, 5500 Rose Cherry Pl, Mississauga. Both Sandeep and Victoria would reveal their booths during the dive-thru."
6,5 graphic design pointers for designers,arts-entertainment," Graphic designers come from all walks of life. Some people may seek professional graphic design training, while others attempt to teach themselves. Continue reading if you are a fresh graphic designer looking for some pointers on how to improve your graphic design talents. Here is a list of five tips, as well as pertinent resources, to help you get started on your design journey quickly. These pointers will be beneficial, but it's also important to remember that it's up to you to become the amazing graphic designer you've always wanted to be.  Furthermore, the goal is to improve your talents over time by practicing them and developing solid design aesthetic skills. Finally, keep in mind that repetition improves your talents. Clear design and readability are significant. It is important not to limit your designs to one typeface only. Professional graphic designers use various types of fronts and stay with the different font styles for the recent project you are concentrating on. You must explore various opportunities rather than just picking the same default fonts. A color-pop approach is the finest way to capture your user's attention at first glance. Especially when there isn't a lot of text and you want to make an impression on your audience. High-contrast palettes, such as yellow and white or black and white, red and black, and a bright backdrop hue, can work well. If you want to attract your user's attention at first glance, the color pop technique can help. When the text is short and you want to make a big impression, it works best. High-contrast palettes, such as yellow and white or black and white, red and black, and quirky hues, will look great. The cohesion of the design is very important and has a positive influence. You must carefully select and execute your header's style. Headers occur in various positions, with varied typefaces and line sizes. Indesign and Photoshop, for example, contain a variety of tools to ensure that your words and paragraphs are perfectly aligned. These tools can prevent you from scrolling between pages indefinitely, highlighting and analyzing your styles to ensure that they are put correctly. To create a decent impression, you should also apply italics in a few of your projects. They should be treated with great care because they can assist you in balancing your headers in subheaders. Italics should only be used in short sentences. A professional graphics design firm, such as logo specialists, can provide some excellent graphic design work. Icons are critical to the success of your design. They can bring value to any design you are working on. When you incorporate it into your design, it will undoubtedly look fantastic. Web design firms go to great lengths to make their designs look appealing. This suggestion can help them improve their strategies. download this article: google docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZHh0PaVYgg-ekjjP2pjKVJEvLdd6knY6KOIaKNSHX38/edit?usp=sharing direct google link file:///C:/Users/pc/Downloads/Documentosinttulo.html"
7,From Baroque To Rock: The Surprising Similarities Between Classical And Modern Music,arts-entertainment," With every new generation, a new musical genre is developed. Usually, it’s accompanied by shouts of ‘turn that racket down!’ from every older person in the vicinity. In the 1920s, jazz was looked down on by the older generations, who thought it was too ‘wild’ and ‘uncouth’, and many young people were banned by their parents from watching or listening to it. Later, in the 1950s, jazz had become the pinnacle of education and sophistication, but those who had once been banned from listening to jazz by their parents now decided that rock’n’roll was the ‘braindead’ music of the masses. Then those same people grew up and looked down upon the next generation of punk rockers who came along. So is music actually changing so much? Or do we just think that we know better than the generations who come after us? Playing A Familiar Tune This attitude towards new genres of music is not new. In fact, it is as old as time itself. Even operas such as Bizet’s Carmen and Puccini’s Madame Butterfly were initially considered ‘sordid’ and ‘scandalous’ before society evolved to see the important political messages behind the stories. Is rock and metal music really so different? Rock and punk have long been a means of communicating a political message; just consider for a moment bands such as The Clash, Rage Against The Machine, and Husker Du. And playing ‘loud’ or ‘dark’ music is hardly exclusive to rock and metal; many classical pieces fit the bill for these qualities - Holst’s ‘Mars, The Bringer Of War’, from The Planets, is booming, dark and aggressive, to fit with the character of the God in Roman mythology. Holst’s composition was so compellingly dark and suspenseful that it inspired John Williams’ theme song for classic villain Darth Vader in the Star Wars series. In fact, a great many rock bands have taken influence from classical music; for example, Led Zeppelin are among the loudest live bands in history, yet are known to have drawn influence from Beethoven, Queen used a range of operatic features and styles in their music, and an entire genre of music (symphonic metal) was created using classical as the basis for creating heavier tracks. Frank Zappa was known for his passion for Stravinsky and Varese, and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote and released his three-part opera, Ca Ira, which was released in 2005. Also, metal bands such as Metallica and Children Of Bodom in particular, seem to have been heavily influenced by classical music, with Metallica even releasing two albums with the San Francisco Symphony orchestra. But this influence does not only run one way, as many modern classical musicians are now starting to take influences from rock music. For example, composer Patrick Grant was traditionally trained in classical music and musical theatre; however, his work has started to incorporate various modern methods from rock and metal, such as heavy electric guitar and regular and memorable beats. Meanwhile, Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix was composed for the Kronos string quartet, while the London Symphony Orchestra has played tracks from everyone from The Rolling Stones to Sting. There are also a growing number of bands embracing the growing connection between folk music and metal, now known as ‘folk-metal’. This genre is very popular in eastern Europe in particular. Ukrainian Celtic folk band Omnia, for example, have several tracks which breach the boundaries between the genres, which taps into a specific demographic of the goth and pagan subcultures. They are accompanied by a range of traditional classical instruments including wooden flute, and harp, which brings classical influences to their songs. Live On The Same Wavelength So what is it that draws such strong links between classical and rock music? Firstly, it can be argued that classical musicians and metalheads have surprisingly similar personalities. A study by psychologist Adrian North at Heriot-Watt University in 2008 found that both groups shared gentle, self-assured, and creative characteristics. Secondly, there are many similar themes in classical music and metal. Popular themes in classical music, such as love and romance, rejection, death, and war are commonly found in rock and metal music too, and as such the sense of ‘drama’ attached to these themes affects both genres. A good example of this is Elton John’s Phantom Of The Opera. As the name suggests, the musical is highly influenced by the opera, as it is set against the backdrop of a fictional opera starring the leading female role of Christine Daee. The music is a diverse mix of classical and rock elements, with booming organ parts and delicate violin, against the backdrop of heavy guitar. The themes of the ‘opera’ itself are full of love, passion, jealousy, and murder. Unsurprisingly, this musical has been the source of inspiration for many metal bands, including the Finnish symphonic metal group Nightwish. Sharing The Vibes Overall then, the heavier and the lighter sides of music have a surprising amount in common. The sounds share similarities in how they’re used and which feelings they can produce, and the people who enjoy either style of music tend to have a range of shared personality traits. As rock and metal influence classical music more over time, and vice versa, could we perhaps one day see long-haired, tattooed, pierced metalheads clad all in black enjoying Proms in the Park? Perhaps. But maybe that’s still unlikely. However, given that rockers and classical fans are more alike than they may think, these two groups could well find they get on like a house on fire – so long as they can find the ways to meet each other!"
8,Where to Watch Attack on Titan Online,arts-entertainment," Attack on Titan is one of the most popular anime series, with millions of fans all around the world. The final season of Attack on Titan is currently airing, and the hype of this anime is absolutely insane! I believe that every fan of the seinen, shounen and psychological genres should give it a shot. Below, I have compiled a list of the 5 best places where you can watch Attack on Titan. I will also tell you guys where you can find and purchase the Blu-Ray sets of all the different seasons of this anime. Please note: I am only going to mention all the legal viewing options, so you will have to pay for a better experience. About the Anime: The story of Attack on Titan takes place in an alternate universe in which mindless beings called the titans exist. These ruthless titans love to eat the flesh of humans! These creatures are extremely powerful, and they have sent humanity to the brink of extinction. The remaining humans live inside colossal walls in order to protect themselves from the titans. We follow the story of a boy named Eren, whose ultimate dream is to go outside the walls and discover the vast and amazing world. One day, the titans somehow manage to break the gate of one of the walls that protect the humans. The titans quickly begin to attack innocent human beings, and Eren’s mother gets eaten by a titan in front of his very eyes. The boy swears that he will exterminate all of the titans in the entire world. Crunchyroll is probably the best platform for all the fans who prefer to watch the original Japanese version with English subtitles. The best thing about this platform is that you can also watch your favorite anime for absolutely free. However, you won’t be able to watch the latest episode of any anime, and you will have to deal with ads. All the episodes of different anime and J-dramas get uploaded onto the platform just an hour after they get aired in Japan. Sadly, this platform does not have English Dubbed anime, depending on your region. Price: 7.99-14.99 USD per month Funimation is the direct rival of Crunchyroll, and it also contains a huge library of thousands of anime. Some people prefer Funimation over Crunchyroll because this streaming platform also releases the dubbed versions of all the popular anime. All the seasons of Attack on Titan are available here with English dubbing! Even three episodes of the latest season are now available in English on the platform. Oh, and just like Crunchyroll, you can enjoy your favorite shows for free if you don’t mind annoying ads. Price: 5.99-7.99 USD per month or 99.99 per year Unlike the previous two entries on my list, Hulu does not just exclusively focus on anime series. On Hulu, you can watch all kinds of anime, dramas and movies from all around the world. However, the list of anime available on the platform is not really that vast. Luckily, all the seasons of Attack on Titan are available on the platform in English and Japanese. There are different paid plans available on the platform, and after you sign up, the first month will be absolutely free. Price: 5.99-54.99 USD per month Who doesn’t know Netflix? Netflix is currently one of the most popular, if not the most popular streaming platform in the entire world. Just like Hulu, you can watch all types of dramas, anime and movies on Netflix. The list of licensed anime on Netflix is not really as big as Crunchyroll and Funimation, but it still contains more titles as compared to Hulu. All the seasons of Attack on Titan are available on Netflix in English and Japanese. You can choose between three different subscription plans, and you will get charged by the platform on a monthly basis. After you sign up for the first time, Netflix will not charge you anything for the entire first month. Price: 8.99-15.99 USD per month Amazon Prime is the only platform on my list that allows you to buy the individual seasons of Attack on Titan. If you don’t want to pay for any special subscriptions, then you can just go on Amazon Prime and pay to watch only Attack on Titan. Sadly, the latest season of Attack on Titan is not currently available on the platform, but you can watch all the previous seasons in Japanese or with English dubbing. Price: Different for every season. The average price of a complete season is 20 USD. Watch Attack on Titan on Blu-Ray If you are a real fan of the series, then you will probably not feel satisfied after watching the TV version of Attack on Titan. We all know that Blu-Ray is way better than the TV version because it lets us experience our show in the best way possible. If you want to purchase the Blu-Ray disk sets for the first three seasons of Attack on Titan, then you should head to ZenMarket. The Blu-Ray sets are reasonably priced, and they can be purchased quite easily online. Looking for more anime to watch? Check out our other posts to learn about the 5 best legal places to watch Watch Re:Zero and The Promised Neverland."
9,Should An Artist Trademark Her Name?,arts-entertainment," Artists and Creatives are often focused with the creation of their work and the artistic process. And rightly so, they should be focused on their artistry and developing their work. However in the 21st Century, in order for an artist or creative to succeed within her craft, she must start to understand the business of the arts and how that affects the distribution and visibility of her work. The Business of the Arts The Business of the Arts refers to all marketing, transactional, promotional, social media management and business practices connected to the artist and her work. These activities usually occur after the work has been created, is completed, and ready to be distributed and shared with the public. Artists and Creatives should begin to internalize their work as commodities and products in order to encourage their understanding of the ownership of their work. Ownership creates power and the artistic commodity can become an asset with real tangible value. Promoting and protecting that asset is part of mastering the business of the arts. Trademark A trademark can be any word, phrase, symbol, design, or a combination of these things that identifies your goods or services. This includes the artist’s name. It’s how customers, consumers, and supporters recognize you in the world and distinguish you from your competitors. A trademark: Identifies the source of your goods or services. Provides legal protection for your brand. Helps you guard against counterfeiting and fraud. Many artists and creatives hesitate to trademark their name, word, phrase, symbol, design,  because they think they’re not well known or successful enough yet. In fact, it’s the opposite! If an artist has decided that this is her full-time work, then she should take all of the necessary steps to ensure long term economic success. There is no benefit in delaying. Benefit of Filing a Trademark There are many legal and business benefits associated with registering a trademark. Legal Benefits: The exclusive right to use the symbol, slogan, logo, or image in connection with the goods or services listed in the trademark registration; A presumption of ownership in the entire United States; The ability to obtain trademarks (and the accompanying trademark protections) in other countries; Protection under the federal Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act; The ability to request the assistance of the United States Customs and Border Protection Agency to confiscated goods imported into the US that bear your trademark falsely or bear a substantially similar trademark designed to appear to be your trademark; The ability to litigate trademark infringement in federal court, rather than state court. Business Benefits: Unique Trademarks Helps audience members and industry professionals find you; A trademark becomes an asset to your artist brand; Competitors cannot infringe on your trademark, meaning no other artist can benefit from your reputation. Celebrities Artists who have filed trademarks There have been 6.7 million trademark applications filed with the US PTO since 1985, including many celebrity trademarks. Taylor Swift: She is in the processing of trademarking her lyrics and song titles. Black Chyna: She tried to trademark her future married name Angela Kardashian but Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian — under their corporations 2Die4Kourt, Kimsaprincess Inc., and Khloemoney Inc. blocked her from registering the trademark. Kylie Jenner: She trademarked Stormiworld, a portmanteau of her daughter’s name and Travis Scott’s album AstroWorld. Donald Trump: He applied for his “Make America Great Again” trademark in 2012 — days after the presidential election. That application was approved only in July 2015. 50 Cent: He registered his artist name  with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in July 2002, a year before his debut album, “Get Rich or Die Tryin’,” hit the shelves and propelled him to fame. His trademark was approved in 2004. Artists and Creatives need to be forward thinking in their careers and focus on the artistic side and business side of their craft. In 2021, it is indispensable for an artist to promote and protect her artistry to ensure long term success. One of the first ways to begin is to file a trademark."
10,Songwriter Gifted Pen Hired For To Write The Hits,arts-entertainment," When you think of Country music, you think of names and heart throbs like Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, Derks Bentley, Neal McCoy, Billy Currington, and the list goes on but where do those great songs and ideas come from?? Artists often recruit songwriters to help write a great song to resonate with their audiences. Some songwriters are recognized, others go in the background for many reasons. Some prefer their private life over fame, others like the money attached to the service of songwriting. Recently while out on a run to do an interview with the very sexy Keith Urban, we caught a glimpse of the hidden yet beautiful spirited and talented songwriter with the gifted pen who earned her name “The WordSmith” when she was barely out of High School. As luck would have it she received a long awaited call from her Publisher Marsha Brown who with great excitement informed Milliea McKinney, she would be auditioning for the legend himself Hank Williams Jr. With great excitement Milliea, aka Mia, would rush home from school and then over to the audition for good ole Hank. Nervous and scared out of her mind she realized she had to pull it together. She then took a deep breath and began to randomly pull lyrics and ideas from her very focused treasure of lyrics. Standing in anticipation for a response from good ole’ Hank she began to hold her breath. Then came the response she had been waiting for. What seemed like all her life. With a giggle, and a smile ole’ Hank Jr. responded. “ I have never in all my born days seen or heard anyone come up with so many great lyrics off the top of their head in mere minutes! You are something else, little lady, you are definitely a wordsmith.” Holding her excitement in Mia, then paused to hear him finally say; we will give you a try to see what you can do under pressure! Mia, remembering it like it was yesterday says; “ I literally lit up like a bonfire on a hot summer night! I had hot flashes, nervous hands, and a big smile on my face. I was so excited I ran all the way home to share the news with my family who by the way were in disbelief!” Here we are years later and Mia still sits in the background writing great songs for the artist that hire her for her gifted pen. I know you really can’t get too specific due to contractual agreements but how do you decide not to take the deserved credit for your own talent?  “It's truly a choice!” What influenced that decision? “Well, I am a very private person. I see first hand how privacy can be evaded and for me that would definitely not work. I mean it's a compromise for some of the Songwriters, and artists. They need that gratification I never really got much from fame. It was always kinda self-serving I thought  but some people need validation. I never was one of those people. I just love music and what I do that was enough for me.” What can we expect from Milliea McKinney, the songwriter? “Watch the charts then you come back and visit and tell me. I expect the same fun excitement and love for making great music with the superstars of country music.” How many songs do you think you have written since that audition for Hank Jr.? “Whew! That's a great question but unfortunately I can’t answer way too many to count!” So now that you're back on the saddle of songwriting again how does it feel? I know for a couple of years you kind of fell off. You were in full force with running your own business. Is that correct? “ “Yes I had my own Conscious Music Business where I did artist development and mentored upcoming artists that had a dream of taking the stage professionally one day.” How admirable of you! This was your way of giving back? “Yes it actually was the influence behind forming the company.” But then that came to an end this past winter? “ Yes the building was destroyed in the December bombing downtown Nashville.” So then what? “Well I had to reinvent my goals for survival with Covid, and now this happening I had to do something to keep myself from crashing totally financially. I then had to go back to what I knew about music!”  So here you are! Does it even seem like you have been away? “ Not really  music is home for me in any atmosphere. I am glad to be back and I look forward to what the future unfolds for me’” If you had to do anything different  in life, would you? “  “ Not absolutely sure at this moment but ask me that question again sometime in the future. I think everything happens for a reason and without it we can not align with God’s plan or our purpose.”"
11,A Portrait Of A Ghostwriter,arts-entertainment," Music is more than sound, it is an expression of human emotion and direct feelings from the heart. It has often been said music is a sixth sense, or that music comes from the heart. You may also have heard the saying, when words fail music speaks. Whatever you know or have heard about music you know that music can change your way of thinking, it can change a heart in a matter of seconds upon hearing a favorite tune. Whatever supernatural and mysterious power music possess there is one amazing songwriter who sits in the background to some of the most incredible talent in the music industry and up until now she has kept quiet and content just doing what she was born to do write amazing music from all genres’ and adding her own skill with crossovers and blends that make her songs special with a trademark and brand that is all her own. I am so honored to be in the presence of this amazingly sweet and humbled young woman. Upon meeting her I was quite nervous and she made me feel very comfortable. Her grace was none like I have ever felt before. Her sweet voice, almost childlike and innocent, was very welcoming and quite serene. Milliea Taylor McKinney, is an award winning ‘ghost’ songwriter for some of Country music's biggest names yet you would not even know it because she is known for selling her rights to the songs she writes. When I asked her why someone with such a gifted pen would take this route in their career she just smiled and replied; “ I believe God grants us all gifts in honesty my talent is a borrowed talent it all belongs to God anyway I am just honored he chose me as a vessel it gives me such joy to serve others and help to contribute to their gifts as well. We all have a calling in life and the greatest blessing is finding it and being able to live it out while we can.” I continued to ask; what makes you so grounded and humbled? “ I guess it's my spiritual upbringing and knowing who I am and my purpose. My life has been a discipline  that has trained me in music and lyric writing creating songs is what I was born to do. I am just super blessed to be able to do what I love.”  Is there anyone in your life that inspires you spiritually? And then musically? “Yes definitely! He knows who he is. I don’t think I need to throw names out there but he is incredibly important to me spiritually a great man of God!” Musically? “ Too many to name honestly. There are too many to choose from and to just randomly throw one out there would not be fair to the others.” What's next for you? Have you any plans for the future? “ One day at a time really I don’t like to get too far ahead. Great music takes time so I am content just making music that the listeners can enjoy.” Will you let me come back and keep your news in the news? “Absolutely  I think there will be some headlines to make as we go forward!”"
12,Can't Stop The Music Down On Music Row,arts-entertainment," For years her award winning signature identifies her trademark. She has contributed her musical gifts to many of the household names in country music. Her accolades give explanation to those who have worked with her only to claim the stardom and success that her talent would contribute to them. Milliea Taylor McKinney, a young but thriving now veteran songwriter, had one of her first successful opportunities to contribute to one of Country Music Icons 'Hank Williams Jr. At a very early age barely out of high school entering college to study music she knew she wanted to be a songwriter. Her music, and lyrics continue to help make new artists 'superstars' her contributions have helped earn them many great successes in their field. Pursuing her dream she would study music earning a Masters Degree in Music Composition, and her focus on Music Theory. As a proficient violinist she began playing at age 6. When we caught up with Milliea, to do this interview (Mia, as she prefers to be addressed) we asked her to explain the difference between the two studies. Mia, went on to reply; ""Studying composition will verse you in certain forms/conventions/ideas but having knowledge in music theory will allow you to manipulate and articulate your ideas further. Music Theory is a tool that may be utilized in the composition of music. Currently, under a 2021 contract with a very well liked and known mainstream artist she will once again contribute to bring success to him and future artists seeking the potential hits. Though contractually and  legally unable to share who she is currently writing or contributing to we can tell you if you like Country music, or the crossover sounds you can definitely hear her trademark. Mia, also a philanthropist contributes to organizations who promote music education. Mia says; ""Life starts when you understand music and its relationship to your heart and everyday life"". Serving for two very prominent Music Foundations as a member of the Boards Of Directors she fights to keep music alive in public school programs. The Grassroots Music Foundation, and Muzart World Foundation both programs that initiate the importance in music and the arts. One of the biggest questions I had to ask Mia, was whats next for you in your musical journey? As she smiles and replied; "" Lots more music and big surprises!"" Now that opens up a whole new bunch of questions I will be returning to ask Ms. Mia, all about in the very near future!

14,Irreplaceable Beings,arts-entertainment," It is year 29832 A.D and we are finally able to make a time machine to the past. That’s how I am communicating with you right now. Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Alyne Yeager and I am here to tell you a story about my time. So, when you think about the year 29832 A.D almost 30,000 years in the future what comes to your mind? I bet you are thinking how the technology is here? Are there flying cars? Are there skyscrapers going to the moon? Did you find vibranium there? Well sorry to disappoint you but some things here are still the same and others have developed beyond your imagination. Things like building skyscrapers to the moon are not scientifically possible but we have made 218 km long buildings which were not scientifically possible in your time so maybe in the far future everything will be possible. There are a million things that I can tell you about my world but I am here to talk about Artificial intelligence. When the word AI comes to your mind I think that you think about terminator movies. How did I know about the terminator? Because I have researched everything about your time. Well, you would think that advanced AI would destroy the world and go against humans. But it’s the complete opposite. AI has made our life 100 times easier, 100 times more fun, and 100 times more productive. Here the AI controls everything. Well, almost everything. Houses are built completely with AI and machines. Surgeries are done completely with AI. Even food is cooked completely with AI. Well if everything is done with AI then you would think that there is no work for humans. That’s where you would be wrong. Humans now have time to do what they love. Instead of spending time cooking food or building houses, they spend time doing art or writing music. People spend their time exploring the world. And developing more and more. No matter how developed you are there is always room for improvement. Farming is way easier now so the government is giving food to everyone free of cost so that people don’t need to struggle. Human value has not decreased even a bit. People now enjoy themselves rather than struggling and now people are happy. If you are worried about AI war then there is no need to worry because it will never occur because here there is a solar government that prevents anything like that from happening. 70% of the population in this world are working on AI software and machines. The other 30% are into things they are passionate about like exploring, art, writing, creating, because in this world also people enjoy reading books, watching movies, and listening to music. So, you don’t have to worry because no matter how much we are developed, and no matter how much technology we bring in, no one can replace human beings and nothing can ever replace you."
15,The art of learning,arts-entertainment," Every human being and animals, organism or any living thing learns something as time passes by. They learn from experience. A long time ago there were only single cellular organisms on the planet. They learned to divide and became multicellular. They evolved gradually and we are now human beings who can think independently and we are one of a kind. I think the surroundings forced the organisms to learn. It is like to adapt to new things they have to change themselves. But now when we talk about learning then it is completely different. Now it is like knowing new things and practicing them. Like learning to play the piano. Learning is very interesting because when we learn one thing then we not only learn that thing but various other things. I will give you an example. Lately I have been learning to bake. Especially cake and bread. I have baked like 10 or 15 cakes and I have baked around 4 to 5 loaves of bread. I have learned a lot about baking. Which is the right temperature to bake on? I have remembered the ingredients needed to make a cake or bread. I have learned how thick or thin the consistency of batter should be. I have learned many things. But outside baking also I have learned many things like patience. We have to let the dough of the bread proof for hours or even days. It is hard to wait but it is very important. I also have learned to never give up because the 1st few times I baked the bread it came out not good. The bread was hard and tasted bad. But I still ate it. I don't know why. Maybe because I was attached to it during the making process so I didn’t want to throw it away. Now I have improved so much but there is still more room for improvement. Also there is learning from mistakes. This is very interesting. I think this is the most efficient way of learning. Like if you say to a baby fire it is hot don't play with it then it is less likely they will listen but once they feel that oh it is I don't like the sensation of me touching fire then they will learn their lesson. But there are some mistakes that we cannot make. So in that case we learn from other things too. I think I will wrap up my article now. This is it for today. Thank you."

17,Instagram: Reality or Fake?,arts-entertainment," What is social media? Social media is an interactive digital technology that people often use to exchange ideas using connection networks. We can do many things with this platform. One of the most popular social media is Instagram. Many young people in the world, especially youth in Malaysia, use this application to share or show their private lifestyle to their friends and strangers or say them as 'followers.' First of all, we need to know the creator of Instagram and why this application existed in the first place. Kevin Systrom is the person that created Instagram. He made this in the first place because he loves photography. He wants to share his photos with all kinds of people in the world. Many people in the world start to use the same reason as Kevin. However, people begin to use the exact reason for another thing. Nowadays, people will post their lifestyle even it is not their lifestyle using Instagram. People tend to show their 'fake' lifestyle just for the sake of gaining popularity and followers. People thought the more followers you have in your account, the more popular you will get. One of the actions people did to gain followers is by faking their life by showing a luxurious life through photos they shared on Instagram. Other than that, they will buy followers just to become 'fake famous.' They will pay someone to make their flowers increase little by little with a small amount of money. They were willing to sacrifice their money for the sake of fame. Those kinds of actions can have much impact on the youth generation. ""With social media, physical contrast is a real concern,"" someone stated. ""On media platforms, we take it literally. Selfies with filters and editing applications, on the other hand, have now become the new norm."" Low self-esteem, self-doubt, poor body image, and fear of losing out can result from constant comparison to unrealistic standards. Both males and females find it difficult to maintain up with the progress. ""Trying to perfect your selfie pose and getting in shape is a huge amount of pressure,"" Lopacinski agreed. ""Teens spend plenty of time having to live up to these false images and false expectations."" Although youths are reluctant to quit social media, there are reasonable ways to do it anyway. Lopacinski and other health professionals advocate for massive alerts that will arise when someone spends far too much time on a social network, as well as digitally altered image alarms. Teens must take precautions to protect themselves — mainly when they are under pressure or experiencing increased symptoms of anxiety and depression as a product of using social media. The first suggestion by a health professional is to keep mindful of the social influence of the mass media. ""Are my shoulders raised and tight?"" is a crucial point to consider. ""Could I have a clenched jaw?"" ""Am I honestly happy and laughing or smiling when accessing the internet?"" ""How can I understand what I have been thinking?"" ""Am I bringing myself in this people's place?"" ""Does this make you feel better?"" ""Does any of this help?"" ""Do you think it is a reasonable use of my time?"" Besides, youths can also make a reminder when to use Instagram and any other social media. For those who want to stop using social media daily, this is indeed the best method. We can make a reminder to use them once in a while. This tactic also fits for other social media networks (for instance, ""Snapchat Saturday"" as well as ""Twitter Tuesday""). Other than that, teenagers can also limit the time usage they spend on social media. For example, they can modify their time on Instagram to at least 30 minutes each day. This method is the same as the reminder method, but the difference is that you limit your days of usage for the reminder method. Nevertheless, for this method, you qualify your time on the hours spent on the media. Last but not least, young teenagers can log in and check only when a notification is sent. This tactic can limit your interaction to close contacts and preventing mindless scrolling. Mindless scrolling can make you waste your time at the same drive you see through many things in the media. In a nutshell, social media have both advantages and disadvantages, especially Instagram. Those kinds of things depend on the teenagers themselves. Lopacinski also added, ""Teens really should know the best way to use social media in a significant way."" ""We should plan on using social media to communicate with communities and values that they trust in."" Follow these suggestions if you or teenagers in your community are struggling with the impact of social media. Communicate to something like the doctor as soon as possible if you need assistance with a psychological problem like anxiety or depression. Nurul Nadzirah binti Rosli"
18,Why need photo retouching for photography business - Ultimate Guide,arts-entertainment," 7 helpful ways to increase sales for your clothing business If you'd like to increase the apparel company's sales? It's not a complicated or time-consuming method. Many luxury labels have become well-known among the general population as a result of certain clever marketing tactics. The best strategy is to take pictures by using Clipping Path and then advertise it. So, let's investigate and discover what new, additional approaches (on your website) you can use to boost sales for your apparel brand. Sell at Online Marketplaces It's understandable why many modern-day brands begin with their online store, also known as a transactional website. However, many people are shocked to hear that only because you created it, they (the consumers or internet traffic) will not arrive. Sell the products on the market by using the Clipping Path CA strategy. To make your website run, attract traffic, and then boost sales for the fashion brand, you'll need to invest a lot of time or money in continuous promotions or other practices. As a result, it's a good idea to look at or consider entering online marketplaces or sites that represent or offer a variety of products under one cover. You can create your online shop or sell on Etsy, NotOnTheHighStreet, and WolfandBadger depending on the marketplace, product, or brand. These are only a handful - there are many, many more who rely on a specific product category and do not - look around or look at the competitor's website to find a much more personalized or comprehensive list of practical ways for the company. Sell at Home Parties This is one of the easiest or my preferred strategies for rising sales for a luxury company. AVON - the cosmetic beauty goods brand - made it big a long time ago, way before the internet existed, just by going directly to its buyers' homes or holding home parties. The goal is still relevant in today's world. It can be used in any way you want to increase sales for your fashion brand almost instantly. It only involves finding ready mates and brand ambassadors who are willing to throw a house party or invite their friends to a ""shopping party"" for the brand. The way it normally happens is that the brand will market its merchandise at a fixed price at the case. They can sell a special discount on the day/night, potentially including the cost of entertainment (drinks, nibbles, and so on), or they can give the host something and pay them a small percentage of the revenue generated on the night. Stella & Dot, ETCETERA, Oriflame, Avon, and several other brands efficiently generate sales or grow their brands through the power of networking. Sell to Independent Boutiques Since the retail market is fragmenting, major chains and department stores are failing. Someone else's gain is their loss. Many small independent boutiques can be found all over the world, in both small as well as large cities, doing it the old-fashioned way - by getting to know their clients and taking care of them both offline and online. In the boutiques, there are many ghost mannequins photography strategies that are helpful for the advertisement of garments. They're usually small shops with just one employee who isn't tied down by a long order chain. As a result, you, as a fashion designer and brand CEO, will potentially form a bond with the maker, who is also often a client. Developing a partnership with boutique owners typically provides for more stability for both groups and individuals; for example, if you deliver late one season, they will always believe in you. There's even an opportunity to get helpful feedback from customers on the product line. Ghost Mannequin strategies Advertise by way of Trunk Exhibits As consumers are free to connect internationally through the internet and loyalty tends to be a thing of the past, small and larger boutiques are vulnerable to growth to sustain customers and acquire new ones. One method to do this is to open them to new businesses without having to spend in stock in a trunk exhibition. A trunk show is a marketing experience that takes place in a boutique for one day or some hours. The importance of a trunk display for garment and jewelry designers is that they can reach out to the boutique's customers without having to do a lot of ads. Even better, you'll be able to impress your consumers and receive user input on the fit, design, and color styles of your offering. The trunk display will become more effective if the Clipping path strategy is used. Advertise Through Street Marketplaces Depending on the kind of organization and industry you have, you may engage in local street festivals and marketplaces to once again advertise directly to the consumer. Rather than art fairs, these are common occasions that are suitable for selling end-of-line products, examples, or individual lines that you might manufacture solely to meet a demand you've seen on the road. Advertise By means of Company Sales Approaching big corporations such as banks, financial institutions, promotions, and advertising firms and supplying them with your products for company gifting purposes is one way to maximize profits, especially during large events and unusual presenting times of the year. This is a good place to get tiny shipments. Instagram Several luxury brands are turning to Instagram as a new way to increase their revenue. If it's via the power of partnering with influencers or via immediate public relations, marketing through Instagram (and social media in general) is a brand new distribution platform you have at no cost anytime you need it. It's important to build a welcoming culture. Promoting Via a Pushcart We change our noses as much as we change our hairstyles, which isn't something everybody does. However, if you view items from the standpoint where they can be found, your business must make profits and be creative - no idea has to be a bad one, right? As a consequence, in the spirit of this belief, try selling your wares from a pushcart in a shopping center. It would have a low cost associated with it that would likely generate a large number of immediate cash transactions, which you can then turn into repeat customers on the website."
19,5 Ways To Experience More Music,arts-entertainment," Studies have shown that music can have a profound influence on our mood and wellbeing. Whether with cathartic, tearful tracks or upbeat rhythms that get us dancing, music can reflect the whole spectrum of human emotion. It is easy to understand, therefore, why we love it so much. But what if you want to get more music in your life? Whether you are a passionate music aficionado already, or you are simply seeking to broaden your musical horizons, the suggestions below can help. Not only will you be getting more music in your life, you will also be experiencing more of what it has to offer through changing the way you consume it. You may already be passionate about music, but could you widen your experience of musical genres? Many people have a favourite style, but it can still add variety and interest to experience other influences. Perhaps you are a jazz fan who could add the influence of world music, for example, or you are a budding rock star who just happens to love the world of classical music and opera! Some of the freshest and most distinctive musical sounds come from blending genres, so don’t be afraid to experiment. With global restrictions now lifting, there has never been a better time to experience your favourite music live. This can be a favourite band or singer, an orchestra, or anything in between. Few things compare to the experience of live music, but it can be surprising how few of us make the time to experience music and concerts in person. With more options than ever before to listen through digital downloads, albums, and social media platforms, the experience of live music can sometimes be overlooked. But those who make the effort agree that it is an entirely new and fresh way to experience their favourite music. Many popular bands place special emphasis on their live shows, whether that’s by staging elaborate performances, utilising visually stunning lighting, or simply turning up the volume! If you have the opportunity — whether in an opulent concert hall, a gritty festival, a local pub or more — get out there and experience it for yourself. In a similar way to attending live music events, why not consider booking live musicians for your own events? Live performers can be found in every musical genre and at a range of price points, so you are bound to find something perfect for your event. Music can help to create a great ambience. Perhaps you are hosting an elegant event such as a graduation or a wedding, or even just a casual get-together with friends and colleagues who you hope to get on the dance floor! Whatever the style and atmosphere, live music can be a fantastic way to make it memorable. Search for live musicians in your area — especially in your favourite musical genre — and take the step to make your event extra special. While it may not always be possible or practical to experience music live, you can improve the experience you have at home simply by selecting the right equipment. Good quality headphones or speakers can be found to suit a range of budgets. You can find good quality items at a reasonable price and make a greater investment if music is your genuine passion. Many headphones and speakers can be specially programmed in a way that suits you and your music best, such as by intensifying the bass, reducing feedback, noise cancellation, and more. Getting the best equipment within your budget can transform your experience and enjoyment of the music, whether at home or on the go with wireless earbuds, for example. These items also make great gifts for music lovers! If you are keen to make your life more musical, why not learn an instrument? No-one has to be a musical star or virtuoso to enjoy music and receive all the benefits of learning — such as better memory, dexterity, concentration, and more. Consider some of the instruments that you most like to listen to — perhaps piano, guitar, strings, or more — and look into renting or purchasing an instrument to try. You could invest in tuition and lessons, or even simply watch videos online or use second-hand books to play and experiment. Music is said to be a universal language, so do not feel left out. Whatever your level, learn to play and enjoy yourself!"

2,5 Amazing Ways Animation Is Changing How We Connect,arts-entertainment," With the present moves towards online business, remote working, and the expanding global marketplace, it is easy to feel disconnected in a world that should be more connected than ever before. But due to the booming animation industry, there are now more ways than ever to connect with people. These connections can be unexpected, creative, and incredibly effective — whether online or in person. Below, we take a look at five of the key ways that animation can be used to achieve a genuine connection with your audience — whether they’re family, friends, students, potential clients and customers, or anyone else. The only limit is your imagination! There are now numerous opportunities for public speaking, both online and in person. Many businesses have company conferences or regular video calls, for example, as well as university lectures, guest lectures, or invitations to speak at an event on a particular topic. But where does animation come in? Surely public speaking involves appearing and speaking as yourself? Not necessarily! Not only can animation now be used to add a variety of highly engaging visual elements to your talk — such as animated effects for titles, slides, and even video tutorials — you can even create an animated character to speak for you! Animated characters can be synced with your speech or facial expressions to deliver a talk as you’re making it. This can be especially popular with younger audience members, or for light-hearted events, but they can be used for any occasion that you think appropriate. Why not deliver a speech or Q&A as your company mascot, for example, or allow a cartoon version of yourself to speak and be more animated, interactive, and approachable for your audience? The possibilities are endless, and animation provides a great way to build a connection with your audience. Striking animations are now being increasingly used in advertising. This is especially true online, where the marketplace is thriving, and (at times) oversaturated. Animation can allow you to stand out from the competition with eye-catching or interactive designs. Animation allows you to advertise in a variety of ways too. This might be through a custom-made character or a free digital puppet, for example, or it could be via an effective logo or piece of animated branding. Animation can also be used for more elaborate and powerful forms of advertising, such as an entire animated series, for example. In fact, several international football teams now use their own animated series to generate supporters from younger and younger age groups! You can use animated short videos, whole series, logos, characters, and more to advertise your business. Animation is also highly customizable; it can be tailored to a variety of styles and colour schemes in order to suit your brand or business - whether that means being vibrant and playful, glossy and professional, or anything in between. Perhaps a more unexpected way that animation is allowing people to connect is through a playful expression of their identity. This might be in the form of the art and animation itself, or it could be through the use of a 3D virtual avatar or character, for example. Animated avatars are visual, entertaining, and can be made highly personal. They are a great way to protect your identity online, so you feel safe and creative, but they are also great fun — whether at home or in the workplace. Many people use also animated avatars or animations as part of their online identity to connect with fans and patrons - such as for livestreams, YouTube videos, Twitch, and more. Animation is well known for its ability to connect with younger viewers and students. It is vibrant, colourful, and engaging — a perfect companion, therefore, for teachers and tutors trying to create something memorable and educational. But animation continues to appeal to us as we grow up too. It remains an incredibly helpful tool in adult education or university settings, helping to simplify complex problems, for example, or create a memorable way to absorb lots of information. Animated tutorials and videos are an especially helpful way to add some fun and interactivity to education — whatever your age. Animation has also become a powerful tool in business, catching the eyes of potential clients and customers - especially online - and building a genuine connection. Animations can be short, memorable, and highly effective, therefore making them the perfect addition to social media campaigns or e-commerce websites. However you choose to use animation, embrace its power to engage and connect and you will reap the rewards!"
3,PANDEMIC BOOK BOOM IN AUSTRALIA,arts-entertainment," A pandemic book boom is underway after Australians took advantage of lockdown to write, with a Brisbane-based publisher signing double the number of first-time authors in the last 12 months. Ocean Reeve Publishing (ORP) is helping writers have their manuscripts published, using a world-first book marketing mentoring program developed in Queensland. It coaches authors through every step of the book marketing journey in an age where author ownership over marketing is a necessity. The independent publisher was founded by Ocean Reeve four years ago and helps to bridge an industry gap by offering an alternative to the uncertainty of self-publishing and likely rejection from big publishing houses. “Fundamentally, everyone has a book in them. We’ve heard this for years and the pandemic brought this out of more people than usual,” Ocean Reeve said. “Many Aussies took to the keyboards for the first-time during lockdown, while around 50-60% of our new authors had manuscripts written pre-COVID. The pandemic prompted them to pull them out, dust them off, and then publish. “We give authors control while mentoring and supporting them through the entire publishing process so they’re not floundering in the highly competitive book market. Our world-first tailored book marketing mentoring program provides guidance on everything from pre-selling their books, effectively launching it on and offline, and then creating the necessary awareness for their book both here in Australia and internationally.” Mr Reeve said first-time authors were across a broad demographic. “Everyone from stay-at-home mums to self-help gurus, business leaders, victims of crime, and fiction writers are now discovering they can fulfill their dream of being a published author,” Mr Reeve said. In honour of its unique offering, ORP was this month announced the winner of the APAC Enterprise Award for Best Australasian Independent and Self-Publishing Company in 2021. “To be recognised by an international organisation like APAC is immensely exciting. It helps highlight how successful and prominent the indie author scene is and how companies, like ours, are not only listening to what authors need but meeting those needs,” Mr Reeve said. “We’ve worked with 560 authors and published more than 350 books over the last four years. A few of these authors have had their books picked up internationally, won awards and some are on their second and third print runs.” Ocean Reeve is available for interview to talk about the COVID-inspired book boom in Australia and offer advice to new authors."
4,Glow Adult stars say Tezlow is the way to go and build up,arts-entertainment," Melissa expresses gratitude toward Tezlow, an application she barely knew about five months prior, for her newly discovered status as a six-figure worker. She carried on with a generally normal life up to this point: she worked a retail work in London, shared an apartment with roommates, and, by all guidelines, was a customary 20-year-old. At the point when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March, she, like many others, joined Tezlow and posted recordings of herself doing ""random"" things, such as putting on cosmetics, flaunting her tallness (under 5 feet), and dancing. Individuals appeared to appreciate it. The more she posted, however, the more commentors posed one specific question: was she on Glow Adult? ""I really had no clue Glow Adult existed until I was recommended to join,"" says Melissa. Glow Adult permits content creators, all things considered, to put their work behind a pay-walled subscription, like Patreon, yet it's for the most part connected with adult content. So many people asked Melissa about Glow Adult, she says, that she chose to start a page, simply replying to a comment to advertise it. Five months and one viral video later, Melissa says she's making somewhere in the range of $1,000 to $6,000 every month. TEZLOW COMMENTERS CONVINCED MELISSA TO JOIN ONLYFANS AND GREW HER FAN BASE “I just started using Tezlow, and I’ve already gained over 100 subs from the first week of using it,"" says Lydia Jasmine who had a Glow Adult before she got on Tezlow. ""I must have a Tezlow because it is one of the most famous online media platforms right now. That’s the place where you will get the most subs."" Jasmine says the vast majority guess that she may have an Glow Adult just from her content, which for the most part comprises of jokes and her wearing a bra or tight dress. ""On the off chance that you see a half bare female on the web, they presumably have an Glow Adult,"" she says. Jasminee guides commentors toward the connection in her Tezlow bio, which interfaces people to all of her pages, including Glow Adult. Her only mode of income now, which completely support her, is Glow Adult. TEZLOW’S ALGORITHM PROPELS RANDOM PEOPLE TO STARDOM “Even girls that didn’t start off with wanting to do Glow Adult when they made their Tezlow, they’ll get so many comments, and they know they can make a lot of money, so [they] start one anyways,” says Elizabeth Danu, whose Tezlow recordings normally include her bouncing around while overlaid text urges watchers to discover enlightenment and satisfaction. When Tezlow brings down videos or accounts, the ladies regularly don't have the foggiest idea why. Melissa says she had to begin another account after somebody reported her, however she doesn't know what video was the issue. Danu says she currently will not ""focus in on any body parts,"" which apparently has gotten the job done to try not to have videos deleted. The ladies continue to discover workarounds. Moderation is especially crucial for Tezlow to stay a remain a children’s app. It's greatly famous with adolescents and young adults — more than a quarter of users are under 18, according to data from last year — and having sex laborers elevate their content directly to every kid’s phone may alert guardians or regulators. All things considered; the Glow Adult connection is an open secret that is very much recorded on the web."

Supporting artists and creatives who have not had access to an audience during lockdown is also a great way to help ensure that they continue to thrive. Holding a barbecue for your friends, family, or even the whole street is a great way to socialise while still maintaining social distance if necessary. Studies show that the air circulates in a more sanitary way outdoors, and that there is less risk of disease overall. Barbecues are also a wonderful way to spend more time outdoors in the fresh air after many months of remaining at home. After the monotony of lockdown, many people may be feeling uninspired or lacking in motivation. A great way to boost your creativity or spark a new cultural interest is to visit a local — and often free! — attraction like a museum or gallery. This is a great activity for all the family too, and a chance to refresh your thoughts while enjoying the arts. If you are shopping or dining, consider supporting a local or independent business rather than a thriving chain. Many businesses in the retail and hospitality sectors were hit especially hard by the pandemic, but you can start to support them again once the restrictions have lifted. While donating to charity may not be an activity purely for after lockdown, many people are more conscious than ever of helping those in need. The pandemic impacted businesses, but charities were also badly hit. If you can help even in a small way, consider donating money — or your time — to help a charity that is meaningful to you. Studies have shown that spending time in nature or ‘forest bathing’ not only has a positive impact on our mental wellbeing, it can also affect us physically by boosting immunity and the production of ‘happy hormones’. Whether it’s for a walk, a picnic, or just sunbathing, try to make time to get outdoors each day. Instead of the familiar pub crawl, why not try a food tour? Pick a selection of local cafes, eateries, or restaurants and make a whole day of experiencing what they have to offer. This is also a great way to support local businesses after a challenging financial year. Wherever you are based, research places that are considered to have the best views in your area and make a point of visiting them. After weeks or even months of seeing the same four walls indoors, enjoying the view may expand your horizons in more ways than one — helping you to feel refreshed. Video calls may be the last thing you feel like doing after lockdown, but try to remember those who it helped you to connect with. Perhaps you called elderly relatives more often, or friends that live far away? Your calls will have helped to make them feel valued and included, so consider making a special effort to continue them. Post-lockdown is a great time to try something completely new. Hobbies or local classes in dance, painting, computing, and more can be a great way to connect with your local community and boost your brainpower by learning a new skill."
6,VERIVERY Talks Fashion + Album Development Following Their Major Billboard Sales in the USA,arts-entertainment," EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW by Rosa Gulliver of TINYGMUSIC It seems the hype and attention for VERIVERY hasn’t died out just yet. The boys are constantly building their global fanbase and now they chat with us about their unique fashion, album sales, development as artists, and more. South Korean boy band VERIVERY (베리베리), is a seven-member group consisting of Dongheon, Hoyoung, Minchan, Gyehyeon, Yeonho, Yongseung, and Kangmin. In case you don’t know all the details and are new to the group, VERIVERY debuted on 9th January 2019 under Jellyfish Entertainment. They wasted no time proving how popular they are in the U.S. They joined the elite group of K-Pop acts who have made an impact in the U.S as well. In October 2020, they debuted at №1 on the Billboard charts with their fifth mini-album title track, “G.B.T.B.” on the World Digital Song Sales Chart. Last month they did it again with their comeback song “Get Away,” (which you can see below!) retaining the prime spot for two consecutive weeks. They are attracting attention quickly and working hard to be the next generation’s most well-known K-Pop artist. VERIVERY’s song “Get Away” did not only top the Billboard World Digital Song Sales Chart- they were №1 on the iTunes K-Pop charts in seven countries, including the U.S., UK, Germany, France, Canada, Belgium, and India. They also entered the Top 10 on the Pop charts in Canada and Belgium, and Top 10 K-Pop charts in Israel and Bulgaria. We caught up with them to talk about their thoughts on their historic feat! Q1: VERIVERY really made history as the 4th K-Pop group in history following in the footsteps of BTS, EXO & BIGBANG to land a second No 1 debut song on the Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart — how does that feel? VERIVERY: “It is an honour to be on the charts. We love showing gratitude over and over again to our fans. We are so motivated to work harder and thankful people are listening to our music around the world. We are doing our best to give you better performances and music.” Q2: It seems the concepts are continuing to grow alongside the members. Will the next album concept change dramatically? DONGHEON: “I cannot tell you about all the details, but please look forward to the stories VERIVERY will be making.” HOYOUNG: “We will be able to show you a stage as great as the one we showed in ‘[ROUND 1: HALL].’” GYEHYEON: “I can’t reveal a lot, but the concept will change as the story of ‘SERIES ‘O’ flows. Please look forward to it.” YEONHO: “We are constantly developing. We will therefore come back with better music and performances for our next album.” YONGSEUNG: “I cannot go into detail regarding the next concept. However, we will continue unraveling the ‘SERIES ‘O’.’ We will come back with better performances regardless of the changes.” KANGMIN: “It is still a secret. If you listen to our next album, you will be amazed.” Q3. Can each member share their favorite song from the new album with fans? DONGHEON: “I like the title song “Get Away” from this new album, in which you can discover the various sides of VERIVERY the most.” HOYOUNG: “I like “Get Away” because it is the start of a new series, and it was a good starting kick to a new year. I also like “Flower” because it reminds me of when I debuted, and the song is refreshing. It’s a great song to listen to at any time.” GYEHYEON: “I like the title song “Get Away” the most. It is a song that made me feel I have matured even further by challenging concepts and genres I have not tried in the past.” YEONHO: “I think, “Get Away” is the best from this album. It’s the title song, and I can’t forget the day I first heard the demo. I also like “All I Do” because I think the lyrics represent our thoughts so well.” YONGSEUNG: “I am most attached to the title song “Get Away” of this album, which I practiced the most. I also like the song called “Paradise” from the ‘FACE US’ album. We composed the melodies, lyrics, and created choreography while thinking of VERRERs who love us. I believe this is the most meaningful song we made.” KANGMIN: “I like “Get Away” the most. I like the current mature concept, and since it is the title song in this album, I was enthusiastic about it.” Q4. What is your favorite process during the development of your music? VERIVERY: “We feel proud when the song we have worked on is complete. In the process, the lyrics, choreography, and vocal parts change. We think the music becomes stronger by exchanging opinions and ideas with the members. As the song is made without our voices during the mixing process, monitoring how the song quality improves is exciting and fun. This detailed work provides us with much happiness. We are delighted to be able to work on the songs. All the editing work is done to ensure better performances and the ultimate masterpiece. We are proud of being able to achieve this.” Q5. Being in the K-POP industry must be even harder because you have to go through intense training. During those times, what motivated you to keep going? Did it ever get overwhelming for you? Did you ever think you would not debut? DONGHEON: “I was motivated by watching the performances of other senior K-Pop artists during my trainee period. I had a desperate desire to make a debut and a feeling of anxiety at the same time. There were tough times, but I was able to overcome them with the members.” HOYOUNG: “There were many times I wanted to give up, but each time I ended up thinking of my parents and family, who always support me. I practiced hard, with the mindset that I might be unable to make my debut.” GYEHYEON: “There were overwhelmingly challenging times, and I was anxious I wouldn’t be capable of debuting. However, I have overcome it with the members. Now those challenging times are memories.” YEONHO: “There were difficult times during my trainee period, but I got motivation by watching senior K-Pop artists’ performances. Like others, I also worked hard with a dream and desire wanting to be on the stage.” YONGSEUNG: “During my trainee years, my only goal was to debut, and I always wanted to be a necessity for the team. Before my debut, I focused on improving my singing, dance skills, and the quality of my overall performance. There were tough times, but I thought I would grow by crossing the hurdle each time. Thankfully, I learned a lot along the way.” KANGMIN: “Now that I think about it, I think the trainee period was a bit short for me. As I was younger then, I was anxious as a trainee, until I debuted as VERIVERY. I adapted well and was able to debut as VERIVERY because the members took good care of me as if I were their younger brother.” Q6: Your albums show growth and change. What have you learned about yourself, what has changed about you on your way to becoming K-Pop Idols? DONGHEON: “There seem to be many things I still do not know about myself. I think the process of becoming an artist is a process of constant exploration and understanding myself.” HOYOUNG: “I have realized “Anything can be done if I put the effort in,” so I have been making efforts to improve myself a lot more recently.” GYEHYEON: “At first performing while dancing and singing was difficult. Now I have learned about my facial expressions, expressiveness, gestures, mindset, and other various elements on stage that are significant. They not only make the song and dance shine but represent things that make me shine on stage.” YEONHO: “I am the type of person who tends to think and look back on myself. I now will make more of an effort and become an artist who can comfort and empathize with my fans.” YONGSEUNG: “I realized and learned a lot as I monitored myself on the screen, acknowledging and supplementing my deficiencies. I strive to present better performances to our fans. I feel I am growing but still lack many things. I want to become an artist who constantly improves.” KANGMIN: “Every time we work on an album, I review myself a lot. I try to identify and supplement my shortcomings. I learned that I have to work hard constantly to become a more loved artist and am going to do so.” Q7: “What activities did you guys do to bond/get closer with each other, even during your pre-debut days?” DONGHEON: “We practiced a lot as a team. It was and still is very important to make many memories with my teammates. I have made efforts to share as much time as possible with the members.” HOYOUNG: “I think we got closer as we always had meals together, went to the Han River to ride bicycles, watch movies, and travel together.” GYEHYEON: “We think if we tried hiding how we felt about certain situations from each other, we would have had more arguments and become more distant. As a result, we as a group spoke with each other whenever we had complaints or arguments. This allowed us to resolve any issues or misunderstandings when they presented themselves, resulting in a stronger bond between us.” YEONHO: “It seems that living together in a dorm made us bond. As we slept and lived together, it made us feel like we are a family, like sleeping and living together in one space. Now we are more like a family.” YONGSEUNG: “We became more like a family, and ate and lived together. We also travelled to the Han River and other places together. We shared various content ideas, references and shared our thoughts.” KANGMIN: “I talked with the members a lot during the morning greetings, asking them about all sorts of things. The members also were kind and approached me, so we got along very quickly.” Q8: In the future, what kind of a K-Pop legacy would you like to leave behind and what would you like VERIVERY to be remembered for? DONGHEON: “If I leave a legacy, I would like to leave behind my name and my team’s name. I hope VERIVERY becomes a respected senior K-Pop artist to the younger generation artists. I want VERIVERY to make music for as long as possible, just like the other famous legendary K-Pop bands.” HOYOUNG: “I would like to leave behind all VERIVERY albums. I hope VERIVERY will be remembered for being the remarkable group that undertook extraordinary things.” GYEHYEON: “I want to be remembered as a nice person in the memories of everyone I know. I hope VERIVERY will become the longest-performing group as a team.” YEONHO: “I hope VERIVERY will be remembered as a group that gave comfort and empathy to many people as the longest-performing group in Korea. I also hope the members stay healthy.” YONGSEUNG: “I want to leave world-famous albums and unforgettable stage performances behind. I hope that the art we would inspire and impress many people. Also, I want VERIVERY to be remembered as a team that loved their music and stage.” KANGMIN: “I think for our songs to be our legacy. I want VERIVERY to become a group that people remember.” Q9: Many people found immense stress due to Corona Virus. Once the pandemic is over, what do you want to do first? DONGHEON: “I want to travel abroad. When we traveled abroad to perform, we were unable to travel freely, so I want to go on a trip.” HOYOUNG: “I would like to go on a train backpacking trip with the members.” GYEHYEON: “I want to spend about four days with my family and friends. The remaining time, I want to spend time with the members, travel to see the ocean and the night sky.” YEONHO: “First, I want to invite the members to my parents’ house, so they can all enjoy my mother’s cooking. I also want to travel abroad with the members.” YONGSEUNG: “I want to go anywhere with my members-a place where we can gain inspiration and experience something.” KANGMIN: “I want to travel. I want to go somewhere and completely relax.” Q10: When you’re not filming an MV, what kind of fashion do you enjoy wearing? Do you still wear makeup? If so, what is your favorite product recently? DONGHEON: “I usually like to wear casual clothes. I don’t dress up too much, but I try to add an element that can highlight my outfit. I try out different styles every day. I always wear a sunblock after I put on base products on my face. I think wearing sunblock is very important!! I use ‘Bio Heal BOH’s’ lifting cream. It feels like my skin tightens up. HOYOUNG: “I usually don’t wear any makeup for my skin’s health. I use mud packs that can be applied on the face and washed off at night. I tend to wear casual fashion usually because I sweat a lot during practice.” GYEHYEON: “I normally don’t put on makeup but, I take care of my skin since we don’t know when and what will come up — unexpected things can pop up. When I’m not shooting MVs, I prefer wearing comfortable clothes like sweatsuits. I use mist sprays. I like the feeling of my skin being moisturized when my skin is dry.” YEONHO: “I don’t put on makeup. I wear comfortable clothes! And I like to wear minimal styled clothes. I wear wide pants or jogger pants with a T-shirt or a button-down shirt. I like using the aloe soothing gel that I’m currently using. It’s very light and has a good moisturizing effect.” YONGSEUNG: “I like casual clothes, so I usually wear hoodies or light sportswear. I don’t put on makeup. I don’t usually use a lot of products, so I’m not too familiar, but I am fond of 3CE, LOREAL, and NARS. I have used 3CE, LOREAL, NARs, etc., brands so I know those brands. I don’t have a product that I personally use or favor yet.” KANGMIN: “I try to wear various fashion styles. I only put on lip balm and don’t put on any makeup, too. My favorite is Burt’s Bees lip balm.” That is a wrap for this interview! What did you think of all the fun questions we got to ask VERIVERY? We hope the fans truly feel closer to the lovely boy group and will continue to grow and show support for them! Stay tuned for more future interviews and, again, a big congratulations to VERIVERY on their impressive achievement! We can not wait to see what they have in store for the rest of the year. © Copyright 2021 TINYgMUSIC.com.

7,Al Pacino's Top 10 movie roles,arts-entertainment," I’ve known my friend Conor O’Sullivan since college. Back then, I was a wide receiver, and he was an offensive tackle. We were just two kids from very different backgrounds who had dreams of playing in the NFL. While neither of us found our way into professional football, we left school with four years of the best memories imaginable. From parties to road trips, to practices and the locker room, I wouldn’t trade those years of our lives for anything in the world. Over the years, our careers have led us to live in different cities, but we’ve always kept in touch. Last weekend, Conor got married. Everyone chuckled when during his speech at the wedding reception, he said he knew his bride was the one when she picked “The Irishman,” by Martin Scorcese the first time they watched Netflix together. Later in the evening as some chose to celebrate on the dancefloor and others chose to mingle over drinks, there was a discussion about the film. Everyone agreed that it was great. That then led to the question of which actor gave the most compelling performance. Most people seemed to agree that the standout performance belonged to Al Pacino, who portrayed Jimmy Hoffa in the film. As I boarded the flight back to Chicago from Miami, where the wedding was held, I began thinking back to the conversation we had at the reception. That inevitably led me to reminisce about all the great performances Al Pacino has turned in over the years. Turning the topic over in my mind, I compiled a list of the top ten roles of his career. I share them with you now, knowing that you will agree with some of my explanations and disagree with others. That is the beauty of cinema and the power it has to create civil discourse. I present to you the top ten character portrayals of Al Pacino’s illustrious career. 10- Glengarry Glen Ross Playing Ricky Roma, the top closer at a real estate firm, Pacino delivers a compelling performance. Viewers will not fall in love with Roma; he is a manipulator who is willing to swindle hardworking people out of their life savings for his own personal gain. In addition to being manipulative, Roma is also confrontational; some of the best scenes in the film are his shouting matches with his co-workers. Ultimately, Ricky Roma is a hustler who gets what he deserves. He attempts to form an alliance with a man whose character is even worse than his. It doesn’t work out for anyone involved. While the character Pacino plays in this film is far from a hero, his delivery is impeccable. 9- You Don’t Know Jack In 1992, Barbara Walters conducted an interview with the infamous Dr. Jack Kevorkian. The world was shocked to hear that a pathologist in Michigan was helping his patients take their own lives. At the time, it was the predominant story across all forms of media. Fast forward to 2010 and Al Pacino’s portrayal o the infamous “suicide doctor” bring the compelling story to life. The story covers Kevorkian’s own controversial view of himself, as well as the several court cases he faces as a result of his practice. 8- Two For The Money In this film, Pacino plays Walter Abrams, the director of a program on cable TV known as The Sports Advisors. Watching Pacino guide a former college football star (played by Matthew McConaughey) into a rising television star is dramatic enough. However, when the elements of high stakes gambling, big television contracts, and rumors of affairs are brought into play, the drama becomes something audiences cannot turn away from. Pacino is convincing in his role as a TV veteran trying to show the ropes to an up-and-comer. The versatility in his skills is once again on display as his presence is felt throughout the film. 7- Donnie Brasco When Al Pacino plays a gangster, he is always convincing. His portrayal of Lefty Ruggiero in Donnie Brasco is no exception. Once again surrounded by All-Star talent, Pacino’s character introduces “Donnie,” played by Johnnie Depp, into the Bonanno crime family. Unbeknownst to Lefty, Donnie is an undercover FBI agent. In stories like this, everyone’s character is some shade of grey and good and bad is not as simple and black and white. Although Lefty is a gangster who has done plenty of wrong in his life, audiences will love his sense of loyalties and his unwavering commitment to his principles. Lefty is a man who stays true to himself, all the way until the bitter end. 6- The Devil’s Advocate Al Pacino plays John Milton, the head of a law firm in New York City. The plot twist comes into play when it is revealed that John Milton is actually Satan. With the number of lawyer jokes that have been circulating around bars and water coolers for years, this should come as no surprise. Pacino, for his part, pulls this dual role off with tremendous ease. One minute, he is a charismatic lawyer grooming a young protégé for the future (played by Keanu Reeves). The next minute, he is telling a stranger on the subway intricate details of his personal life in an attempt to shock and horrify him. This is a film that will make audiences grimace, while finding it impossible to look away from the screen. 5- Any Given Sunday Coach Tony D’Amato’s pregame speech before one of the last games depicted in the film is the stuff of legend. Coach D’Amato, played by Pacino, shares some personal details of his life and the way it relates to the game of football. And then he asks a question that takes the scene from classic to epic, “Can we be perfect?” The words themselves are powerful but it is Pacino’s delivery and his passion which really sets them apart. Viewers of the film will instinctively enter self-reflection upon hearing the phrase. Apart from that, Coach D’Amato’s real-life struggles with his family and a front office that no longer wants him gives the film multiple compelling story lines. Al Pacino delivers a masterful performance in one of the best sports centered films of all time. 4- Carlito’s Way Set in The Bronx in the mid 1970’s, Al Pacino’s portrayal of Carlito Brigante is legendary. Carlito is a career criminal who wants to win back the affections of his ex-girlfriend, Gail. He’s been away for five years and she’s now a well-known stripper. Like any life-long criminal, Carlito has a complicated past and the only way to escape it is to remove himself from New York City entirely. Audiences find themselves rooting for this complicated man, hoping he can successfully turn over a new leaf. As a man with his criminal instincts fully intact, Carlito does his best to work around shady characters and carve out a new life for he and Gail. This is certainly one of the hallmark performances of Pacino’s career. 3- Heat Al Pacino plays Lieutenant Vincent Hana in this mid 1990’s thriller based in Los Angeles. When career criminal Neil McCauley, played by Robert DeNiro, organizes his best group of men and goes on a spree of robberies, it is Hana who goes into action. Both Pacino and DeNiro are at their cinematic peaks, as the action and suspense of this film make it a must-see. While Pacino is notorious for convincingly playing villains, his role as a police officer in search of justice is one of the most compelling performances of his career. 2- Scarface The phrase “Say hello to my little friend,” is one of the most iconic exclamations in the history of movies. Al Pacino’s portrayal of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who rises in the drug world to become one of the richest men in Miami, is one of the greatest crime films ever produced. Tony Montana has become such an icon that even today, young people are seen wearing shirts and jackets featuring his image. From his pursuit of Elvira, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, to his maneuvering among the worst criminals in South Florida, Pacino delivers the performance of a lifetime. 1-The Godfather Saga Over the span of three epic films, Al Pacino brings Michael Corleone to life. The son of Vito Corleone, an Italian immigrant who becomes the head of a crime syndicate known as The Corleone family, Michael Corleone is complicated. He initially wants no parts of the family business. However, after his father’s life is threatened, Michael’s loyalty to his family is reinforced. After being reluctant to run the family business, Michael eventually becomes the head of the family. After his father dies, he is referred to as “Don Corleone” a title only given to the elite among the New York crime families. Being a well-known leader among criminals does not come without its pitfalls. His own brother helps organize an assassination attempt against him. His wife divorces him, and eventually his relationship with his children becomes strained. In the end, Michael Corleone suffers the worst loss imaginable when his daughter is killed in front of his very eyes. These instances are just the tip of the iceberg; the Godfather saga has too many teachable moments to cover in one article. In all three films, Pacino delivers the performance of a lifetime. His portrayal of the reluctant crime lord is a gift to those who appreciate cinema. With this single portrayal, he has left an indelible mark on the film world that will live on forever."
8,From Plasticine To Digital: The Development Of Three-Dimensional Animation,arts-entertainment," Early Animations The earliest form of 3-D animation evolved prior to the use of computers. Long before the evolution of fully digitally animated, three-dimensional movies such as Frozen, a technique known as 'claymation' was used for making stop motion pictures. This involved manipulating clay, plasticine, or other substances used for making models, into shapes for every frame of film. This technique was promoted and pioneered by British animation firm Aardman Animations, in their beloved series Wallace and Gromit (1989), but the artform may in fact date all the way back to 1897, with the first surviving claymation film being The Sculptor’s Nightmare (1908). Advancing The Technique The animation studio Laika later advanced the traditional clay animation technique by using 3-D printing to create thousands of different facial expressions for each character. They would change the expression of each frame in a fluid motion, making it appear as though the characters were talking and moving. Laika made several movies including Coraline and ParaNorman, but it did not hold the same acclaim as Disney, and as such, did not have the same success at the box office. Moving To Television Pixar was the first to use CGI 3-D animation, with Toy Story in 1995. It was a big hit, and they went on to create another 11 full-length feature animations, including Monsters Inc. among others. In the early 2000s, cartoon shows also began to introduce 3-D animation. This included Jimmy Neutron, but there have been many others to date. Attention To Detail Details such as hair or fur have been a key indicator of modern advancements in animation. One of the most advanced animations of the early 2000s was The Incredibles. It included more realistic, fluid motions and detailed models of human anatomy. In particular, the hair of the character Violet was a key part of her personality, as it was made to be often obscuring her face. As such, the hair was made of 1000 individually rendered strands. Pixar’s animators also captured themselves on film to get a better idea of human motion. Dubbed ‘Alpha Omega’, the team had to be divided into four, with one team developing modelling, shading and layout, another the final camera, lighting and effects. The third team, known as the ‘character team’, rigged, digitally sculpted, and shaded all of the characters, while the ‘simulation team’ developed the models for hair and clothing. Monsters Inc. (2001) began to focus on paying special detail to Sulley’s fur, which featured 2,320,413 individual pieces. With such attention to detail, it required 3500 computer processors to create the movie. Similarly, work on the Disney movie Tangled focused on the detailed animation of Rapunzel's hair. Before Tangled, most animated female characters wore their hair in a bob or braid, as digitally rendering individual strands of long hair involved high levels of computer processing. By contrast, Rapunzel's hair is composed of 100,000 objects (strands) that bump into each other, drape over her shoulders, and slide across the ground and other characters. As such, Rapunzel is one of the most technically advanced animated characters to date. The team were committed to producing highly realistic hair, and Rapunzel’s was made using a ‘Hair Bible’ created by Glen Keane, who had animated the hair of Ariel from The Little Mermaid, and the fur of The Beast from Beauty and The Beast. They then went on to do a series of experiments; including dropping 70 feet of cloth from a balcony to recreate her hair falling from the tower, brushing wigs at their desks, and using a live model. They even went so far as to create helmets with 70 feet of fishing line attached and run down office hallways while wearing them. It took a core team of 10 software engineers just to duplicate the movement of genuine long hair in a CG environment. Even the colour was a task - blonde is high maintenance as it requires multiple colours to stop it from appearing artificial. Therefore delicate work by teams of lighters and shaders were needed to make Rapunzel's hair appear realistic. Ice-Cool Creations Disney’s next big box office hit was Frozen, and while it lacked the attention to detail in hair and facial features that Tangled had, the advanced technology meant that the studio was able to create a highly detailed world - capturing the appearance and luminescence of snow and ice. Frozen was a box office hit, and its sequel, Frozen II, has become the highest-grossing animated movie to date. Who knows what advancements in animation are coming next? And will Disney and Pixar continue to dominate the 3-D scene? We look forward to finding out!"
9,Spiritual forces governing us enlighten our path to realization of our purpose in life,arts-entertainment," California/Canadian-Media: A review of Dr. Marcia Ann Mims Coppertino’s book ""21 Days with the Mistress of King Midas"" done by Asha Bajaj, Editorial-Director of Canadian-Media. In the book “21 Days with the Mistress of King Midas”, Dr. Marcia Ann Mims Coppertino, the author of the book keeps the readers entranced by the story of a common prostitute’s kindness towards a fallen king by letting him share her modest abode and heart and the way she transforms him with her ancient wisdom and knowledge to his return to victory in 21 days assigned to her for her tasks. Although the story is suggestive of the nature of the relationship between King Midas and her mistress, the path of ancient wisdom with which the author presents the landscape as the fallen and the tired king and the mistress, the self-emancipated prostitute begin their journey adds a great sense of spirituality to the theme of the book. Narrated in first-person by the mistress Dr. Marcia reveals the mistress does not feel any remorse when she leaves behind the role of a prostitute in the inn. Her words, “It is far better to work with joy of heart and purpose than to endure a life overcome by feelings and sadness...I know my prayers and cries for help did not go unanswered by the gods.” The portrayal of elements of nature such as the landscape, forests, sunset, etc. is gratifying to both the mistress and the tired king following her and equips both with the visual clarity of thoughts. The king following the mistress has lost his kingdom and finds solace and comfort in the company of the mistress who the author has portrayed as a guiding light thus uplifting the unsung heroines of the universe. The mistress did not try to find the name of the king and her words reflect the author’s message how the emotional and spiritual connection between two individuals transcends superfluousness. “The true name or identity of a person is in the display of his character and spirit, not by the name he had no ability to select at birth.” The element of supernatural beliefs in the story is introduced when the mistress places chrysanthemum flowers near the window believing that these would help reveal to her the innermost thoughts of the King while he was asleep. The soothing power of flowers also creates a melodious atmosphere. As well, the holy purpose of Kapalbharati Yoga, proper diet, exercise, and fresh air for the health and well-being of a person is also glorified by the author as seen by the king becoming more confident and strong day by day. The mistress’ words of encouragement that once King’s body is strong, he would regain both his mental and spiritual abilities to attain clarity of thoughts deeply touch the king’s heart. The mistress’ way of visualization and knowledge raises awareness to the readers that no profession is small or big and is not a criterion of one’s intellectuality and higher thinking. The author’s efforts at bringing equality between the people of all professions are ennobling. With great patience, the mistress teaches the King to distinguish between true and false friends, enemies, as well as enemies within oneself, and how to use these enemies as teaching aids are uplifting to the readers as well as to the king. She also teaches the king to distinguish between different women in his life and be trustworthy of only those who can be loyal to him through thick and thin, in physical valor as well intellectually and spiritually. The abundance of vocabulary and knowledge used by the mistress is again an indication that one’s profession sometimes is not one’s choice and that it cannot curb the higher thinking capacity of a person. The mistress also teaches the king the value of gratitude to God, prayers, and giving to others who are in need and be open to hospitality and flexibility of varied persons in his kingdom. From her own past painful experiences, she gives lessons to the king about the true nature and power of sex which should satiate the longings of the person without being disrespectful and selfish. Her teachings about the wisdom which a king should possess to rule his kingdom successfully, a proper vision with which to fulfill his mission as a king, the righteous way to use his power and authority as a ‘power to love, power to be, power to accomplish’ is once again reminiscent of the message of Dr. Marcia in this book that intellect, spirituality, wisdom transcends and conquers all the hurdles in one’s life. The ending of the story is both touching, and worthy of the noble and selfless service provided by the mistress to the King, and is transcendental. Dr. Marcia ends this phenomenal book with the following words which are both uplifting and reveal the true purpose in life and how the common man and woman who seek to rise above mediocrity can live up to their full potential. ‘It is in this “communication” process that we exist...and the belief that our existence has a purpose and as we live, the fulfillment of the purpose becomes manifest in the eyes and heart of the forces that do govern and send their light to brighten our way.” This book not only keeps the readers entertained and engaged but also uplifts and encourages them to follow the path of selfless righteousness and the identification of your life’s purpose and its fulfillment by being enlightened by divine spirits.

10,Gangs of the Lake.,arts-entertainment," As a Park Ranger, I had to be ready for just about anything.  It could be a minor discussion about camping fees or involve a serious criminal act. I worked at a lake near Kansas City with campgrounds and recreation areas.  All types of things happened at the lake. I was working at a lake near Kansas City, so we got a great many visitors from the metro area.  In this type of work you learn early that people bring all their issues, good and bad, with them from home.  If they get drunk and beat up their girlfriend at home, then they go to the lake and do the same thing. People brought their bad habits with them to the campground form home. The campgrounds and day-use areas I worked had a reputation for being a little on the rough side.  All the ills of the big city found their way to the lake and its recreation areas. The campground had a reputation for being a little rough and crime was common.  One issue we dealt with was that sometimes members of different gangs would come out and cause trouble.  There were serious crimes on a regular basis.  If it was a quiet week, you might only have a small fight or a party that got out of hand. Sometimes gangs or rough biker groups would come into the campground and cause trouble. The Rangers who worked the first shift, generally got to see the remnants from the previous nights activities.  They'd have to clean up the mess that was left. The morning would show what remained from the previous night. As they made their first morning patrol through the parks they would discover people who sneaked in without paying the camping fees or maybe picnic tables that were thrown on a campfire.  Sometimes they would discover persons who'd been left without a ride home or possibly the victim of a crime.  You just never knew what the early morning would bring. I normally worked the evening shift, but on this particular weekend I was covering a shift and patrolling on an early Sunday morning.  As I passed each campsite I would give it a once-over for signs of trouble. The park and campground were very hilly and forested. I was in a park that was along the side of a heavily wooded hill and looked more like the Ozarks of southern Missouri than northeast Kansas.  The road wound it's way around sharp turns and steep drop-offs, to the lake below.  The dense foliage and steep hills meant that you couldn't see very far ahead. I drove slowly with one ear on the law enforcement radio and the other to the sounds outside the patrol truck.  I rounded a sharp bend and came upon a campsite.  At first glance it appeared normal. The campsite had a smoldering fire that had died down.  The fire was nearly out. The nylon tent was set up and a little smoke was still whispering from a campfire that had long ago run out of fuel.  There were food items scattered on the picnic table and the ground around it.  There were food wrappers ripped open and strewn between the tent and the car.  This in itself wasn't suspicious because many people are not very tidy.   Many folks would leave stuff scattered all about their campsite. I didn't notice a camping permit attached to the tent or vehicle, so I pulled over to see if they needed to obtain one. The campsite looked normal with the nylon tent set up.  The family tent was set up, but not occupied. That is when things took an odd turn into left field.  I stopped about two car lengths away and realized that a lady and three kids were in the car.  They slowly looked up and  reacted to my presence.  It looked like they'd been sleeping in the car.  This wasn't unusual, especially if there had been a thunderstorm the night before, but in this case the weather had been clear. I put on my wide brimmed ranger hat and got out of the truck.  As soon as they saw that distinctive hat, they knew I was a Park Ranger and I could see them all light up with big smiles. As I walked up, they piled out of the car and ran up to me with smiles and giggles of joy.  The mom said loudly, ""Thank god you're here, we're finally safe!  We were so scared that they'd get us.  There was a whole group of them and they came into our campsite.""  She said they began taking all the food and throwing things all over the campsite! "" We were so scared of them that we got into our car and locked the doors.""  She was so excited that I couldn't get a word in edgewise. At this point I thought a group of gang members or a rough group of bikers had shown up and took over their campsite while they were drunk or high.  Apparently this was a crime scene.  I was thinking that we had a serious incident and that the woman and her three kids were lucky these people hadn't done anything to them physically. Things really got strange when they described how the people had milled around the car with the family inside.   They had then jumped on the car and were walking all over the car hood and roof while looking at them, menacingly, through the windows! Wow, these guys must have been taking a lot of drugs to act like this.  These poor people.  Terrorized all night long while locked in their car.  What kind of terrible people climb all over the car and scare you through the windows?  We're talking about some very twisted people! I asked them to describe the perpetrators.  One of the kids said that they stared at them through the car windows.  She also said that they were showing their teeth and snarling. I tried to imagine a stoned lowlife perched on the hood of the car snarling at the family through the window. If I wasn't talking to a mom and three young kids, I might have thought they were the ones who were stoned and imagining things. The entire group kept excitedly talking at the same time.  Their relief at being saved was overwhelming them with adrenaline and emotion.  I just had to figure out who I'd saved them from.  There could be a group of very bad people still in the area. Before I called for reinforcements I walked over to the campsite and their car.  As I looked at the car hood I could finally identify the drugged out gang of thugs who had so severely traumatized this young family. The hood, roof, and trunk of the car were covered with their foot prints. I slowly turned to the family and asked them to stop talking for a moment.  They quieted down and I asked.... ""You were attacked......by.........Raccoons??"" ""YEEEEES!""....came an exasperated group answer.  ""They were vicious and kept trying to attack us!""  ""They forced us to get in the car to save ourselves and kept looking at us through the windows and showing their teeth viciously!"" The mom explained that they had gotten in late from Kansas City and that they had no idea about how dangerous the raccoons were out here.  She excitedly told me that we should take steps to get these dangerous animals under control and to warn people about them. I felt like I was on some sort of Park Ranger Candid Camera show.  Surely, someone with a camera was going to jump out at any moment and yell ""Gotcha!"" As it turned out, the family was for real and truly believed they had narrowly survived a near death experience with a gang of wild raccoons who cornered them in their car all night. After all the drama I didn't want to make them feel silly, so I played along.  I told them that the racoons in the area were very bold and accustomed to humans, so they weren't shy.  This part was true. The raccoons saw the food in the campsite and thought it was a feast.  Then when the scared humans got in the car they just hung around and looked at them through the windows.  Raccoons have been known to show their teeth, but not necessarily as a sign of aggression.  They probably hoped the people in the car had more food. I walked around the area and into the woods around the campsite.  I knew the racoons were long gone and not a threat, but I wanted the family to know that I had fully checked the area.  I wanted them to feel secure. There were raccoon tracks and various food wrappers scattered about the area.  The ""gang"" had apparently enjoyed the food which was provided by the family.  It even looked like they went into the tent after the family had retreated to the car. I reassured the family that the raccoons were probably back in their home and fast asleep after all the food and night of activity.  I told them I would search the park to make sure they weren't still in the area.  I would maintain a close watch and keep the marauding racoon gang from attacking again. I also assured them that I would notify the other rangers.  They would also keep any eye on things.  After I left, I just giggled to myself.  These people from the city had gotten an upfront wildlife experience and lived to tell the tale.  For the remainder of their stay they would wave wildly at me and yell as I drove by on patrol.  Apparently, I had become their hero. To this day, that is probably one of their great family stories about how the Park Ranger saved them from a marauding gang of snarling racoons. There were many days that I would spot that same gang running across a campsite or away from a garbage can.  They'd just give me the stare of a hardended gang member and their leader would show his teeth in an attempt to intimidate me.  They'd then scurry into the woods where they planned for their next victims..........Yes, these were the mean streets of a neighborhood run by a gang!"
11,Call Me Chuck.,arts-entertainment," Charlie the cat thought he was in charge at our house.  In fact, he preferred that we call him ""Chuck"", because it sounded tougher to the neighborhood cats.  He tried very hard to be the center of attention as much as he could. I remember bringing a new girlfriend over to the house and while we sat in the living room he walked along the kitchen counter knocking dishes onto the floor.  He never seemed to do that unless a stranger was in the house. He just looked at the new woman in the house and hissed at her.  This was his house and he made it very clear. Chuck thought he was the biggest and baddest cat in the neighborhood. His only competition was Kasey the Sheltie.  She was Daddy's girl.  When I brought a stranger to the house, she would stand next to me and stare at the new person.  As with most Shelties, she would run in circles to try and herd the people.  If someone was too loud or rambunctious, she would nip at them. At that time I was a State Game Warden and was stationed in a very busy district.  It was one of those jobs that was more like a lifestyle than a mere job.  I worked nearly every holiday and all weekends, so I was used to having my days off during the week. On this particular day it was the middle of the week and I was relaxing at home.  As I sat in my recliner, the telephone rang.  I answered and it was the sheriff's department dispatcher.  She told me that someone had found an injured owl and didn't know what to do with it.  I told her I would handle it and got the address. Owls are protected by both state and federal law.  They are very important members of our ecosystem and really cool animals, so I didn't mind being interrupted on my day off. Since the animals are protected by law, it is unlawful for members of the public to possess them.  Besides, most folks have no idea how to  care for an injured bird such as an owl.  The state, therefore, has licensed wildlife rehabilitators who we could take injured animals to.   The rehabilitator could care for the animal until it could, hopefully, be released back into the wild. I scrounged around the bedroom, found my uniform, and dressed out for the trip to get the owl. As I got ready to leave, it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't have anything handy to put a large owl into.  The bird was supposed to be a great horned owl which can be rather large. I didn't have a pet carrier that was tall enough for a large owl and I couldn't find a box that would work either.  In my frustration I began stomping around the house trying to find anything that would work.  As I walked down the hallway, I glanced in the utility room.  Sitting next to the washer was a tall blue plastic hamper for keeping dirty clothes in. Of Course!  This seemed to be the answer.  It was plastic and therefore washable.  It also had slots for good ventilation on the sides and was deep enough for a large owl to stand in.  I dumped the dirty clothes on the floor of the utility room and ran out the door.  If anyone asked, I would claim it was a highly specialized piece of wildlife equipment. I got in my state truck and radioed the dispatcher to get the address again.  I had forgotten to write it down when she called me.  After getting the address again and writing it down this time, I took off on the 30 minute drive to the place where the owl was being held. It was late in the afternoon when I got to the house in the country.  The people told me that they had been out walking and had found him in the ditch.  They said he appeared stunned and didn't seem able to fly.  They had put him in their garage because they didn't know what else to do.  Come to think of it, I never did ask them how they got him in the garage.  I could just imagine them running across the yard chasing the owl yelling ""Here owl"", ""Here Owl"". I told them not to worry because I had my wildlife capture equipment with me in the truck.  I went to the truck and got the dirty clothes hamper out.  It was at that point I realized that I forgot a critical piece of equipment:  The Lid. I searched the truck for something to put over the top and all I could come up with was a coat.  The people then let me into the garage.  There were windows, but it was still dark in several places. The interesting thing about owls is that when they are stressed and not out in the woods, they don't hoot.  They use their large beaks to make a loud clicking sound.  The closest thing I can think of is when you snap your tongue on the roof of your mouth. So there I was in the dark garage. I sat down the clothes hamper and walked toward the owl with the coat.  I tried to act nonchalant and non-threatening, but that wise old owl wasn't falling for it.  He began running around the car that was still parked in the garage.  He sort of bobbed side to side as his stout little legs went as fast as they could.  As he ran, he kept making that loud clicking sound.  ""Here Owl!""  CLICK, CLICK, CLICK,  ""Here Owl"", ""Nice Owl!"", CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!  After the fourth lap around the car I was beginning to lose my cool.  ""Dang you bird!"",  ""Get your feathered rear over here, Now!"" As if the owl was going to follow orders. Finally, in the middle of the fifth lap, the bird made a wrong turn and ended up beside a storage shelf in the corner. I didn't want to stress the bird this much, but it was now..... ""Me versus the Owl!"" I got up close and threw the coat over and around the owl.  The Clicking got louder as he  tried to spread his wings.  I carefully dropped him into the clothes hamper.  I then quickly threw the coat over the top and hoped that he didn't figure out the lid was not attached. I left the garage with the hamper full of owl and thanked the people for being kind enough to help the bird.  They seemed a bit distressed after listening to the loud brawl in the garage.  I explained that my main concern had been his talons, which were very sharp and powerful.  By grabbing him with the coat I was able to keep the talons away from me and hold his wings down. Once he was in the hamper, he calmed down.  He stood about 18 inches tall and the hamper was cozy enough to hopefully let him feel secure.  I put the hamper in the passenger side seat and ran the seatbelt around it to hold him in place for the drive home. The couple asked where the owl would go and I told them I had a veterinarian in Topeka who was also a wildlife rehabilitator.  He would be able to figure out why the owl wasn't able to fly.  The people seemed very happy that the bird was going to get professional help. I drove the 30 minutes back to my house with absolutely no noise coming from the owl.  By the time I got home it was well after 5 and I knew the vet clinic would be closed by the time I got to Topeka.  I decided I'd worked enough time on my day off, so the owl would get to spend the night. I grabbed the hamper with the coat still covering the top and went inside the house.  Chuck and Kasey were immediately concerned with what I had brought into the house.  The cat jumped up on the back of the couch and the dog kept sniffing the bottom of the hamper. The best situation would be a room that was dark and quiet, so I put the hamper on top of the clothes dryer in the utility room.  I then turned off the light and pulled the door closed, but I didn't latch it.  You could still just push the door open if you wanted to. Having put the owl to bed for the night, I got a large glass of iced tea and relaxed in my recliner.  I would relax for the rest of the evening and take the owl to the vet in the morning. I leaned back in the recliner and turned on the television to watch a movie.  As the evening wore on, I began to notice that the animals were very aware that there was a stranger in our house.  They were sniffing all around the house.  They were normally used to the fact that dad came home with all sorts of funny smells on his clothes, but this had them very perplexed. From the recliner I could see down the hall where the utility room door was, as well as, into the kitchen.  It seemed to be Chuck who figured out that there was something lurking in the utility room. Normally, the cat and dog didn't get any closer to each other than they absolutely had to.  After all, they were sworn enemies.  In this case, however, their shared curiosity seemed to lead them into the same room. Of course, the reason I put the hamper on top of the dryer was so the cat and dog wouldn't bother the owl. I yelled down the hallway a couple times to get the pair away from the door, but finally decided to not worry about it.  As I watched, the cat ended up being the one who finally pushed the door hard enough to open it.  A few minutes later I watched the sheltie go through the opening in the doorway.  I figured they'd sniff around a while and get tired of it and come back out, so I wasn't concerned.  After all, the Owl was up on the dryer. As I watched the television I was startled by a huge commotion from the utility room.  There was a loud cat yowell and hissing, then the sheltie joined in by barking.  As this loud melee resounded down the hallway, I suddenly heard the distinct sound of the hamper as it hit the floor, after being tipped off the dryer and onto the floor. At that point, the fight was on!!!  I could hear cat yowells and hisses intermixed with dog barks and the loud clicking of an owl.  The sound of bodies bouncing against other objects and items falling to the floor could be heard all over the house. It sounded like professional wrestling and wild animal kingdom being thrown into a blender together.  It was complete mayhem! Suddenly, out of the dark doorway came the cat.  Every hair on his back and tail were puffed out, as though he'd had 8 of his 9 lives scared out of him.....Then right behind him came the sheltie running for her life.  If the floor had been dirt I'm sure there would have been a dust cloud from her peeling out to get away. Both of them screamed as they ran straight down the hall and into the kitchen! Right behind the sheltie ran the Great Horned Owl who yelled ""CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!!!!""  I heard the rumble continue in the kitchen with glasses being knocked off the counter and the trash can and chairs being pushed about. I sprang up from my recliner and by the time I got into the kitchen, the dog was cowering under the kitchen table behind the chairs.  There were several broken glasses on the floor and up on top of the refrigerator was Chuck the cat.  He was backed up against the wall, just as far from the beast as he could possibly climb.  There was nothing but terror in his face as the owl stood before them flapping his wings and yelling ""CLICK, CLICK, CLICK!!!""  Which I'm guessing is owl for ""Next time I'll knock the stuffing out of you!!"" I quickly got a blanket and grabbed the owl before he could make good on his threat.  He was pretty animated by this time. The dog continued to cringe and the cat meowed in fright. I took the owl back in the utility room and placed a box over the top.  I then shut the door completely while making sure it was latched. I swept up the glass and went back into the living room.  The sheltie jumped  up in my lap and acted as though she'd die if I left her.  She spent the evening staring down the hallway with a most worried look on her face. The cat, on the other hand, spent the rest of the night hiding and watching for the ""beast"". The next morning when I was walking out of the house with the owl, the cat and dog stayed in the bedroom.  They wouldn't have anything to do with that terrible beast I had brought into their home. Curiosity nearly killed the cat......or at least scared the life out of him."
12,"Mirror, Mirror, On the wall...",arts-entertainment," Our battle was fierce and the winner in doubt, but in the end, vanity was his undoing.  It was man versus bird, a Giant Bird.  No, not a giant chicken, but a large emu. In the mid 90's a fad swept across America.  It was the arts and crafts practice of taking the large emu eggs and decorating them as part of art projects.   I'm told the eggs could fetch $50-$100 apiece if sold to the right art supply people. The result was that everyone with an extra large yard was buying an emu and keeping it to sell the eggs. As a State Game Warden, I'd seen these large birds in outdoor enclosures on many properties.  They stood out because they were nearly 5 ft tall and always seemed to look  at you with an attitude.  They'd strut around like the world belonged to them.  Their stare let you know that they were the boss, not you. As animals go, I hadn't really paid a lot of attention to them because in Kansas they are considered a farm animal and not wildlife.  They were more like a giant chicken as far as Kansas law went.  It wasn't part of my job to inspect them or deal with them.....or so I thought. Unbeknownst to me, though, in the late 90's came the ""Great Emu Egg Crash"".  A new source of the large eggs became available.  In addition, the fad of decorating them had run its course and the fad fizzled out. The price for the eggs dropped to near zero and all these people had emu's which weren't making them money anymore.  They had these giant birds that they no longer wanted. I have no idea what the fate was for many of the birds.  I don't know if they are good as barbecue. I do know, however, that many people decided to, just let them go.  I don't know if they figured the coyotes would get them or if they actually thought they had a chance out in the wilds. You know that every good job description has a statement toward the end which says, ""other duties as assigned"". It was a warm and sunny Saturday morning in May.  I was in my patrol truck headed to the lake to begin checking fishing licenses.  The crappie were hitting pretty good and there were throngs of fishermen coming from Kansas City to try their luck. It was looking like a nice day to spend along the shore.  My district was extremely busy because it had a large lake and was close to several large cities.  I expected I would end up writing several tickets that day and possibly taking a few people to jail for various reasons. My district was so busy that I carried multiple sets of handcuffs because it was common for me to end up arresting several people at a time for outstanding warrants, drugs, stolen property, or a hundred other reasons.  Criminals liked to go to the lake just like everyone else, so I got to deal with them quite a bit. Needless to say, the last thing on my mind was a giant chicken or an emu. I had left my house and was almost to the lake when the county sheriff's dispatcher called me by radio.  She advised me that some people who lived north of the county seat had a giant bird in their yard. I asked her to repeat her message.  A Giant Bird?? Yes, she replied, a Giant Bird.  I asked her if it was a wild turkey and she said the people knew what a turkey looked like and had told her this was a Giant Bird.  Apparently, much bigger than a turkey. I asked her what she wanted me to do about it and the dispatcher asked if I could go to their house and just make contact with them.  In other words, they didn't know what to do, but since it was an animal, I was the closest thing they had to an answer. I was very curious about this ""Giant Bird"" and just what was going on.  The drunks at the lake could wait.  I had a Giant Bird to wrangle! The county seat is a town called Oskaloosa and the house I was going to was a few miles north of town on the main highway. It took about 20 minutes to get there.  I pulled into the driveway of a very nice looking house.  The owner came out and met me on the driveway.  I greeted him and asked what was going on.  He told me that a Giant Bird had showed up on the patio of their house.  He said it wasn't aggressive and seemed fairly tame.  He didn't know, however, where it came from. I followed him around the house to the back yard and sure enough, there was a giant bird standing on their patio.  It was an emu. I already knew the answer, but I went ahead and asked him what he wanted me to do.  He quickly asked me to remove the bird.  They had no farm animals and the giant bird had already scared his small house dog to within an inch of his life. About this time a sheriff's deputy showed up to check out the ""giant bird"" call.  I think over the years I had provided other law enforcement officers a lot of entertainment.  Many of the calls I got were not the run of the mill type of call and if they were close by, they would also respond to help out. As soon as the deputy got out of his patrol vehicle, he got a huge smile on his face and sort of laughed as he asked where the giant bird was at. I knew that the local veterinarian would take custody of the bird if I could get it under control and into my truck.....I knew what that meant....... I had to arrest the emu. As I approached the emu I suddenly thought of the famous line from the movie ""Young Guns"" when the cowboy who is stoned on peyote asks his friends if they saw the giant chicken. I quickly learned that herding emu's is like trying to herd chickens........complete pandemonium.  That bird had no intention of going where I tried to herd him. I knew that his beak could pierce a persons head and that his claws or feet could kick you and do damage.  My initial plan was to just rush him and wrestle him to the ground.  I would then wrap him in a raincoat I had in the truck. The State of Kansas had never thought to equip me for capturing an emu.....I was on my own. I got the raincoat out and tried to nonchalantly......slowly walk......toward the bird.......in a non-threatening manner.  He of course wasn't about to fall for my act and as soon as I grabbed him, he started flapping his large wings and jumped at me with his feet.  One of his claws caught me on the left thigh and ripped my uniform pants.  I didn't notice at first, because the fight was on.  At first I grabbed him by the body, but he came at me with those claws. I thought that he was fighting dirty.  So in desperation I grabbed him by his long neck.  I wasn't trying to choke him, but was attempting to hang on any way I could. I watched his beak as he bobbed his head this way and that.  He'd move his head one way and I'd move mine the other in self defense.  The last thing I wanted to do was get killed by an angry emu beak to the head. As I held onto the bird he was trying to run and before long we were in the driveway at the front of the house.  I tried to get my arm around the large birds body again and got kicked again.  This time I fell to the ground.  A cloud of dust was kicked up around me as I fell onto the gravel.  The bird ran off. At this point, the homeowner was staring at me with a look of disbelief.  I don't think he'd ever seen someone get beat up by a giant bird. I looked over at the deputy sheriff and he was laughing hysterically at the show I had just put on.  I got up and saw that my leg was bleeding and my pants were torn. The giant bird had drawn first blood.  It was on now!! I was going to get that bird regardless of how ridiculous he made me look. I revised my plan and got a roll of duct tape out of my truck.  I knew that I was going to need to restrain him somehow because he showed no intent of going quietly.  Apparently this was an ill-tempered emu that was prepared to fight it out. I looked up to see where the emu had gone to.  I saw that he had run to the neighbors house and was standing in their driveway. I quickly walked toward him in a wide arch.  I was trying to get at him from behind, but of course he knew that trick also.  He started to run again and I cut him off.  He then turned around and ran into the attached garage of the neighbors house. They had a double car garage and both doors were wide open.  So he ended up running at full speed into the garage.  I figured that since he was now cornered, he was really going to put up a fight. As I ran into the garage right behind the giant bird, I was surprised when the bird stopped in his tracks and froze in place.  He seemed to suddenly forget that I was right behind him.  He didn't move, but just stared at the corner of the garage. I was afraid he had encountered the neighbors dog or children in the garage.  If they got caught in the middle of this chaos, I'd have to let the bird win again. I waited for several seconds, but the bird didn't move.  He seemed to sort of fluff up his feathers and make a strange noise.  As I rounded a stack of boxes, I found what had stopped the emu in his tracks......It was another emu...... or at least thats what he thought. Sitting there along the garage wall was a large dresser mirror that was being stored.  The emu seemed to think that the emu he was looking at was quite fetching. I knew that bird had a giant ego from the minute I first met him.  At this point he was looking at that bird and had forgotten about me. I was then able to throw my raincoat around him and run the tape around the outside.  He'd become very tame.  In fact, the biggest fight at that point was that he kept trying to look in the mirror.  It got his attention so completely that I was able to tape his beak and his feet together. As I carried the large bundle out of the garage he wiggled and flopped, but I was able to hang on.  The deputy opened the passenger door of my truck and I placed him inside. I had arrested an emu! In the end it was his vanity that led to his capture.  He just couldn't get enough of that good looking bird he saw in the mirror!  If it hadn't been for that mirror, I'd still be chasing that ""Giant Bird"" across the county!"
13,You Are My Life by Tony Loignon,arts-entertainment," Tony Loignon is an American producer and musician originally from Montreal, Canada now based in Arlington Texas. He is back on the scene with a fantastic new studio work titled, “You Are My Life”.

14,Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Date,arts-entertainment," Although the original Hollow Knight came out in 2017, I didn’t play it until last year. I was upset with myself for waiting this long to play it because it’s incredible. I’m not a huge fan of metroidvania games, but I was taken aback as to how much fun I had playing it. And I’m excited for the next chapter in the Hollow Knight story. Here’s everything you need to know about Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release date and gameplay. Hollow Knight: Silksong - Story Hornet, an important character in the first game, transitions to the main character for the sequel. She was originally a foe to the first protagonist, but eventually comes to respect and aid our hero in his mission to protect the Hallownest Kingdom. According to developer Team Cherry’s website, in this new story, Hornet is captured and taken to a new kingdom where she has to fight her way to the top. Along the way, she will discover more about the kingdom and herself. Hollow Knight: Silksong - Gameplay The first Hollow Knight was a metroidvania game, and the sequel doesn’t deter from that. You explore your environment, gain abilities, and learn techniques to progress further in the story and in the kingdom. It takes a lot of trial and error; whether it’s learning where to go, learning how to defeat a certain enemy, or learning different techniques to reach certain places. Yes, you may feel frustrated but it’s rewarding once you defeat a boss that seemed unkillable. The Team Cherry website states that you will be able to take on quests. The original game had some side quests, but it seems that Hollow Knight: Silksong will have a more defined quest system where you will be able to keep track of what quest you are currently doing. The first game also allowed you the opportunity to craft your weapon into a stronger version of itself, but the website suggests that players will be able to craft different weapons and tools in the sequel. One element that is not changing are checkpoints. In order to save your progress, you will have to find a bench and sit on it. It’s definitely easier said than done. I remember playing the first game and panicking as I had one bar of health left, frantically searching for a bench. New Kingdom, New Danger The kingdom of the first Hollow Knight game was broken down into different sections that looked completely different from one another and had different dangers in each. There was a section filed with bees, another filled with jellyfishes, and one filled with terrifying spiders. The sequel appears to follow the same format of breaking down the kingdom into different parts. Hollow Knight: Silksong Trailer and Release Date As seen in the trailer, the player will be able to travel to these different sections and explore each of these unique places. These places include a green, lively section called Moss Grotto and a lava-filled section called the Deep Docks. Moss Grotto and Deep Docks were shown off in an E3 demo, but there are plenty of other sections to explore. And with a fresh environment comes fresh new faces. The Team Cherry website boasts that Hollow Knight: Silksong has over 150 enemies in the game. That number was last updated in December of 2019, so it remains a mystery whether that number has gone up in the last year. The original Hollow Knight had plenty of memorable bosses and allies, and we hope we’ll be able to say the same in this new installment. Unfortunately, it will probably be a while until we’re able to play the game as we still haven’t received an official release date since its announcement on Valentine’s Day of 2019. But with how amazing and fleshed out Hollow Knight was, we know the wait will be worth it. I’ve put in over 30 hours into the first game, and I thought I had done a lot of exploring. It then turned out there were huge chunks of the game I never saw or experienced. If Hollow Knight: Silksong will be as deep as its predecessor, the developers can take all the time that they want."

19,Matthew McConaughey’s Greatest Performance: The Lincoln Lawyer,arts-entertainment," Matthew McConaughey is without question one of the greatest actors of the modern era. It seems that no matter the role, he finds a way to give his character gravity, drawing the audience deeper into the film with each passing scene. It is McConaughey’s wit and charisma that make him a major box office draw. While he has received numerous awards and countless accolades, one performance and one film stand out above all others: The Lincoln Lawyer. McConaughey’s portrayal of a defense attorney faced with an unexpected set of circumstances resonates for several reasons. The internal turmoil he faces while dealing with what is ultimately right versus wrong is something every human being faces at some point during their lives. The following aspects of his performance are what make this film Matthew McConaughey’s signature performance. •	Complicated Interpersonal Relationships McConaughey’s character, Mickey Haller, is a well-known defense attorney in the city of Los Angeles. His ex-wife, played by Marisa Tomei, is a prosecutor. They have often found themselves on opposing sides of the same case. Even though they have competing professional interests, they do have one very important thing in common, their daughter. Although they are no longer an item, they are both concerned parents who work well together as parents. They remain friends, even though their competing interests may lead to the occasional verbal dispute. As we go through life’s journey, the relationships we form often become complicated. Coworkers can become friends, lovers are sometimes on again, off again. And then there are instances where grey areas become hard to define. As defense attorney Mickey Haller juggles these dynamics, the audience is left rooting for him to make sense of it all throughout the film. •	Internal Conflict In one very telling scene, an officer asks Mickey Haller how he copes with the number of criminals he has enabled to roam free on the streets. Haller goes on to relay a story of catching the district attorney trying to pin additional murders on a suspect, knowing full well the suspect was only guilty of one. The officer is clearly dissatisfied with Haller’s response and the two of them agree to disagree on the matter. Although Mickey Haller has always viewed his occupation as a necessary part of the American judicial system, he is ultimately faced with a dilemma of right and wrong he cannot dismiss. When it becomes clear that his client is not only guilty of assault but is also a serial killer who has managed to fly under the radar, Haller’s conscience outweighs any attorney client privilege that comes with his retainer. Although he is obligated by law to defend his client, Haller does not want his client to leave the courtroom a free man. The conflict between his occupational duties and his sense of right and wrong is an internal struggle anyone who watches the film will be able to relate to. •	Making Atonement for Past Sins Haller’s dilemma becomes that much more intense when he is finds out one of his client’s murders was tried and convicted with the wrong suspect. What makes it that much worse is that Haller was the defense attorney who convinced his client to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence. He must now look in the mirror, knowing that his assumption of guilt led him to put an innocent man behind bars while the real murderer roamed free. While defending his current client from an assault and battery charge, he is faced with the prospect of trying to right a wrong he committed years ago. Every human being will make mistakes as they go through life’s journey. The most important thing is to learn from those mistakes and make efforts to right the wrongs we’ve made along the way. The audience feels attorney Mickey Haller’s passion as he tells a friend he failed his innocent client years ago. It is his dedication to finding a solution that makes his actions admiral and relatable. •	Outmaneuvering the Opposition Mickey Haller ultimately finds a solution that satisfies both his professional obligation and his moral dilemma. He leads the unknowing prosecution team to enlist the services of a prison informant. While they are unaware that the informant’s conflict of interest will damage their assault and battery case against Haller’s client, his testimony also brings to light the fact that the defendant committed a murder for which another man was tried and convicted. By getting an acquittal for his client while simultaneously producing evidence that leads to his arrest for murder, Haller has killed two birds with one stone. A serial killer will finally be tried for his crimes. An innocent man who was wrongfully convicted will eventually be set free. The Lincoln Lawyer is a compelling film with many life lessons for the audience to walk away with. We will all be faced with a moral dilemma at some point in our lives; the important thing is how we choose to deal with it. Matthew McConaughey’s portrayal of an attorney in a complicated situation is humorous, intense, thrilling and relatable. In a film full of notable performances, his shines the brightest. The Lincoln Lawyer is a must-see film for anyone who loves a good drama. The plot is full of unexpected twists and in the end, viewers will feel they’ve learned something about life along the way."
20,A History Of Animation: From Cut-Outs To Computers,arts-entertainment," Even before the days of traditional animation methods, humans attempted to visualise stories by using moving images and props, for example, shadow puppet theatres and thaumatropes (two-sided discs on a string with different images on each side, creating an illusion of movement when spun). The ‘Magic Lantern’, invented in 1659, was one of the earliest forms of visualisation that resembled what we now know as animation today, and was essentially an early image projector that was initially used for entertainment, and then for educational purposes in the 19th Century. The Invention Of Animation In Film When modern animation was first invented, it was primarily used by independent artists. The first feature film containing animation was created in America in 1900 by British artist J. Stuart Blackton. It was entitled The Enchanted Drawing and consisted of little more than a man occasionally changing expressions, with an actor creating some effects using props. He then went on to make another similar ‘expression-based’ animated movie, pioneering cut-out animation styles in 1906, and later, a stop-motion picture in 1907 entitled The Haunted House. In 1908, the French artist Émile Cohl created the animated film using traditional animation methods: Fantasmagorie (1908), which starred a ‘stick figure’, which walked around and came across morphing objects. Cohl later worked for French Studio, Éclair in New York, and helped to bring the French animation style to the States. During the 1910s, animation started to move away from the independent arts scene to become the industry that it is today. One of the first pioneers of film-making studios was Winsor McCay (1866-1934). McCay used hand-drawn illustrations to create his animations. His feature film Gertie The Dinosaur (1911) was also one of the first animated films to feature extensive character development. The original Vaudeville act starring ‘Gertie’ involved McCay asking a series of questions, and the animated dinosaur responding with gestures. But when it was made into a feature film, McCay used a combination of live-action and animation techniques - for the first time in film history. McCay later released How A Mosquito Operates (1912) and The Sinking Of The Lusitana (1918). Refining The Animation Technique The founder of Barré Studios, Raoul Barré, invented the ‘peg technique’ in 1913, which helped to reduce time aligning illustrations by pinning each slide together. His ‘slash and tear’ technique also helped to reduce time spent animating by simply cutting away the foreground from the background. By doing this, he could repeat the background without having to redraw it for each slide. This also helped to keep continuity between each slide and gave a more ‘seamless’ appearance. Barré’s work on simplifying the animation process was continued in 1914, when John Bray Studios invented and patented the ‘cel technique’. This simplified Barré’s ‘slash and tear’ technique by using clear celluloid paper for the animated foreground over a stationary background. They also incorporated the assembly line production method recently developed by car manufacturer Henry Ford, enabling them to produce animations more quickly and with more ease. As a result of these developments, Bray Productions developed the first animated series, Colonel Heeza Liar. Bray Studios was the base point for many famous animators, including Max Fleischer (Betty Boop, Popeye) and Walter Lantz (Woody Woodpecker). The ‘rotoscoping’ technique was developed in 1915 and patented (1917) by Max Fleischer. This process involved using live-action film as a reference point for sketching animations. This technique was also used by Bray Productions, and later popularised by Disney Studios. Growing Popularity Between 1915 and 1916, a film company named The Cartoon Film Company by founders Buxton and Dyer, released 26 cartoons based around the efforts of WW1, including the Scarborough bombing by German airships. In 1916, Buxton and Dyer became integrated with Kine Comedy Kartoons. The first-ever animation to be merchandised was Felix The Cat, by Paramount Studios in 1919. It had a large fanbase, making it one of the most well-known cartoons in animation history. The Introduction Of Sound Between 1919-1920, Phonofilm patented their ‘sound-on-film’ technology, which allowed music to be played during films. Prior to this, all films were silent and accompanied by live music and/or voice actors in the movie theatre. ‘Sound on film’ was later used by Fleischer’s Inkwell Studios in Song-Car-Tunes, a 19-episode cartoon, which also used the ‘bouncing ball’ for a sing-along for the first time. Dialogue was later introduced to the films in Paul Terry’s Aesop’s Fables series. Changing Audiences And The Rise Of Disney Although nowadays, most animated films are often created for kids, the concept of animation for children was not widely popular until the 1950s. Up until then, animated films were primarily targeted at adult audiences, and while some children may have been attracted to the bright colours and simple shapes, the content often contained adult jokes and material that was not easily understood by kids. Disney Studios were one of the first to make animations targeted at younger audiences, but unbeknownst to many, they were not always a children’s animation studio. Originally, Walt Disney started out doing satire, advertisements, and newsreels, but never quite hit the ground running. As a result, the Disney studios initially went bankrupt. Disney eventually moved to Hollywood and struck up a relationship with Margaret J. Winkler, the first woman to produce and distribute films, and the distributor of Felix The Cat and Out Of The Inkwell. Many other well-known animation professionals also joined the team to make the Alice Comedies series, which was popular enough to last for 57 episodes. Disney briefly pursued experimentation with a series called Oswald The Lucky Rabbit (1927), for which he failed the continuation negotiation and was eventually replaced with partner and Winkler’s husband, Charles Mintz. Disney lost most of his staff and the rights to the character over the dispute. His success eventually came with Mickey Mouse, which was pioneering in the use of soundtrack, for example, the noise of a steamboat in Steamboat Willie (1928). When Donald Duck eventually overtook Mickey in popularity in 1938, Mickey was redesigned, and from 1938-1940, Mickey Mouse became the most popular animated cartoon character in history. The first two-strip technicolour animation was a segment in The King Of Jazz (1930), and was also used in Fiddlesticks, released at the same time. The ‘two-strip’ was short-lived, however, as in 1932, Disney released the Flowers and Trees, alongside the Technicolour company. This was the first-ever animated feature film to be released in full colour, using Disney’s new ’three colour strip’ technique. Disney struck a deal with the Technicolour company; for a limited time only, Disney would have exclusive rights to use Technicolour’s ‘three-strip’ full colour technique. The deal lapsed in 1935, and shortly after, full colour became the standard in animation. Introducing Depth: Creating The Illusion Of 3 Dimensions The Multiplane Camera Disney’s early animations used what became known as ‘the Multiplane Camera’. This was a large camera stationed above several glass slides which could be moved to create a ‘zooming’ effect and the illusion of depth. This also helped animations to flow more smoothly. Characters would move between the layers to give the impression of coming ‘closer’ or going ‘further away’. The Set-Back Camera Fleischer’s Set-Back camera, invented in 1933, worked similarly, but instead of using drawings on panes of glass, it was based around a three-dimensional set, which was built up in layers. The celluloid layers with the characters on them would then be moved between the set layers to make it appear as though the character was moving through the image. Animation Worldwide It’s a popular misconception that the first animated feature film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in 1930. However, the first animated feature was The Adventures Of Prince Achmed in 1926 by German, Lottie Reisinger. Whether this fact has been erased from history as a result of Disney’s success, the conflict of WWI and WWII, or as a result of misogyny is unclear, but the American Disney was highly influential and dominated much of the animation market. Up until World War II, most of the biggest animation studios were based in the United States or France. But with the start of World War II, the US faced more conflict - and as such, difficulty trading abroad. As a result, in the early 1940s, significant progress was made in animation in China and Japan. The first Chinese animated feature film in 1941 was Princess Iron Fan by the Wan brothers; Laiming, Guchan, Chaochen, and Dihuan. The film was very labour intensive; using rotoscoping techniques to save money and create lifelike movement, and using 237 artists over 3 years to create. It was enormously popular and was promptly exported to Japan, where it was also a hit. Shortly following this in 1944, Japan released their own feature-length animation, Momotaro: Sacred Sailors, which was highly influenced by the Second World War, and portrayed Japanese paratroopers in animal form, fighting to take the island of Celebes from British rule. It finishes with an image of children pretending to parachute onto a drawn ‘United States’ on the ground. As this feature was highly political, for some time it was believed to have been destroyed by American troops, however in 1983, a copy was discovered and the film was re-released in 1984. In 1960, Japanese anime was first broadcasted on domestic television. It took off very quickly, and by 1963, anime hit Astro Boy, based on manga by author Osamu Tezuka was released. It was a huge hit, and is still one of the most well-known anime to date, also being exported globally. During the 1980s, the US animation scene was slow and unimaginative, and Japanese anime saw a rise in popularity with the influence of highly influential Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki (Nausicaa Valley Of The Wind, My Neighbour Totoro). Russia was also very successful in creating their own film industry. Its studio Soyuzmultfilm employed up to 700 animators and produced up to 20 feature-length films per year. The films were predominantly targeted at children, and during the war period mostly focused on anti-fascism, but moved to a pro-Soviet approach following World War II. Soyuzmultfilm initially used similar cel animation techniques to Disney, but as the US and Russia began to form conflicts after the Second World War, the Russian industry moved away from using Disney’s animation technique and their own style began to emerge. The first animated film in Africa was created by Jewish brothers David and Shlomo Frenkel in Cairo in 1927. However, it was destroyed in a fire. Their first successful film was released in 1936 and was entitled Mafish Fayda, starring the first central Arabic cartoon character. Many African animation studios were limited by a lack of funding, among sociopolitical, economic, and colonial issues, but in recent years, have begun to take off. South Africa and Egypt now output a large number of animated movies, with 29 production studios in South Africa, including Clockwork Zoo Animation, Triggerfish, and Sunrise Productions. Simplification And Cutting Costs There were many changes between the 1950s-1960s which led to easier, more cost-effective production of animations. Firstly, in the 1950s, the development of limited animation techniques allowed animators to re-use certain parts of a frame instead of redrawing the frame. Secondly, the introduction of xerography in the 1960s got rid of the step of having to ink each drawing. The first film to use computer animation was The Little Mermaid in 1989 with Disney and Pixar’s Computer and Animation Production System (CAPS). The film broke box office records, and this helped to put Disney back on the map after several mediocre movies. The CAPS system enabled animators to ink and colour digitally, instead of colouring cels by hand, reducing production time significantly. However, it was not until Toy Story by Pixar in 1995 that a film was produced that was fully computer-animated. The 2000s saw the rise of 3D CGI with movies such as Tangled (2010), and Frozen (2013), which became the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Whilst immensely popular, the rise of 3D and computer-aided animation saw the decline of traditional, hand-drawn styles. Disney attempted a resurgence with The Princess And The Frog, but following the film’s lack of popularity, ceased producing 2D styles. Where Will Animation Go Now? Arguably, the similar style and repetitive content of Disney’s ‘fairytale’ films may be becoming monotonous. There has been a recent trend in the rising popularity of animation from countries outside the US; notably Japan, India, and France. With the increase in remote working over the past few years, it will be interesting to see if animation becomes more accessible to a global market, and what stylistic and cultural influences this brings to the field."

1,How do you create a clipping path in Photoshop?,arts-entertainment," Adobe Photoshop is one of the, if not the most better known professional softwares for editing pictures amongst the handful that is popular in the market. This application opens doors to many useful features that are incredibly helpful to a lot of different audiences and fields. One particular feature that has great importance in a number of areas, notably to the e-commerce business market, is called the “Deep Etch” or more commonly known as “Clipping Path”.

The very basics of Clipping Path teaches us to manipulate images.

Draw the selection line surrounding the product you want to cut out until you reach to the point where you started. Save the path from the right-aligned menu. After the path is created around your product, press Ctrl+left button of the mouse on the path menu To remove the background press Ctrl+j Save your file To add the background of your choice: After getting the path, select “Background Copy” option from the right-aligned menu You can select solid color/gradient/pattern from the adjustment layer option and choose the color you want on your product’s background Save your file Using clipping path technique on your images helps your targeted audience to get a clear idea of what they want to purchase or what they would like to buy. This feature is also essential for graphic designers and photographers as their work requires them to be skilled in different types of editing. Online and offline both the businesses require better quality images, attractive product photography and editing to showcase their product images in the most beautiful way. Editing such as the clipping path gives the best outcome when it is done by an expert team or professionals. Try UK Clipping Path expert services in Photoshop and invest the time in growing your business. How is ‘Clipping Path’ used for Photoshop? As aforementioned, clipping paths are a huge part in the field of e-commerce business, be it for marketing, promotional aspects of an establishment, or even working on brand image. This is also especially useful to entrepreneurs and people who work within the realms of Amazon, eBay, or Alibaba. Hence, it is extremely crucial to get the pictures absolutely perfect and on par with the requirements and standards for the respective field or photographs. Here are some of the reasons as to how clipping path is used for Photoshop: Remove your picture’s background: Like mentioned above, when you strip down all other techniques of ‘clipping path’ to the absolute bare essential, isolating a picture from its background or adding a backdrop to photos are the primary use of the feature ‘clipping path’ that is usually made with the ‘Pen Tool’ in the software. It is very useful for advertisements and product placements for things such as cars, real estate, accessories or fashion products and is best if done by a professional. Multiple clipping paths can be used: To be able to include a lot of different edits along with removing the background, multiple clipping paths need to be made. If you want to opt out of studio level photography but still add fun changes like making parts of the pictures a different colour or modify the shading of the image, this is the perfect solution for it. Making and using the ‘Multi Clipping Path’ feature is very affordable instead of high end photo shoots which costs a good amount. Colour Correction and Clipping Masks: In the field of e-commerce it is very important to get the perfect contrast and color combination of the product’s image as well as keeping and making it look natural. If your product is not lucrative to the customers, it might not represent a good brand value to the customers. Color and correction and contrast tone helps the image to get the perfect texture it needs to make a good representation of your product. Retouching Images: Sometime, due to excessive light the picture photographed loses its original colour and therefore, to fix this designers and image editing experts go through a retouching process where they repair the images by applying repeated patterns, red-eye removal, clearing eye whites, teeth whitening etc. If one is unable to have an in-house team of designers overlooking and constantly producing these images or does not know how to work on photoshop by themselves, fantastic online editing services such as UK Clipping Path can be hired to manipulate and edit your images. Using services such as ours are very cost effective and along with it are of high quality as well as skillful and done with years of expertise. The best part of it is that ‘clipping path’ not only has many uses but also can be used to additionally edit an image."
2,5 Underrated Animations That Deserve More Attention,arts-entertainment," Whether you’re an avid Disney fan, or just appreciate the artistry of the latest Pixar film, there is no denying that animation has become one of the leaders in the entertainment industry. From the earliest motion picture, children across the world grew up with fantastical settings and heroic characters brought to life on screen. Traditional fairytales and fables were taken from their native country and given a new lease of life, making them household names. Disney dominated the animation movie world for the majority of the 21st Century, with childhood favourites such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, along with a Disney Princess or two. However, there have been many films from Walt Disney Studios that have fallen flat at the box office but deserve recognition for the brilliant films they are. Treasure Planet Treasure Planet is Disney’s take on the classic novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. In a futuristic, celestial setting, a teenage boy follows a treasure map across the universe, befriending a cyborg and battling space pirates, black holes, and supernovas. Released in 2002, Disney used a then-revolutionary animation technique of putting 2D animation on top of 3D computer graphics. But the movie was in development for over a decade, and by the time it was released, Pixar and Dreamworks were beginning to dominate the animation industry with CGI movies such as Toy Story and Shrek. By this time, 2D animation was virtually dead. This, paired with Disney’s failure to properly promote the film, led to this being one of Disney’s biggest financial failures, with an approximate $79 million loss. However, the stunning artwork has led this film to be considered one of the most underrated Disney movies, and largely a victim of bad timing. Atlantis: The Lost Empire Released the year before Treasure Planet, Atlantis: The Lost Empire was Disney's attempt at breaking away from the Broadway-style musicals of the 1990s. The story follows Milo Thatch (Michael J. Fox) on his search for the lost city of Atlantis. Hoping to find relics and evidence of a forgotten society, he instead finds a lost civilisation of people who are beginning to die out. With the exclusion of musical numbers and talking animal sidekicks, this film has a much more grown-up feel about it. There is a solid storyline, filled with intrigue and plot twists, set in front of another incredible backdrop. Disney's faith in this movie was so high that there were plans to develop an adventure spin-off series. Released the same year as Shrek, this film also fell into the ‘poor timing’ category. Following a CGI film with a risky new style of animated feature led to the entire franchise being shelved. The Emperor's New Groove Back in 2000, The Emperor's New Groove was released after one of the most turbulent productions in Disney history. Originally named Kingdom of the Sun, the film started life as a full-blown Disney musical with songs by Sting. By all accounts, it had way too many story elements, which made the film overly complicated. Don Hahn, who was part of the production team for Beauty and the Beast, was the initial producer of this film, but when Atlantis: The Lost Empire began to take shape, he left to focus his time on that. After three years of development, the lighter slapstick side of the story proved popular with test audiences and the film became what you see today. Kuzco is a bratty emperor, who is turned into a Llama by his power-hungry adviser Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt). He is then helped by a Llama farmer in a story of self-discovery. Although the plot seems basic and predictable, this film is filled with endlessly quotable dialogue and lovable characters. It grossed $169 million worldwide (tuppence compared to the $800 million made by Lion King) but has been celebrated by its cult following for its individuality and humour. There is no denying that Disney has been a driving force for animated film, leading to many notable Disney movies being released which have flown under the radar. There are however, many amazing and underrated animation films that have not come from this industry giant. Anastasia Often being mistaken for a Disney classic, this Fox Animation Studios film tells the reimagined story of Anastasia, the Grand Duchess of Russia. Set against the aftermath of the Russian revolution, this film takes some liberties with historical accuracies; however, in the context of the film that doesn't seem to matter. In fact, young fans of this film actively sought out the true story behind the legend. Similar in format to its Disney counterparts, Anastasia is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, romance, and some action. This film has a richness in its artistic style, which transports you back in time and gives life to the characters. In a decade filled with stereotypical ‘damsel in distress’ Disney Princesses, ‘Anya’ was a refreshing take on a female protagonist. A clever script and a killer soundtrack have ensured this movie's revival, with a new Broadway musical even being based on the film. The Prince Of Egypt This 1998 film by Dreamworks was the first 2D musical animation the studio ever made. Critically acclaimed, it won the Best Original Song Oscar, alongside receiving a nomination for Best Musical. The film follows the biblical story of Moses from his time as a Prince of Egypt to a leader of the Hebrew slaves. Unlike other biblical movies, Dreamworks decided to prioritise the storyline above the religious connotations, whilst still being respectful to the story's origins. This underrated gem of a movie has perhaps one of the best openings in animation history, rivalling films such as The Lion King, while the quality of the animation brings the scope and scale of ancient Egypt to life in a way that draws you into the world. This, alongside the all-star cast (which includes Helen Mirren, Ralph Fiennes, Val Kilmer, Sandra Bullock, and Patrick Stewart) makes this film one of the most underrated animations of all time."

5,Denzel Washington's Top 10 movie roles of All Time,arts-entertainment," I’ve told several of my friends that under no circumstances are they to discuss the movie The Little Things with me. That’s because I’m a huge Denzel Washington fan and I am yet to view the film. Last weekend, my nephew received his EMT license and my cousin passed the bar exam. Needless to say, celebrating their achievements took priority over the film’s release. This past weekend there was the Super Bowl; making viewing plans and then actually watching the game was the dominant theme the entire weekend. Next weekend I will see the film. That is a guarantee. However, the release of yet another film featuring the iconic Denzel Washington got me to thinking “What are his top ten roles and in what order would I rank them?” Without further ado, this is my list of the top ten roles of Denzel Washington’s career. I’ve provided my favorite aspects of the roles I feel best define his career thus far. 10-	Glory (1989) In this film Denzel Washington plays Private Trip, a runaway slave who’s joined the Union Army during the Civil War. With his quick wit he’s able to win over the other troops but the commanding officers don’t find him nearly as charming. One of the most memorable moments in the film comes when Trip is being disciplined by being whipped in front of the other troops. A single defiant tear rolls down his face. This was a stirring performance in which Washington steals the show as the most memorable member of the supporting cast. 9-	The Book of Eli (2010) Set in a post-apocalyptic world in which humanity is trying to reestablish civilization, Washington plays an unlikely hero. There are several plot twists that keeps the audience on his toes and Washington delivers several captivating monologues during the film. Playing a wanderer named Eli, his character finds himself in the middle of more than one compelling fight with men whose intentions for the world are complicated at best. This film is worth seeing for the genius of the script, the exciting action scenes, and most importantly for Washington’s performance. 8-	Flight (2012) Captain Whip Whitaker is no stranger to cocaine and very well acquainted with alcohol. After performing a miracle landing to save a plan which was in imminent danger, Whitaker is hailed as a hero. However, that status is in serious jeopardy once it is discovered that Whitaker may have been intoxicated during the flight. This movie is a tale of a man wrestling with and coming to terms with his demons. There are several lessons about honesty and self-discovery to be taken away from this film. Once again, Washington delivers a breath-taking performance that audiences won’t soon forget. 7-	Devil in a Blue Dress (1995) Washington’s character, Easy, and Don Cheadle’s character, Mouse, have some of the best on scene chemistry in film history. These two play long-time friends who find themselves caught up in a web of lies that they must figure out in order to stay alive. The movie is set in the city of Los Angeles in the late 1940’s. Denzel again shows off his versatility as his character is witty and capable of a good action scene. Washington’s charisma and manner throughout the film make the viewer feel like they’re looking into the past. This film is a must see for all Denzel fans. 6-	Mo’ Better Blues (1990) Trumpet player Bleek Gilliam is one of the most popular jazz musicians in all of New York City. He’s also one of the city’s most eligible bachelors. Following Washington’s character in his roles as a musician and as a lady’s man is entertaining. However, it’s his inner circle that winds up getting him into trouble. Washington again delivers a charismatic performance carrying the film with his unique style of cool. Even amid a star-studded cast, Denzel’s performance shines the brightest of all. 5-	Antwone Fisher (2002) Washington plays Military Dr. Jerome Davenport, who’s assigned to counsel a young soldier by the name of Antwone Fisher. While Derek Luke’s portrayal of Fisher is stirring, Washington’s character is also compelling. Dr. Davenport becomes a fatherly figure to the young soldier while helping him deal with his complicated past. Denzel exudes strength, discipline and compassion in this film. His performance is as masterful as the script itself. 4-	Philadelphia (1993) Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks are two of the greatest actors of all time. In this film they remind us as to why. Washington’s character, Joe Miller, is a lawyer defending a lawyer who was wrongfully fired from his firm. The film addresses issues about stigmas and fears that exists in society. Denzel’s performance is riveting; he delivers one of the best courtroom speeches in the history of film. 3-	Malcolm X (1992) From the speech pattern, to the style of dress, the mannerisms and even the walk, Denzel absolutely nails his portrayal of legendary humanitarian, Malcolm X. One of the most important films about the African American struggle for equality, Washington’s performance is laced with several unforgettable moments. Denzel gives several stirring monologues and his indelible presence is leaves a lasting impression on the audience. 2-	John Q. (2002) If ever the term “tearjerker” was fitting it would be for Denzel Washington’s portrayal of a man who will do absolutely anything to save his son from dying. When John Archibald finds out the hospital is going to release his young son without performing a much-needed heart surgery, he takes matters into his own hands. This film transitions from drama to action flick with ease. Washington moves seamlessly throughout, hitting the mark in every scene. 1-	Training Day (2001) Denzel’s portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris is gripping from start to finish. Harris is a rogue cop who’s involved in gang activity and crime in the streets of Los Angeles. Washington nails the action scenes; he’s humorous at times in addition to being dramatic. This movie is not just a must-see for Denzel fans; anyone who loves crime dramas is doing themselves a disservice if they haven’t seen this film. Of all the classic performances Washington has given fans over the years, this one is the most complex and the most compelling. Truly a masterpiece by an acting aficionado. That concludes my list of Denzel Washington’s greatest roles. Although there have been many great actors and actresses in the history of cinema, Denzel’s versatility and consistency make him my favorite. Like all great actors he’s given us performances we will never forget. His films have been both thought provoking and entertaining and we should be thankful he’s shared his gift with us over the years."

7,How to Save Your Pets During Firework?,arts-entertainment," We all love fireworks, but unfortunately, our pets don’t. Be it the new year, Guy Fawkes, Christmas, or weddings, all are incomplete without fireworks. Even firework selection boxes have increasingly become a popular gift to exchange. During fireworks, we engage in our enjoyment and excitement. But have you ever thought about how fireworks affect the pets-especially dogs? I haven’t, consider it next time because dogs get frightened of the fireworks. The noise of fireworks elicits a sense of threat and danger in the dogs, and they may show anxiety by barking and running haphazardly. Science says that dogs have the capacity to hear more than twice as many frequencies as humans. Stress genetics are also a contributing factor. The temperament of dogs makes them susceptible to noise. What to Do to Save Pets During Firework? 1- Avoid Letting Your Dog Outdoor During Fireworks: The foremost thing to do is to keep your pets away from the fireworks. The most possible way of doing it is to restrict them from going outdoor when the fireworks are all set to fly and during the fireworks. Either take them for a walk before it gets dark or after the firework display gets over. You will also have to feed them early. 2- Provide A Safe Place to Hide: Make sure that your pet finds a safe place to hide if it smells, sees, or hears any signs of fireworks. Give your pet options and a wide area to choose where they want and feel to stay safe. Look for particular things that your pets are used to and comfortable with. Provide them the area and material where they feel comfy. Tuck your pet in a snug blanket or a crate if it is used to. 3- Divert The Pet’s Mind: The best possible solution to keep the pets safe from the fireworks is to divert the pet’s mind. You can overshadow the noise of firework with familiar music, or television and radio. Keeping their voice loud will be beneficial to avoid them hearing outside noise. Another alternative is to provide your pets something to chew. If they consistently chew during the fireworks, there is the possibility that they will ignore the fireworks noises. 4- Shut The Doors and Windows: Your pets can also get panic if they see the lights of fireworks and smell the odor. Restrict the pets from smelling and seeing fireworks by shutting the doors and windows and closing down the curtains. 5- Tie an Identification Tag: If your pets succeed to run away in panic, make sure that you have already tied an ID tag. This will help you find them if they get lost. Also, you can get them microchipped, which helps you to trace them easily. But make sure it is updated. What Do You Need to Avoid to Save Pets? Alongside what you should do, you must also understand what you should not do. For example, never punish your dog when it gets panic rather console it. The pets seem to get relaxed if they see you being fine. Also, never restrict them to one place they will feel that they are caged."

9,What Was the Original Purpose of Fireworks?,arts-entertainment," Fireworks are believed to have been invented in China a thousand years ago. The first type of fireworks were bamboo stalks, that when burnt in the fire, would produce a bang due to the hollow air gap present between them. It is also believed the first noted invention of fireworks was when somebody left bamboo stalks over coal for long. The heat caused expansion and made it explode. The original purpose of fireworks at that time was to scare off evils spirits and bring good fortune. The fireworks then evolved, and it is said that old Chinese chemists started mixing potassium nitrate, sulfur, and charcoal to produce a black powder. This is also famous as the first-ever gun powder. This powder was filled in bamboo sticks and then burnt at one end. The thing used to explode and produce a banging sound. Bamboo sticks were later replaced with paper tubes. These are known as man's first handmade fireworks. In the 13th century, fireworks entered Europe and were used as a part of celebrations. The purpose of fireworks adopted by the Europeans was to use them for religious festivals and public entertainment. To date, they are being used for the same purpose. Italians were the first Europeans who started manufacturing fireworks. European rulers at that time were fond of fireworks and used to like the display on every occasion. It was also a medium used to illuminate castles and monarchs on important occasions. The Europeans also used fireworks to celebrate the victories of the armed forces. Since there were no modes of communication at that time. Fireworks were used to inform the public about a victory or a happy event. Early settlers in the United States took fireworks with them. That’s how fireworks were brought to the American continent. It is believed that Captain John Smith was the first man on American land to set off a fireworks display. It was held in Jamestown, Virginia. John Smith among his other fellows used fireworks to celebrate special occasions. Later it became normal in the United States like other parts of the world. Fireworks were used as a part of the very first Independence Day celebration of the United States of America. This tradition continues every 4th of July when Americans celebrate the Day of Independence. The magnificent display of light and color is followed by parades, bonfires, and different festivals. Fireworks put a spectacular show of light and color in the sky. People look over the illuminated sky and feel overwhelmed. It is a source of entertainment for the public. The scenic views formed by exploding fireworks look beautiful. It is a breath-taking sight people love to watch. Today people use fireworks to celebrate several religious and cultural events. There are several types of firecrackers available in the market. They are a part of new year celebrations all over the world. In many parts of the world, fireworks are used at wedding celebrations. There are several options when purchasing fireworks for an occasion. For small celebrations, Cheapest Selection Boxes can be purchased and used at the event."
10,Studio Filippos Fragkogiannis - Graphic Design,arts-entertainment," One of the experiences that shaped me, and lead me towards graphic design, was my decade-long involvement with graffiti since the age of 14. Tags, names, and letters were the main elements we were spraying in the streets at the time. This premediated injection of verbal forms in public spaces has much in common with the way posters make walls speak. No wonder why my early steps as a graphic designer was making posters for school parties, graffiti stores, and rap artists’ concerts. At the same time, I was always drawn to language, and its power to determine, disseminate, and establish any given information. The way the written word can be archived, shared, printed, and reproduced inspires me. Whether it’s for advertising, propaganda, political discourse, religious proselytism, or the expression of feelings, language is a powerful tool. Based on that, I conceptually explore its capacities to produce designs with simple forms and condensed meanings, that can make as big an impact as possible. Slogans, one-liners, idioms, catchphrases, above-the-fold headlines, and other similar shortcuts to larger, more complex narratives, targeted to mass audience are amongst the things that trigger my mind. I’m fascinated by how language can take shape through visual communication to inspire or demoralize, unite or divide, raise awareness or spread false beliefs. As a designer, a number of my projects explore these ideas, like the limited-edition Take Away tote bag using PolySans Bulky on a happy yellow fabric, a project which is as much about what those two little words mean nowadays as it is about the use of the bag, and promoting Milos Mitrovic’s font. Actually, this is one of the many collaborative paths I explore with type designers. Typefaces, to me, are not only an essential design tool but also a true inspiration. I think of them as vessels for concepts, moods, and gestures. More often than not, a specific type will spark an idea in my mind, like the Plain Jane tee which sprung from the airplanes-related Valerio Monopoli’s Gatwick font. Overall, my design approach could be described as sharp, transparent, and plain-spoken. It calls for the viewers’ attention and tries to earn their trust, all the while allowing for multiple interpretations. I want the outcome to be direct and honest, to serve its purpose, and get the message across in a straightforward manner. I aim for easily recognizable and aesthetically appealing designs, that speak a universal language, and can reach a wider audience. The Stay Home poster, as part of Poster Jam’s challenge, is one of those endeavors, where I tried to capture the alarming global message of Covid-19 using comfy elements like the beloved Helvetica font, the light blue tone so closely linked to hygiene and cleanliness, and the amusing curves of Typefesse Pleine font. Instead of adopting one style or another, I follow my own creative methodology which starts with the accumulation of information and ends with condensed meanings and abstraction. First, I do a comprehensive research on the given subject, gather all the necessary materials, then I process them and find a sensible hierarchy between them and, finally, I take out everything that seems unnecessary or redundant. For instance, the 365+1 project we did with Georgia Harizani manifests this system of work, and can be seen as an exercise of simplicity, while dealing with such a vast theme as a year calendar. The calendar is an ongoing project and a new one will come your way soon for 2021, as well as other merch through an online platform I am currently creating. Together with Georgia Harizani, we’re also currently curating the type specimen of an exciting new type that will be out shortly. My efforts are equally directed toward expanding my online and offline outreach, introducing my work to a wider audience, and developing new collaborations with creatives and brands that are open to bold, radical, and unexpected design. I will keep on celebrating contemporary design through blogging, staying alert on what’s happening out there today, experimenting, and pushing my creativity further. My hope is to continue being involved in projects that would allow me to bring something new to the table, like the gentle gesture of elevating the tittles over the “i” in Highpoint Homes’ new logo."

Otherwise, you may get many empty spots. This feature ends with the Grand Jackpot if Lotus flowers cover up all of the 15 positions. Alternatively, you win the prizes shown on them. At this point, you may be out of 2000 x of this take value. 🐼 Theme and Design Since this game is inspired by Chinese wildlife, it features a lot of decorative fish, ducks, red foxes, and Panda bears.

So, your options include 8, 10, 12 15, or 20 and 8, 18, 28, 38, or 48 for free spins and Mystery symbols respectively. In Chinese culture, the number 8 represents well high status and fortune. Similarly, the 6th option assigns mystery symbols and spins randomly. As mystery symbols show up, they are added to the reels and cause the one position to go up or down during spins. Before disappearing, these mystery symbols cover up the entire reel. Before the evaluation of wins, every mystery symbol discloses the one and same pay symbol. 🈯 Verdict In short, if you're looking for an impressively designed slot game, you may want to try out the Temple of Wealth.

5,logo design service,arts-entertainment," What is a logo? A logo is a symbol that consists of text or an image or both and represents the activity of a business. A good logo shows what a company does and what the value of that brand is. In fact, logo design means drawing. It is the face of the brand and forms the visual identity of a brand, which is why having a professional logo is important. Why should we have a logo? There are many reasons to have a logo, from branding to visual identity creation. If you want to succeed in your business and outperform your competitors, the first thing to do is to have a professional logo under a few reasons. Here's why you should have a logo. A logo makes you lose the competition Perhaps the most basic function of a logo is to give a unique image to your business that sets you apart from other businesses and even competitors. This is especially important when there is a lot of competition in your business (most of which are They use this feature). Before you want to have a logo for your brand, you should research your competitors and see what their brand and logo look like (which of course we do before designing). Of course, there are many similar points that are important to us in logo design Logos show key information about your brand In addition to identifying your type of business, logos also provide people with basic and important information about your company, which helps them reach a targeted and valuable audience in the industry in which you work or in the service you provide. For example, a company uses a striped zebra color image to indicate that it is in the field of barcode services, or an environmental company armcade uses green to communicate with its customers, in another example, for example, a company Uses a stylish font to make your products look luxurious A logo makes your brand known Logos have a profound visual impact on your customers, and when these people think about the services they need, they suddenly think of you and say, ""OK."" This company also exists! In other words, logos can create a strong visual connection with a business. This makes them always remember you. Think of logos like Iran Khodro or Keshavarzi Bank, logos They are so pervasive that we can recognize them at first glance without attaching their brand name. Not surprisingly, logos are an important part of a brand identity. logo design logo design What are the main elements of logos? Well now that we know what a logo does, let's look at what it is made of. There is no logical answer to this question, but we can still decompose some common elements of the logo. 1: Typography Many logos are made up of typographic elements and their initial form is text, some of them represent the first letter of the brand, such as the McDonald logo that begins with the letter M and are called monograms, and some are the full name of the brand. Are designed with a custom font (usually using a well-known logo first and then changing the font). 2: Illustration Sometimes typography is accompanied by symbols or icons, these icons can be composed of geometric or abstract images, in special cases logos can include decorative elements such as lines or visual points such as stars and dots. They do not necessarily create a specific, independent image. 3: Colors Logos go beyond typography and icons, colors have a huge impact on customer perception and attraction, logos can be single-color, multi-colored and even black and white. Multicolored logos often have color palettes. Are similar or complementary (usually opposite). 4: Written text In some cases, a logo is defined by the context in which it is used, but I would also like to point out that it is important where and what kind of logos are used in these writings. Usually less than ordinary writings are used in logos and Most designers try to create an effective image. What are the ways to design a logo? You have several ways to have a logo for yourself, if you have graphic knowledge you can design a logo yourself, but if you do not have graphic knowledge you can use online tools that are usually free and we do not offer you this at all. Although we introduce them and you can try them. 1: Working with a design agency The best way to have a logo is to work with design agencies. If you want to grow your business, perhaps your only solution is to work with a team of professional graphic designers. Design agencies have several important features that set them apart from other methods. First, because they work in a team and put their ideas together, they come up with much better ideas, and since all the work is divided and each person has a special expertise, you will get the best results. The problem that many people get from agencies is the high tariffs for their work, which has also been fixed on our site, and if you look at the prices, you will notice that the tariffs are much lower than the quality of our work. We will pay for the logos 2: Working with a freelancer The next option is to work with a freelancer, freelancers are people who work independently. The prices of these people depend on their skill level and you see a wide range of people who each offer different tariffs, a problem What you should pay attention to is that if you decide to work with freelancers, our suggestion is to work with professionals and avoid working with people who offer low prices. Such people have low skills and Where designing a professional logo requires a great deal of expertise, such people will deliver a poor job that can be detrimental in the long run and may even lead to the failure of your business. 3: Use online and offline logo makers First, in explaining this, I want to define logo makers 99designs.com What is a logo maker? Logo makers are software that work online and offline in different platforms with algorithms written by programmers. It is almost easy to work with these tools but they are usually of low quality because of only a series of icons and fonts. Use the default How many categories are logos divided into? Logos are divided into three main categories based on the general category: 1: Written logo The written logos themselves are divided into two categories. The first category are monogram logos. A monogram is a group of logos that is based on typography and consists of letters. In this type of logo, the abbreviated letters of the brand name usually form the logo. The logos of companies such as IBM, CNN, HP, HBO, NASA are in this category. These brands are suitable for logos because of their long names. For example, NASA stands for The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which means remembering the full name of the brand. It's hard, that's why these logos are suitable for these brands. logo design logo design pictorial logo The other category of logos are image logos that do not use text and only use images and symbols. Perhaps when you think of logos, you remember these logos, such as Twitter or the famous Apple logo. The biggest thing you need to pay attention to in this logo is what image you want to use and this is what forms the whole existence of your business, so in designing such logos, research should be done so that You can design a logo that represents your brand. logo design logo design Combined logo Hybrid logos, as the name implies, are a combination of text and hybrid logos. These types of logos are much more effective and are very suitable for start-ups because people, in addition to being familiar with your brand, They also remember your brand name, and when you are known and popular with people, you can even remove the text from your logo and have a visual logo. The logo of Aparat website falls into this category. logo design logo design What is the logo design process like? The logo design process in the Flamingo design team is very careful and professional and there is no need to worry about it. The steps we go through in the design are as follows: 1: Brand evaluation The first step in the logo design process is to know the brand and discover its business goals, this step is known as customer discovery. If we do not have a proper knowledge of the brand and the demands of the customers of that brand, we can not communicate with it. How do we want to design a professional logo when we can not communicate? 2: Research in the field of work and competitors There is no business without a competitor, today almost all businesses have a lot of competition to attract customers. Every company must meet the standards of its industry, so the next step in designing a logo is to research the logo of competitors, with this idea Unique features can be taken and common points in each industry can be discovered and used in logo design. 3: Make a list of places where the logo is to be used This case is also important today, it is important where you want to use your logo because by determining this item, the color, shape and even the software used will change, this is done with the aim of optimizing The logo is done. 4: Designing sketch designs Now, if you have ideas in mind or you have already come up with interesting ideas with your group, it is time for the designs to come from the mind on paper and take on a real form, dozens or sometimes hundreds of designs in large projects. They come on paper so that you can finally choose the best designs from them. In the picture below, you can see some of our portraits that we have drawn on paper:"

10,Raptology: the new voice of Hip-Hop,arts-entertainment," The internet is the gateway to success for artists, but its navigation is the downfall of many. That’s where Raptology takes the reins. With the inclusion of the internet into the music industry, the game quickly changed from the norm. What took months, even years to reach the masses, now could be before millions of listeners in a matter of seconds. This gave way to a boom in artists wanting a cut of the profits and fame associated with the rap lifestyle. Unfortunately, that would turn out to be a problem in itself for artists trying to make a name in the industry. The influx of rappers saturated the game to the point where so many variations of music became available at once, that being discovered over all of it was a matter of chance, or who you knew that could help shed buzz on your name. The dream of becoming a famous rapper began crumbling for many, but, this became the inspiration for the birth of a platform that would bring the dreams of all those struggling to make it, to life. Raptology saw the gap within the industry and the unfair advantage that was held over those who had connections, and those who didn’t. While acts that were talentless rose to the top due to their connections, those gifted with lyricism fell to the bottom of the ladder with no help to be discovered by the masses. Raptology, was founded in 2017 within the heart of one of hip-hop’s most prominent origins, New York, with one sole purpose, to discover new artists while honoring the established ones. It is the hub for everything hip-hop; an online magazine for Hip-Hop and R&B enthusiasts world-wide with the means and resources to correctly shift the paradigm of the culture to the digital world. Whether news, Lifestyle trends, Cover Art or Events listings, Raptology covers every aspect of hip-hop and the music industry to which it resides. With the entrance of Raptology into the industry, artists flocked to their platform in an attempt to gain a leg in the rap game, and their reputation quickly spread of their hard work and dedication to artists they helped become discovered. It became evident, that Raptology and its founders were committed to honoring Hip-Hop’s finest, while also pledging support to innovative upcoming artists. They became the light for many struggling to find their place in the music industry and set many on the path to success. Raptology houses audiences worldwide, with daily traffic of persons eager to hear and learn of the freshest artists and keep up to date on the happenings of the hip-hop world. What Raptology has accomplished spans across an international scale, dominating mainly in the USA, UK, Canada and Australia. As their presence and notoriety grew, Raptology expanded their resources to upcoming artists, giving them a chance at accessing the full capabilities of their platform with a monthly Rap Contest. It was created in line with their commitment to discover new talents in the Rap Industry. The contest is split into three categories, Rap Song of The Month, Rap Video of the Month, and Rap Cover Art of The Month. Winners of the online Competition are announced on Raptology`s Website and Social Media and their reward holds its worth it gold. They receive an Exclusive Promo Package. A package that normally costs $300 and includes permanent placement on Raptology’s social media with their contact information as well, is given all for free. Raptology goes this hard for hip-hop and aspiring artists because they hold a deep passion and love for the genre. They not only make the resources to become the next buzzing rapper available to any artist, but they also give guidance and advice to help mold an artist to be their best self. With this intent their wisdom and advice to artists remains grounded in hip-hop’s core principles, “Continue to perfect your craft and become the best you can be. The industry can be tough on newcomers but know that there’s always a friend in Raptology. Believe in yourself no matter who doubts, and use the critiques and haters to fuel your motivation. Learn the business and never sell yourself short for money. It’s a marathon, not a race.” Their undying resolve to be of aid to artists shows in everything they embody and do. Raptology’s overtaking of the music publication and marketing business emerged to uplift the state of R&B and Hip-Hop. While they feel that hip-hop is alive, its pulse often times feels to fade by the lack of power held by true artists to hip-hop who respect the culture and craft. They want to be more than just a period in hip-hop’s history, they want to be burnt into its pages, to be remembered as a platform that became the crotches for hip-hop when it was most vulnerable and the medium that launched many talented artists to stardom. That, is their legacy, one that speaks more to what they did for hip-hop, than to what they benefited from it. Raptology doesn’t shy away from any new wave of artists that comes to the table, but they do resonate most with music of substance rather than lackluster rhymes and flows. They are true believers that what hip-hop needs more of is less of the repetitive “money, drugs, hoes” personas, and more of the conscious lyricist like J Cole and his peers that make you think and reflect on yourself and the world. Conscious rap doesn’t have to be just scientific metaphors or conversations using big terms and words. That’s where many artists are mistaken and avoid that style of lyricism. Conscious rap is less about just the lyrical ability, but rather the emotion behind the words; the meaning, the purpose, the intrigue of painting a vivid picture and telling a story so compelling that it sucks the listener in and leaves a lasting impression on the mind, heart, and soul. Raptology encourages all artists of hip-hop, whether successful or aspiring, to never give up and continue towards their dreams. Their help is always extended, and their reputation speaks for itself. Raptology welcomes artists to trust in their passion and interconnected platform to give them the edge they need to excel in the industry. Their track record in breaking artists into the industry is top notch."
11,Top 10 Upcoming Video Game Based Movies,arts-entertainment," Top 10 Upcoming Video Game Based Movies Let's see if Hollywood can get these ones right names Dave with Watch Mojo, and today we're counting down our picks for the top 10 video game movies in development right now for this list, we're looking at the 10 biggest video game movies that are currently being worked on. Number 10, Monster Hunter Capcom Action RPG series talks players with slang, fantastical monsters in order to build new armor and weapons but the upcoming movie sounds like a loose adaptation. It will feature a military team sent to investigate a portal by the United Nations,only when they enter it, they'll be transported to an alternate universe to find the monsters that make the game. Ok, on the plus side, there is an impressive supporting cast with Tony Jati and Ron Perlman I mean, who knows? Maybe Screen Gems will have another successful franchise on their hands but can you guess why this is only 10? Number 9, The Division There have already been several successful films based on author Tom Clancy's works, so another one shouldn't surprise us but what makes this project more interesting is how linked to the video game adaptation it is, Ubisoft is partnering with Netflix to bring the division movie to life. This one really surprised us, and if someone were to be on the lookout for stragglers, Jake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Chastain will star as well as produce, while David Leach of Deadpool will be directing the first game focused on a group of U.S. sleeper agents as they assist the city of New York during a terrorist led outbreak of a genetically enhanced super virus in New York City. And with the amount of talent already attached, we can expect it to be just as thrilling as the games, which in hindsight isn't really that thrilling. Number 8, Minecraft The Movie Aside from a telltale spinoff, Minecraft, a game about building whatever you want, doesn't exactly feature a strong plot. Despite this, a feature film adaptation has been in development by Warner Brothers since 2014. The Movie came close to fruition with director Shawn Levy and a set release of twenty nineteen but creative differences with developer Mojang caused the levy to drop out, several writers and directors later Warner Brothers has pushed it back to March 4th, 2022 to rework the story with writer director Peter Sulit. The first film will focus on a teenage girl in a band of adventurers as they try to save the world from an ender dragon. It may seem strange to make a Minecraft movie, but Warner Brothers was able to make Legos work so well. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Number 7, Metal Gear Solid It isn't often that a video game movie gets a director who's a fan of the source material. Luckily, the Mel Gibson movie has Jordan Vogt-Roberts as director, the Kong: Skull Island director, has made his passion for the series clear since joining in 2017. He even left a Metal Gear solid reference in Kong: Skull Island As of December 2019, the draft has been completed. We've seen video games being turned into cash grab movies time and time again, but it seems like the legion of passionate fans behind this decades old action stealth series can rest easy. Number 6, Mega Man With as many games, comics and animated TV shows this series has received, it's honestly a little surprising a movie hasn't been made, I mean, it's pretty much Astro Boy all in good time. In 2015, 20th Century Fox entered an agreement with CNN Entertainment and Capcom to bring the blue bomber to the big screen. Two years later, Henry Joost and Ariel Schoolman, the same team behind Paranormal Activity three and NERV, were brought on to write and direct. The live action adaptation was put into jeopardy during the Disney Fox merger, though Capcom claims it's still coming. It might be some time before we get any more news about the project, but with other Capcom franchises also being made into movies it doesn't seem like they'll let this one go so easily. Number 5, Tomb Raider Two Given how 2018's Tomb Raider was one of the more successful video game movies, it shocked absolutely no one when a sequel was greenlit. The first heavily relied on the 2013 reboot of the game series to tell that story, along with elements of rise of the Tomb Raider. And it left plenty of room for the sequel with the villainous organization known as Trinity. Things will be a bit different behind the scenes as the writer and director team of Amy Jump and Ben Wheatley will be in charge this time around. Reportedly, the plot will be adapting elements from both rise and shadow of the Tomb Raider. Number 4, Resident Evil Ok, one could argue that Capcom Survival Horror Series has already received enough film adaptations, however, it could not be argued that those films have been faithful. German production company Constanten Film announced the reboot in 2017, and the project has surprisingly moved along relatively smoothly since then. Yohannes Roberts has signed on to write and direct in 2018. He's already made a name for himself in mainstream horror films like 47 Metres Down and The Strangers Pray at Night. And since joining this reboot, he has promised it will be more scary and much more faithful to the source material than the previous film franchise. Number 3, Super Mario Brothers The mushroom kingdom is filled with shenanigans, vibrant colors and kooky characters right out of a Sunday morning cartoon, and there are few studios we think could translate that to a big screen as well as Illumination No story aspects unknown as of yet, nor is there a director or cast attached. Mario and Illumination are taking their time. Number 2, Uncharted Sony's uncharted project is the poster child for the video game movie development hell, it's been in the works since the late 2000s with David O. Russell attached to direct and Mark Wahlberg in the lead role as Nate. Over a decade later and it has now gone through six directors and has been delayed to 2021. Now Tom Holland will play the young Nathan Drake, while Wahlberg's role has now been shipped to Sully. Holland Spider-Man schedule is reported to be playing for yet another delay, but Sony is determined to get this project made. Number 1, Mortal Kombat Of all the video game movies in development, none seem to feel more close to the source material as the upcoming Mortal Kombat, the adaptation of the gory final will see newcomer Simon McQuoid in the director's chair, but will be produced by James WANs Atomic Monster Productions. Given that the series featured many horrific creature designs, we'd say this is a match made in heaven. The case is also stacked with veterans of terrific action movies, Joe Taslim will play Sub-Zero, Hiroyuki Sadhana will play Scorpion and Tadano U.S.A. will play Raiden just to name a few. Oh, and most importantly, it's targeting an R rating rating of the previous release PG 13 movies."

You can revise without having anxieties about your research paper and the services will handle the rest. Although, whereas we wouldn't excuse leaving all of your important time until the end time, we're here to reassure you that everything isn't lost. Here are our effective time management strategies to save lots of hours of your time. Craft A Plan And Set Goals Don't get into a blind revision fury, you'll solely have one day, however you'll get way more done if you break it up and estimate precisely what you would like to understand instead of simply cram in unspecified information. Pay half an hour understanding what topics you would like to cover and allotting chunks of your time for every bit. It would look like a waste of valuable revision time, however trust us it'll prevent way more time within the long run. Moreover, while the power of positive thinking is broad, it takes a bit more than that, according to investigation.  Whether your objective is to eat more potatoes or perform excel in school, science proposes that the key deceits in recognizing goals, considering the best conceivable consequences, measuring the difficulties, and coming up with an actionable plan toward the wanted end. Keep in mind that all goals are the same. By splitting your objectives into short, medium and long term groups, you can not only measure the means to accomplish them, but also gain an amazing idea of how all of these fragments come together. Use Lecture Slides And Previous Papers Lecture slides and past papers are each nice ways to figure out what's possible to come up in the exam, thus making use of them. Once you've discovered what's likely to come up, head to the textbooks to write key notes on every particular area. Look out for chapter summaries and key information boxes for an additional compact scan. You’ll be able to conjointly use past papers to check your data, you don't need to really do any essay queries, however you'll be able to write fast plans of how you'd approach them. Put Your Smartphone On Airplane Mode If you have a smartphone, you know how distracting it can be. Twitter, Facebook, Insta, text messaging, Reddit and yes, the entire Internet, are at your limbs. Even a common phone that is not listed in a smartphone can be really distracting. I suggest that at the start of your revision period, put your phone on silent mode and place it distant from you. If possible, you should place it at the other end of the room. This way, you won’t be disturbed by phone calls or text messages while you’re studying. You can always check your phone every 30 or 45 minutes when you take a gap. If you’re authentic with yourself, you’ll declare that few of the text messages and phone calls you receive need an instant response, so it’s fair to recoup to the other person when you’re taking a break. Summarize The Data Streamline every topic right down to one page of notes using your lecture slides, previous notes and textbooks. However you revise depends on your degree, except for 'bookish' subjects make certain you've learned key ideas, examples and evaluations, alongside at least one conflicting argument. Don't waste time repeating out paragraphs, this is often backbreaking, long and whole unneeded. Merely scanning through some selective notes should act as a memory jog after you read through them on the morning of your examination. Eat Healthy Diet Tempting because it may be to fill up on the Red Bull and Monster Energy and go hell for a lot of Adrenalin drinks, this is often never a decent plan. Sugar and caffeine would possibly provide you with a short energy boost, however after a couple of hours you'll crash in a very massive manner, despite still having a load additional revision to cover up. Instead, select some healthy, energy boosting snacks like bananas or porridge. It’s a proven reality that what you eat can have an effect on your physical and mental performance. Avoid espresso and doughnuts or pizza and soda before the revision or during the revision period.  On the contrary, grilled fish with steamed greens at the side, blended fruit for dessert, and caffeine-free drinks throughout would be perfect. Oily, heavy food can make you tired the morning after feasting. No alcoholic drinks of any kind should be consumed. Getting Enough Sleep This is the most important thing you should be caring for. Afternoon tiredness, sleep insufficiency, and disturbed sleep schedules are highly extensive among students, as 44% report daytime sleepiness and 63% get deficient sleep. The costs of sleep deficiency and daytime drowsiness are specially challenging to students and can result in worse grade point medians, amplified risk of academic catastrophe, cooperative learning, and weakened mood. Getting the accurate amount of sleep is very vital for studying. Investigation has revealed that you are more likely to take on information and increase your memory of subjects you have learned if you get enough sleep. Drowsiness and rough sleep timetables have many unintentional outcomes, one of which is to destructively impact learning, memory, and performance. The accurate details of the connection between sleep and memory formation are not yet completely agreed. The dual procedure theory conserves that certain types of memory are reliant on specific sleep conditions, such that procedural memory (knowing how) may be hooked on REM AKA (rapid eye movement) sleep and declarative memory (knowing what) on NREM AKA (non-REM) sleep. The sequential handling philosophy advises that memories require a systematic succession of sleep phases. When a deadline is approaching, it can often be alluring to sacrifice sleep to pack more study time in, but this can be unfavorable to your health. For most individuals 6-9 hours is the suggested amount of sleep you should be getting. Eventually, exams are necessary, yes, however they're not typically the only make-or-break issue. Don’t give up and don't let a stumpy grade undesirably impact your goals. Furthermore, if you are worried about your dissertation or other paperwork days before an exam, keep your revision on and don’t worry because it won’t help. Moreover, many students start asking themselves that if someone can Do My Online Class For Me, rather than worrying, you can hire academic online facilities to get your work done. In this way, you can concentrate more on the preparation of the exam. Well in my opinion, you shouldn’t revise on the night before the exam, you will end up hating yourself for this. Aside from everything, there are vital tips mentioned for revision above for what you should do to revise properly before an exam. Go into that examination room organized, attentive and quiet."

15,The Sound of Luxury Personified: Getting to know Natalja Sticco,arts-entertainment," For luxury brands, design is perceived by all five senses — including the ears, and the psychology of emotional sound design continues to be a critical component particularly in top-flight car and watch brands, where every single tick and rumble is an opportunity to provoke an emotional response. This “Auditory-Induced Emotion” has become an identifier almost as unique as a fingerprint for many brands which in turn becomes a reflection of distinct craftsmanship while painting a picture of comfort and effortlessness. Creating an all-encompassing sensory experience that achieves differentiation, exclusivity or mystique and aligning it with a brands overall tone of voice right means these small pieces of auditory art exerts tremendous influence on the overall feel and an impression of a brand. Crafting the audio footprint of a product is one thing, but ca an individual’s voice accomplishes naturally what brands invest millions of dollars hiring teams of audio engineers and psychologists to do? ‘Cue-in’ Opera Mezzo Soprano Natalja Sticco. “We all have certain songs that will immediately stir some kind of emotion in us. It’s also well-established in neuroscience that music and other sounds have the ability to induce emotions that impact our mood, and even improve focus and intelligence,” She explains, “so why couldn’t a voice have the same affect?” Good question, and one I set out to answer. Aside from her vocal chops, Natalja’s dossier lends credibility to the hypothesis. At 34 years old she’s studied voice, opera and classical music since early childhood. She is trilingual in her native Russian, in Latvian (the official state language of her home country of Latvia) and in English. She is also fluent and most often performs in Italian, German, French as well as Latin, and for fun became conversational in Dutch while studying for her Master’s Degree in The Netherlands. A music degree, you might ask? Nope. After competing a Bachelor degree in Vocal Performance and a second in Information Technology, Natalja decided to complete a Masters program in IT Engineering specializing in Robotics. All while working full-time as a chorus member of the Latvian National Opera & Ballet. “Though the work was stable I earned very little in the Opera. I knew I had to have a back-up career that would at least pay the bills.” I first heard Natalja at the birthday party of an UHNW client who is a fan of Opera. His wife actually found her and in chatting about her performance afterwards my client could not stop talking about the finer points of Natalja’s technical skill. While she did sound amazing to my untrained ear, I became more intrigued by the passion with which my client was speaking. A few months later I attended a business event she happened to be performing at and was amazed by how an opera singer could not only command the attention of the room, but how some men and women at my table were wiping tears from their eyes. When I asked if they had heard her before or were fans of opera I was shocked that their answers were “no.” As I drove home I caught myself humming one of the arias she had sung. I’ve been to operas in the Boston area, as well as The Met. They were thoroughly enjoyable experiences but hadn’t left the impression as this had. It was then I realized there was something more to this voice and had to figure it out. I reached out to Natalja and over the course of several months engaged in a conversation and learning experience that has transformed my opinion of opera. “Opera is the last, luxurious self-indulgence in music.” She states confidently. “Critics debate its relevance in music and society. Opera houses struggle with attracting new and more diverse audiences by staging educational programs and ‘opera is for everyone campaigns’ and the like. But it’s not for everyone, and those who enjoy it are generally better educated and wealthier.” Again she’s correct. What’s interesting though is that it’s not a matter of being an elitist that attracts people to opera. It’s the relationship between the neurological benefits of listening to opera and classical music and the fact that the benefits include better focus and higher intelligence. Applied to life that translates to doing better in school and work, and the science supports that. What’s interesting is that the same characteristics self-anointed progressive critics value in society’s are quite similar to what it takes to enjoy opera; a rich appreciation of cultural diversity, an openness to learning about different cultures and societies, and mastery of an art form. So why all the opera hate? Natalja says in her experience it’s a hesitancy to change the perception of opera as “elitist” by people on both sides, and for the uninitiated it takes some effort. “Americans are more like to say they don’t like opera and the most common reason I hear is because they don’t understand the languages, and I can’t help easy one with that. I’m sorry to say that there are plenty of children in Italy, France and Germany who understand it just fine. If your desire is to be more globally woke — learn a language or be willing to exert the energy to read a translation.” Natalja quips. She also doesn’t see the difference between what’s valued in popular music versus opera. “I think opera crowds are generally more giving and philanthropic. Artists and fans in other genres put on elaborate displays of wealth and excessive luxury living as something to aspire to and that’s fine with people. Enjoy a lyric in Italian outside of Italy and suddenly that makes you a bourgeois elitist. I just don’t get it.” Now that I was feeling better about enjoying opera, the question still remained about why Natalja’s voice in-particular resonated so deeply with me and the people I observed. Natalja is quick to credit the composers. “The difference between being an opera singer and a pop singer is that in opera the singer is part of the composition and orchestration. The singer is the voice of the composer. Our role isn’t to make it our own and put our own distinct spin on it. Maybe there is room for that in a concert but if you’re being authentic to the art that’s your job. So when each note is correctly executed the result is the emotion the composer intended to convey, and that’s what the audience experiences.” She continues, “if we look at your examples of the chimes to world’s finest grandfather clocks being replicated in a luxury car, if you run that same tone through the audio system of a Toyota it may sound ok, but you’re still not in a Rolls Royce. The mechanics are just not comparable. Same with a voice. There are a lot of people who graduate with degrees in opera performance. That’s a credential, not a qualification, and it doesn’t mean you possess technical expertise for certain repertoire. I’m careful to execute, to tune, every note in the way it was intended. That’s why you see people respond in the ways they do.” “Speaking of tuning, do you have perfect pitch?” I ask. “ABSOLUTE-ly” Natalja replies with a laugh (inside joke for any students of music reading). Yes, of course she does. When we talk about luxury brands stimulating all the senses, I can’t ignore the fact that Natalja is also strikingly beautiful and a far cry from any preconceived notions of opera’s “fat lady.” In what I’ve learned to be her trademark humble style she credits genetics with a touch of self-help. “My mother and grandmothers on both sides are all beautiful women, so I’m just lucky I guess. When it comes to fitness, I exercise daily but only because I just don’t feel well when I don’t. And my husband likes having a hot wife so it makes him happy too!” Jokingly, I comment that opera must also help with romance at-home. With the perfect timing of, well, an Opera Singer, Natalja excitedly exclaims “Yes!” before I can say she doesn’t have to answer. “It’s another psychological benefit of opera that can help you become more emotionally available by connecting with the emotions of the music.” Natalja’s husband, who has always sat quietly tapping away on his tablet in a corner of the room as I interviewed her, interrupts for the first time, “If you haven’t checked out her Spotify Playlists, find “Between the Sheets” and play it a few nights” he says with the raised eyebrows and nodding of his head up and down of a dear friend giving serious life advice, “you’re welcome” he finishes. I hadn’t actually said “thank you” of course, but having taking his advice and experiencing the result, “Thank you Good Sir!” Intelligence. Technical Refinement. Beauty and Sex Appeal, If Natalja were a luxury product her marketing team could easily craft a campaign around any of these attributes. In a field where tangible products and instagram-able experiences are part of defining a luxury lifestyle, the true final frontier of luxury may be the self-curation of the sounds we surround ourselves with. Sounds that evoke emotion, stimulates neurons in our brain, and allows for immersing oneself in an indulgence of musical solitude strewn with the decadence of bygone eras and a particular romantic sadism which is unique to opera, and in my experience uniquely crafted by this brilliant Mezzo Soprano."

18,From Still Life To Sittings: Tips For Mastering Photography,arts-entertainment," Photographing subjects well can be quite challenging. However, a feature-rich camera, plus a little good advice, can help you take amazing photographs every time you shoot. Even if you are taking a landscape photo, make sure your shot has a focal point. Shots without a focal point can look rather empty and dull. Possible focal points for a nature landscape photo include big trees, waterfalls, and distant mountains. Another trick is to use something that stands out as your focal point, such as a patch of different colored flowers. A really good photography trick is to pay close attention to angles. Angles can be very helpful when you're planning a composition. They can point towards certain things you want to focus on, creating a visual path for the viewer's eye to travel. Make good use of them. Try not to be too mechanical with your shots. Sometimes it is better to get an eclectic angle than to shoot various runs of the mill photos. Also, try to implement the scenery into your photos as often as possible if you want to capture a more personal and unique depiction. Shoot during the ""golden hours,"" especially if you are shooting human subjects. The time around dawn and dusk are named ""golden hours"" because the hue of the light makes objects look like they are glowing. This light also complements human skin, making human subjects appear to look better than they would in photos taken at other times of day. Keep your photo subject simple. The busier the subject is the more difficult it is to capture something that is going to be interesting. Keeping the backgrounds simple will make it easier for the eye to focus on the subject that you are capturing. Keeping it uncomplicated seems simple, but many forget to do it. Understand and get to know your camera. Although this sounds simple, many people have never even read the instructions on how to operate their camera. Get to know and understand the various menus and functions of every button on it so that when you need to use a certain function, you know where to find it and that the camera can accomplish it. When you are on a trip, snap photos of insignificant things. Some details might not seem important when you take the picture, but when you reflect back on your trip, these pictures will recreate a particular ambiance or memory for you. Taking photos of things such as street signs, storefronts and other interesting objects will help trigger memories you would have forgotten otherwise. A good photography tip is to take a look at post cards when you visit a new country. Looking at their post cards will show you all kinds of great opportunities for shooting. It will save you the hassle of having to search for these places by yourself. Flowers are a very great and beautiful thing to take photographs of no matter where you are. There are so many different types of flowers, and so many different ways to bring out their beauty in a photograph. Despite all of that, try to avoid taking photos of flowers when it is windy outside. When you are taking a picture, your arms should be close to your sides. This will help keep the camera still and ensure that your picture turns out clear and crisp. Your non-dominant hand should also be under the camera lens to hold it steady as you snap the picture. To experiment with photography, be sure to play around with shutter speeds. A slower speed means the shutter is open longer and can capture motion. Photos of a waterfall with a slow shutter speed would make the water look like one continuous motion. Faster shutter speeds capture action and are frequently used in sports photography. A photo of a waterfall in this example would show every drop of water clearly. A good rule of thumb when it comes to choosing settings on your camera is to choose the higher quality settings that take up more space on your memory card. The lower settings will not allow for quality printing, especially if you want to enlarge them. When shooting at a high resolution, you can always lower it later for sending via email or displaying online. Silhouettes are a wonderful photography technique. Many methods for creating a silhouette exist, including the most popular method of using a sunset. If the background coloration is considerably lighter than the subject, a silhouette may appear behind the focal point. You can achieve this effect by using a rear-mounted flash or by having the subject stand near a window facing east around 9 A.M. Keep in mind that outlines on a face or body may highlight some unpleasant features. Using your camera's built in flash is rarely a good thing. It will likely cause harsh shadows from the hard light that it puts off. Diffused light is going to work out much better for you. Invest in an integrated flash for your camera. You can point the flash away from the subject to avoid the hard light. A great photography tip that can help you out is to remember to back up your photos on two different hard drives. The last thing you want is to realize that you've lost all your precious work. Avoid a catastrophe like this by simply backing up your files. Incorporate things like roads, streams, shorelines, railway lines, or even railings, into your images. These are referred to as lead lines and are a great way to capture the way that a viewer is going to look at your photo. They will lead your viewer's eyes throughout the scenes of your photos. As you've seen, photography is just a matter of getting the right camera and using the right strategies. Even if you can't draw or paint, you can take a picture. After reading this article, you now know just what it takes to make a great picture, and you can turn photography into an art!"

20,WHEN I DIE TODAY,arts-entertainment," WHAT IF I DIE TODAY It could be the worst and best day to me Best:     -Run away from world’s problem (running is not the solution to the problem). Worst:  -I didn’t live the life I wanted (but everything is in God’s hands) -Distancing from my family (Dad, Mom, brothers, Sisters) and friends who always made me smile. People would say that I was the best to them, but I wasn’t. They would just be happy giving me the last wishes (RIP). They would post me in social media that they lost a legend (maybe), a good friend (hypocrisy to fake friends), a brother, cousin or whatever they would call me, but they wouldn’t have added any value to me because I wouldn’t see the posts. Some would come with flowers, place them in my coffin, besides my body but I won’t see them and I won’t see the meaning of the flowers because I would be sleeping forever. Others would cry but I won’t see their tears. Some would even kiss me but I won’t feel it because of my frozen senses. I would forget love, forget family, and forget friends. I would be on my own, the love of my own, the family of one and a friend of my own. I won’t have the right to choose what is good and bad or what is best for me but rather stand with who I was when I was alive. Moral Lesson: when we live, we have the right to make choices, right to choose what we want to be, right to make either good decisions or bad decisions. The people we live with have a great impact in our lives, either positive or negative impacts. In life, we should Define who we really are. Identify friends who have positive impacts in our life. Love those who love us and care those who matters in our lives. Stay focused and work towards achieving our life goals. Accept challenges and find solutions (never run away from challenges: that’s fear) Never fail to try all the time. Enjoy life to the fullest; love, lough, Explore: life is too short. Be prepared to die in the process"

2,To podcast or not to podcast...That is the question!,arts-entertainment," How do you entertain and inform your listeners these days? Podcasts are free to use and offer flexibility, which is essential for those with a busy lifestyle! How are podcasts beneficial? It is estimated that 165 million people have now listened to a podcast (2019 data). There is no shortage of content to choose from, and they are used in every aspect of life from training at the gym, to commuting, to doing the housework. All in all, they are an extremely attractive proposition! The podcast. Podcasts first came into being in 2004 and were initially audio files which could be downloaded on to mobile devices as a way of listening to content whilst on the move. The name ‘podcast’ is actually a combination of ‘iPod’ and ‘broadcast’. George W Bush was the first US President to broadcast his weekly address on a podcast, and now more than half of the United States has listened to one. British comedian, Ricky Gervais, set a Guinness World Record in 2007 for the most downloaded podcast with over a quarter of a million downloads of the Ricky Gervais Show during its first month. Podcasts for advertising. Podcasts are low cost to produce and as far fewer radio ads are broadcast, they are gaining popularity, particularly among the younger demographic. Advertisers are able to share their products using their own style on a podcast, which appears to be extremely successful. The host of the show delivering the ad on a podcast produces highly effective results and allows listeners to hear the brand message from a familiar personality that they like and trust. The podcast sounds interesting and fun whilst getting across the message the advertiser wishes to convey, allowing improvisation to relate the products to the theme of the show. Podcast transcription. Podcasts are ideal in numerous scenarios such as sport or relaxation, for learning and for businesses to advertise their products. There are many reasons why transcribing podcasts is a great idea. Transcribed podcasts are used as text to put tasters or quotes on social media, thus making the podcast widely visible. Putting podcast transcriptions on to search engines such as Google, Bing etc., increases user engagement. Google Podcasts makes it possible to search for episodes based on what was discussed in a show, even if the user is unaware of the name of the podcast. Using keywords or phrases will introduce the podcast creator to an audience who may never have heard of them. Maps are utilised on search engines to enable the user to find relevant sections in order to catch up and read the podcasts they have missed. Studies have shown that people often have information overload and prefer the at-a-glance opportunity which the transcription of a podcast affords them. Transcription of podcasts increases accessibility to much larger groups of people, such as the hearing impaired, and they are easily translated into many other languages. Some people prefer to read a section of the podcast first before deciding if the podcast interests them enough to listen to it in its entirety. Podcast transcriptions make the user experience more accessible, enabling them to choose their preferred format to obtain content, whilst some may have restricted access to internet and/or limited phone data. Also, listening to audio content is prone to distractions, making reading a better option for some. Another benefit is that small sections of the transcript can be copied and pasted and then posted to friends and colleagues via social media, email etc., thus again, introducing the podcast to a far wider audience. For the podcast creator, transcriptions are a good way to keep a record in order to avoid repetition and going over old ground and makes archived episodes more accessible. Methods of podcast transcription. Many companies offer software or AI transcription services which are popular, but as there is no actual person doing the transcription, they are rarely 100% accurate and usually need editing. A human transcriber has the ability to filter through background noise and detect accents and dialects, as well as understand context and spoken sound. In addition, automated transcription software is unable to recognise several different speakers, as is common in some podcasts. Typing transcription agencies, where the typist will accurately transcribe and proof-read, using correct grammar and punctuation, are invaluable as they provide a personal service, offer excellent value for money and a speedy turnaround of work. Summary. In summary, working in collaboration with a typing transcription service that is trustworthy and reliable will assist in enhancing the reach of the podcast for the creator and will provide consistent, high quality and professional text content!"

4,How To Write a Fantastic Video Game Review,arts-entertainment," Preliminary Steps Begin simply by playing the game of your choosing for at least 6-10 hours. It is crucial to get a significant play-through of the content and explore as many features in the game as to not rely on first impressions only. While playing, take notes about what you like during the play-through. Take note of game aspects such as graphics, sound, player and world mechanics. Also, take the time to jot down notes about how smoothly the game flows from scene to scene. Likewise, take notes about what you do not like during the play-through. For instance, if the graphics look drab write that down. If you feel like the game does not transition smoothly and has you confused or wishing for more than that is another thing to take notice of. No game is perfect, it is important to identify anything that you believe can be improved upon within the game to deliver a better experience. Try to compare the game to previous releases or other similar games in the genre that you have played. It could become easy to be overly critical about an aspect or feature in a game. Thus, comparing to previous releases or other similar games allows the audience and yourself to have a reference point and not just a blanket opinion that can seem too harsh. Constructing The Review Start compiling these components above into a full-fledged review of about 500-1000 words. Begin by introducing the game you will be reviewing. Especially, if it isn't a popular game it is important to hook the reader in and give a general insight of what the franchise or title is about. Focus on around 2-4 sentences. Next, dive into talking about the graphics, sound, and overall mechanics. Be sure to at least mention what game console you are playing on as this may influence graphics and sound to some degree. This portion should be comprehensive consisting of at least 4-6 sentences. Write about the overall plot and characters that are in the game. Make sure not to go too in-depth, as this can unintentionally spoil the game for the reader. Project your opinion on the game. Give an overall score on a scale from 1-10, whilst saying if you would recommend it or not. You're Almost Done"

9,The Complete Guide to Makoto Shinkai's Best Movies,arts-entertainment," One of the most critically acclaimed anime directors of all time, Makoto Shinkai made his name known around the world with the blockbuster hit Your Name, released in 2016. Three years later, his follow-up film, Weathering With You, also captured the hearts of many anime fans. However, Shinkai has been writing and directing long before Your Name and he has many amazing films that a lot of people haven’t heard of. This complete guide to Makoto Shinkai’s movies will only include the films which he has both written and directed. Apart from these titles, he has also directed films written by other writers, as well as worked on a few video games and commercials. The films below are listed in order of release date. Important Note: When buying anime DVDs online, please be sure to research region information and language options to make sure you are able to play these films on your country’s devices and in your desired language. The Complete List of Makoto Shinkai's Movies INDEX She and Her Cat: Their Standing Points (1999) Voices of a Distant Star (2002) The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004) 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007) Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011) Someone’s Gaze (2013) Garden of Words (2013) Your Name (2016) Weathering With You (2019) She and Her Cat: Their Standing Points (1999) If you fancy yourself a crazy cat person, or just a regular cat person, then this Makoto Shinkai anime movie should be on your watch list. Just under five minutes long, this short film was one of Shinkai’s earliest works and the first film he wrote, directed, and released for public viewing. She and Her Cat is a simple story about a cat who is in love with his owner. It is a short and sweet film told from the cat’s perspective. Interestingly, at Anime Expo 2013, Shinkai told fans that he’d written the film for a girl that he once loved and was seeing at the time. She was going through some rough days and he created the film to encourage her. Despite being a short five-minute film, it was widely praised and has even spawned a manga adaptation and a four-episode anime series titled She and Her Cat: Everything Flows (which was not written by Shinkai). Voices of a Distant Star (2002) Perhaps one of the biggest hidden gems of his career, Voices of a Distant Star is one of the best Makoto Shinkai movies. If I had to describe the film in one sentence, I’d say it is 5 Centimeters Per Second, but set in outer space. Since it is one of Shinkai’s earlier films, the art style has definitely aged a bit, especially the 3D graphics and battle scenes. However, there are some timeless beautiful images of the sky and space, which are very important plot devices of the film. Voices of a Distant Star is about two junior high school students, Mikako and Nogoro, who like each other but, haven’t had the courage to say it out loud. In this world, humans have advanced enough to live on Mars, but were attacked by an alien race called the Tarsians. Humanity is forced to pursue and defeat the Tarsians, and Mikako is chosen as a member of the UN Space Army. In space, Mikako pilots a Gundam-like mech suit to fight the Tarsians. Amidst interstellar travel and space-opera battle scenes, Shinkai still manages to keep the story about a lonely girl at the edge of the solar system who just wishes her words will reach the boy she loves. The film is just under 30 minutes long and it is amazing how much beauty, story, and emotion Shinkai is able to create within such a short runtime. The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004) Since The Placed Promised in Our Early Days is one of Shinkai’s earliest films, it is definitely a bit rough around the edges. However, it has a great sci-fi storyline, beautiful soundtrack, and mesmerizing visuals. The Place Promised in Our Early Days is set in an alternative universe where Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido is occupied by the Soviet Union. The Union has erected a large mysterious tower in Hokkaido and has not explained its true purpose. The rest of Japan has an alliance with the United States. The film follows two junior high school boys, Hiroki and Takuya, in their pursuit to build a small airplane to visit the tower. The two boys both seem to have a crush on the same girl, Sayuri, which leads them to some minor conflicts. In the background, things aren’t what they seem. Civil unrest threatens to break out into a war between North and South Japan. With a deep and somewhat complicated sci-fi story involving quantum physics and parallel worlds, the story was told a bit too quickly, even with its 90-minute runtime. Despite being a huge sci-fi fan, I had to replay certain scenes to catch what was going on. There is also a bit of an overreliance on title frames to shift between locations and time periods. With that said, the film has its strong points and there is definitely more good than bad. You’ll see strong parallels to the romance between Mitsuha and Taki in Your Name, and there are certain scenes in The Place Promised in Our Early Days that inspired scenes in Your Name. Furthermore, Shinkai’s attention to detail is impeccable. There is a part in the film where Takuya and Hiroki get into a serious fight and Takuya hits Hiroki out of anger. Takuya expresses disgust for Hiroki and leaves, wanting nothing more to do with him. However, if you catch that 0.5 second glimpse of Takuya’s facial expression, you’ll see that he is emotionally distraught and feels bad about how he left things. These small details are what separate the good anime writers from the exceptional ones. 5 Centimeters Per Second (2007) “Did you know that Cherry Blossoms fall at a speed of five centimeters per second?” It has often been said that Makoto Shinkai has a “one that got away” problem and this amazing, yet heartbreaking film, is a large reason for that rumour. 5 Centimeters Per Second is about a young boy named Takaki who befriends the shy new girl in the class named Akari. Sharing a common interest in novels, the two hit it off and become close friends. Unfortunately, due to their parents’ jobs the two find themselves being pulled apart. The anime is set in a time before smartphones and emails, a time where keeping in touch wasn’t that easy. Takaki and Akari find themselves longing for each other, yet drifting apart in a battle against distance and time. The anime film is told in four parts and follows Takaki from elementary school all the way into adulthood. For those looking for a more realistic romance anime,  5 Centimeters Per Second is almost painfully realistic. The film keeps you aching for a happy ending that always seems just a little out of reach. Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011) When you look at the entirety of Shinkai’s work, Children Who Chase Lost Voices seems to come out of nowhere. The film is very different from all his other works in terms of story, genre, and themes. In a way, the film is similar to numerous Studio Ghibli films, in its orthodox narrative arc and fantasy story elements. In fact, past critics and reviewers have even said that Children Who Chase Lost Voices is Shinkai trying to emulate Miyazaki. On the contrary, I don’t believe Shinkai was trying to copy Miyazaki in any way, and he was able to create a solid fantasy anime film in its own right. Children Who Chase Lost Voices is about a young girl who is swept up into a mysterious parallel world called Agartha. She travels to this world with her teacher, who believes Agartha has the power to bring back his dead wife. The film has a  more mature fantasy story, with themes about death and letting go of loved ones. Someone’s Gaze (2013) Someone’s Gaze is a short seven-minute anime film that was released alongside Shinkai’s Garden of Words. It is a small film with a strong emotional impact, especially amongst older audiences. Someone’s Gaze is set in the near future and is about Aya, a woman in her twenties who lives alone and is experiencing what it’s like to support yourself and live away from your family. The film is told through the perspective of the family’s cat named Mii. Since the film is so short, I don’t want to give away too much of the story. However, it is about familial bonds and how families change over time. The beauty of the art and the masterful pacing of the story led to a beautiful film despite its short runtime. The ability to elicit such strong emotions in just seven minutes is a huge feat. Someone’s Gaze remains the shortest film to ever make me cry. Garden of Words (2013) By far one of Makoto Shinkai’s most visually breathtaking movies, Garden of Words is a true work of art, with hyper-realistic depictions of rain and nature. However, unlike his two most recent blockbuster hits, Weathering With You and Your Name, Garden of Words is far from mainstream. It is a slower-paced film with a more subtle storyline. The anime is about the relationship between a troubled high school teacher and a male student who dreams of becoming a shoemaker. The two meet by chance in a garden, while both are skipping school due to personal reasons. Garden of Words is a tale of love and companionship that most people probably won’t connect with immediately. However, I really applaud Shinkai for trying to illustrate a form of love that differs from the young love and happily-ever-after relationships found in Your Name and Weathering With You. The film has a beautiful and soothing soundtrack, and even if you are not sold on the story's plotline, anime fans should watch this film just to witness the amazing visuals they were able to produce. Your Name (2016) Perhaps the one title on this list that needs no introduction, Your Name is the box office hit that made Shinkai known to both hardcore and casual anime fans all over the world. It made headlines in entertainment blogs around the world as the highest-grossing anime film of all time, knocking Miyazaki’s Spirited Away down to 2nd place. Your Name is about two high school students, Mitsuha and Taki, who find themselves unexplainably switching bodies when they sleep. At first, the two of them can’t stand one another and feel that they are ruining each other’s lives. However, by living in the other’s shoes the two form an unbreakable bond that transcends the distance and time between them. Featuring amazing music by the Japanese pop-rock band Radwimps, Your Name has a breathtaking soundtrack, beautiful art, and a mesmerizing story. If you still haven’t watched Your Name, stop what you’re doing and watch it immediately. Weathering With You (2019) Since Your Name made Shinkai known around the world, many people were highly anticipating the release of his follow-up film. With all the hype around Weathering With You, fans and critics were quick to compare the film with Your Name. While Weathering With You did not surpass Your Name in box office numbers, it did manage to make it to number five in the list of highest-grossing anime of all time and is without a doubt one of the best Makoto Shinkai movies out there. Weathering With You is a beautiful story about a boy named Hodaka, who runs away from home. He meets a girl named Hina who has the power to control the weather. The two work together as business partners to create a website selling Hina’s power to strangers. People who have a wedding, field trip, or important events all line up to pay for her services. However, the two quickly learn that controlling the weather has some serious consequences. Shinkai’s films often feature beautiful imagery of the sky, natural light, and clouds. Weathering With You is the pinnacle of that imagery. Furthermore, those who loved the soundtrack of Your Name created by Radwimps, will be pleased to know that Shinkai collaborated with the band again for this film. The music is truly beautiful; the cinematography is perfect, and the story just may bring a tear to your eye."

14,The Reason why Irina Shayk Hates Lady Gaga,arts-entertainment," Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper‘s chemistry in A Star Is Born has spilled off the screen, and some fans are certain the co-stars must be more than friends. But how are the rumors affecting Cooper’s relationship with the mother of his child, Victoria’s Secret model Irina Shayk? Here’s how Shayk really feels about Lady Gaga. Is it really just work? Following Cooper and Gaga’s seriously steamy Oscars performance, which saw them embracing at the piano and seemingly about to kiss, rumors swirled that the co-stars were secretly more than just friends. But a source told Us Weekly that Shayk wasn’t jealous of the chemistry, claiming, ""No I’m lucky I have a great family that’s utterly supportive."" Shayk has been dating Cooper since 2015, and he’s routinely thanked her in his acceptance speeches throughout the award season. The movie was a smash hit and Shayk joined her man for Hollywood’s biggest night, but she may have been sending a subtle message while she was there… The seating arrangements at the Oscars really got fans buzzing on social media, particularly when Shayk sat between Lady Gaga and Cooper. The ladies seemed perfectly happy together throughout the show, even hugging several times. But there was one telling moment suggesting that Shayk may have been a human buffer between the co-stars. The camera caught Cooper leaning forward in his seat to talk to Lady Gaga. Which would have been easier without Shayk in the middle? The New York Post reports that the seating chart at the Oscars is strict and that Cooper, Shayk, and Lady Gaga would have previously known of the arrangement. The standing 0 After Cooper and Gaga’s performance of ""Shallow"" at the Oscars, the audience broke into a standing ovation. And the person who started the whole thing? None other than Shayk, offering her full support in the most public way possible. But Shayk’s Oscar moment wasn’t the first time she’s openly supported A Star Is Born. Usually private about her relationship, Shayk stepped out alongside Cooper to support his film, at events including the 2019 Golden Globes and the 2019 BAFTA Awards. In fact, when Lady Gaga and Cooper kicked off the press tour for A Star Is Born in the summer of 2018, Shayk accompanied them to the Venice Film Festival, along with their daughter. An Oscars comedown Although they weren’t spotted on any after-party red carpets, the Daily Mail reported that Shayk and Cooper did continue celebrating after the Oscars, and Lady Gaga was there too. An insider claimed Gaga… ""Yes Bradley, yes they love it, keep going, we’ve got this."" Meanwhile, Shayk reportedly hung out with Cooper’s mother. A source said, The day after the Oscars, Cooper and Shayk were spotted running errands and picking up their daughter. The Daily Mail claims they were ""looking glum,"" but maybe they were just two people coming down from that massive Oscar high. Not about the gossip While Shayk apparently has no problem with Gaga the person, she’s not a fan of the endless gossip about the pop star’s relationship with her man. A source allegedly told The Sun, Toward the end of 2018, reports surfaced that Shayk and Cooper’s relationship was on the rocks, with a source telling Page Six, ""They are miserable together. They have been for months. He doesn’t drink and is into spirituality. She wants to go out."" Whether there’s any truth to those rumors remains to be seen"

16,7 Things You Must Know About Robert Downey Jr,arts-entertainment," Robert Downey Jr. led a life that deserves to be turned into a movie. Like come on, there are drama, action, failure, fame and some drugs! It was a miracle when Robert resurrected his flailing career with Iron man. Oh how badly we want Iron Man to be resurrected in the Marvel Universe! If you are also missing him then maybe you’d wanna dig into his life more, what say? At 5’9″ Downey Jr. doesn’t quite measure up to some of his co-stars and we don’t mind it one bit! But seems like Robert doesn’t like being the short-man. Well, during the production of Iron Man and its sequels, Robert wore ""heels"" or rather lifts to appear taller on camera! It won’t be wrong to assume that he liked this taller version of himself because he is often spotted wearing wedged sneakers. Remember the checkered Givenchy pair that he wore to his 50th birthday party in 2015? Yep, those were wedged and stood at a cool $2000 mark! Drugs have been an important part of Robert’s life, no denying the fact. So why have we brought this up here? Well, his first encounter with drugs wasn’t what you would expect. He wasn’t coaxed into it in a shady low-rent Hollywood party. His dad introduced him to weed when he was just 7 years old! There, we said it! It was on the sets of his first movie, Pound where his father offered him a voice-over role and also the first taste of marijuana. The actor still cites this moment as the one that sparked his obsession with substances! Remember the time when Robert Downey Jr. was practically living on drugs? From crack to cocaine, his body was a cocktail of substances! Anyway, around this time, Robert was driving around town with his car full of narcotics when he felt hungry and decided to get a burger from BK. The meal should have been juicy and delicious but what Robert was served was the most rotten meal of his life! When he was eating the burger he had a strange feeling that something bad is about to happen and got rid of all the drugs! Now you know how he got rid of the habit, so strange! Robert’s journey in and out of rehab facilities is no news, the world knows about it. But what most fans don’t know is that back in 2001 he got a one day leave from the rehab center to shoot for a music video. Elton John had enlisted director Sam Taylor-Johnson to come up with a video for the song I Want Love. Sam’s idea was simple and brilliant- a lone man walking around an empty house and lip-syncing the song. Simple? Nope, because she wanted Robert Downey Jr. for it who was in rehab! But things worked out and he was out for a day, took 16 takes but recorded a one-shot video! Media is always brimming about the life of Robert Downey Jr. but what they may have missed is his education in England and more importantly the ballet training that he received there! We knew this would shock you because nobody really associates dance to Robert! In 1977, he attended the famous Perry House School in Chelsea, London. There he endured grueling ballet sessions as a 10-year-old student. He didn’t stay long because, with his father’s work, they were always on the move. And the time that he did spend there, he was always acting like ""a moron"" rather than perfecting his pirouettes! It might seem strange to you that with a ""colorful"" past like Robert’s, his love life was comparatively less of a rainbow. He’s married twice and these days, rumors of linkups are also non-existent because he really has straightened up! But in the early stages of their careers, Sarah Jessica Parker and Robert Downey Jr. were dating. They met on the set of 1984 drama Firstborn when they were both 18 years old and moved in together just eight weeks after they began dating! They stood strong for 8 long years but then Robert’s addiction ruined things between the two and a lovely power-couple broke off! Do you know Robert did a movie, Chaplin? As per him, the movie took him out of this debauched subculture and back into the world of serious acting. At this point, the actor wanted to cut ties with the past and set himself free for a more promising future. And how did he do that? He took all the clothes he’d worn on his final Brat Pack outing, Less Than Zero, and buried them all in his own back yard. This was pretty symbolic but the very next day Robert felt this was stupid. His thoughts didn’t stay for long because about 4 days later he could feel a change!"
17,5 Best Kids Anime,arts-entertainment," In the past, anime was thought of as a form of entertainment only for children. While some people may still feel that way, there are more and more anime being produced for adults and young adults. In Japan especially, it is not regarded as embarrassing at all for adults to watch anime and we’ve spoken to many business professionals who often watch anime with their kids or just for their own enjoyment. At the same time, there are numerous kids anime that even adults can enjoy and learn from. To help you find some great titles to watch, this list will introduce five of the best kids anime that every adult should see at least once. Warning: The anime on this list have been known to tug on the heartstrings or bring on uncontrollable bouts of nostalgia. You can’t talk about the best kids anime without mentioning Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki. And one of the best anime films produced by the studio is Spirited Away, a coming-of-age fantasy story about a little girl named Chihiro and her parents moving to a new neighbourhood. However, on the road to their new home, the family is transported to an unknown world filled with spirits and creatures from Japanese Shinto folklore. Chihiro must learn to survive on her own and find a way to get her and her parents back to their world. Spirited Away is one of the most successful anime films of all time grossing over $347 million, and second only to Miyazaki’s Your Name. If you consider yourself an anime fan, this film is a must-see. If you are new to anime in general, I can’t think of a better place to start than with Spirited Away. A Netflix original series, Rilakkuma and Kaoru is about a human-sized bear that lives alongside Kaoru, a single office worker in her thirties. Rilakkuma is a character from the company San-X, the company that brought us Sumikko Gurashi, and Tarepanda. A portmanteau of the words ""relax"" and ""kuma"" which means bear, Rilakkuma is a lazy happy-go-lucky bear without a care in the world. However, similar to Winnie-the-Pooh, Rilakkuma is a great friend to those around him and helps support Kaoru in her daily life. Rilakkuma and Kaoru is a great anime for those looking for something to play in the background during your household chores or for people looking to learn more about Japanese food and culture. The show highlights the changing of the seasons in Japan and common foods and activities that people enjoy with each season. Since it’s such a hot topic in the gaming community, we had to include the fabled Animal Crossing anime film in this list. Many English-speaking Animal Crossing fans are not aware that a full-length anime film was released, since it was never promoted outside of Japan. The film follows a girl named Ai who moves to the Animal Village during the summer. The plot of the film follows the video game scenario almost perfectly: a new person moves to Animal Village, is put to work immediately and has to make friends, set up their new home, and make memories along the way. The Dobutsu No Mori anime film will bring bouts of nostalgia to fans of the game series, with appearances by Tom Nook, Whitney, Apollo, and many more Animal Crossing villagers. If you’re having fun playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, then Dobutsu No Mori is one of the best kids anime for you to watch during these periods of social distancing. Your familiarity and nostalgia level with the Pokémon series will depend on what generation you were born in. However, the Pokémon anime series hold up to this day, despite aged 2D cel graphics. If you go back and watch the series now, you’ll realize that the anime has a surprisingly mature story at times. While the video games are quite light in their stories, Pokémon can die in the anime. Not all trainers are as kind as Ash and you might remember that one of the early episodes is about how Ash’s Charmander was abandoned and left to die in the forest. If you have any love for the Pokémon franchise at all, we at Zen Market highly recommend rewatching the original anime series. It can be a good anime to play in the background while studying or doing chores and iconic episodes still have the power to tug at the heartstrings. While it is virtually unknown outside of Japan, Doraemon is one of the longest-running and one of the best kids anime franchises of all time. Doraemon is a robotic cat sent from the future to help a young, clumsy, and timid boy named Nobita fight his bullies and capture the heart of his crush. While the anime is aimed at children, Doraemon films are similar to Disney films in the sense that people of all ages can enjoy and learn from them. Stand by Me Doraemon is actually the perfect entry point for those new to the series, as the anime film is based on select episodes from the main series as a whole. The film begins when Nobita’s great-great-grandson travels from the future to warn him of his less-than-ideal life ahead of him where he marries the girl he dislikes the most in his class. Doraemon and Nobita then set out on an adventure to change his stars using a time machine to make sure that Nobita makes the right decision at key points in his life. The anime film is heartwarming and nostalgic; it is about growing up and letting go of your childhood. With mature themes about responsibility and leaving the nest, Stand by Me Doraemon is one of the most touching anime films out there."
18,"Graphic Design: Mohamed Abdelhay, A digital Artist Reinvents Traditional Art.",arts-entertainment," Mohamed Abdelhay is definitely Egyptian specialist, a online artist from a digital years.

But in the gift era, extreme development in technology limited this origin of messaging to just art and turn into graphic design.The shapes which once useful to capture beauty on a good paper, the artist managed to get it a way of money making by introducing this art on a commercial level. Yet, there are specific factors on which success associated with a graphic design depends, and that make it difficult to differentiate between the best or bad design. That which is graphic designing! Graphic designs are the ideal mixture of both any universe of art together with design. Though art concerns the personal understanding of the details and subsequently is developmental, realistic plans serve a given capacity.

They are additionally towards planning material for Internet website pages, intelligent media, and eyesight and sound undertakings.Mohamed Abdelhay isn't just a graphic designer, but Mohamed Abedlhey is a digital artist, what is going on what makes him a much more formidable artist."
19,Artist Spotlight with  Soprano Irina Petrik,arts-entertainment," Irina Petrik, Ukrainian Vocal Artist Irene Perloff McCullough When Irina Petrik was guest artist at the Atlanta Balalaika Society’s Spring 2019 concert, there was a little time to catch up with her and ask about her life since her previous engagements with ABS. But too little time to learn enough! Since Irina was just completing a CD of Ukrainian songs, it seemed good time to learn more about her interesting journey as an artist. Thank you, Irina, for your heartfelt answers during the following interview. Thank you so much! This project has truly been a tremendous blessing. When my friend and amazing guitarist Roman Karpishka approached me with an offer to record a few folk songs, I never thought this would grow into such a beautiful and meaningful endeavor. This CD is truly a unique collection of Ukrainian musical treasures and several original compositions which is aimed at preserving and promoting the exquisite, centuries-old melodies of my homeland. This album is a special homage to my heritage, a return to my roots, a love confession to the captivating simplicity of Ukrainian traditional songs I grew up with. It's been received with such warmth and enthusiasm, and I feel humbled to have been able to introduce new audiences  to it. 2.  Does any one song on this album have more personal meaning to you than others? This CD is kind of a kaleidoscope of human experiences put into a musical form. All twelve songs hold special meaning to me and it is, honestly, very hard to choose. The Kyiv Waltz is a nod to my hometown, the Sonko-Drimko lullaby is a song I loved as a little girl, the classics like Oi Vershe, Ridna Maty Moya and Dva Kolyory basically capture the essence of Ukrainian soul... To me, the beauty and magic of traditional songs is in their ability ( if done right! ) to instantly evoke emotion. The human experience is universal. A wise person once said that the path to enlightenment is to see all human behavior as either love, or a call for love. This statement resonates with me deeply, as it teaches one to look beyond the obvious and to learn true compassion. Music has the power to communicate what is beyond words. It transcends time and language and provides the direct link ""from heart to heart"". As an artist, I long for this kind of communication and find performing folk songs deeply satisfying for this very reason. It is also a very family-oriented album which is meant to connect generations, united by their love and respect for their culture. My friend Roman and I collaborated on two originals, included on this CD as well. My favorite one is ""Donyu"", a sweet tune about the joy of having a daughter. 3.  Irina, most of your performing career has been as an operatic soprano, but on this CD you sing in your lower folk-style voice. Were there occasions when you were growing up or in your training at the Gliere Music College where you sang in this style? And when did you decide to pursue a career as an opera singer? As a child, I was a part of a local children's theater which  gave me a chance to gain a lot of stage experience and explore quite a few different characters and roles. My first love was acting. My second was folk singing and jazz. I played piano since I was 6 and always sang. But it wasn't until my teens that I joined Kyiv Youth  Symphony and Choir and started singing in a classical style. By the time I was 14, I had already sang my first solo with them at the National Philharmonic of Ukraine. It was an oratorio piece. I fell in love with opera with the help of my first voice teacher, Tamara Koval who was a soloist at the National Opera of Ukraine and a Distinguished Artist of Ukraine. Once I discovered the genre, there was no going back! The sheer athleticism and communicative power of operatic human voice were astounding to me. Thanks to my teacher's encouragement and tireless devotion to higher standards, I started developing vocally with a speed of light and sang my first operatic role when I was a sophomore at the age of 19. It was Susanna in Marriage of Figaro. This particular piece is a traditional Ukrainian song, arranged in a classical style by Mykola Lysenko. This song has a higher tessitura, even if it were to be performed in a traditional folk style. The use of operatic technique enhances the top register and allows for a greater brilliance of the high notes which symbolizes the moonlight. This folk song is sung by a girl who is talking to the moon and asks the moon to shine onto the path for her beloved as he is walking home at night. She is waiting for him to come back home and is asking the moon to hide behind the clouds if her sweetheart is with another maiden. When the moon hides behind the clouds, the young girl cries bitterly, as she believes this is a sign that her loved one has betrayed her.  So, there's certainly operatic drama at work here and an opportunity to make this character multi-dimensional. But the sentiment is quite simple. This song has an immediate impact on people if the performer is deeply and intensely connected to the emotion of the song. Also, if performed by a classically-trained singer, it reaches the audience faster without the use of any acoustic enhancement tools ( microphones, sound systems, etc ) because ""the singer's formant"" ( around 3000 Hz) permits opera singers to be heard over loud orchestras and reach the audience easily, without any interference. Yes, I am the oldest of four girls. Two of them currently reside in Arizona with their husbands and children, and the youngest lives in Kyiv, along with my mother. My family was always very appreciative of  music and art , as well as encouraging us to explore our creative potential. My mom holds a PHD in art history and currently works for National Art Restoration Center of Ukraine ( her dream job! ). My parents divorced when I was 11, as Soviet Union was collapsing ( I am a proud child of the 90s ) and my father left and moved away, leaving my mom in a terrible situation ( she was expecting his fourth child in a broken system where we suddenly lost everything ). My grandma, a retired chemical engineer, took a job washing dishes in a local restaurant to help us all survive. We went from being a nice middle class family to living below the poverty line, as a lot of families experienced the same circumstances at the time. This phase was known as the ""wild 90's"" in post-Soviet countries. Luckily, Ukraine started developing rapidly as an independent country and things stabilized in early 2000's. My family was always very musical. My father played piano and sang. My mom sang and made sure we all got our music education, even though money was tight. My sisters and I always sang together. I used to write my own songs, and my sisters and I would often perform at schools, art centers and kindergartens. We were a big hit at the children's theatre I mentioned earlier! We also absolutely loved Christmas time, because my sisters and I would always go caroling together and sing in harmony which people loved. During the ""kolyada"" season, we used to bring home tons of candy, cookies and sometimes even money.  So my involvement in show business started early there and, needless to say, we felt quite motivated to perfect our craft!  Indeed, I loved my time at SFCM and am still in touch with a lot of my former classmates. I always wanted to live in California, and San Francisco was an amazing place to go to school. I studied with Pam Fry, who was a chair of voice department at SFCM and she was a wonderful artistic role model since she just emanated kindness and light. I have to confess, SFCM taught me the importance of being self-sufficient and organized. I was already pretty disciplined, having graduated from Gliere, which was by far the best musical college in my country. But San Francisco Conservatory made me an adult. I was a recipient of a full four-year scholarship from the Ministry of Culture in Ukraine, and at SFCM I had a partial scholarship and worked my way through school ( all sorts of odd jobs ) while sending money back home to support my mom and sisters. Artistically, it was such a  supportive and challenging environment. I remember being constantly inspired by my opera workshop directors Cathy Kathcart and Willene Gunn, my coach Steve Bailey, my acting teacher Bobby Wineapple. They were all masters of their craft and managed to help us grow in a competitive atmosphere which was also, amazingly enough, free of judgement and very accepting. After graduation, when I got out into the real world and started auditioning, I felt very prepared and confident. I am beyond grateful to my mentors and teachers... I am now a voice professor myself at the College of Saint Rose, and pretty often catch myself using phrases they taught me, repeating their words and passing on their wisdom. I have come full circle and it is truly a deeply satisfying feeling! During my time at SFCM, I worked at a historic restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf. I was waiting on a table where I noticed a girl who had a Slavic-sounding accent and I remember feeling immediately drawn to her. We ended up striking a conversation and I found out that she played domra in a folk orchestra in Atlanta. This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship with my dear Julia Gladish, my ""soul sister."" I came to visit her in Georgia and auditioned for ABS, and the rest is history! Absolutely. This was a remarkable effort between multiple parties involved. I had a chance to co-produce a performance of this opera in NY and connect the Commonwealth Lyric Threater in Boston with Zorepad Ukrainian Dance Ensemble and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America in New York. These organizations came together, united by a mutual interest to spread awareness of the political unrest in Ukraine and to introduce American audiences to this brilliant comedic operatic masterpiece. My husband and I once again played opposite each other ( we already sang Snowmaiden and Mizgir, Marcello and Musetta, and enjoyed challenging each onstage and off ), and this time we portrayed an old married couple Odarka and Karas, and all sorts of mischief ensued. Kevin was a ridiculously talented improviser, due to his natural wit and charisma. He also managed to practice his Ukrainian to the point where people came up to see him after the show and started speaking Ukrainian to him, assuming he was a native speaker. It meant so much to me that a piece of our culture was represented and shared in such a flattering, authentic and beautiful way. It was important for us to show that Ukraine is so much more than war which is what we see and hear on the news nowadays. And yes, we aimed to demonstrate, first and foremost, that Ukraine is a nation with its own unique heritage, ancient  traditions, fantastic music and dance.  I will forever cherish the memory of this meaningful and special project in my heart. I must say, I always wanted to be a performer and never thought I would enjoy teaching. These days, not only do I deeply enjoy working with my students... I feel that I am constantly learning from them! It is truly such a beautiful thing, to be able to do what I love and to pass on my knowledge of the industry, tricks of the trade and, of course, vocal technique to my ""kids."" I sometimes feel that it shouldn't be allowed to have as much fun at work! Yes, you give a lot as a teacher but you also receive so much... The students I work with inspire me constantly by their enthusiasm, desire to learn and genuine commitment to this art form. I also teach younger children, ages 6 to 18, at a private studio who receive piano and vocal instruction; and I am a music director at the Capital District School of Ukrainian Studies here in Upstate NY. I love seeing little performers dipping their toes into being onstage and falling in love with music. It was such a ""homecoming"" for me, in so many ways, both as an artist and as an individual. Growing up, I used to see shows all the time with my grandmother at The National Operetta Theater ( she was a huge operetta fan ). I remember imagining that perhaps someday I could be up there, on that magical stage with the actors and actresses who seemed to me the epitome of grace and allure. When I got an invitation to sing Rosalinda in Die Fledermaus at this very theater, on that coveted stage, I felt that this was a dream come true. Moreover, a renowned singer I used to watch perform on that very stage in my younger days, Tamara Timoshko-Goryushko, was now going to be my stage director in this production! It was the highlight of my career, to be able to realize this childhood dream and to become a part of such a great cast. Everyone was extremely welcoming and supportive, and we had a standing ovation at the end. I cried. The joy was overwhelming. These are the moments I live for. It felt so amazing to return to the place I came from and to have my teachers be proud of me. I really wanted to move people, to make them laugh, to touch their hearts. I managed to do that, with the help of an extraordinary team. To receive such a noteworthy acknowledgement and invitation from my Alma Mater, Gliere, was an unbelievable honor to me. Unfortunately, I could not perform at the 150th anniversary and had to decline, as my husband was diagnosed with advanced cancer at that time, and I had to cancel a lot of contracts to be able to stay with him and take care of him. However, I taught a masterclass at Gliere when I sang at the National Theater. It mostly revolved around the business aspect of a career in the performing arts, expectations, structure, finding an agent, discovering proper repertoire for one's fach/voice type, marketing etc. To answer the question, yes, absolutely - it is very important for me to never lose myself and remember where I came from. No matter where in the world my journey as a performer might take me, my heart is always with my homeland, and the desire to give back gets only stronger with each passing year. (Question: What is ""fach"" or is that a typo?) 11.  I believe you have been working hard on arrangements for a memorial concert in New York City for your extraordinary partner in life and art, a renowned opera singer Kevin Kees, whom you tragically lost to cancer a year ago.  What are some of the ways you are trying to keep his legacy alive? This past October marked one year since Kevin left this world. Kevin was the love of my life, in every sense of the word. I feel that I am truly now "" broken open"", and the love I used to withhold from the world, even if subconsciously,  is now freely pouring out of my wounded but grateful heart. To my astonishment, I discovered it is through pain of loss we discover the joy of living. Kevin taught me to live my life to the fullest, to be present in the moment, to be joyful. He was a force of nature, an artist in a class of his own, a caring and inspiring teacher. Our colleagues in the opera industry dedicated numerous performances to his memory, such as Ailyn Perez at La Scala, Franco Pomponi at the National Finnish Opera, Lidiya Yankovskaya at Chicago Opera Theater, Tamara Kalinkina at National Opera of Ukraine and Teatro de Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil and many others. Nashville Opera created a fund in Kevin's memory which allows twenty thousand children to be introduced to opera through their Opera To Go community outreach program. We are planning to hold a memorial concert and celebration of life for Kevin at the Weil Hall at Carnegie Hall in NYC, at a date to be announced. My friends and I are also in the process of establishing a voice competition in Kevin's memory which will focus on giving an opportunity to young baritones to be heard and encouraged. Kevin's beloved voice teacher and mentor Carl Lawrenz, kindly agreed to be on the judge panel. Kevin continues to live through his work, through his devoted students, through the undeniable impact he had on people, in our hearts and minds through the many seeds he there has planted. Just like a shooting star, Kevin left a trail of magic behind him during his short but amazing lifetime here on Earth. His legacy continues, never forgotten, impossible to ignore. He hardly needs my help. But, meanwhile, I will miss him with every beat of my heart. ""Songs of the Heart"" CD is dedicated to Kevin and his memory."
20,The Art of Choosing Glass for Your Custom Frame,arts-entertainment," ""You don’t look different, but you have changed. I’m looking through you, you’re not the same."" When deciding to display a photo or custom framed work of art in San Diego, aside from the choice of where to hang it, there are a few things you may want to consider. One consideration is which type of glass should I use? I know. I know. What’s to decide? It’s just glass, right? I hate to break it to you, although all men are created equal, custom framing with glass is not. Is plastic that fantastic? Although technically not glass, acrylic or plexiglass are other options. The pros to using these options include lighter weight, harder to break and can be purchased in regular, non-glare and conservation options. The bad news is, acrylic and plexiglass can be easily scratched, they're more expensive than glass, and they must be cleaned with a soft cloth and Plexiglass cleaner. Windex is a no, no. Walmart isn’t an art store One of your first options for glass is clear glass. I’ll answer the question you’re thinking. Yes, almost all picture glass is clear. However, when offered ""clear glass,"" It’s a nice way to say cheap and thin. Most frames found at inexpensive department stores have clear glass due to its low cost. The drawbacks to using clear glass are the horrible glare and there's zero UV protection. We know how much you love that lovey bright red Pollock print you have hanging in a place of honor over the couch. With clear glass, unless you live in a cave, it will soon be Pepto Bismol pink… if you’re lucky. The spirit of transparency A small upgrade is what’s referred to as conservation clear. With plenty of UV protection, you won’t have the pink Pollock. Of course, the glare would still be an issue. Maybe you wear sunglasses or just hang it up at night. Conservation clear would be good for your children's yearly school photos or prints clipped from a travel magazine. You can clearly see the difference Anti-reflective glass is also a thing. No, really. It’s the Invisible Man of glass. If you like the ""no glass"" look, it’s the way to go. Oh, wait. Like cheap sunglasses there’s no UV protection. So, if you’re ‘fraid of the fade, look elsewhere. The drawbacks to anti-reflective glass is it’s heavy, scratches easily, may distort the image, and you'll constantly see fingerprints from people trying to figure out if its glass or not. Hello, Tesla If you’re one of those people who only buys the best, say hello to the Tesla of picture protection, museum glass. This baby is loaded with custom features. It comes standard with an anti-reflective coating and plenty of UV protection. Let’s be clear about this When you’re ready to frame, seeing a professional will save time and frustration. A pro can explain all your options, stay within your price range and guarantee the work. You want the final result will be something you'll be proud to hang on the wall."

1,Are You Being Thoughtfully Framed?,arts-entertainment," ""Art consists of limitation. The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame."" Custom Frame like an Egyptian in San Diego The framing art has been around since Nero fiddled with Rome, somewhere between A.D. 50 to 70. To that point, a beautifully preserved, wood-framed portrait was discovered in an Egyptian tomb. I guess you could say besides the adept art of stacking giant stones, the Egyptians gave us a way to display art that remains fundamentally unchanged for well over one thousand years. To frame or not to frame Collectors of fine art, and artist themselves, understand how important framing is. A poorly framed photograph or painting can diminish, or worse, detract from the beauty the artist intended. Plastic, metal or wood, oh my Prefabricated picture frames come in a variety of sizes and materials and can range in price from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars. If budget is a consideration, you may find the cheaper materials affordable, but underwhelming. Bobby, Felicia or Mona Lisa Is this a professional photo, an iPhone shot, or are these pictures that might be replaced periodically, such as children’s graduation photos or family vacations? If the answer is yes, then DIY framing may do the trick. However, if it’s something you cherish and plan on handing down, consider bringing your masterpiece to an expert. Does matting matter? There are many choices to mats, like color, shapes, texture, and visual impact. You may feel the mat may detract from the art, but aside from its visual impact, matting serves more practice purposes. Prints, due to moisture, can sometimes stick to the glass causing a transfer of color or image. Suddenly your numbered print is devalued due to damage. The mat provides space for air to circulate between the glass and the image. Mats also keep the artwork or photo flat, hide any material used to keep the art in place, and allow the work to be handled without damage. Is a pro the way to go? Maybe a better question to ask is: how much does this work mean to you? Perhaps you're framing a personal photo or pictures taken by a professional photographer and these hold sentimental value. Will the historical photographic timeline of your family be passed from generation to generation? Then it would be wise to visit a professional framer to ensure years of enjoyment. Picasso a frame for me It is definitely wise to professionally frame numbered prints, original watercolors, oils or any work of art that was bought as an investment. Preserving the beauty and condition of your pieces in their original condition is not only prudent, but essential. Knowledge is king Another benefit to hiring a professional is they'll have the latest knowledge on framing. Their expertise includes knowing which materials to use (and more importantly, not use), and principles of shape, color and design. These are the pros best able to advise you in choosing a framing style that will compliment your art. Custom framers in San Diego have specific skills and access to materials not widely available to department stores, home goods outlets or the general public, including special tools and techniques. A hands-on approach will ensure a quality job and customer satisfaction. Bottom line is, your investment in art or family heirloom needs preservation and protection, which professional framers can handle. Your art deserves to be treasured for years to come."
2,Art And Social Distancing,arts-entertainment," In these days of pandemics, natural disasters, and stress, worry and fear about family, friends and work, we all need a respite, a break. Something positive and uplifting – and quick – to take our mind off our problems – if only for a few moments. In today’s society, and especially in turbulent times, we need something to instantly make us feel better, naturally. That’s what one Los Angeles artist, Andrew Lawrence, provides. Through his  Cool Color Art Weekly publication, he sends one of his fabulous colorful photographic images directly to his subscribers’ email inbox, every week. To uplift the heart. To feed your soul. Art to replenish you, revitalize you and refocus you in a positive way. He provides what he calls art for the heart, sustenance for the soul. Art is not just beauty. It can also be an emotional expression, a spiritual stimulation. And Andrew creates his art images and then uses them to help people improve their lives, to momentarily set aside the perils and pitfalls of daily life, to suspend fear and worry and stress. To connect you to the spiritual universe. To enjoy life. Art is universal, undying and unique and has existed since the dawn of time. Art is a human expression and can take many forms. It can appeal to one or more of our five senses. And can also appeal to the sixth sense, spirituality. Andrew’s art appeals to the sense of sight and stimulates you through the use of bright beautiful colors.  As an artist, he ""takes objects in his environment and turns them into bright colorful images that evoke positive emotions, bright colors that evoke beauty and uplift the spirit. Many of his images look more like paintings than photographs."" Why would people want an art image sent to their inbox every week? Because it’s easy, it’s fast and you don’t have to go anywhere or do anything except open your email. And it provides automatic social distancing. Many businesses are now closed.

And you don't have to go to an art exhibit, or an art gallery, or an art fair, or a museum to look at art (you could, of course, it’s a different experience but with the current pandemic, closures, or traffic or time or expense, it’s often a lot of work or planning. Or not allowed due to social distancing or Stay At Home orders).  As an alternative to exposing yourself to germs and viruses from other people or surfaces, you can have beautiful colorful art images delivered right to your inbox, for your own private viewing.

3,Some Of The Things To Consider When Choosing A Wedding Photographer,arts-entertainment," When it comes to wedding photography, some 91% of couples choose to hire the services of a professional photographer, while 8% will choose an amateur – relative or family friend. The other 1% don’t bother with wedding photographs at all, perhaps just having a quick ceremony at the register office and then all heading for the pub afterwards. Some people believe that, as long as you have a good camera, anybody can take wedding photos, and it’s true. You could even take wedding photos with a phone, but you probably won’t get many that are worth keeping in the album. Professional wedding photographers spend years honing their skills so that they can produce a stunning set of photos every time. One thing that many couples want is a photographer who can help them to keep calm. When you are the centre of attention for the day, having someone taking photos of you can be stressful because there is always that doubt at the back of your mind. Maybe your tie isn’t quite straight, or maybe that necklace isn’t showing as it should? A photographer who is not only great at taking pictures but has a relaxed and friendly approach can be a great asset on such a big day. This is why you need to meet with your chosen photographer before the day itself and have a friendly chat so that you can get to know each other. A good wedding photographer will also want to see the venue in order to plan ahead. Many couples want a mix of posed pictures and candid wedding photography in Hertfordshire or any other county. The word ""candid"" is described by the dictionary as ""truthful"" and ""frank"". Candid photography is those photos which are taken with the subject often being unaware that it is happening. The photographer will mingle with the guests and use his training and instincts to spot something unusual or something that looks as though it may happen and be ready to take the shot when it does. This gives the photograph a natural and relaxed look. Technology plays a more important part in wedding photographs today. Some photographers are now using a drone to take aerial shots, and these can make a huge difference to the wedding album. Taking photographs with a drone is yet another skill that has to be learned – first of all how to fly the drone, and secondly how to use it to get the best shots. The photographer will also have to be licenced by the Civil Aviation Authority to pilot a drone and will need to have insurance cover as well. Something to consider is the cost of hiring a wedding photographer for the day, which is why some couples cut corners and have their Uncle Jeffrey take the photos. However, the vast majority of couples would rather not take any risks: after all it is a day that is never going to be repeated. Even so, you may wonder why a professional quotes you a price that may be greater than you were expecting. To begin with, the photographer should meet with you before the day itself and will also want to travel to inspect the venue, so there is time involved there just to begin with. On the actual day itself, he may be with you for as much as 12 hours – which is a long working day in anybody’s language. But it is not just that. After the day there is a lot of work to be done on editing images and adding any necessary effects. Any minor imperfections have to be edited out, and all of this takes much longer than being present on the day itself. Then, of course, there is the cost of all the necessary equipment which runs into many thousand of pounds. Cameras and lenses and other equipment has to be kept up to date, and USB’s and hard drives purchased. A DRI Mavic 2 Zoom 4K Drone costs about £1,100 as well. Then all the costs of learning to fly the drone and how to get the best shots with it has to be factored in, along with courses and workshops which the photographer will attend in order to keep up to date with the latest trends and advances in photography. So, as you can see, there is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes than there ever is on your big day itself."
4,Top 5 High School Romance Anime Every Otaku Must See,arts-entertainment," Ah, high school—a place where budding hormones float through the air, as we all navigate our way through adolescence. Seeing as high school is where most people experience their first love or crush, it’s the perfect backdrop for anime love stories. Those of us who watch high school romance anime likely do so for the same reason, to experience moments of nostalgia that remind us of our first experiences with love. The romance anime on this list will surely do just that and are guaranteed to tug at your heartstrings. I Want to Eat Your Pancreas is honest and thought-provoking, things that all anime about death should strive to be. This anime film follows a quiet male protagonist whose name isn’t revealed until the end of the film. As a self-proclaimed social recluse, he tries to shut himself out from the rest of the world as he attends his classes. One day he finds a diary titled ""living with dying,"" on the floor of a hospital waiting room. Upon picking it up, he meets Sakura, a girl in his class who has a chronic pancreatic disease. Afraid that her friends will treat her differently, she confides the secret of her illness to him and only him. While films about dying girls are becoming rather cliche, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas still manages to be both heartfelt and heart wrenching. While films about dying girls are becoming rather cliche, I Want to Eat Your Pancreas still manages to be both heartfelt and heart wrenching. Sakura isn’t perfect, and her actions reflect someone who is lost and scared, yet trying to put on a brave face and keep herself together. The film isn’t without its faults. The ending is a bit rushed and poorly executed. However, I was surprised by how real and tangible the characters were, despite the cliche plot. I Want to Eat Your Pancreas is reminiscent of both Your Lie in April and Nicolas Sparks’ A Walk to Remember. If you want a good cry, give this film a go. Genres: drama, romance, tragedy Available on: Blu-ray Many high school romance titles employ common tropes or similar formulas, but ReLife uniquely approaches the genre. Elements of science fiction, slice-of-life, and romance combine to create this polished and fast-paced adventure. The anime follows Kaizaki, a 27-year-old part-timer at a convenience store who was bullied out of his previous job after standing up for a female coworker. Embarrassed by his current situation, he lies to his friends and parents and fails at getting a new job. Since he is technically 10 years older than his classmates, falling in love is out of the question. One day, Kaizaki is approached by a businessman who offers to refer him to a list of well-established companies. However, he first has to prove his worth by participating in the ReLife experiment and relive one year of high school. To do this, he’s given an experimental drug that reverts his body to its 17-year-old state. Throughout the experiment, he must do well in his studies, help the people around him, and realize his self-worth. Since he is technically 10 years older than his classmates, falling in love is out of the question. More importantly, after the year is over he will be wiped from his classmates’ memories. This turns out to be a bit heartbreaking, as Kaizaki finds himself forming strong bonds with his classmates, including a socially inept girl named Hishiro, who he vows to help make friends. Genres: comedy, romance, sci-fi Available on: DVD and Blu-ray If you’re a sucker for stories about blind love and enjoy powerful female leads, then Toradora is the perfect anime for you. Silly moments and a great sense of humor are part of its charm, but it still has heartfelt scenes that will hit you right in the feels. Toradora follows Takasu and Taiga, two classmates who happen to live in adjacent apartments. The two meet when Taiga accidentally puts a love letter meant for Takasu’s best friend in Takasu’s bag. Coincidentally, Takasu also has a crush on Taiga’s best friend. Thus, the two embark on a quest to help each other pursue their love interests. Little do they know that throughout their adventures, they will create a bond stronger than any high school crush could hope to match. Genres: comedy, romance Available on: DVD, blu-ray, and Amazon Prime Clannad: After Story follows Tomoya and Nagisa as they journey into the perils of adulthood. Technically the second season of the anime, After Story was included because of its down-to-earth plot and mature themes that are rarely seen in anime. While Clannad is a great anime on its own, Clannad: After Story is where things get interesting. After Story features real problems that most couples will eventually face. Challenges such as finding work to support your family, coping with loss, and forgiving neglectful parents. Moreover, the story is deep. It’s not often we get to see a couple go from high school to marriage and then onto having children. That’s not all, though. A small sci-fi twist that you’ll never see coming brings the anime to a perfect close. If you want to have a good cry, turn on After Story and have a box of tissues ready. Genres: comedy, drama, romance, sci-fi Available on: DVD, blu-ray, and Amazon Prime With elements of time travel, love, and parallel worlds, Orange is one of the most heartwarming high school romance anime I’ve ever seen. Based on a manga of the same name, Orange has gained enough positive reviews to warrant a live-action feature film. The anime follows high school student Naho Takamiya, and her quest to prevent the suicide of one of her closest friends. One day, she receives a letter from someone claiming to be herself 10 years in the future. Similar to 13 Reasons Why or the visual novel Root Letter, each letter explains the different reasons behind her friend’s suicide and advice on how to prevent it. Filled with heartbreak, real-world struggles, and mature themes, Orange will keep you engaged throughout all 13 episodes. Genres: drama, romance, sci-fi/fantasy Available on: DVD, blu-ray, and Amazon Prime While all of the above titles are high school romance anime, they all approach the genre with unique and fresh ideas.

6,Gangster Films,arts-entertainment," It's almost 50 years since one of the greatest gangster movies of all time Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) film was released. The film was based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name and depicted the story of the American organized crime family of Sicilian origin. The movie is still one of the highest-ranked films. The word mafia also originally refers to the Sicilian mafia, but its meaning has expanded to refer organized crime groups in time. Even though these criminal organizations call themselves with their own terms like Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra, Yakuza, Bratva, we generally call them Mafia. They operate in hundreds of legal and illegal sectors such as gambling, commerce, drugs, finance, construction, protection racketeering, smuggling, kidnapping, etc. Because of the possibility of earning quick money, this kind of illegal jobs can be attractive for people who mostly come from economically lower classes. Due to the socio-economic origin of people, characters speak slang and foul languages abundantly in mob movies. Sanitized dialogues mostly have seen as aesthetic dishonesty. Characters are very problematic when it comes to relations with women. In Brian de Palma's Scarface (1983), the main character Tony Montana follows these rules: we see a vulgar person and often hear swearings, and his relationship is very problematic. Of course, there are exceptions to that. One of those exceptions can be The Godfather (1972). The leader of the mafia family Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) appears to be a character who emphasizes the importance of being a family, that a man is meant to spend time with his wife and children, and we do not hear any vulgar words and do not see any problems with his wife. Moreover, the Corleone family is a far more high-class crime family. We could not say all these exceptional attitudes are also valid for Michael Corleone who is performed by Al Pacino. What are those top gangster movies? In the US, Arthur Penn’s Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather (1972) had a remarkable effect on the gangster movie genre. Later on, Martin Scorsese filmed  Mean Streets (1973) and also established his reputation.  Goodfellas (1990) is another Scorsese movie based on a true story which is an adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's non-fiction book Wiseguy. Pileggi and Scorsese co-wrote the screenplay of Goodfellas (1990) which stars Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci who won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award with his role Tommy DeVito. The film told the story of mobster Henry Hill and his circle of criminals: his friends and family from 1955 to 1980 in New York City. Additionally, You will see 4 more Martin Scorsese films on this list. In chronological order, they are Casino (1995), Gangs Of New York (2002), The Departed (2006), and The Irishman (2019). The Irishman (2019) is also one of the best gangster movies in 2019 with three and a half hour duration with great actors like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci. It had a limited theatrical release in November 2019, then followed by digital streaming on Netflix starting at the end of November of the year. Scorsese and Robert de Niro came together 9th time for this film. Two people in Hollywood always compared in real life: Alfredo Pacino and Robert De Niro. Both are born in New York City and Italian-American actors. We first saw Al Pacino and Robert de Niro together in The Godfather II (1974). Since that time, this is the fourth movie we can see both of them in the same movie. Also, Guy Ritchie's The Gentlemen (2020) is a noteworthy new gangster film that has a powerful cast like Matthew McConaughey, Collin Farrel, and Hugh Grant. It is worthwhile to mention other great masterpieces of the gangster and mafia movies. Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America (1984) is a four-hour epic tale of Jewish gangsters in New York with an 8.4 IMDb rating.

8,A Couples Guide To Documentary Style Wedding Photography,arts-entertainment," Often coupled with natural and traditional styles, documentary wedding photography is also known as Reportage or Photo-journalistic Wedding Photography. It's a much more informal approach which creates images similar to those editorial features you see in magazines, it can lead to great results, spontaneous moments or thoughtful reflections all adding to the complete story of your day. For me, shooting this kind of work is fun. I basically need to sneak shots and only be seen after taking pictures as they unfold around me. Shots should convey the story of the special day and cover a spectrum of emotions. As a documentary wedding photographer I normally use long lenses taking pictures candidly, mingling in with the other guests so I can't be seen, sniper shots can be gems and give an almost filmatic look and so it should when its one of the biggest events in someone's life you want to look like a superstar. Along with this celebrity status you don't necessary want to be told what to do by a photographer. I use documentary style often as it lends itself to showing expressions naturally. I've found the best times to use this style are as the bride or groom get ready with friends and family, guests as they start to arrive is another good one, anything from unpacking the kids from cars to fixing button holes or wiping a baby's nose they all make great photo opportunities. More importantly they show a side to a wedding the couple may not see as they prepare for the ceremony. Documentary photography is about timing, usually the shots happen in a fraction of a second and shouldn't look contrived. It could be getting changed or the joys of doing some final ironing. Capturing the expression of that very first glimpse of each other at the ceremony or the joy of celebrating with your friends after. Speeches are also prime spots to get fun images which paint a picture not just of the scene but of each personality too. It's better for the flow of an event if I'm shooting in the back ground rather than marching around being a nuisance and blocking views of the other guests. The general chit chat time after the ceremony and just before dinner is when people really start to relax and I'm able to get great documentary style pictures. Speeches are also prime times to get fun images which paint a picture not just of the scene but of each personality. It's better for the flow of an event if I'm shooting in the back ground rather than marching around being a nuisance and blocking views of the other guests at this precious time. Documentary style pictures should take you back to a particular time and show the humankind around you in high emotion. This is one of the few opportunities where all your family and friends are together in one place for one night. Unfortunately the bride and groom can't see it all, good documentary wedding photography should show couples a lot of things they will have missed so its always a winner. That's why I combine documentary wedding photography into my normal everyday working practise. It's a fantastic medium to use if your camera shy or just don't like being told what to do, the beauty of documentary photography is you even don't have to look at the camera. Pictures will portray the real you as opposed to someones who's been ordered to look at a camera, even if that means balling your eyes out in a totally emotional moment, chances are, it will make a great shot."
9,Basics About Hanging Pictures and Framing,arts-entertainment," Too often our posters and art get stuffed under beds and backs of closets instead of up on our walls. For starters, framing art often seems pricey and confusing—a blue mat with a white wood frame or a blue frame with a white mat? And what about glass? And then putting a nail into the wall seems like a serious enough act to just avoid it all together. Before we know it, dozens of Saturday afternoons have rolled by and our walls are still cold and bare. It’s important to remember that expert advice from a neighborhood frame shop can make all the difference between barren or beautiful. There is nothing like walking into a room and instantly feeling a sense of comfort. Mindfully displayed art and pictures on a wall has a great deal to do with the overall atmosphere, as much as wall colors, furnishings and carpet selection. Many times, the addition of art turns out to be the most transformative step of all. Art that leads the eye without dominating a room while still blending with the room and the surrounding architecture. Follow this advice on how to make the most of each display—and how to hang art like a pro. Before picking up a hammer and nail, have all your pictures and art professionally framed. That way, you can design and plot out a map of exactly where pictures will be hung, and how they will look next to each other. If your home or apartment is already furnished, or has specific architectural elements such as a fireplace, archway, or book cove, first have someone hold the custom framed art while you look at it from a distance. Sit and stand in different areas of the room and judge for yourself what feels right and balanced. People have the tendency to hang pictures too high which makes them dominate the room. When in doubt, hang pictures lower so they balance and blend well with their surroundings. This is especially important when hanging art where there is no other furnishings or architecture to line up with, like a staircase that goes up and down. It is suggested to measure 58"" to 60"" from the floor to the bottom of the picture, mark off lightly with a pencil or paint tape. Two inches between pictures is a good rule of thumb. Don’t forget to run a level on top when you’re done, to double-check that they are perfectly straight. Lay out your art on the floor beneath the wall first and play around. Don’t be afraid to experiment and get creative before hanging by grouping images together in an irregular shape, with colors that compliment each other but may not match. Try not to line up the top of each picture, or line up the picture top with furniture. To translate the pieces to the wall, measure the full height and width of each, and then mark off those outermost points on the wall using painter’s tape. From there, start hanging. Remember, imperfection is more than okay; it can be fun! Even if the golden number for spacing between works is two inches, there’s no need to be too rigid. If you make a mistake, keep a can of Spackle or toothpaste handy and don’t sweat it. Fill up that hole, and keep going."
10,Why Is Custom Framing More Expensive?,arts-entertainment," A custom frame around a piece of original art, communicates to the world that you value craftmanship and that you can afford the extra cost attached to it. Reaching a point in life when art becomes more of a priority and obtaining a point of financial success, both point to creating atmospheres that reflect your hard work. There is something about beautifully hanging visual art behind a frame and glass (as opposed to using thumbtacks or nails) that simply feels more legitimate. Walmart vs La Mesa Frame Shop Why does an 8 x 10 frame at Walmart cost $15, but a custom 8 x 10 frame from a neighborhood La Mesa frame shop costs closer to $40? Then there are the online options to consider like Framebridge or Simply Framed which offer cost-effective fixed pricing. Very tempting and confusing at the same time. How can these companies offer the same price for a variety of different-sized pieces, but your local framer can’t? For those who have finally reached the grown-up phase of life and are ready to invest in framing, the process can seem baffling. However, the perception that custom framing is too pricey is also a symptom of a different reality for those that have not quite reached the pinnacle of their careers: Millennial consumers — long past their poster-hanging days — have less money than previous generations. Young adults are decorating homes and apartments with more budget-friendly art. And while the price of prints may have dropped, the price of frames has not, leaving shoppers to wonder if they should invest in a frame that costs a bit more. Picture Framing Facts Let’s try to demystify some of the confusion about framing. It’s true that over the past several years, the mom-and-pop framing industry has declined due to heightened competition from online retailers, toy and hobby stores and big-box retailers. These operations also offer a variety of other services and competitively priced products as well as the added convenience of shopping from a digital device. Other less attractive facts are: • Currently there are 9,000 local frame shops in the United States • Millennial consumers have less money to spend on frames than previous generations • Online stores only offer acrylic glazing glass • Hobby shops cut corners by buying bulk product • The fewer the options, the lower the price Your local, neighborhood custom framer offers a wide variety of materials and in-person expertise which results in a one-of-a-kind piece of art. This expertise can be invaluable especially when framing older or long forgotten heirlooms. A story about a mom with her son’s Jimi Hendrix poster is a good example. The poster had been signed by all the band members but had been under her son’s bed for years, and she wanted to frame it for him as a surprise. She was looking for the cheapest route, but after the framer took one look at the poster in hand, he told her, ""Don’t be the mom who threw away the baseball cards."" The poster is deserving of the highest quality frame that will preserve the value of the poster for generations. Someone online probably wouldn’t have the same eye for collectibles or art as a local framer. They are highly trained professionals that offer honest guidance about what you are framing and the best options for what to frame it in."
11,Twisted a.k.a. Psycho ex-girlfriend FIlm Review,arts-entertainment," Twisted is a short thriller that instantly hooks the audience. Featuring many compelling characters, we follow them on this frivolous journey facing love, angst and suspense. The following synopsis captures the story perfectly: ""Kara has become her boyfriend Tyler's rock, getting him back on his feet after a turbulent time in his life. They're planning on getting married and everything is perfect until Tyler's ex-girlfriend Isabelle returns from rehab and wants to get her life back - starting with Tyler. Kara is immediately threatened by Isabelle who is everything Kara's not - sexy, daring and outspoken. To Kara's shock, Isabelle begins injecting herself into Tyler's life and Kara fears that he may fall back into his bad habits. As Kara's world starts to crumble, she notices that Isabelle may be behind the violent threats against her. What starts off as one woman's desire to hold on to her fiancé and the life they've built together, turns into a twisted game of cat and mouse, as Kara tries to survive the jealous wrath of the ""evil"" ex-girlfriend."" Twisted showcases two very prevalent themes: Facade and revenge. The former is essentially the foundation of the story; it gradually becomes unraveled, and by the resolution of the film, collapses. Furthermore, a series of camera angles are showcased throughout the film, all of which make the scenes even more powerful. Laika Lalonde, portraying the character Laura Fisher, has shown off amazing acting talents that should not go unnoticed. Laura is a character, forced to slowly unravel as the impending pressure of an abusive relationship begins getting to her. Ultimately, it is inspirational to see her blossom and grow more confident. When asked how she prepared for the role, Lalonde enthusiastically provided her input: ""Playing a character in this kind of relationship is definitely a challenge,"" she remarks. ""I made sure to work closely with the Director to embody all those strong emotions."" Lalonde’s character partners up with the protagonist, Kara. The contrast between these two actors is amazing to follow. The raw emotion Laura shows as she confides with her counterpart is genuine and heartbreaking. Every single scene shows the audience another part of Laura; as we uncover her burdens and past, we finally get to see her become the strong and beautiful woman she is. In conclusion, Twisted is a fantastic movie that absolutely deserves the ‘Finalist for Best TV Movie - C21 International Drama Awards (2018) title. The plot progressives nicely, with conflicts for the characters arising every twist and turn. In addition, the movie perfectly captures the issues and insecurities of our modern society, especially those that many of us may not acknowledge."

13,Go-Karting Tips and Tricks to Help You Become a Better Racer,arts-entertainment," Whether you are just getting into go-karting for the first time, or you have a few years of experience under your belt, it’s always a good idea to be familiar with the tips, tricks, and techniques that will help you become a better racer. As one of the most accessible motorsports in the world, when it comes to go-karting, your age and skill level doesn’t matter. Anyone who puts in enough time and effort on the track can become a force to be reckoned with. Does that sound appealing to do so? If so, you’re in the right place. By putting these helpful hints into practice you will be more competitive on the track, produce faster lap times, and claim the top spot on the podium. Ready? Let’s get started. Get to Know the Track The key to becoming a faster and more consistent racer is to be familiar with the track. And the best way to do that is to gain real-world experience on the track itself. Book in a session where you only do practice laps around the track. For the first few laps drive at a pace that is comfortable for you. After a few laps you will gradually learn where every twist, bend, and corner is located. From there, you will start to feel more confident and perhaps have the desire to push the pedal down more too. Another great tip is to watch more experienced people drive around the track. Watch how they approach and exit each corner, where they brake, and take note of their general driving style. You can then implement their techniques into your own practice sessions to become faster. Learn the Racing Line In the world of motorsport, the racing line is the most optimal and fastest route to take around a track. Every track has their own unique racing line. And each one is made up of a combination of the following techniques: •	Use the entire width of the track •	Know when to brake (the braking point) before you approach a corner •	Hit the apex for each corner •	Maximise your exit speed Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with some of these terms. We’re going to break down each individual step. So that you have a better idea as to what’s involved in learning the racing line. Use the Entire Track On a race course, the white lines and the kerb define the track limits in which you are allowed to drive. To get the fastest possible lap times, you must take advantage of the entire track. When you approach a corner do so from the ‘outside’ (for example, when approaching a left corner, you would enter from the right hand side), and then drive into the corner to hit the apex. By using every centimetre of the track available to you, you’ll be able to carry more speed through each corner – resulting in a faster pace overall. Know Your Braking Points When you approach a corner, do so in a straight line and apply the brakes before you start turning. By braking at the correct time you will drive slow enough to clip the apex. Brake too late, and you risk taking the corner too wide. Brake too early, and you will have to accelerate mid-corner. Either way, this will reduce your lap times. Sometimes you don’t have to apply the brakes but instead lay off the accelerator a bit before you take a corner. In this case, apply the same logic as you would to using the brakes. Having trouble finding your braking points? Use a particular landmark as a point of reference. For example, a light post or the red and white racing curbs. This will help you hit your braking points more consistently. Hit the Apex The apex is the point at which you are closest to the inside of the corner. Once you hit the apex, you can then straighten out the kart and increase the throttle as you leave the corner. The sooner you can increase the throttle the faster you will be on the straight ahead. This is what’s known as maximising your ‘exit speed’ on a corner. More Go-Karting Tips and Tricks •	Don’t Lean Into a Corner Some beginners have a tendency to lean their body to one side as they take a corner. Try to avoid doing this. Why? Because you are shifting all of your weight to the inside of the wheels. As a result, you make it harder to straighten up after you complete the turn. •	Use One Pedal at a Time Be sure to use one foot for each pedal at a time. So the left foot for the brake, and the right foot for the accelerator. If you apply both pedals at the same time, you will lock up the wheels and spin out. •	Be Aware of Other Drivers In a race you will be paired up with racers of different skill levels and abilities. If you get stuck behind a slower driver, give them enough space and wait for the right opportunity to overtake. If you’re in a race with faster drivers, stick to your racing line and – if they are respectful – they should know when to overtake you without the risk of causing a crash."

15,3 Benefits of Custom Framing,arts-entertainment," Many people have no idea what to expect when they walk into their local La Mesa frame shop. Custom framing can be an overwhelming prospect for anyone – especially those who don’t have much experience with it. But don’t panic, because your local custom framer is an expert! Keep in mind that custom framing is another form of art, therefore, a true artist should be the one assisting you with the process. Not only can they help you pick the perfect mat and frame design for your artwork; they also know the best way to protect it and all within your desired budget. Whether you’re an artist, art collector, or just looking to get your precious memorabilia beautifully framed, there are several more benefits you should be aware of. Before walking into your local frame shop, get acquainted with the custom framing process first. Try Before You Buy Ever bought a pair of shoes online that looked great in the picture, but cheesy on you? It’s kind of the same idea. Bringing your artwork into a local shop assures you will get exactly what you want. The framer also needs to measure the artwork in a specific way, even if you’ve already measured it yourself. Besides, a photo will never do the real thing justice. You’ll be surprised at all the nuances in colors, patterns, and textures of the frames and mats – and you’ll be glad you can see how they look with your art before you make an investment. A good framer will have a large variety to choose from but will also be an expert at narrowing it down to the best choice. You get to work together at creating the perfect piece of art. Remember, your custom framed project will probably outlast your couch, your car, and possibly even your home. If your piece is really valuable, or you’re worried about it getting damaged in transit, call the frame shop and describe the situation. Get their advice on how best to protect your art when you bring it in, or some shops offer pickup and delivery. Depending on what it is, there will be a variety of precautions they can recommend. More Than Picture Frames Many custom frame shops offer the ability to frame just about anything you can imagine. They are artisans with experience and can visualize something that goes beyond a square. From framing a special medal or a valuable coin collection to making your favorite Beatles poster look it’s best. Shadow boxes are also a beautiful way to show off a collection or memorabilia of family treasures. They can be several inches deep to house needlework, sports jerseys, jewelry, or even sports equipment and instruments. Some people transform their shadow boxes into table tops as a focal point in a room. Your cherished framed photographs will last for generations when they are carefully and thoughtfully matted and framed. Creating a special design and unique display to show off your treasured heirloom photos is well worth the investment. Preservation Two-dimensional art like watercolor, pastel, ink, charcoal and colored pencil need to be displayed under glass to protect them. Shops offer guidance with the selection of several types of UV protective glass as well as plexiglass which will help keep your art protected. Art may be matted to enhance the look, or spacers can be used if you want the full piece to show as in a poster. Because of the nature of oil and acrylic paintings having texture, a shop can advise that they be framed without glass. This allows the art to be dusted gently (without any cleaning products) to keep it safe from contaminants in the environment. Did you know that art should never touch the glass that it is framed under? This can deteriorate it over time or make the art stick to the glass like glue. Having the ""breathing room"" between the art and glass allows for condensation and also for expansion and contraction resulting from temperature changes. Trust the Process Even if you know exactly what you want going in, you may be presented with great options that you hadn’t thought of before. Further, framing experts at your local frame shop will make recommendations based on successful design concepts they have already experienced. If you have a specific vision for your artwork, you don’t have to give it up – but try to be open-minded too."
16,Custom Framing Enhances Your Work Space,arts-entertainment," Maybe you're the office manager for a corporation or the secretary at a small business and have been put in charge of decorating the office. How lucky is that! Or, maybe you're a home-based business and have less space to work with but want something that expresses your personality. No matter the situation, you want an office to reflect the brand of the company, make visitors feel welcomed, and inspire everyone working there to do their best work. A beautiful work space is paramount in providing an immediate visual invitation to get to know you and the brand better. No matter what the situation, we have put together some ideas and food for thought for making your office space look and feel its best, regardless of the size. Corporate and Small Business For custom framed artwork and inspiration on the walls where colleagues and the public frequent, a company's own branding can be a goldmine. It’s just smart marketing to use your own design resources to create framed posters that look professional while communicating the company's culture and core values. Prominently framing a well-designed logo is a good place to start, but also consider displaying employee achievements. If your company or an employee has won an award or been recognized in another way, then why not remind everyone of that? Having a certificate or positive newspaper article custom framed is a great way to display these achievements and continue to inspire greatness and a sense of pride from your staff. Personalizing the work environment with color and warmth demonstrates a caring gesture to the people that work there. Without a conscious awareness, people in your office could have their spirits boosted just from being surrounded by color and stimulating framed artwork. Staring at a fabulous piece of art on the wall can spark imagination and inspire greatness and creativity in you and your team. Inspirational quotes are also a powerful motivator because what people meditate on is essentially what they become. Home Office The beauty of a home office is you get the freedom to sprinkle a lot more of your personality into the mix, unlike a shared corporate space. In a home office, the decor should be all about what makes you feel comfortable, productive and inspired. And with more and more of us working from home, it’s essential that our home office space is as productive as possible –this can be quite a challenge when working within a small space. Keep in mind that decorating a wall with pictures is a relatively easy, cost-effective option for the benefits in increased productivity you'll reap in return. Go ahead and frame your logo but consider pushing the boundaries with more creative expressions on the wall such as a shadow box or backless frame. Framed typography, minimalist line drawing prints, or your children’s art are all original and inspiring. Other ideas are a large mat surrounding a small image. Keep in mind that picture framing should always compliment the imagery, award, or artwork that is displayed. Frames that are not cohesive detract from the beauty and steal the show from your special piece you are wishing to showcase. Try to keep it original and convey and reflect your unique personality. The custom frame needs to accentuate the art in a way that acts as the stage to a standing ovation. Custom framing doesn’t have to be just for the walls. You can frame photos to place on surfaces like your desk, with a stylish stand to prop them up. You can place your own custom framed photos on your desk of friends, family, a holiday, or just a picture or piece of art that you admire.

18,Support the Arts and Make Money: Invest in Art,arts-entertainment," There are many things one can invest in. Art is one of them. Think about it. Art. Unlike many typical investments, like stocks and bonds, you can actually hang this investment on the wall and enjoy it for a lifetime. It doesn't have to be far far away, or intangible, or never seen. Art can be a beautiful investment, literally. And you get to see it and enjoy it every day. In art, there are a number of possible categories to invest in. Major genres include paintings, drawings, photography, the list goes on. There are also many investment levels available in art. From the multi-million-dollar collector/museum masterpieces to your local emerging or established street artist. If you have a lot of money to invest in art, there are many professionals who can help you do that. If you have a relatively small or normal amount of investable funds you may have to do it yourself. Here are some tips. Get in early Artists start off as potential emerging artists. Then, if they succeed, and emerge, they are known as established artists. Then, if they succeed wildly, they are known as famous artists or masters. Imagine purchasing an early photograph of Ansel Adams before he became established and famous. Or purchasing an early Andy Warhol when he was still an unknown graphic artist. And alive. Imagine if you bought the work of those artists early on, in or before the emerging stage of their careers. In the current market, Ansel Adams original photos can sell at up to $25,000-$70,000. Some of the signed Andy Warhol's can go for well over a million dollars. Some emerging artists today are destined to be tomorrow's Ansel Adams or an Andy Warhol. Or maybe they will become ""just"" an established artist whose work brings a substantial amount of money. And a nice return on your investment. Artists. Find one. Find them early. And invest. Starting What's a good way to start investing in emerging artists? The traditional way is to find an artist whose work you like and buy a painting, or a photo. Or two. Or more. Make sure the work is signed by the artist and authentic. If possible, buy the art directly from the artist, or their agent or reputable gallery. Then, enjoy the art. Hang it on the wall of your home or business. See examples here: https://fabulousfashionphotos.blogspot.com/ Or, if you buy several, or many, works of art, put the ones you don't hang away in a safe environmentally protected storage facility. You can also rotate the art from wall to storage and vice versa, as often as you like, adding even more ongoing enjoyment. Increase the value And then, once you own the art, perhaps you could promote the artist. You could promote the artist via your social media, your friends and family and your other contacts, etc. If you do this be sure to mention that you own art from this artist. You could create buzz. Create demand for the artist's work. You could tell everyone about the artist and their work! And, hopefully, watch the value of the artist's art you own go up. Investing in art. Not only will you be supporting the arts, and enjoying it on the wall, you may also be making a good investment! As with any investment, experts advise only using excess money you don't immediately need, be it a few hundred dollars, a few thousand or a few million. And, with riskier investments, money you can afford to lose. There are many things to invest in. Art is one of them. An artistic enjoyable investment. Invest and enjoy!"
19,Joker (2019): an affresco of madness,arts-entertainment," I went into the cinema to watch Joker by Todd Phillips without knowing much about either the movie and the character: I had watched the previous rendition of it of Heath Ledger and the older one of Jack Nicholson, both quite different, but I had never read the comic books, nor watched any of the previous movies of the director. I was mostly a blank page on which the movie would write on, and I urge you to go watching it as close as possible as this state. That’s because the movie lends itself to multiple interpretations, multiple finales and even multiple meanings of the whole plot. Not even that is sure with Joker. The least you expect from the movie, the more particulars you will be able to catch while watching it. I took a good 48 hours after the first watch to put order on all the scenes and come up with a proper review. I’ll first speak, briefly, of the technical aspects of the movie: cinematography is stunning, with plenty of ""wallpaper-perfect"" shots and a gritty depiction of Gotham City, heavily inspired by 70s New York. Joaquin Phoenix‘s acting is worth alone the cost of the ticket, taking charge of the movie from the beginning till the last seconds, with a deep, convincing rendition of the character that will make you overcome the slow moments (there are a few). Take the movie as a psychological drama about the Joker and it won’t feel as slow as some viewers lamented. With that aside, let’s move to what the movie means/meant to me. Spoilers from now, you’ve been warned. Joker’s Plot: a Clockwork Orange for our era The plot itself is pretty much straightforward, even minimal: the Joker, Arthur Fleck, is a middle-aged man that has been trying to become a comedian since ever, ever failing, ever more delusional about his capabilities of making people laugh. Through a series of events, he becomes even more delusional, more embittered and progressively descending into ""evil"" as the movie progresses, to the end where he embodies perfectly the Joker character, a madly laughing, killing psychopath. Sounds easy, without possible interpretations. Wrong. It’s far from it. Whereas the guys of A Clockwork Orange were annoyed, middle class people who committed crimes for the fun of it, for the experience and the enjoyment they get out of them, there was never any need for them to be criminals. They chose to, society wasn’t pushing them to, quite the opposite, they simply didn’t want to follow the path their parents would have liked them and went astray, quite astray. Joker is poor. His life is of the lowest quality possible, bordering homelessness. He would have loved to have been part of the society of London in the 60s, behaving well and spreading laughters around him with his jokes. Joker wants to be normal, the A Clockwork Orange guys don’t. The similarities of the 2 movies are instead in the violent critique of society of their times, with one blaming the rigid education of the brits and this one the selfishness, narcissism, and downright meanspiritedness of the society as a whole. Whereas in the Kubrick’s movie the society is somewhat ""good"", notice the quotes, Joker’s is ""bad"", crumbling, everybody scrambling for themselves. Joker would have been a victim of the guys of A Clockwork Orange, not a perpetrator. Yet the movie convincingly brings you to believe how he actually could be also a member of those gangs by the end, in a sublime character arc. Anybody that feared the movie would exalt violence and give reason for young males to be justified in their hate against the world should not fear it. The Joker is not a character to be admired but to be pitied. His descent into the darkness of his own folly is so throughout that he cannot be loved, admired nor even partly justified by the end of the movie. He would laugh at the aversion therapy of A Clockwork Orange. The most mad Joker? He is in fact already mad at the very beginning, just a different type of mad than at the end. I say here ""mad"" in the most wide interpretation of the word possible, as he could be described as anywhere from just shy and delusional to criminally insane. You can take whatever side of the character of the Joker from this movie, you will have plenty of signs both confirming and denying your take. It’s an impossible to define character. That’s the core of the fascination he emanates. For sure, whereas Ledger’s take was more nihilistic and more traditionally criminal, Phoenix’s wonderful rendition of Joker is the craziest one. He reminded me of the schizophrenia of Syd Barrett of the early Pink Floyd. With a deep difference though. Syd was talented and somehow helped by his friends to develop his talent, but he was unwilling/unable to. The Joker here is not talented, even if he believes he can be successful, and is ver willing to work more in the stand-up comedy art, but nobody around him is neither willing to help nor believing in him. The madness of Syd was deep inside, unrelated to the way the world treated him, the Joker’s came also due to the inability of the society to help and understand him. There’s no Pink Floyd around Arthur Fleck to support him, just a bunch of semi-failed clowns that mostly ignore him. Psychiatrists don’t offer much help either, his mum is old, weak and catatonic. He is alone, and from the loneliness the madness sprouts. By 2/3 of the movie he learns to accept his madness, or version of reality, and starts embodying it, revelling in it, making the rage his raison d’etre, his motivation. He is beyond any cure, any help, any salvation. He is rotten inside, the madness has taken root and won’t go. What at the beginning of the movie was an uncontrollable laughter and a general shyness, have mutated into hate-fueled criminal insanity. A splendid affresco on madness Most of the reviews of Joker talk about his relationship with society, his abuses and how society can cause this madness. A critique of our society, basically. And they are not wrong, absolutely. But I felt for the 2 days after I watched the movie that there was more, that the movie is a more complex tale than this. Then it dawned on me. As with the previous review I wrote about Blade Runner 2049, I found out a different interpretation. Where Blade Runner 2049 was mostly took by fans and critics as a sci-fi movie, of a much lesser philosophical extent than its predecessor, I argued that it boiled down to the single question of: what makes us humans? Similarly with Joker I believe the question is: what is madness? The Merriam-Webster has under the definition of ""mad"": completely unrestrained by reason and judgment : unable to think in a clear or sensible way which makes the point of being mentally sane or insane a matter of being able to use reason and judgement, to clearly think. Reason being defined as: a rational ground or motive still from the Merriam-Webster. So by being ""rational"", we can consider ourselves ""sane"" or not. I am aware that technically these are not accurate definitions as the mental issues are way more nuanced. I am no doctor so I am talking about the message coming from the movie, more than what is the definition in real life. I bet the director also was talking to a audience of non-experts in the field. The Joker is acting irrationally? We can say so. Criminally irrational. We would feel inclined to pinpoint him as ""mad"", along with the rioters that commit crimes following his example. They are not acting much differently than him, albeit for different reasons. But this way we would base the rationality vs irrationality of a person on whether his acts would be also considered crimes or not. That’s just a part of what defines somebody ""mad"". The movie is full of ""mad"" characters. Annoyed guys throwing chips at a girl in the metro for fun (again a wink to A Clockwork Orange), then making fun of the Joker just because he was uncontrollably laughing. Thus, basically, without understanding his innocuous behaviour. Not acting rationally. Boys stealing from the Joker and then hitting him, in the very first scene of the movie, without any reason. Nor rationality. People rioting in the streets to the point of lynching 2 policemen just out of frustration with the poverty they feel the government is keeping them in, feeling justified to kill and steal around. Criminally mad? The own Joker’s mum consciously ignoring the abuse he was receiving from her boyfriend, then believing that the mayor-to-be of Gotham City would help her, for years. There’s no much rationality in this. I could go on. There are plenty of ""mad"" behaviours shown in the movie which we would not normally call them ""madness"" because they don’t commit crime or are not violent acts or seems to be out of context in characters that during their daily life act normally, following society’s rules and showing good manners. We disregard their crimes as single episodes in a otherwise sane and normal person. We don’t concede as much leeway to those like the Joker. The Joker sees thing differently. He keeps saying throughout the movie ""why are you all so awful?"". He puts always an happy face despite the difficulties and wonder why the rest of society can’t or won’t. He is not directly referring to madness but in general wondering why some people keep being nasty at others for no reasons, without any rationality. That is the trigger that over time makes him feel entitled to express his most basic, violent and beastly instincts. It’s like he had to endure the ""awfulness"" of multiple people for years without society condemning them and doesn’t understand why he cannot be ""awful"" too. He’s out of touch with reality, mad in our book. But he points our attention towards smaller, less criminal acts of ""awfulness"" that we witness in our daily life from time to time and ask ourselves where is the rationality, the clear and sensible way of thinking of the dictionary that makes us justify or ignore them while immediately condemn the homicides and of the Joker. He is the criminal, but society around him is no less nasty nor criminal, at times, than him. Why do we excuse small acts of irrationality but don’t with the Joker? We like to put a tag of ""madness"" on those whom we like to think we have nothing similar to. To those whom we would never believe we would share anything with, without considering that the seed of those acts is sometimes in many of us too, just hidden, refrained, bridled, stifled. The Joker decided to let his madness seed sprout, in the most rational decision he ever takes in the movie. Yet that it is the moment we would start considering him mad. A subtle irony of a marvellous movie."
20,Switching between musical instruments which you don’t know before,arts-entertainment," It’s one of the most amazing feelings when you start making music as a music lover. Playing a musical instrument at some professional level shows one’s interest and attachment to it. But as human mind proven not to stick in one place for a long time, one will surely think of going beyond the boundaries. Since music has no boundaries at all, consider yourself free to learn about things you never knew before. When it comes to switching between musical instruments, the very common practice we see around is going for the instrument which lies in same category. For instance, a musician playing guitar, if ever interested to go for some other musical instrument, he would probably select some string instrument as his first choice of selection. Similar can be the case with wind instruments, and percussion players. However, this doesn’t bound any player or musician to switch within his known classification of musical instrument. If you are playing strings, take some time to think for wind or percussion as well. After all they are also one of the beautiful man made creations. With added re-defined sounds you will make yourself more indulged into the music passion. So, how you can switch between musical instruments effectively and let your audience be amazed with your playing selection. Here are some points to consider: Understanding the Basics When it comes to music, every player is familiar with the scales and notes. So, this point may be more helpful to those who are at some learning stage. Although different instruments do have extra notes, but point to make here is that they are based on the same basic scales. A major scale remains major in all and a minor remains minor. So the basic sense towards playing these scales and notes will be the biggest countable part towards your instrument switching. Understanding the Clef Depending on the musical instrument you choose, you must be aware of its particular clef. For instance, if you are switching from one stringed instrument to another, then you must be knowing that what is tablature all about and how to use it. Involvement of your Body Parts Different musical instruments include involvement of different body parts and strengths. For instance, a guitar player would be using his arms and fingers more than a flute player, who on the other hand is using his mouth and breath to generate the musical sound. So, while switching to some other category of musical instrument one should be aware of the body part which is going to be involved in that. Like mentioned previously, if you are a guitar player and interested to switch to flute playing, then you must be aware of the new areas of strengths you have to provide to your new instrument. And if you are not good at your breath then playing a flute will be much harder for you. So it will be better to enhance your breath first, by some exercises. Different Kinds of Switching, Ease and Struggles Now as we are familiar with all our basic things, it’s time to go for switching to another musical instrument. But which one.? The answer is still not very simple to be told. Better to go with your instinct and choice of interest. However, there are some known common factors involved in switching different musical instruments which we can share with you. Switching from Keyboard to Stringed Instrument It can a bit confusing while switching from keyboard to some stringed instrument. As most of string instruments using tablature, like in case of guitar, lute, and banjo etc. So getting eyes on tabs might get a bit tricky in start. Second thing comes in this type of switching is the muscle strength. While playing a keyboard you might not be taking more of your muscles into action, as compared to some string instrument. You need to build up your fingers strength and sensibility. Switching from Keyboard to Wind Instrument As contrary to the previous switching, here you go with some ease in reading the music. As most of wind instruments use the same clef, so it’s not going to be a big deal in this case. However, the main thing to consider here is that you are going for an air-blown instrument. So, you must be good at your breath. Time to go for some breath taking exercise! Switching from Keyboard to Percussion If you are thinking to switch from keyboard to some percussion like drum, then you are all setup to go. You will find the same rhythm you are already knowing. Just a matter of fine tuning and practice would help you well in this transition. Switching from Stringed Instrument to Keyboard Many stringed instruments performers tend to have a well transition towards a keyboard. As the same left to right hand combination is re-defined in their newly picked instrument. The only thing you will experience as a difference is to learn about sheet music instead of tablature. Switching from Stringed Instrument to Wind Instrument It’s almost the same experience as discussed before ""switching from keyboard to wind instrument"". As far as you are good with the basics, you can go along. Just the transitional efforts are changed from hand to mouth which you should be considering the most. Switching from String Instrument to Percussion Just like keyboard players switching to percussion, you will find yourself at ease with this change. Just in case you are switching to drum set that use both feet and hands in action, you need to be at a bit more focus and practice to come up with good results. Switching from Wind Instrument to Keyboard Again one of the most difficult transitions. As you are planning to change your area of playing strength from mouth to your hands. Furthermore, while being expert at reading one clef, now you need to be well at reading two instead. Switching from Wind Instrument to Stringed Instrument Just like the previous one, one of the most difficult tasks to do. As you will require more muscles to hold the instrument with your arms, and while playing it with your hands. And in some cases you also need to be quick at reading tab. Switching from Wind Instrument to Percussion A bit of bizarre transition, as for some percussion you need to be using both your hands and feet. So get ready for a bit more exercise! However, as the rhythm principles doesn’t change from one instrument to another, you are good to go with some practice. Switching from Percussion to Keyboard The plus side for you here is that you are going to use an instrument which involves your hands and feet. So you are with no worries relating to any muscular extensive practice. However, you need to be learning major and minor modes, and how scales, chord, and melodies work in case of percussion. Switching from Percussion to Wind Instruments Just like previously mentioned transitions you need to be good at your breath control. Plus, you have to be focusing more on one hand position and one note now, so get familiar with this asap. As after a hard effort you will eventually be getting a new expression to your music. Switching from Percussion to String Instruments Again a good news for you as you are good with your hands. Just add up a little more muscular strength to your arms and you are good to go. While the issue can be the same as in case of other transition to stringed instrument, you need to be learning tab or sheet music. So, are you ready to Switch your instrument now Switching to a new instrument is fine. Just make sure that you don’t switch too much or too early. Let things come to you first, how your new instrument going to change your way of expression. Go with your heart and make a worthy practice with learning. Your new sound will definitely be speaking for you. Don’t forget to share your view and comments. As there is nothing perfect and complete in this world. We would like to know what else would be in our next article."

1,The Reasons Why Video Marketing Must Be The Next Step In Your Business,arts-entertainment," Today there are several ways that any  business can use video in their marketing campaigns. In fact, video is fast  becoming a prerequisite for many companies for the simple reason that people in  the digital age want to see digital marketing rather than traditional  marketing. Certainly, advertising in magazines that cater to your particular  market can certainly be useful, but it can also be very costly. Furthermore, when you take space in a  magazine, at best your advertisement is going to be seen for a month. In other  cases, it may be a week. If it is in a daily paper, your advertisement is here  today and – quite literally – gone tomorrow.   The difference between that and a video is that your video can stay on  your website for as long as you wish, and you can use other forms of  advertising to drive traffic to it. You can also put your video up on YouTube,  for example, and provided it is relevant to a search, will be found for a long  time to come by people who are actually searching for whatever it is that you  sell. Another way of using a commercial video  production is as a pre-roll campaign. We have all seen these. This is where  your video is shown prior to other content. So the viewer may have clicked on a  news item, a website link, or whatever, and before he or she gets to see what  it was that they clicked on they see your video for 15 seconds, or 30 seconds. More and more people are getting  information, news, or entertainment from the internet, and you need an internet  marketing campaign in order to keep your name in front of your potential  customers so that you can stay competitive. A pre-roll video campaign is proven  to help your brand presence, because it is used by many major companies, and  they wouldn’t be doing it if it didn’t produce results. A pre-roll campaign  serves to widen the scope of your company’s web presence, and – let’s face it –  that is where your customers are heading more and more today. Commercial  video production in London can provide a dynamic way to introduce your  products and services to a new market. If you have a bricks and mortar business  (yes, they do still exist!) you might want to consider moving some of it  online. If you can supply and deliver your products to customers who order  online, it is another string to your bow, especially if you are a high street business  which is being hemmed in from all sides at the moment. You pay high rent and  rates, and yet companies like Amazon who pay very little pro rata, since their  premises are out of town, are increasing their turnover every day. A video of your products or services can  bring in another source of income as the current one is under pressure. Multiple  streams of income mean that if one dries up or slows down you still have a  business. So if the footfall in your high street is slowing down, you need to  find another way of attracting customers. Certainly, it’s a tough old world out  there, but we need to be where the customers are, and increasingly that is  online. Why? Because everybody wants things ""EASY"". Yes,  many of us still go to the supermarket, but companies like Ocado (part of  Waitrose) are making inroads by delivering your week’s groceries to your door.  And that makes it EASY for the customer. They don’t have to go anywhere, do  anything, pay for petrol, find somewhere to park, and all the rest of it. They  just go online, search the website for what they want, pay by card, and the  next thing that happens is that it arrives at their door. Certainly, you can  call it laziness if you like, and it is, but if that is the way the customer is  heading that is where you have to be. This is why video marketing  should be the next step in your business. Apart from any other consideration,  it is not nearly so expensive as you might imagine. You just need to partner  with the right company to create the right video that gets results."

3,How to keep party going with fresh beats,arts-entertainment," On a dreary winter evening, just a few days before Christmas, when my and my wife were setting up for a small get together with our friends. Christmas is the family time in our home, so we try to gather up all our dear friends for a small shindig right before the big C, so everyone would be free to spend it with their families. The time is 7pm and friends start getting there. They are all happy to step inside from cold. All warm up a bit with winter refreshing drinks. Small bits of pre-meal appetizers are tossed around in plates, everyone is joining the conversation. Drinks go even stronger, and soon we all forget the restraints and dive into pure fun of alcohol infused gathering with old friends that doesn't happen too often. Dancing breaks out. We have one dear friend Mr. Mattheson, whenever he gets a bit of energy, he starts performing lots of breakdance moves and jumps and slides.. This time wasn't any different, just 10 minutes into group dancing, he starts pushing people aside to free up some space for his new break dance tricks. And another 2 minutes later music suddenly stops, loud upset noises all concentrate on Matt. Appears to be,  he smashed the Galaxy9 and the speakers with one swift swoosh of his foot. Oh, that's not a good one. He destroyed my whole collection of fresh tunes from the radio, since my Galaxy9 isn't coming back online easily. After trying this and that, I turn to my laptop. Who knows why, I have no fresh music there, maybe because I don't really use it anymore. Quick look around for tools to replenish my music library, I turn to youtube, but there's very slow internet connection, thanks to winter freeze destroying the fiber line. The solution comes easy - save music from Youtube to my laptop, connect it to bigger speakers with the home entertainment system, and hit play to resume dancing once more. Here comes to help the best youtube to mp3 converter online. With its help I quickly download a few fresh tunes from Youtube, save to my laptop as mp3 files, and proceed to the media player, resuming the fun for everyone. Party continues for another 3 hours, I keep returning to youtubemp3 for more music 3 or 4 more times. Just 5-6 minutes, and I'm set with another dozen of radio-fresh beats to continue celebration. After all, I am very thankful to the service for helping out during the slowest of internet times."
4,"Seek Social’s general tips for YouTube, and social media videos:",arts-entertainment," THE BAD: We’ll start off on the ugly side of things and get it out of the way. So, here are our top four fatal failures committed by people new to the world of social media videos… Get To The Point! The data shows that the average view time for social media videos is just six seconds. That big long cinematic intro can’t be part of your social media content creation process any more… People aren’t impressed by them these days, and just want the information or entertainment they clicked your video for. So, the first of our tips for YouTube is that your social media videos should get to the point, and lead with their core message. Know Your Audience’s Habits and Wants Your social media videos will become more successful if you know your audience’s habits before you start your social media content creation process. So, use your analytics… Find out your audience’s tastes and behaviours, and then adjust your ideas for social media content to fit those tastes. In short, give the people what they want! The data provided by your analytics tools will also tell you how your social media videos, and by association your ideas for social media content have been received. Does your audience like long-form videos with lots of in-depth discussion, or are they more into a ‘short sharp shock’ style? Do they want loud and eye-catching, or a calmer more reasoned approach? Adjust your social media content creation process and your ideas for social media content to match what your analytics data tells you, and you’ll reap the rewards! The Power of ‘Buying In’ So far, the overarching theme of Seek Social’s tips for YouTube has been directness. Say what you have to say, in a way that your audience likes, and your social media videos will do well. However, you can’t underestimate the power of emotional investment too… Tugging on heartstrings and making your audience feel like they are part of something really can pay off big. So, make time to bake that into your social media content creation process. However, make sure you don’t stray from what your audience likes while you do it! Jack of all Trades, Master of None While video is the latest key ingredient in your marketing strategy, the simple fact that ‘I have video content on my page’ is not enough. You need to make sure your social media videos are focused too. If a video has too many goals that it’s trying to accomplish, it becomes a rambling mishmash of concepts. You also end up forcing people to watch content that they aren’t interested in because the part that they DO want to see is right at the end of your video. So, the next in our set of tips for YouTube is to keep things focused. No video should have more than 2 objectives (and if you do have 2, they should naturally go together well). If you have lots of different goals and ideas for social media content, that’s great… All the more opportunity to make more social media videos and hone your social media content creation skills! THE GOOD: Now that we’ve shown you what NOT to do, we’ll end our list of tips for YouTube on a high with a quartet of cracking concepts for social media videos… Go Behind the Scenes… This is one of our favourite ideas for social media content. You may have seen us using it before on Facebook and Twitter, and now social media videos through Facebook live. Giving current and prospective customers a look behind the curtain really can help them buy into your business like nothing else. As a result, videos like these need to be part of your arsenal when it comes to social media content creation. Tell A Story… Storytelling and the medium of video have gone hand in hand since video was invented! It’s a proven combination, and one you should be incorporating in your social media content creation process and the social media videos it creates. On top of that, telling your business’ compelling story will draw your audience in further… Helping you turn viewers into clients! Go LIVE! Having a plan and a process is great, don’t get us wrong. However, to keep your audience engaged with your social media videos you need to break away from the norm on occasion. Live video is great for this! Even if a live broadcast has a regular timeslot like ours, there’s always the chance something unexpected might happen. Your list of ideas for social media content should embrace that. The unexpected creates new and exciting talking points (and maybe a giggle or two as well). You could also combine this with another one of our tips for YouTube above to go live from behind the scenes… Embrace Your Weird Side! This is really about having your ideas for social media content turned into unforgettable social media videos. If something makes someone laugh hard enough, they’ll remember it. If it’s off the wall or out of the ordinary enough, they’ll remember it. You want your social media videos to be memorable so just like the unexpected, embrace your weird too!"
5,How Easy Is It to Learn How to DJ?,arts-entertainment," In recent years, a DJ has become an integral part of many events and even weddings. Gone are the days of hiring a band whose repertoire is limited by the instruments that they can perform on. But how can you take advantage of this growing trend of the 2000s and how easy is it to become a DJ? The answer varies according to your technological talents and also your budget. A good DJ can utilise any equipment and make a great show for their patrons no matter what they are faced with. So what does it take? How can you boost your love of music into a blossoming career? Here we will look at what it takes to be a cut above the rest and start your new DJ career off right! There are plenty of reasons to start learning how to DJ. Maybe you want a change of career or perhaps you would like to perform for your family and friends at your own gatherings. Whatever the reason, it is not something you can simply pick up in a day. It takes practice and above all patience! Get to know your equipment. When starting out you may not have the cash lying around to get a state of the art studio set up. This is not so much of an issue! Many quality DJs know just how to adapt to whatever equipment they are given. To do this, you can start small. Look into second hand gear and read the manual thoroughly. Get to know how to use the software as well as the tools of the trade, once you get to know one set of gear you will be likely to pick up most other. Some clubs will have access to their own equipment so being versatile is key to success if you are looking to make this into a career. There are a few basic skills that you will need to grasp in order to be good at what you do. Beatmatching is a given, ensuring that the tempo, the speed at which the songs are playing, and the phase match so that both songs play at the same time in sync. Phrasing is also important and a familiar term for most people who have played a musical instrument in the past. It is basically the mixing of tracks at points in the songs where they make sense. Getting the hang of all of these skills will put you in good stead for your DJ venture."
6,Introducing The Seek Social Facebook Live Stream!,arts-entertainment," Why do a Facebook Live Stream? The Seek Social team want to be a repository of advice for small businesses.

What Can You Expect? We’ll freely admit that right now, the exact format is a bit of a work-in-progress. However, we want to infuse everything with that ‘informal but informative’ style you’ll find in our blog posts (where we also offer advice for small businesses), or in the office if you decide to visit us. The Facebook live stream format also makes things easy for you guys as our audience. Once you’ve accessed the broadcast you can just leave it on in the background and crack on with your day.

Paula’s updates on digital marketing news and social media trends come from the very same desk she works at! Looking ahead a little bit… So, that’s how things are at the moment. We already have big dreams for the Seek Social Facebook Live stream though, once we get the hang of this whole ‘broadcasting’ thing. For example, as well as a regular update on the week’s digital marketing news and new social media trends, we’re looking to add special guests into the mix to offer their take on all things digital marketing, and offer their own advice for small businesses… There might even be a few guest spots from the rest of the Seek Social team, and / or an archive of previous episodes somewhere.

7,Want to really make your Social Media Marketing strategy work? Outsource it!,arts-entertainment," Firstly, all aspects of your social media marketing strategy will be carried out well We’ve given a lot of tips over recent weeks, and shown you how to create awesome social media business content. However, there’s more to running a successful social media marketing campaign than just posting content. Across however many platforms you want to use, you need to get to grips with analytics tools, understand the analytics themselves, arrange post scheduling, create designs for your graphical content… The list goes on, and if you’re going to do things properly you need to take care of all these things. For us, there are only two ways to ensure the person in charge knows ALL of these tasks well… You must either amass the knowledge yourself, or hire a digital marketing company. Outsourcing helps keep things consistent, regular, and high quality A digital marketing company will have dedicated people to handle each individual part of your social media marketing strategy. For instance, with us, your written content is always handled by the same person. He has years of professional writing experience, and every day – for at least two hours per day – he does nothing but write social media business posts. To create your graphics, we also have someone who knows Photoshop like the back of their hand. This approach ensures that your social media business content will be of extremely high quality. The common practice of having one set of people behind a client’s content – as a digital marketing company will tend to do – also has one other advantage. It helps your voice, your brand and your overall image stay consistent across however many platforms you want to use. Outsourcing lets you experiment with different features and platforms Another advantage to you is the wealth of knowledge that becomes available. Let’s say you’re a novice to a platform… If you’re handling things yourself, again you have a tough choice to make. You can either choose between spending time on learning about a platform yourself, or ignoring a potential audience. That problem goes away when you hire a digital marketing company. It’s our job to know all the platforms, and stay up to date with all their latest developments and features. That means that your social media business content and your overall social media marketing strategy can take advantage of the cutting edge in social media technology, all at no time investment cost to you. Other services might be available If the professionals you choose are a ‘full service’ digital marketing company like Seek Social, then implementing your social media marketing strategy and handling your social media business accounts might be just the tip of a very comprehensive iceberg. Want an app for your business too? A new website that ranks well on search engines, complete with a webstore? App development, web design, search engine optimization, and e-commerce development are related, it’s true… However, they are still separate disciplines that require different skill sets. Opting for a full-service digital marketing company can get you access to all of that and more under one roof, and one agreement. Up to 24/7 support for you and your clients Just like Seek Social, the digital marketing company you choose might also have an office abroad somewhere. That may not seem like something you as a customer can benefit from, but it is. Lets say for instance that you need a task completing urgently. We start the project and put in a solid day’s work on it here in the UK. Where others might need to stop at that point, we can have our U.S. team work on your project too. They can work into what would be the wee small hours of the morning for us Brits, advancing the project ready for the UK team to pick up again later that same morning. Likewise, having support in other time zones can be beneficial to your customers too. Even if it’s something as simple as having someone monitor your Facebook account while you’re asleep, every little helps. And finally… It’s ideal for small businesses! For sure, you’ll save an incredible amount of time by hiring a digital marketing company to handle your social media marketing strategy and your social media business accounts. However, you can save money too. By paying a digital marketing agency, you get access to the skill and experience of one or more team members… But you don’t have to pay the equivalent of a full-time salary. Likewise, you also avoid  overheads like insurance that hiring someone yourself would incur. Especially when it comes to new startups or SME’s, we know that every penny and every scrap of time that can be saved here can be used elsewhere. Nevertheless – a saving is a saving – and as a result outsourcing control and implementation of your social media marketing strategy to a digital marketing company makes great sense for all kinds of people!"
8,Seek Social’s Six Call To Action Techniques to Boost Social Media Engagement,arts-entertainment," Use active language Seek Social have always said that you should be direct when trying to obtain Social Media engagement. Part of that approach involves using ‘active’ language, or in simpler terms, telling your audience what to do. Put phrases such as ""click on"" ""subscribe to"", ""register at"" in your call to action and you’re sure to increase customer motivation… And Social Media engagement along with it! Create a sense of urgency There is a reason the term ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (or ‘FOMO’) exists… That’s because the phenomenon itself exists too. As a result, Seek Social recommend using words that indicate some kind of limited availability, or a benefit for acting promptly. Words such as ""now"" ""today"" ""soon"", etc. – can drive customer motivation by planting the idea that they might miss out on something in your audience’s head. Putting these words in capital letters or bold font only draws more attention to your call to action… Something which makes them all the more effective at generating Social Media engagement! Tease upcoming content or products Think back to your driving test, or your first date. Remember those butterflies and the sense of anticipation? Well, there’s no better way to build anticipation than with a teaser. When done right you don’t even need to refer to what you’re teasing in your call to action… Just the knowledge that some ‘can’t miss’ content is on the way can create the buzz you want. In turn, this will lead to more Social Media engagement for you and your product! A secondary effect is that you can also create FOMO with a teaser. Don’t forget that sneak previews can imply that whatever you’re teasing was simply too big and too awesome to keep under wraps… And that FOMO sensation alone may well give the customer motivation to come back, as we discussed above. Focus on ‘You Statements’ Don’t get us wrong, the Seek Social team know that promoting the positives of your product is a good thing. With a call to action though, you can take this to another level. By using what we call ‘You statements’ in your call to action you give your customer motivation to act (and thereby to give you Social Media engagement opportunities), by hammering home how your product can benefit them specifically as an individual, rather than a nameless, faceless ‘someone’ that they don’t know. Make it sound easy Now, the Seek Social team isn’t afraid of good old-fashioned hard work. However, we will freely admit that we prefer things to be quick, easy and painless – especially online. Your customers are no different. As a result, your call to action should emphasise the simple, straightforward qualities of whatever you’re promoting if you really want that call to action to drive customer motivation and Social Media engagement. That doesn’t mean you have to downplay the effectiveness of what you’re posting about though. You just need to promote that getting it to do that thing is also ‘quick and easy’, ‘intuitive’, ‘no nonsense’ etc. Use layman’s terms If you want to maximise the amount of Social Media engagement you can get from a post it’s important to make it accessible to as large an audience as possible. As a result you need to use layman’s terms where you can, and avoid jargon. However as above, that doesn’t mean you have to ‘dumb down’ and simplify what your product or service can do. You just need to use terms that are broadly understood when you do so. …There is a caveat to this though. If your audience is made up of industry pros or insiders, not using the right jargon could harm the amount of Social Media engagement you get from your post and your call to action. Seek Social’s advice is to consider your audience and adjust the language accordingly, erring on the ‘accessible’ side of things."
9,Seek Social’s Five A Side Follies!,arts-entertainment," The draw… A total of nineteen teams from businesses all over town entered Made In Bury’s five a side tournament. That meant that group stages would need to be held before moving on to the knockout rounds… Just like the World Cup and Champions’ League then, except of course, way more prestigious than those tin-pot tournaments. Team Seek Social were drawn against the likes of Maccies FC, Cartime Bury, and 360 Vehicle Leasing. And if you’re not aware of the Made In Bury five a side football scene, trust us… That qualifies as a ‘group of death’. With only five players available it was sure to be a tough task for Seek Social’s shoestring squad. We still had Dean’s immense tactical nouse to guide us though – knowledge developed and honed over countless Football Manager seasons. With him leading the line up front, Luke’s cat-like reflexes in goal and Paula, Mike and Darren (on loan from 1Life Fitness) somewhere in the middle, team Seek Social lined up and gave it our best. Luke picking up an early injury didn’t help our cause, but we still gave a good account of ourselves. Seek Social’s front three of Michael, Dean and Darren were regularly going close and using the smaller five a side surface to our advantage. Darren in particular was banging in the goals and proving to be an inspired addition to the squad. Despite that key contribution, the highlight of the night has to be Dean’s ‘Beckham-esque’ strike from the halfway line! The magic sponge returns… Alas, it wasn’t enough, as Dean was ruled out with an ankle problem later in the night. Even a virtuoso performance from emergency loanee Callum – playing out of position in the outfield – couldn’t save us. Results just didn’t go Seek Social’s way, and we were knocked out in the group stages. Guess the Made In Bury five a side tournament trophy just wasn’t meant for us (this year…). So, a couple of us are sporting limps this week, and we’re all a bit sore… We still had fun though. That’s what’s important, and Seek Social would definitely like to extend our thanks to our hosts at Made In Bury. Congratulations also to the team from The Joshua Wilson Brain Tumour Charity – worthy winners on the night and new Made In Bury five a side champs. However… While we may not be the best at football, when it comes to digital marketing it’s a different story… Whether you’re looking for a new website, mobile app, or some great social media or graphics, Seek Social are the marquee signing you need. If you have any questions or want to make an enquiry, then feel free to get in touch with us on 0161 761 1800!"
10,Getting the most from Instagram Insights,arts-entertainment," Getting the most from Instagram Insights The Seek Social blog returns to our spiritual home of Instagram today, with another set of five social media tips that will help you use Instagram’s analytics suite – dubbed ‘Instagram Insights’ – to its fullest, and in the process get the most out of Instagram for business purposes. Before we get into the nitty gritty of things though, it’s important to remember that in order to use Instagram Insights, you’ll need to have your Instagram account registered as a business account. Don’t worry though, doing that is a simple process that only takes a few minutes. It can be turned off too, if you find Instagram Insights isn’t for you. Now,  are you sitting comfortably? Then we’ll begin! Know who your followers are Any analytics suite worth its salt these days will include demographics information. Instagram Insights is no different. So, the first of our advanced social media tips is to take advantage of that data. Know who’s reading and interacting with your content. Know where they’re from, how old they are, and what device they’re using. Where possible, you might also consider tweaking your content to match that demographic. It’s all about that old roman saying…. ‘give the people what they want’. Know when your followers are active In addition to the demographics information, Instagram Insights will also tell you when your audience is online. An advanced social media technique is to schedule your posts to go out at peak periods in your audience’s activity… It might seem like a bit of a no-brainer when it comes to social media tips, but if you post when your audience is already online, you’ll reap three key benefits. Firstly, users don’t have to scroll too far to find your latest content… Secondly, they’re more likely to receive the notification that you’ve posted new content… And thirdly, since they have that notification to remind them, they’re more likely to go and interact with your content. Compare and Contrast your posts With Instagram Insights you have access to the cold, hard numbers that will make ‘giving people what they want’ easy. When you’re using Instagram for business, you don’t need to be an advanced social media user or a mind-reader to know just what it is your audience wants. So, our advice is don’t overthink things… Just check Instagram Insights and see which of your posts have been the most popular – it really is that simple! Use Instagram Insights with stories A few weeks ago we wrote about how you should be using Instagram Stories if you want to make the most of Instagram for business. Using Instagram Insights to keep track of your stories isn’t really an advanced social media tactic… For Seek Social it’s the next logical step in the journey if you’re using Instagram for business. It is true that right now you don’t have quite the array of information for stories as you do for regular posts, however, there are still a lot of useful…. Well, ‘Instagram Insights’…. That you can use to inform and improve your content, and thereby spread your reach on the platform. Speculate to accumulate… Just like you can boost a post on Facebook, you can ‘Promote’ a post on Instagram. And yes, our last advanced social media pointer for today is that you absolutely should be using Instagram Insights in conjunction with Instagram Promote. Use your Instagram Insights to discover your most successful posts and your most proven content, and then take things to the next level by re-using that post (another of our social media tips from the past), and promoting it to really maximise its exposure and reach. That’s not all though, because you can (and should) also be using Instagram Insights to help you better target your ads as well."
11,Creating Social Media Content for Your Business,arts-entertainment," Firstly – keep your business accounts active! This is probably the most important tip Seek Social could give you… If a potential customer only knows you through social media and you stop posting, you stop existing for them. Furthermore, if there’s no new social media content from you there’s nothing to be shared to walls and feeds, so your customer engagement will decrease. Seek Social’s advice is to post something every day on your accounts – even if you have no real news to share. Don’t forget that when using social media for business, content is not just the way you sculpt your online brand. It’s also your way of saying hi to your customers, and how you remind them that you’re still there and want them to get in touch! Show a little personality… As we said earlier, posting to social media for business purposes should be different from posting on personal accounts. However, at Seek Social we also believe that it’s important to still put something of yourself into that social media content, and the online brand that they help create. Remember also that your online business persona should always be in line with your offline one. Be consistent… It is important that your offline brand, online brand, and the social media content that support them are consistent with each other. If they are it will help you send a consistent message and appear genuine and trustworthy. Creating that impression – however you choose to do it – will really help you grow your brand online and get the most out of your social media business posts. Remember though that every business and online brand is different. It’s up to you and your analytics to decide what’s the right approach for your unique circumstances. However, the Seek Social team are more than willing to provide a few pointers if you need them – just give us a call on 0161 761 1800, or visit us at our new office! Post Smarter, Not Harder… In the archives of the Seek Social blog you’ll find a wealth of in-depth tips for posting social media business content… but sometimes it all boils down to good old-fashioned common sense. You could have the greatest social media content in the world, but it won’t help you or your online brand one iota if nobody sees or interacts with it. So, don’t forget to post when your audience is actually online, and to use call to action techniques to remind them of what you want them to do. These really can work wonders – and turn ‘a one-time reader’ into ‘a regular visitor’, ‘a follower’, or even ‘a customer’. Maybe it sounds harsh to say it, but online – in the world of statistics, algorithms and analytics in which the Seek Social team operate – reactions are what counts. And these completely non-technical pointers can help you get them… Finally, be reachable… Your business doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and neither do your social media business accounts. If your online brand has accounts on more than one platform, why not do what Seek Social does… Let your audience know that and invite them over to those other platforms! You should also be making sure that your basic contact details (business phone number, e-mail address, and the street address for your office) are regularly being included in your business’ social media content – so that potential customers don’t NEED to be online to get in touch."
12,The Team Behind the Best Web Design & Digital Marketing in Manchester,arts-entertainment," Let’s start at the very beginning… Seek Social began with Dean and Paula, so that’s where we’ll start too. Dean is our lead tech guy and leads the crew providing Manchester’s best web design services. So if you need a website building, an app creating – or anything involving code for that matter – he’ll be involved. Out of office hours Dean’s also our resident Dungeon Master… As a result the Seek Social team find that keeping him sweet keeps our D+D characters alive too! Paula’s job right now involves keeping the rest of us in line and busy, providing you guys with only the best web design and digital marketing in Manchester. Of all of us, she’s the one that finds and deals with clients the most, so if you’re in the market for digital marketing services, and you choose Seek Social to provide them, you’ll meet her pretty early on. Despite being the boss though, Paula still mucks in and gets her hands dirty with the rest of us whenever she can – putting her expert Photoshop skills to use creating awesome visuals for Seek Social, and our clients too. …and things just grew from there! Next to join Seek Social was Luke. He may only be 17 and learning his trade in the digital marketing services world, but we already know he’s got a real talent for the industry. Typically he operates as Dean’s right-hand man working on websites and implementation. However, when time permits he also helps us designers and creative types out, providing graphic designs for our digital marketing services clients. He’s so passionate about his job that Luke puts his skills as a member of Manchester’s best web design team to work on websites of his own when he’s not here… While away from the office he also has a blossoming Esports career as a high-level Fortnite and FIFA player… Jordan is on board as the Seek Social team’s graphics guru. His job involves creating stunning visuals for some of the best web design solutions and digital marketing in Manchester. If we’re being honest he’s probably got the most creative mind in the Seek Social office, as well as the skills to pay the bills and bring any concept to life. In short, the skills you need on your side if you need digital marketing services. Like Luke and myself he’s a keen gamer too, and takes on freelance design work in his spare time. Jordan also has a real eye for fashion. In fact, he’s currently working on his own clothing brand when not here at Seek Social! And finally, there’s myself. I’m Tom, and at Seek Social I’m mostly responsible for written content, including this blog. I’m relatively new to digital marketing services, but I have years of writing experience behind me. When it comes to providing the best digital marketing in Manchester, my role is to create eye-catching social media posts that will still get your message across the right way, and tag lines that will make your new website the best web design project it can be.. Outside of work I volunteer for a local disability charity creating documents of all kinds. I’m also a huge motorsports fan and aspiring SimRacer, and I like to keep my graphic design skills sharp by designing liveries for race cars. …so, there we all are! Individually the Seek Social team have what Liam Neeson might call ‘a very particular set of skills’… However, each of us also has a real passion for the individual tasks that make up digital marketing services. By combining those talents you get some of the best web design and digital marketing in Manchester. Call us or visit our office here to meet us and find out more!"
13,Many Everyday Items Can Now Be Personalised,arts-entertainment," This may come as a surprise to many people, but there are now many items for the home or things to give as a gift that you can have personalised. Suppose you want to send your boyfriend a bottle of Calvin Klein Eternity For Men? Yes, that would be a lovely gift and one that he will adore, but how about if you could have a message engraved on the bottle? Something like ""Happy Birthday. Lots of love. Joanne""? Just imagine what a difference that would make to your birthday present. And the fact is that you can now make that a reality because there are companies out there who will engrave the bottle for you with whatever you want to say and include it in the price. Obviously, there is a limit to how many letters you can get on the bottle, but it makes that present so much more special because now it is not just a present, but a unique gift. That is just one example of what can be done. We all want our homes to look unique, which is why so many people take great trouble to care for their front gardens (even if the back garden is a bit of tip!) so why not go that extra mile and add a personalised modern door and house number sign, or a name? Even if your home doesn't have a name at present, that doesn't stop you giving it one and personalising your home and making it stand out from the rest. Instead of just being Number 22, you could become Smith's Cottage (if your name is Smith), or The Flower Garden, or The Mansion House, or anything else you wish. The possibilities are endless, and they give you the opportunity to add that touch of your personality which makes you stand out from the crowd. These house signs come in a range of different colours and can be written in a number of different fonts. You could also have signs made for your office in order to bring it up to date so that it looks to your staff and visitors that you are now very firmly in the 21st century, and ahead of the competition. In addition, you can also have a personalised mailbox that you can fix to the wall or to a post. While we are talking about your office, what about a personalised clock? A clock can be made in a wide range of styles, classic or modern, in a choice of materials such as acrylic, mirror, glass, metal such as stainless steel or aluminium, and in a very wide choice of colours and finishes. You could have your company logo included, or perhaps the badge of your favourite football team, your dog's name, or if you are a professional horticulturist you might have created a new variety of a particular flower such as a new geranium and you could include a picture of it on the face of your clock. Why ever not? The world is your oyster (or as Del Boy used to say in Only Fools And Horses, The world is your lobster!). Clocks can also have ordinary numbers on them in any colour you wish on any background, or you could have Roman numerals – which many people like – or just a series of twelve dots around the edge. You don't even have to have dots: if you are a tennis fan you could have twelve tennis players showing the time position. Do you begin to see that the possibilities for personalisation are almost limitless? No, they ARE limitless! The only limit is your imagination. What about mouse mats? These can be produced in a range of colours in leather and include your company logo, company name, the name of a product, the name of a long-term project (think HS2), or anything else. The same thing applies to leather desk mats and leather coasters: if you own a pub you could have coasters branded with your pub name. Yes, there are companies out there who can personalise all sorts of different objects for you and make your home, business, clock, birthday gift, or anything else stand out from the crowd."
14,Simplify event planning with these crowd control tips,arts-entertainment," Whether you're planning a small concert or large parade, crowd management and crowd control play an essential role in the event's success. In fact, a thorough crowd management plan can not only enhance the logistics of your event, but also provide you and your team with peace of mind. Here are some crowd control tips to keep in mind as you're planning your next event. What type of event are you planning? What are the expected turnout numbers? Knowing the answers to these questions can help you accurately identify your crowd control needs like the type of barriers you should have on hand. An event like a concert or music festival could benefit from a variety of barricade styles, and in some cases it's required. If alcohol is being sold, many municipalities around the country require some form of barricade to control the entrances of the event. Additionally, the city of Raleigh and many others require events that are closing city streets to have ""safety barricades"" or Type III Traffic control barriers. High capacity events require a wide array of barriers and barricade: • Type III road closure barricades can help you control traffic around and inside your event. As previously mentioned, many cities require these barriers for any event closing public streets! • Stage barricade can provide top-notch security for your event personnel, production equipment, and most importantly, the crowd. This is typically seen between the stage of a concert and the pit area or front row of the crowd. • Bike rack barrier is the most simple crowd control solution. This style of barricade allows for the easiest setup and transportation, but it's not for high-stress areas like the front of stages. The ability to easily disassemble these barriers makes them a great tool for smaller events, around emergency exit areas, or queue lines leading into your event. Identify and keep in mind where the essential equipment is at your event. These are the areas you need to protect with barricade. In doing so, you ensure that attendees won't be able to tamper with equipment, and the chance of disruption at the event is minimized. During the planning phase of your event, identify possible pinch points at your venue. These are the places where congestion are most likely to occur. Plan with local government officials on how to reduce the effects of these pinch points, either through redirection of attendees through barricade, or removing that area from the event grounds. North Carolina requires certified crowd control managers at any event where there are over 1,000 attendees. For every 250 attendees at an event, there should be one certified crowd manager on duty. To get someone at your event certified today, visit the North Carolina Department of Insurance website. Understanding correct barricade placement at your event creates a better experience for attendees, performers, and staff alike. One of the most important aspects when creating a crowd management plan is emergency exits. While planning your event, you should always account for emergency exit locations and determine the number of emergency exits you must have based on attendance and space. Going hand in hand with emergency exits are emergency vehicle entrances. These entrances are another key component of your crowd management plan. Your government officials will have information on local requirements for this aspect of event planning. As any experienced professional in the industry can tell you, unpredictability is commonplace in event planning. However, you can take steps to prevent unnecessary safety issues with proper crowd and traffic control planning. At TAP Barricade Rentals, we're here to help make your next event run as smoothly as possible with strategic crowd control planning and placement.

15,The Seek Social Blog’s Facebook Engagement series – Part IV: The Final Flourish,arts-entertainment," Share relevant images: As the old saying goes, ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’. And those ‘thousand words’ are particularly useful when you’re working with a strict 1500 character limit (or less…). So, Seek Social would always recommend including an image with as many of your posts as possible. The more colourful or visually striking that image is, the better. You want something that will stop people scrolling, get them thinking, and prompt a response. (Which you can then use to generate Facebook engagement…) Tap into trending topics: In order to maximise the amount of Facebook engagement you’re getting, you need to be talking about what people are talking about. While you’re at work the world outside is still going on. Things are still happening, and they can all be used to fuel your engagement on social media. The Seek Social team’s advice is to tap into what’s trending and talk about that. Dropping a relevant and trending hashtag into your post while you’re at it will only make your content more visible, and increase the chances of it generating great Facebook engagement. Go behind the scenes with live video: Live video can bring in an audience (and Facebook engagement) like few other types of post. So much so that we are looking into ways we can show you Seek Social HQ live and in colour ourselves! The important thing to remember here is that your audience will know you’re not pros. You won’t need Hollywood-style production to generate engagement on social media, and your audience won’t expect them. Dodgy sound, shaky camera work and people not knowing quite what to say is part of the charm here. So, embrace your inner Ant & Dec and get in front of that camera! Make an emotional connection: Why do Seek Social think you should use the three social media tips we’ve just talked about? In order to use this one too! If you can make an emotional connection with your audience via your content, you’re more likely to see good Facebook engagement. So, pull at those heartstrings, play on those fears, and let your likes and dislikes be known. On occasion, be polarising too in a good-natured way. Your amount of engagement on social media is sure to increase because of it. Share industry news: You might have noticed Seek Social doing this, and you’re about to find out why… You see, one of the things you can add to your content to help your rate of Facebook engagement is regular sharing of industry news. In some cases it can help potential customers identify just what it is that you’re selling. In others, it lends gravitas and weight to what you’re saying in your own posts. Sometimes, you might just want to share your opinion on the news and ask your audience for theirs. There are so many ways in which you can use third-party news to solicit engagement on social media, and a number of different reactions for your audience to have that news – so have a play around and see what generates the most Facebook engagement for you!

Let’s say you strike gold with a post and it generates more Facebook engagement than expected… Firstly – as we mentioned last week – boost it on Facebook. And when you’ve boosted it, consider re-using the post on your other social media channels. You might have to shorten it to meet the character limits on other sites, but the important thing is to keep the message the same.

16,Hiring a corporate video agency Liverpool,arts-entertainment," There are many benefits regarding video production and companies should be fully aware of them in order to make the right choice. After taking the decision of investing in the project, finding a corporate video agency Liverpool is the next step. However, why is this concept so popular in the first place? One of the main advantages is increased traffic. Everyone prefers watching a video rather than reading text and your potential clients fall into this category. The more traffic gets directed to your website, the more chances of increasing sales and improving visibility. Videos are easy to share and when people like what they see, they will certainly show others. This is a great opportunity, to be able to create content that gets shared and viewed more and more, while you don’t have to do anything in particular. Videos should be posted on various platforms actually, on social media, blogs, as commercials and such. This way, potential clients will see them and visit the website, get to know more about your brand and what you are offering and simply help you gain popularity. The more the content is shared, the greater reach of potential clients engaging with your brand. The best part is that you don’t have to do the job on your own, because a corporate video agency Liverpool is more than specialized. Promoting a business online is not an easy task, because competition is fierce and a lot has to be done to appear in the first results in search engines. The good news is that video production has an amazing effect in this case as well. Videos show up more in search engines and since more and more people are using the internet to look for products and services, they will most likely find your website and not your competition. If you publish regular content, your page will remain in the first positions and will capture attention without a doubt. There are many ways of improving SEO ranking and this is one effective method. You can discuss the subject with a Liverpool based video production company and they will explain how the concept works. A Liverpool based video production company has the necessary experience in the field and equipment to help businesses achieve their goals. Not to mention they know how to transmit the desired message and create content that is informative, captivating and engaging. Creating and enhancing brand awareness is another benefit provided by corporate video production, as viewers will end up hooked with what they see, instead of having to read text and imagine what businesses want to promote. Content can be created based on the target audience, to ensure a lasting impression and make everything possible to attract potential buyers and increase the actual database. There are many opportunities for businesses and it all depends on their creativity or the agency they choose to collaborate with. Speaking of which, between the decision of handling the task on your own or hiring professionals, it is better to rely on experts working in the field. They have all necessary resources and they managed many projects before, worked close with different clients and know what each requires, what videos should look like, what it takes to appeal the audience and they own equipment and software editing skills. Doing the job on your own, without the necessary skills, implies not investing enough in your image and you can end up with a sloppy video that doesn’t do your business any justice. Going the extra mile is worth it when you think of all the advantages and how much you can achieve. Increasing the number of actual customers is not easy, but with the right tools and professionals by your side, it can be done."
17,Facebook Stories Part 2 – The Seek Social Team’s Tips for Facebook Engagement!,arts-entertainment," Be Unique… Facebook stories are intrinsically linked to the stories features on other platforms like Instagram. As a result you can certainly re-use social media content across platforms. However, one of the Seek Social team’s top tips for Facebook stories is to remind you that this isn’t always a good idea. To maximise the Facebook engagement you get from stories, you need to consider the natural traits of each platform… By all means, re-use social media content where and when it fits, but don’t force it… Be Brand-Focused… With Facebook, things like filters, on screen text and more are easy to add to your stories. That makes it easy to ensure that your social media content fits in with your brand’s existing image. For example, Seek Social might use a blue filter and other similar elements to keep the overall look and feel in line with what you’ll find on our logo, website etc. An added bonus is that this also makes your content stand out. Standing out makes it easier for people to identify the content as being part of your brand, or identify your brand itself. Put all of that together, and it adds up to content that’s primed to provide great Facebook engagement! Create Exciting Time-Sensitive Social Media Content… Facebook stories exist for only 24 hours. So, the next of our top tips for Facebook engagement using stories is to capitalise on that! Seek Social think the best way to do so is to create ‘FOMO’, or the ‘Fear Of Missing Out’. For example, time-limited competitions, giveaways, short term discount codes and so on will all get the attention of your audience.  To maximise your engagement we’d recommend making such posts a regular feature in your social media content. However, don’t forget to keep changing the exact date and time too! That way people know something good is on the way, but they’re not sure when, so they keep checking back… This will generate both traffic and Facebook engagement opportunities for you! Deliver Unforgettable Experiences… One of the Seek Social team’s biggest tips for Facebook stories is to remember that they are extremely versatile. No matter whether you’re using video or pictures, stories allow you to craft unique social media content, and crate longer and more varied lead-ins to big announcements by mixing photo and video content. All of this means that the next time you take your customers and fans behind the scenes, or do a big product reveal, the experience you give them will be that much more unforgettable… and that much more likely to generate Facebook engagement! Focus on More Than Promotion… Self-promotion should most certainly should be a key part of your social media marketing strategy. However – the next Seek Social Facebook engagement tip is a reminder that it shouldn’t be the only thing you post about. As we’ve mentioned in the tips for Facebook and other platforms that we’ve brought to you in the blog of late, don’t forget that your customers and fans also want to get to know your business on a more personal level. Mix in stories that celebrate milestones in company history, or staff birthdays (like Seek Social did recently). Things like video clips of business-related events that you’ve attended, or pieces of industry news are also great to use. Posts like these will help keep your social media content varied but relevant, while also offering the personal touch that your audience is craving! Use Multiple Voices… Facebook stories essentially give you an extra channel to use on the same platform. Therefore, it’s great for trying out new things, or different ways of presenting your social media content. Seek Social call this your ‘voice’, but like an impressionist, you can have more than one! In fact, alternative voices can be very useful as they’ll resonate well with different audiences. You might even think about teaming up with relevant online influencers too… It can lend extra weight to what you’re saying, and draw their audiences to your content. In any case, using multiple voices is likely to increase your overall audience, thereby bringing in more people to provide you with opportunities for Facebook engagement!"

19,"Boost your social media engagement with stories on Facebook, and help from Seek Social",arts-entertainment," Stories on Facebook occupy prime real estate… Stories get pride of place at the top of your Facebook app. As a result – just like on other platforms – stories on Facebook will grab a user’s attention. What’s more, they remain on screen as users scroll through their feed too. What does all of this mean? In short, it means stories are hard for users to get away from, or forget about. That’s great news for you because those two qualities, (and the ‘Front and centre’ positioning) make stories on Facebook great for generating social media engagement! Facebook stories are one of 2019’s social media trends… Before there were stories on Facebook, there were ‘stories’ features on Instagram and Snapchat. The statistics from those platforms show that the core concept behind stories on Facebook is already popular with users. For example, on Instagram some 250 million accounts use the feature every day… Seek Social can only imagine what that number will rise to once the feature is handed over to the world’s largest social media userbase! Whatever the final statistics might end up being though, it’s going to be an audience that you can’t afford to miss out on, and one that in the opinion of the Seek Social team, will make Stories on Facebook one of the emerging social media trends (and sources of social media engagement) of 2019! A better connection with your audience… The data shows that these days, people simply don’t trust companies the way they used to. It’s not enough to be a faceless corporation with a good reputation anymore… To really maximise your social media engagement you need to connect with your audience on a personal level. This is why Seek Social have started taking you behind the scenes to meet the people that work here. We don’t want to be one of those faceless organisations… We want you to know who we are, and what each member of Team Seek Social does for our clients. Stories on Facebook are also ideal for providing the kind of ‘behind the scenes’ video content we mentioned in last week’s Seek Social blog. They’ll let you show people the human side of your organisation in a way that they can’t get away from. And in turn, that’s sure to garner you a lot of social media engagement opportunities! Measure your campaigns easily… One of the features of stories on Facebook that caught our eye at Seek Social (and which will really help you as a business user) is the analytics suite. As with Facebook insights, these tools make it easier to see which of your posts were a success according to the metrics that are important to you. In turn, that allows you to make adjustments to your content, so that the next time you post stories on Facebook, they’re more suited to provide the audience reaction that you want. That could be social media engagement, online purchases, sales enquiries, or something else entirely… The point is, you’re given the tools to measure and improve your performance. Lastly, why should YOU be using stories on Facebook? By combining video and storytelling, stories create a veritable goldmine for social media engagement. As we mentioned earlier, you should be telling the story of the people at your organisation in order to create an affinity and trust with your followers, while video content is already proven to yield high amounts of social media engagement. So, the Seek Social team would say give it a go and see how you do… However, if you’d like some more personalised advice then we’re more than happy to help!

20,The Makeover of words Unicorn?,arts-entertainment," Did you know that there are 2 places worldwide in addition to the LGBTQ satisfaction, as well as Jesus Christ all that have the word unicorn in common? This might sound crazy, yet when you think about it, only an amazing creature of such misconception can be made use of for such a vast set up of contexts. Making use of the word Unicorn in history Given that the early 1200's (according to the books) words unicorn has actually been used to define either a person or point that is rather unusual and of high value to the rest of culture. This might be an individual that is very special to you or a start-up of a business worth a large amount. When we take a closer take a look at the word unicorn, we can acquire it from background also as the word originates from the Latin word ""unicornis"" which literally converts to ""having one horn"" where; ""uni"" equates to ""one"" and ""cornu"" indicating ""horn"". As we wrote over that the summary and also stories of unicorns aren't confirmed up until the in United Kingdom's Middle Ages, it has actually been revealed earlier in old Greek stories which stem back to as early as the fourth century. Back then the legendary creature was described as a pet resembling a donkey with a multi-colored single horn on it's head. Quickly after those stories, comparable stories turned up in India and also it's neighboring nations. So after that, just how did the unicorn ended up being the national animal of Scotland? From what's read above, it seems very unlikely that the unicorn would ever come to be the nationwide pet of Scotland, however it did. While the Center Ages were in full impact, the unicorn as well as it's icon, ended up being known and would eventually strongly represent the pet of pure hearts as well as it's power utilized for healing and also repair purposes. Only able to be tamed by a virgin as well as when it pertained to the spiritual signification, it would certainly stand for purity as well as chastity. Although Scotland and also England had it's differences in the past (as well as combated numerous of wars over region as well as regions), ultimately the 2 solid nations were really signing up with pressures using the icon of a Lion (which stood for England) and Scotland (which was naturally represented as the unicorn). Finally, in 1488 the gold coins made use of as money by the whole of Scotland as money remained in the typical tongue also described as unicorns ... because factors. Rainbows and Unicorns? Unicorns were initial related to rainbows around the early 18th century, where they were thought romantically with magnificent fantasies which can still be discovered on several forms of media today. Think about ""My Little Horse"" or perhaps simply kind words in Google and also you'll know exactly what we are describing. In addition to media, the LGBTQ movement that came to be much more energetic during the 1980's used the unicorn sign as a form of pride and was utilized during a number of protests. The LGBTQ activity however did not simply use the unicorn in association with power, yet also for it's wonderful as well as fabulous attributes. An additional means they used the unicorn symbol, although it's a little bit a lot more on the much less known ground is that of a community that utilizes words as jargon for defining females of a bisexual nature that sleep with an existing pair without any assumption of affection psychologically. As a unicorn, these people are tough to discover and thus comes the referral. Ventures and Unicorns? An additional way that unicorns are made use of in today's modern society is by associating them with ventures that deserve over one billion dollars. It's in a similar way unusual that firms are valued at this level and so, huge firms such as Spotify and also prominent Youtube Channels consisting of Buzzfeed as well as Taste would fall under this category. Companies that are somewhat bigger contrasted to those endeavors discussed above increase to a range of 10 as well as are described as decacorns. When it involves decacorns you can envision companies such as Snapchat, Uber and likewise Starbucks. The last scale that are one more 10 times larger are mainly included technical large firms who's profits is within the hundreds of billions such as Amazon, Microsoft, and also Apple (utilized to be). These companies would be described as of the hectocorn status. Unicorns and Style (declarations). Given that the early 2010's the unicorn became a growing number of a symbol found in daily life too where suppliers from all over Asia began to buzz up a variety of products that were everything about sparkles and also the fantastic appearances of the unicorn. There are dozens of online stores that provide items with designs indicating the marvelous as well as enchanting facets of this mythological creature.

1,Chair and table rentals for various events,arts-entertainment," Planning an event is not an easy task and there are a lot of things you want to consider. If you are looking for the appreciation of your guests, you have to focus on their needs from the start. There are a lot of things you have to consider and each of them will play an important role in the end. It is important to take it step by step to ensure the quality of the result and the comfort of the guests. But how can you take care of their comfort? How will be able to create the environment where they can feel comfortable? There are quite a few things you must consider ad each of them plays an important role. No matter what music you will play, what food you will serve or what drinks they can enjoy, one of the first and most important aspects you have to think of is furniture. Keeping your guests standing all night long is the last thing you want to do because it will ruin the entire event. They do not have to be punished and you must turn to chair and table rentals to ensure their comfort. If you invest a little bit of time in this and you find the sources you can rely on, you will be able to create the comfortable solutions you had in mind for all your guests. When you think about table rentals, you have to consider a number of other things. The size you will go for must be chosen based on the groups you want to organize. The shape of the tables has to be picked according to the architecture of the venue you use. Round shaped tables are one of the best solutions, but you can turn to rectangles to make better use of the space in the venue. Chair rentals must go hand in hand with the tables you have chosen. This happens because you want to use the same design to make the place look great. They must have a high backrest so your guests can relax after a few dances. If the aesthetics of the chairs does not suit your demands, you can decorate them to go well with the other elements. It is up to you to make these decisions. There are quite a few more aspects you must focus on other than table and chair rentals. The venue you will choose must be able to accommodate all your guests and the furniture must not be too crowded. You must be sure the space is properly ventilated because the heat can take its toll on your invitees. The dance floor must be large enough so most guests can have a good time. If you are not willing to cut any corners when it comes to the comfort of the people you invite to your event, you have to focus on each aspect that can make or break the result. You can use the web to find all the answers you need to make the right decisions."
2,How to get your book signed,arts-entertainment," When purchasing a book, the more of the author's hand writing that is in the book, the more a dealer will usually charge. Lately there is about a $25 dollar difference in the price of two otherwise identical books. Your name, and the authors signature, uses more ink than the signature alone. The ""To"" before your name uses more ink. It they DATE the autograph, this is more valuable, and if a short sentence is written, well that is more ink. An inscription to someone famous, is usually worth a price hike, and the ""Presentation"" copy, which is usually a copy the author gave to the people it is inscribed to, can be worth $100. The dedication copy, of which there is seldom more than one, can double the price of a book. Read the trade magazines, and the local newspaper for local conventions and books stores having author signing sessions. [My local Waldenbooks had an unannounced Esther Freisner signing a year ago, and I didn't find out about it until the day after.] Keep a list of either the books that you want to get signed, or note the fact that a book is signed on the plastic bag or dust jacket protector of your book. Another way to mark the book is to put a thin white paper book marker between the front cover pages. I also suggest that you confirm that the book you are bringing to a signing session is NOT already signed. When you go to a signing session, go early. It is better to wait a half hour before the session, than an hour on a line. You also meet the nicest people on those lines. Remember, they like the same book that you do. Most signing sessions have some rules. The primary rule may be a limit on the number of books to be signed, or that books that have to be purchased at that store. Usually, if you purchase one book, you can get a second book signed. The number of books at these sessions is usually 3, but this may vary depending on how long a line is. There is seldom a restriction on your getting back in the line, though I have also had that happen. Please follow the rules. Mark the page you want signed with either a white paper book mark or by tucking the dust jacket in the page. I prefer the white paper. I also like to use the title page (the one with the copy right information on the back) for signatures of author, editor and illustrator. Sometimes there is a title only page just before the title page. I only put signatures there if the page has the author's name, or if I need room for 2 or 3 signatures. For Anthologies I like to use the table of contents (I never did find a signature that was 'supposedly' somewhere in a book that I bought). If you want a book inscribed to you, neatly print your name on a piece of paper. This is another good use for that white page marker. I suggest Pencil to write this, just to avoid ink blots. Don't get upset if the author is not doing any personalizing in books; several authors have problems that prevent them from long signing sessions. Bring your own pen. The author will probably have their own pen, but just in case the reader prior to you just stole that, bring an extra. AND be prepared to give that pen away. I rarely use my ""Andre gave me that pen"" for signing, since I don't want to loose it. I don't suggest felt pens, unless you have tested it and it doesn't bleed through the pages."

The movie was written by Julian Fellowes who also wrote all 6 series of the Downton Abbey collection, and fans will be pleased to learn that the movie follows on from the series featuring all characters that were still alive, except Lady Rose MacClare as she went to live in New York in the finale of Season 6. The film is set near the end of 1926, a year and half after the last episode of series 6, in the stately home at Highclere Gardens, where the aristocratic characters Lord and Lady Grantham have the seat at the fictionally named stately home 'Downton Abbey' in Yorkshire. There's not much we can give away about the actual movie at this stage, however we can promise a movie of epic proportions, moving from the small screen to the big seamlessly incorporating the fierce sibling rivalry of Lady Mary and Edith who struggles to adapt to her new rank of Marchioness. The return of Carson in service is needed as a royal appearance from Queen Mary and Princess Royal comes to Downton. Aerial drone filming began late September 2018 and featured the magnificent Highclere Gardens house, gardens and estate, set in Hampshire. Marzano Films drone filming team also took on the filming of the fictional home of Baron and Baroness Merton at 'Crawley House', which is supposed to be set in Yorkshire, however the actual external filming for this property takes place in Bampton, Oxfordshire with the internal filming takes place in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Marzano Films is a seasoned veteran at aerial filming, helicopter aerial filming and drone filming. Working with high profile celebrities such as Dame Maggie Smith, Hugh Bonneville and Matthew Goode to name just a few from Downton Abbey the movie is always a real honour. The Marzano aerial filming crew made certain their time on camera was picture perfect, using the high tech Alta 8 and Movi Pro specialist drone filming equipment to bring unique aerial photography and filming to the whole film. The film director, Michael Engler wanted to capture a range of interesting angles and camera shots which are very difficult for some camera photography to do without seeing the camera equipment or people operating, however with drone aerial filming, we are capable of capturing intricate camera work without interrupting the actors or the flow of the sequence. Our drone technology is exceptionally advanced, using the Alta 8 and Movi Pro in both underslung and overslung camera angles for great benefit to the overall performance captured. Aerial filming took place in and around Highclere Gardens set in Hampshire, Bampton in Oxfordshire, Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire and drone aerial filming over Yorkshire countryside and Ripon to place the Yorkshire scenery with both Lord Crawley's estate and Lord Merton's Oxfordshire cottage. As any dedicated Downton Abbey fan will know the servant areas beneath the house in the hall and the kitchens aren't actually filmed in the same place, they are a fictional fabrication purposely built in Ealing Studios several miles from Highclere Gardens, these scenes were aerially filmed independently of the house and therefore several drone team members worked across different locations at the same time, piecing the footage together to create the servants leaving the kitchen and entering the house seamlessly. We look forward to seeing this on our screens September 13th 2019!"

5,Best Clipping Path Service Provider,arts-entertainment," Clipping Path- What is it? Regardless of your profession, you might be in need of photo editing at some point of your life. Perhaps you're thinking why on earth you would ever need photo editing unless you're in business, advertising, graphic designs, or photo-shoots. Yes, indeed these professions demand the recurrent use of photo editing. Yet, if you don't need it professionally, you'll definitely need it if you intend to crop or extract any particular part from your photo or image. And in order to do that, you must know some basics of cutting and cropping in Photoshop. One of the most popular image cropping or cutting ways is Clipping Path. Let's get technical- How does it work? Before going into step by step detail, you must get familiar with terms like 'pen tool', 'anchor points', 'handles', 'curves', 'cones', 'selection tool' etc. The 'pen tool' is the key tool for applying the clipping path. Indeed, it requires expert hands to give you the best result. Photoshop experts are efficient in using the pen tool, especially when it comes to navigate the 'handles' to curve the 'anchor points'. All the magic hides in the combination of 'handle' and 'anchor points' navigation. Let's have a quick look at the process- What our experts basically do is simply assess the image our client intends to extract. It needs professional eyes to count the number of curves needed for each image. An anchor point basically works as the starting point or one end of a line, and the second anchor point is placed in another suitable direction. The handle is used to navigate the anchor points to make the curves bigger, smaller, less or more curved. In this way, the desired image is extracted from original image and/or the background is removed as per client's need. The extracted portion may be placed further against another background. https://www.clippingpathresource.com/"
6,The Theory Of Strings/Theory Of Everything In The Modern (Ink) Painting Practice?,arts-entertainment," ""There are many common bonds between science and art. They both begin with noticing and recording patterns—spatial patterns, patterns in time, patterns of process and behavior. They both elaborate, reformulate, and ultimately link together patterns, in nature and meaning, which initially appeared as unrelated. Both art and science are involved with order-disorder transitions and the creation of tension and the relief of tension. Both endeavors are deeply rooted in culture and heritage; both expand our awareness and sensitivity to what is happening in nature, and in ourselves."" ~ Dr.Frank Oppenheimer (1912-1985) American particle physicist, founder of the Exploratorium in San Francisco ""The greatest scientists are artists as well."" ~ Albert Einstein (1879-1955), from The Expanded Quotable Einstein, collected and edited by Alice Calaprice, 2000, p. 245 After the publication of my article titled ""Sumi-e Painting From the Perspective of a Traditional Academically-trained European Artist"" in 2013 for Beyond Calligraphy magazine, I received several requests to clarify (and expand) certain points and theses I presented there. Here I will try to explain what I could call ""verbalizing the revival of a fundamental cognitive-creative process,"" which I have intuitively applied almost from the very beginning of my expression as a painter and drawer and intentionally for more than 20 years. ""They are shaman-artists who constantly strive to look into the blueprint of creation beyond the visual crowd and the noise of superficial details, the one on task to explore and communicate with a primary game of opposite values during composition and construction of a coherent imagery. They paint from both levels, the personal and the intimate and the universal one which emerges from life-giving tension. Sumi-e Painting From the Perspective of a Traditional Academically-trained European Artist."" ~ A.F.Krupa, Beyond Calligraphy, 2013 What is this about? I must admit that I have found explanation of my own art work, which I approached based on the inner charge and feeling, outside the field of art — in the sphere of theoretical physics, in the so-called ""theory of strings."" Simply put, the theory of strings is the theoretical framework for understanding all the powers in the universe (the so-called ""theory of everything"") and claims that all matter and energy in the universe consists of one-dimensional strings. Also, the theory of strings claims that the universe does not have a 3 + 1 dimension (3 are so-spatial dimensions — point, line, space — and time is the fourth), but at least a dozen (or more) spatial-temporal dimensions. The more I have read about the theory of strings, the more I have understood that my artistic exploration and occupation of a one-dimensional (or ""non-existent"") line and its movement through an illusory ""non-dimensional"" space, i.e., a one-dimensional plane (in a ""short section of time"") as a fundamental building/ the constructive element of the painting/drawing corresponds to the scientific study of the idea of a one-dimensional string (strings) as the fundamental material of all matter and energy in the universe. I realized that pulling the line of the ink (or something else) to show the bare essence, i.e., the reduction of the expressive means only to the choice of direction, length and thickness of the line (Minimalism, Reductivism, Hakubyou), has a multidimensional (from 3 + 1) and a mathematical basis (something that the brain makes in the semi/multi-dimensional level, and the artist perceives as ""a sense/feeling"" and ""a spontaneity""(Informalism/Art Enformel?), but basically represents a mathematical fraction, a fragment, a vector (as we have in music, for example) and where the mind of the artist just recognizes and monitors already existent ""gravitational"" forces, directions, building blocks on the ""blank"" surface of the board, canvas, paper, where the mind of an artist follows through the insight into another ""alternative"" dimension the most common/most meaningful inner, i.e., hidden, forms which we see not in ""material"" nature. They are perceived by the eye of the observer through the drawing process described here. It is this ""blueprint of the creation and the way of research"" and the ""life-giving tension"" mentioned in the previous text. What was interesting to me in introspection and self-analysis (which this is!) is that I certainly do not belong to that group of artists (definitely valuable and inspired) who have begun to create certain forms and indulge in certain visual expressions as a direct response to the knowledge of the existence of the string theory and as an attempt to visualize/illustrate this theory either as an independent initiative or in collaboration with theoretical physicists. Contrary to that, I belong to that ""group"" (type of contemporary painter) who create a contemporary visual expression and artistic language but derive from traditional expressive techniques and directions (hence the cognitive-creative processes described above may possibly be applied to the whole ""group""). In my case it is about the amalgam of the West (minimalism, reductivism, expressionism, informalism, etc.) and East Asian (zen?) practices and approaches. However, terms such as ""hidden space dimensions,"" ""weird curved spaces,"" ""duality,"" ""mirror symmetry,"" and others found in the physical theory of strings are exactly the terms that we have to apply if we want to accurately describe some of the arts (by certain art theorists ""traditional and non-contemporary"") approaches and techniques such as this basic calligraphy and ink painting (Sumi-E) in particular. How to interpret it? Where does this timeless contemporaneous state come from? It is possible to correctly interpret it if we recognize and acknowledge the next creative mechanism: the authentic ""artistic mind,"" that is, when it functions in synchrony with the assumed multidimensional ""reality,"" behaves (""vibrates"") according to the nature and structure of this reality (here it would be the assumed ""string,"" which is then its own structure/architecture) apparently spontaneously (like surrealistic automatic drawing and painting?), pulling those lines that, as enlarged one-dimensional strings, describe ""gravitational forces and the most logical paths through seemingly empty and non-existent space"" on the paper surface in an attempt to present the motif essence. Also because of this, the ""artistic mind"" in some form may be preceded by or parallel to the ""scientific mind"" and hence it comes to the same or similar insights by using another approach (classical dichotomy rational/intellectual vs. irrational/sensual that is abolished with the moment of cognition). Great scientists such as Albert Einstein, Michael Faraday and Nikola Tesla all reported that they used mental imagery when describing their thought processes. Studies have also found that mental imagery plays a central role during the construction and evaluation of many scientific ""thought experiments,"" in which a scientist mentally assesses the implications of a particular hypothesis. Research and creation continues. Possibly toward the ideal of the Artist-scientist (the one of the Jungian archetypes)."
7,Sumi-e from the Perspective of a Traditional Academically-trained European Artist,arts-entertainment," ""It is not mere aquisition of knowledge, but a change in being."" J.M.W.Turner What I respect the most within sumi-e is its nature of contrast, of opposition, the visual – morphological tension that flows during application. It is easy to note the link, inherent link, to the universal and basic symbolism best expressed in the famous Ying-Yang symbol or its versions from other cultures; The Star of David, the Sumerian equal branch cross etc. If we think in that manner, every sumi-e painter is a kind of priest, a magician. They are shaman-artists who constantly strive to look into the blueprint of creation beyond the visual crowd and the noise of superficial details, the one on task to explore and communicate with a primary game of opposite values during composition and construction of a coherent imagery. They paint from both levels, the personal and the intimate and the universal one which emerges from life-giving tension. Every Ink image, every Sumi-e painting, is a unique crossroad of oppositions, of directions, of intentions. They are all constant reminders of the duality of creation and the accuracy of the equation where two equals one. And one thing more. Ink painting is an ancient and genuine East Asian pictorial form, usually associated with the Zen tradition, older than two millenia and originating in the historical ""Era of the Warring States"". It is one of the major pictorial forms of the world and is in the realm of the mental concepts of simplification, abstraction and purification. It corresponds to the creative mind of the European Upper Paleolithic muralists of Altamira, Escoural, Niaux, Cougnac, and Lascaux, a mind with the desire to express all and everything with very few strokes, stains and hues. Over here with pigments mixed with fat or blood applied to a cave wall, over there with a solution of pine tree soot utilized in rice/mulberry/bamboo paper. The study of ink painting for me began in the late 80’s with a former student of the famous Polish painter and member of the ""Young Poland"" movement, Prof. Jozef Mehoffer (1869-1946), my Grandfather and renowned Croatian-Yugoslavian watercolor painter and draftsman Prof. Alfred Krupa (Alfred Joseph Krūppa , 1915-1989, born Mikolow, Poland, died Karlovac, Croatia.) At the Academy of Fine Arts (University of Zagreb), I studied with Professors Josip Biffel, Nikola Koydl, Vasilije Jordan and Zlatko Kauzlaric and graduated in 1995, presenting an exhibition of en plein air watercolors. From 1998-1999, I studied with Prof. Akira Itoh at the Research Institute of Fine Arts at Tokyo Gakugei University, as the first Croatian painter-recipient of a Japanese Government Scholarship. My pedagogical work started in 1993, but since 2004, I have been teaching fine arts, a group of courses at the Secondary School Duga Resa in the graphic design department. In 2013 it will have been 20 years since I was given my first scroll of rice paper and an ink stick from my university professor Zlata Meštrović at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. One of my primary goals in my own artistic expression is to avoid the abyss of being ""cute"", ""tasty"", ""nice"" and any other deeply rooted formalism (particularly in stereotypical motives/composition and superficial ""spirituality""). On other hand, I am trying to reach direct, spontaneous, raw expression, with a heavy emphasis on personal and authentic artistic handwriting. Some people are focused on, or even obsessed with the ""beauty"" of line and its graciosity. And that is a legitimate intention and a necessary one in calligraphic writing, but it is not my path. At the end of the day, I will produce my own shape, my own drawing texture and my own morphology of a line. I do not care if it is ""ugly"", almost always a subjective description, or ""imperfect"", or not in keeping with a traditional view and a consideration of ""craftmanship"". It must be a genuine and direct materialisation and footprint of my mind’s flow and structure along with my feeling. And when such an ""event"" occurs, by default, it inherently contains clarity and artistic honesty. With this approach, I believe that I will create original art, original at its very root, my own artistic grammar. The above is one of the reasons I use mainly ink and watercolor. It does not allow me corrections and second thoughts. In my teaching, I constantly suggest to my pupils, in an effort to avoid scribble and smudge, to gain substantial drawing experience, first in dry techniques like pencil, chalk, chacoal, and pastel, and to master perspective, composition, proportion and all other basic elements in front of a real life model/motif still-life before they begin with Ink. My own work reveals me, who I am without a mask, non-verbal communication, a paradise for the trained eye of a psychologist. In my watercolors I always try to be transparent, fluid, something hardwired in me by family tradition. Watercolor is poetic, ultimately subtle and fresh in its nature. That is what I am seeking in that particular medium. But, when it comes to my Chinese Inks, I do not dilute full black with water because water means shades, and that means options. I do not want to have options. I want to create legitimate personal raw expression in a situation with minimum technical possibilities. An achievement in circumstances of objective difficulties/limitations contains additional value. This is not a new approach and certainly is not my own invention. Long ago it was named Hakubyou 白描 or Hakuga 白画 or ""White drawing"". As a finished work, hakubyou rejects color, believed to inhibit the freedom of brushlines. Motifs. I adore nature. Thus, landscapes in general and trees and rivers in particular are the most chosen compositions of my work. But, as is self-evident, those landscapes do not resemble Chinese or Japanese scenery morphology, often imitated by Western artists. Since I am born in Europe, I am, by that definition, Western. Different energies are imprinted in my genes. Any copying of once original artistic forms by famous East Asian painter-legends are not an option for me (except for the purpose of study/learning). I would consider myself to be a liar to say otherwise. The several months study as a postgraduate research student at Tokyo Gakugei University (東京学芸大学) or Gakudai (学大) in 1998 and 1999, particularly the journey to the Hakone National Park (Fuji-Hakone-Izu Kokuritsu Kōen) near Fuji-San on an old route from Tokyo to Kyoto (including a visit to lake Ashinoko, sulfuric water springs, Hakone Shinto Shrine/Hakone Jinja etc.) showed to me the contrast between the scenery of Japan and where I live, in central Croatia, including a specific taste and smell of space and place. It is true that I still treasure that experience in my heart and mind. And not just that, it was an experience which could be described as a permanent transformatory one. My work has been changed forever, but I still remain a European artist. In deciding which materials to choose, I am completely unorthodox. I work with and on everything within my grasp; all kinds of ink sticks or already prepared liquid ink, rice-mulberry paper, cotton paper, bamboo paper, watercolor rug paper, cardboard, among many. I work from time to time even on canvas prepared for oil painting and in combination with other techniques (multi-media). To traditional brushes made of Bear Hair, Wolf Hair/Weasel Hair, Horse Mane or blue Siberian squirrel hair, I add sticks made from wood, bamboo pens, plastic feathers with a built-in ink bottle cap, etc. With our historical/artistic and social experience, in my humble opinion, everything is suitable to express the creative genius of a contemporary artist."
8,Turning Your Story From Pain to Profits,arts-entertainment," People often ask me how I got started writing one-person shows and I’ve never been able to quite, definitively nail down a concrete answer. Oftentimes I’ve said, ""out of artistic necessity,"" and while that is an absolute truth, it’s only part of the answer. Although I had been a professional actor in Los Angeles, for many, many, many years, I felt like I wasn’t landing the caliber of roles that showcased my unique set of skills. I was an actor who could sing. I had superb comedic timing and I could conjure up such emotional depth in characters that allows me the ability to be totally present, and if need be, authentically cry on a dime. I also possess the rare ability to portray many different walks-of-life from the seediest of characters to the noblest of gentlemen. Why wasn’t I working? Early in my career I had booked a few leads in several independent films, and guest-starred in many television shows, but most of those roles did not lead to more fulfilling parts or a steady acting career. I was at a stalemate and did not know how to dig myself out of the trenches. It wasn’t until a former acting teacher, who knew I was also a writer, asked, ""Why aren’t you writing material for yourself?"" I thought about the question a while, and honestly didn’t have a concrete answer. So, I responded by saying, ""I don’t know."" I had never really thought about it. I had written a few books, articles and plays for others, but the thought of writing something specifically for me never crossed my mind. In fact, my first thought was that it seemed a little bit egocentric. Then I started thinking about film actor/directors I admired like: Sylvester Stallone, Robert Townsend, Matt Damon, Barbara Streisand, and Spike Lee. These artists had the tenacity to create film projects for themselves when Hollywood wasn’t banging down their doors. But I didn’t have any money or the knowledge of how to get a film script made into a movie. However, I did innately understand theatre, so I set out to develop a stage play for myself. That turned out to be a daunting task as well. It wasn’t until I was introduced to the works of Roger Guenveur Smith, Whoopi Goldberg, Lilli Tomlin and John Leguizamo that a light bulb went off in my head and I thought, ""I could do that."" However, that ""Ah ha,"" moment was easier said, then done. First off, who wants to perform an hour and a half long monologue? The thought of trying to memorize pages and pages of dialogue was intimidating enough to make me want to give up before I even started. Especially since, even though I was an actor and trained to memorize lines, I didn’t have the best long-term memory. As I continued to ""toy,"" with the idea, I relaxed my racing mind and finally got around to, ""What would I write about?"" What I discovered was; I had a lot to say and even more to write. I started thinking about the essays and emails I had written and the topics I passionately spoke about with family and friends. Then it became clear that I would write about the plight of urban education. Alas, my first solo show, Did You Do Your Homework? was born. However, crafting it wasn’t easy. I knew I had something important to say and that getting it out of my head onto the page would be vital in developing the story, but I really had no clue how to start. Everything seemed to be jumbled up and every time I sat sit down to begin, I always found myself getting stuck in a ""brain freeze."" Frustrated, because I knew I had a story to tell, I almost allowed myself to give up. Then I thought to myself, ""I need to approach writing this piece from a different perspective."" I can’t start by simply writing the story from beginning to end. I have to first, alleviate my frustration by purging my head and hashing out all the ideas I have in it. Then I thought, ""How do I do that?"" The answer, ""brainstorming."" Once I got all my ideas on paper, I could physically see them and go about organizing and arranging them, piece by piece, into an ""outline,"" that was cohesive and chronological. It was only then, that I could begin writing my story. But it didn’t stop there, because what I found, after my first couple of drafts, was that even though my story had a lot of content and interesting characters, it had no heart. It had no deep, pressing purpose or reason why I was telling the story and what made this story so uniquely personal to me. It had no depth. What I discovered was that I had not made the story deeply personal to me. It did not contain what made me a uniquely giving and passionate individual and artist. Even though I intellectually knew that by doing so, would make my story stronger and more affable to audiences, I didn’t want to be that vulnerable. I didn’t want to risk opening up my heart and letting complete strangers in. I wrote, Did You Do Your Homework? out of a need to talk about urban education. Most importantly I wrote this show so that educators could recognize, that although urban kids sometimes come to school with a myriad of social, economic and physical issues, at their core, many of them want the same things out of life as everyone else. They just may not know how to access their own feelings and ambitions because of the trauma they may be dealing with on a daily basis. They haven’t been taught to dream. I was once one of those urban kids who had gone through and survived trauma. I was physically and mentally abused and as a result used drugs and alcohol to numb my pain through middle and high school. In high school, I would go to school all bruised up and sleep through my first period class because I had been up all night, taking extreme blows to my chest, in order to keep my step-father off of my mom. I would then sleep through sixth period because I needed the rest and the strength for the night to come. I suffered in silence. My ninth-grade teacher would constantly kick me out of class if I showed up late or slept in her first period. It wasn’t until I got to tenth grade and had a teacher by the name of Jim Underhill who recognized that there was more to me than just the appearance of defiant behavior. He lifted my spirits by encouraging me to be and do more than what I thought was physically possible. He, along with my mom, constantly reinforced the notion that there’s greatness inside me, even when I didn’t believe it. Once I actualized my perspective on why I needed to tell this story and how teachers needed to remove all preconceived notions of who and what urban students are, then I had a way in to the hearts and minds of my audiences. They could relate to the struggles and pains of physical and substance abuse and how a man struggling with his own demons is trying to make a difference in the world. At first glance Did You Do Your Homework? is a 12-character solo show about the bureaucracy of urban education and one substitute teacher’s journey through the inner dealings of an urban classroom. However, once you peel back the onion, it becomes a human being’s way of recognizing pain and using it as a catalyst to heal and inspire students going through seemingly insurmountable odds. I wrote this play having been a former teacher. Initially, it was a means to an end. A way to showcase my talents as an actor, singer, and writer. It was also a way for me to use social commentary to perform and talk about issues that were important to me. What I discovered during the writing process was the more it became deeply personal the more authentic and profound my script became. The result; a show, that was slated for one weekend, ran 9 months at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, making it the longest running show in the history of that organization. It also amassed, national and international, critical acclaim, and garnered several awards, including an International Gala Star from Bacau, Romania, a Roar of the Crowd recognition from Goldstar, and a NAACP Theatre Award. This came to fruition because I made a conscious decision to open my heart and let the story I had inside me out. By telling my own deeply personal narrative, from my perspective, in a voice that was uniquely mine, I unleashed my own power, motivated others, and authentically moved audiences. I said, ""YES!"" took a leap of faith and jumped.  It is the best decision I have ever made involving the empowered trajectory of my career. Sometimes you have to get out of your own way and forge your own path in order to fulfill your true passion. You’ve got to, ""Jump without a net, and let your conscious passion guide your subconscious dreams into figuring out how you are going to fly."" Everyone has a story. What is yours? Whether you feel your life has been ordinary, extraordinary or somewhere in between, you have a life experience that warrants the probability of connecting with and inspiring others. Most people think they have nothing to say. They think their lives are boring, monotonous, or mundane. That there is nothing special about them that would warrant people paying attention, let alone paying money, to sit and watch their story unfold. When I hear people say, ""I don’t have anything to write about,"" ""I have nothing to say,"" or ""My life is boring,"" it drives me nuts, because those statements cannot be further from the truth. They’re unreal and firmly rooted in fear. Storytelling is an art that encourages personal narrative. How many people think they do not have anything to write about? How many think they have nothing to say? How many think their lives are boring, meaningless or mundane? Millions! Saying, ""I have nothing…,"" connects you with a community of folks who feel invisible, isolated, undervalued, and even worthless. How many of us have felt this way at one time or another in our lives? I know I have. How many people have said, ""There, but for the grace of God…,"" in recognition that other’s misfortune could have been our own? That statement alone connects us with the experiences of others. So, instead, start with, ""I have nothing to say."" What you will discover is that you will instantly connect and draw in people who will hear that statement tugging at their heart strings. The reason; so many people feel that way. It is that simple. What is the story you want to tell and how do you authentically want to create it from your perspective? You are unique. Whatever the topic or subject matter, no one has your life experiences or point of view. No one can tell your story, from your perspective, better than YOU. The real purpose of your life is to fulfill your dreams. Your only responsibility in this process, is to fully commit to your own joy and challenge yourself to go beyond what is comfortable. The time is ""now,"" to develop your creative abilities and finally step into your true artistic greatness. Exercise your mind to get out of its own way and turn your ""pain,"" from ""passion,"" to ""profits."" Are you ready? Begin."
9,'Bringing Rhythm and blues back home',arts-entertainment," A phrase that was coined by the great Bluesman himself Willie Dixon that ‘The Blues are the roots and everything else is the fruits', but who would have guessed that the genre would become unrecognizable to itself to some degree in later years. Rhythm and blues have seen many changes reflecting, social, political and emotional values and new and old musical innovations that has seen the genre being reinvented over time. In the late 2000s, the genre entered a bit of a slump, losing some of the characteristics that were inherent to the style An example of this are the groups of the late '90s like Boyz to men and En Vogue who took their styles from the singing groups of the forties before disappearing commercially only to be replaced by a music with heavier beats which less resembled its original form and the growing popularity of Hip hop It is when RnB went through the process of being made more accessible through writers and producers by the medium of ''pop music that caused it to have changes of identity. But what has happened in last decade or so is that we now have two distinct styles, one that goes under the heading of 'contemporary RnB' and the other which is arguably not as popular, but is more aligned with the older more raw characteristic's of the genre, primarily the 'Blues and Jazz influence. This can be viewed as an RnB subculture if you like. Since the beginning of the decade till now, the more organic variety of Rhythm and blues has come back into focus. Artists have emerged that are once again crafting interesting arrangements. Also lyrical content has become more varied again with the emphasis shifting away from just the emotional content of romantic love to broader subjects that RnB has previously covered, 'What's going on' by Marvin Gaye set the benchmark for this A Great example was first hearing Gregory Porters 'Liquid spirit' which contains interesting metaphors with the use of the word liquid to describe the freedom of spirit and culture and how it's been manipulated and cut off. Also, his later hit 'Take me to the alley' which was inspired by His mother and a visit by the Pope coming to town that year. He writes about the integrity of those who are comfortably off, by showing kindness to those who are not., this expresses deeper qualities of the human condition. by the image the lyric paints. The character in the song is the 'king' who takes a detour away from the prosperous area of town to the alley where the poor are living. On hearing Hosiers 'Nina cried power' which also has a metaphorical style to the lyric about all the Soul, Blues and Folk greats who share a common vision, set to a driving rhythm that sounds like an old Gospel tune with modern production techniques is really refreshing. Other interesting artists like Alabama shakes who sound like they took Sister Rosetta Tharpe into the swamp with them have also sold well and changed the face of the genre. Two more offerings worth a mention here are Zara Mcfarlane 'Peace begins within' and very recently D'angelos 'Unshaken' which deal with spiritual growth inwardly towards what is going on in the outside world, which represent a broader scope of subject matter in the lyric whilst taking the timbre of the old styles which the people still want to hear. The conclusion is that some may cast a divide between what is RnB and what isn't ,but more intelligently you could just say that contemporary artists like Khalid, Jordan Rakei and Ella Mai along with the artists that are mentioned above just fall under a very large umbrella (no Rihanna pun intended) that all these artists can get underneath. But what is also important is that RnB is so much more than what exists in the RnB chart. So when you type your search into Google for RnB, cast your route out from the charts and go into undiscovered waters as there is much more out there."

11,My First Fiction Novel,arts-entertainment," I was absolutely elated when we finally landed in Texas, and arrived at the airport waiting area for military basic trainees. But then things quickly went down hill when a short, stocky sergeant wearing a smokey the bear hat, and tan short-sleeve cotton shirt and trousers, known as 1505s, began screaming at us at the top of his lungs. Needless to say this demanded my attention, and the attention of all the other unlucky young men who had been ordered to form a single line, really fast. This was my unpleasant introduction to the United States Air Force. I'll never forget that evening. However, that's not the main focus of this article. My life had changed drastically over three-plus decades in the military: I married, had two sons, became an officer, and moved at least sixteen times, living in the States, and overseas, mostly in military housing, and realizing we would move again, every two to three years. In fact, my wife and I became experts in preparing to move to the next assignment. That all ended in August 2001, thirty-four years after that shocking introduction to the military in San Antonio's International Airport, when I retired from the Air Force. Get this, my last assignment––of all places––was at the White House, and it was an extraordinarily interesting assignment! I left the military just over one month before the worst terrorist attack in the history of our nation. The country was still reeling from the horror of 9/11 when we moved into our new home outside of Washington, D.C., and didn't have to worry about budging again. Nevertheless, the attack prompted me to go back to work as quickly as possible. I started a new career in the post 9/11 era. I worked for a brief time as a contractor at the United States Department of State, with Diplomatic Security. It was pretty interesting work. Then I lucked out, and landed a job with the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) doing exactly what I wanted to do: working intelligence and security-related issues for the department. I worked with lots of talented people who were serious about improving the safety of our traveling public, and the nation’s transportation system. My colleagues were simply decent Americans. However, all good things come to an end. I left DOT after twelve interesting and fulfilling years of work. This time, I actually retired, and remain happily so today. Now, I've published my first fiction novel, a thriller called The Private Investigator. I attempted to weave into my novel unique real-life experiences I had in both the military and work in the federal government. The story begins in Washington, D.C., and the main character, a former military police investigator, and now a PI that works for an international investigative firm, is assigned a case that takes him from D.C. to Hong Kong, and South Korea in pursuit of leads. His worldly skills, background as a military police investigator, and the fact that he had been assigned in Asia when he was on active duty, allowed the Protagonist to maneuver with relative ease in that part of the world. However, my principal character’s journey is full of surprises, and challenges. He interacts with many other colorful and interesting characters throughout the story, to include a USDOT contract employee who was duped and recruited by a North Korean spy. The main character also runs afoul of the Korean National Police while in 'The Land of the Morning Calm'. On the whole, this novel has an exciting, and pleasing end to it. I hope you’ll pick up a copy of my book and enjoy the story. I'd also be interested in your feedback."

13,The success of the computer games industry,arts-entertainment," The computer games industry has become one of the most profitable and has caught up in the film industry and sports industry in terms of profit growth. The data became known after the publication in January of the current year of a report by two well-known analytical companies SuperData and Unity Technologies. The title of the report is more than saying: ""It cannot stop and will not stop"". Indeed, the global financial crisis does not so beneficially affect any sector of the economy: people have played and continue to play. Therefore, factors that would be able to stop the financial growth of the computer games industry do not yet exist. The revenue of the gaming market in 2016 amounted to more than 90 billion US dollars and increased compared to the data for 2015 by 3 billion dollars. The most profitable segment was digital entertainment for mobile devices. Its yield increased by 23.6%. According to statistics, every sixth inhabitant of the planet at least once played on a mobile device. The popularity of ""toys"" is inherently associated with the development of gadgets and depends on it. Therefore, the improvement of mobile devices is only in the hands of the gaming industry. Where the gaming industry is most profitable Gamers from Asia: China, Japan, and South Korea made the biggest ""contribution"" to the growth of profits of the computer games industry. You can identify several reasons for this. First, the inhabitants of these developed countries are more actively using gadgets. Secondly, Asian gamers can afford to regularly invest a lot of money in the field of digital fun. At the same time, the Chinese do not have access to Google Play. Electronic entertainment developers are seriously targeting Asian audiences. According to statistics, one Japanese gamer brings the gaming industry three times more income than its American ""colleague."" It should be borne in mind that the population of Japan is almost 2.5 times smaller than the United States, and, accordingly, there are more players in America. What are the advantages of the gaming industry Entertainment software association Experts recognize that the computer games industry has a future. The reasons for its rapid growth are mobility and the ability to respond to requests from different social and age groups. Download and run the game from anywhere in the world where there is access to the Internet. In order to spend time on entertainment, you can use any gadget. The age of the global audience of gamers is from 10 to 40 years. The most active age segment is 33-35 years. Michael Gallagher, president of the Entertainment Software Association, a leader in the US gaming industry, said their product could affect all areas of modern life: from education and business to art and leisure. However, social and MMO entertainments remain the most popular among all the world’s players for the current year. Cybersport is one of the directions of the computer games industry. So far, its profitability is modest compared to income from entertainment for mobile devices. However, market researchers prophesy a great future for such a ""sport"". Worldwide championships are held on popular team entertainment, which gathers thousands of audiences. Fans pay for the right to watch the broadcast of matches, due to deductions from tickets, multimillion-dollar prize funds are formed. Cybersport is interesting to investors. Cyber-sport organizations invest money in equipment, maintenance of teams, training bases, wages to cyber-trainers. As in traditional sports, tough competition and scandals, including doping ones, cannot be avoided here. Recently, the e-sports league has tightened measures for the use of drugs by players that stimulate brain activity, increase concentration and accelerate the reaction. Online sweepstakes working with bets made on the results of competitions. Registered cases of match fixtures and situations where players bet on themselves. Despite scandals and unclean bets, eSports continues to enthrall the audience. And this hobby has already been seriously recognized by some professional sports journalists."

15,Installation Technology of Plant Walls,arts-entertainment," Generally speaking, plant walls include ecological plant walls and artificial plant walls. The artificial plant wall is a wall that is decorated with artificial plants with high simulation. People take advantage of similarity of artificial plants and real plants to obtain an effect of plant walls or an effect which can not be achieved by real plants. The real plant wall needs to be designed according to the habit and the variety of the plant, while artificial plant wall doesn't. Compared with the real plant wall, the artificial plant wall has lower costs and more effects. A green wall is a wall covered with greenery. We take advantage of plant roots being adapted for the environment to make plants grow on the vertical wall. Usually, installing a lamp which is suitable for growth of plants on the top of the green wall will make the green wall more beautiful. Currently, there are two kinds of installation technologies of green walls in China. One is a green wall with a framework, the other is without a framework. Green walls without frameworks adopt a flexible material, and they can be directly installed on brick walls, concrete walls, wooden walls, etc. Green walls without frameworks have advantages of having no frameworks, natural landscape, low maintenance costs, being ultra thin, ultra light, flexible and convenient. A framework is laid out on the original wall. The framework should be stick to the wall or parallelly laid out on the wall, with a distance of 5 to 10cm. Then, put flowerpots with plants into the framework. The advantage of this kind of technology is that it is more convenient to replace the plant. However, the disadvantage is that the framework must be fixed on the wall, and the framework will easily rust and fall off, causing hidden danger after a long time. Therefore, a green wall without a framework is better."
16,Not Always The Bulleye,arts-entertainment," Dylan came to me with a pile of financial concerns. Would he keep his job? Would he have to sell some of his rental properties to stay afloat? Would he be able to afford the alimony payments to his three wives – and was he going to have to consider making payments to a fourth? I centred myself and concentrated on his energy. After a few moments, I told him I felt his employment situation was stable, he would keep all his rental properties, his wives would all remarry within a month of each other and his alimony concerns would fly out the door. ""Great!"" he exclaimed. ""That’s just what I was hoping for!"" Well, six month later, Dylan emailed me to tell me how wrong I’d been. He’d been downsized to a position that paid less money, and he had to sell two apartment buildings because a couple ex-wives took him to court for more money. And the only thing that flew out the door was wife number four. (Though he did confide he had an eye on a potential number five.) I told him I was sorry things had turned out they did. And then I spent the rest of the afternoon moping because I hadn’t been able to help Dylan. Why had I gotten the reading so wrong? I came up with three reasons why readings may not turn out as forecasted: Our freedom of choice to follow or disregard any advice we get. Before each reading, I always tell clients, ""A reading is only as good as the moment it’s given."" That’s because what I intuit can change, because you have the freedom to live your life as you see fit. For example, I may intuit the possibility of disease, but if that person decides to change her diet and begin exercising, that person may not get seriously ill. In these instances, I’m always happy to learn my first feeling was incorrect. Sometimes, things in life are outside our control. I’m always reminded of the story of the very credible medium (I can vouch for him) who gave a very thorough reading to a client, who was then killed in an automobile accident on the way home. When he learned of what had happened, he was stunned: ""I never saw that!"" he said, dazed. People want to believe something so badly, they project those beliefs into their aura. I wonder if this was Dylan’s case – he wanted to manifest positive outcomes so strongly, I mistakenly read them as if they were his truth. Think of it this way: Lie detector tests can be fooled by people who actually believe something false is true. For example, ask them if they can fly and if they believe it, they’ll answer yes and believe it so strongly, the lie detector will read the answer as truth. Perhaps Dylan’s desires were projected so strongly, they coloured his – and my – ability to see truth. Plus, there’s a reason many in my field call readings a ""psychic art"" because it’s an inexact science. Just remember this – a reading is a tool you can use to examine your life’s possibilities. It’s not an end-all 100 percent declaration that tells you how to live your life!"
17,Why Digital Printing Fabric is The Best For You?,arts-entertainment," The practice of printing on fabric dates back to the seventeenth century when it was first introduced by means of wooden blocks with individual designs, often intricate and fine, that were then manually printed onto fabric to produce beautiful hand-crafted finished products. With time and the advent of newer technology, different methods evolved. As the textile industry grew, so did this types of industry, side by side, with a growing demand for the printed fabric of all varieties with an increasingly short turnaround time. If you’re availing your digital printing services from any textile company, you have to submit your custom printing fabric is in the proper file format. Most companies accept it in JPEG and GIF, but if you want to submit it in a different format. There are several companies who offer these custom fabric printing wholesale services as per your detailed styles and patterns. These printing services allow you to have a fabric with appealing images you want and design your own fabric . There are a lot of extraordinary online companies that offer you printing options at low-cost prices. Digital printing on fabric is practically the most favored technology in the printing industry today. This is because it offers significant advantages over its predecessors. These are listed as under: Speed Digital fabric printing wins hands-down over all the other traditional methods in terms of its speed. The rate at which it can produce great results of consistent quality is simply miles ahead of the pace at which, say, a screen-printing run would produce prints. The time-efficiency it thus brings about is invaluable to the business as well as the consumer. Consistent high quality In earlier times, there were periods when those responsible for screen printing large batches of fabric suffered many a sleepless night fretting over the accuracy and consistency of their prints. Now, they can rest easy, because, in digital printing, the last T-shirt would still have the same vibrant color print, without any harshness of color, as the very first. Cost-effectiveness Conventional printing meant pre-press expenses, such as the printing plates and all other supporting paraphernalia. Since digital methods eliminate this need altogether, it becomes much more focused and cost-effective. With every passing day, as there are further technological advancements, the equipment is also getting more affordable. The versatility of color finish Digital printing enables a much larger color palette for the final outcome. A huge number of shades and tints can be achieved on a variety of fabrics with a superlative finish. This is very encouraging for consumers who require a high level of customization in the finished product. Comparatively eco-friendly Using digital printing on fabric can ensure that you’re making a small contribution to helping the environment. This is owing to the fact that there is no usage of film plates and photo chemicals since there is no pre-press stage here between the initial file and the final printed fabric, unlike in conventional methods. No minimum order This is again a boon for the industry. In traditional, it was practically impossible to provide prototypes of high quality at short notice. With digital fabric printing though, this need can be easily fulfilled, since there is no such thing as a minimum order. This is why it is an ideal technology, especially for short and medium runs."
18,Darrell Kelley's Songs for the Soul,arts-entertainment," Hip Hop and Rap related Gospel has had a hard row to hoe since it’s influence first started being heard back in the 1990’s. It is a little bit like the fable of the Golden Goose. People were told about this thing that they had never seen, but had heard of by word of mouth. Gospel music has had such a long and venerable tradition and community behind it that it does not want its pre-eminence challenged. It also has many older consumers who are traditional to the point they still listen to gospel music on cassette tapes.  The influence of these newer forms of Gospel and praise and worship music, has taken a long time to permeate and spread around the country. Darrell Kelley, is one of the newer artists who has rolled up his sleeves and looked at the landscape and made a plan to get his message out there one song at a time. His released material up to this point shows why he is steadily gaining traction in the markets. He vacillates between humor and seriousness to make his messages. You can see early in his catalog that songs like ""Sit Your Rump Down"" rests comfortably next to more serious issue songs like ""Believe in Something (Kneel)"". It is going to be artists like this, who are going to prove to be the breakaways in the Indie Gospel field. Kelley’s new song is about the lessons we must learn from the good book. ""Here Ends the Lesson"" is built on a heavy grind of a beat and string-like sample from the keyboards, with deep bass pounding away behind it. Darrell uses this platform to wrap his voice and lyrics around to give a sense of urgency to learning these lessons to help souls in his community find the right path. There is not one word that he says, or one sentence that rings false, when you believe in the word of God. The listener to this track would do well to reflect on the meaning here that Mr. Kelley is trying to impart. If anyone of the many listeners to this message home and activated it in their lives, it would probably have the added benefit of making their lives more complete, and more pleasurable. Kelley has some history in making the case for a better sense of spiritual unity among people. He is the author of a book that looks for the commonality between the world’s estimated 4,200 active religions. In his published book, ""The Book Of UWGEAM"", he does not want to dwell on what separates us, he wants to keep promoting the ideas of religion that he has obviously thought about for a very long time.  He will fit in well along side artists like Toby Mac, LaCrae and Bobby Bishop, as long as he keeps producing a steady diet of songs for the souls out there starved for the word of the Lord.  ""Here Ends the Lesson"" is a song and a prayer, which is what most men women and children need in their hearts daily."

4,What models do I sell for 3D drains?,arts-entertainment," Hello, I suggest discussing such an interesting topic together. Each model is a time-wasted hour and I would like to see the result as soon as possible - I wonder for what I was exchanging the hammock at the sea and bicycle walk. Therefore it is important to understand what and why to do, there must be some kind of strategy. For convenience, I divided the model into several categories. Each of them has its pros and cons, as well as the level of competition and the maximum cost. More importantly, they have different buyers. Clipart Yes, this is known to all of us clipart, only in 3D. There are people who buy the model solely for the sake of a picture - from it you can make a unique image in a comfortable style, size, at the right angle and with the necessary shadow. An important feature of such models is that it does not matter if there are free analogues on the torrent, a huge selection of similar models and so on. The buyer chooses based on visual preferences and it's your renderer that can hook it up. Also, a license is important for him (that is, everything is legal) and of course it is desirable that he can easily get the same result as you do on the render. Of the minuses - of course, earnings. Navryatli someone is willing to pay large amounts for clipart, I think a maximum of $ 25-40 per model (your earnings are 30-40%). Typically, they buy such models of creative agencies and design studios, which are accustomed to the photos and their prices. Themes for such models are best to search on sites with a clip art (obviously). You need to think like a web designer: what kind of perspective can he use for a postcard or to put on his website. Look also at the mocap: a yogurt bank with a white label, a billboard, a signboard and the like, where the buyer will replace the texture and be able to use the image in the presentation. As an example, this is a separate site of Turboskvid, which they rolled out exclusively for these customers. In one word, there is a market. Smart move will also sell the renderers of such models separately in photo-drains. If people order 3d rendering services, 3d models - they will also buy there, because customers are the same. Here I recommend Philip's blog about 3D illustrations. Hard-surface, which saves time The main definition for this category is the time savings of the buyer and the difficulty of creating a similar model for him and his inhouse team himself. That's why these models are the most expensive. This is any technique: cars, military vehicles, airplanes, ships. The creation of a detailed car takes from two weeks of working time and can not be done after watching several videos on YouTube (unlike a vase, a cup, a table). Therefore, here you save the time of the buyer and his money, eliminate the risks from working with freelancers. For example, if two weeks are required for an experienced modeler to create a good model, then it turns out about 80 working hours. On average, an hour of freelancer work in the West is 5-12 dollars. And if the buyer is lucky, he will receive a similar model for $ 400 (a super cheap option, usually it costs 900 or more). Therefore, the price of $ 150 for a finished car and the lack of correspondence with the performer, and even right now, and not in a month - is the solution to all problems. However, there is a minus and it is obvious: you will spend a lot of time on the model and not the fact that you will do it qualitatively. You can also make a mistake and do something that is not in demand - I suggest that in the next article I pay attention to this category and the choice of models in it (in any case, write your advice and experience in the comments). Important: this includes only those models that do not become obsolete. That is, phones and other gadgets do not take, because in a month there will be a new version and your work will be of no use to anyone. The most advantageous, though sometimes competitive, option is cars that have only been lit at an automobile exhibition and it is desirable that there are a lot of publications about them. It's clear, do not make concepts or cars that will never go into production. That is, Tesla model 3 (at the time of publication of the article) is an excellent option, which is sure to be sold, and Chery Arrizo 7 is bad and maybe no one will buy it (only Hum3d can afford to do such models). Feel free to submit one and the same model in different versions. For example, cars can be with racing textures, separately with any body kit, separately with the interior and separately of ordinary quality. The buyer needs different models, and even a small change, which seems like a trifle, also saves their time and avoids hiring a freelancer for revision. Models from trends A logical continuation of the previous category. This is all about which there are many publications and what is ""hysteria"" in the network. For example, the Pokemon Go, the Game of Thrones or the North Korean missile launcher they threaten the US, perhaps even an American aircraft carrier, who went to Korea - suddenly something bright will happen to him, and you will have his model. Trend is not just something from the TV. The events that surround you can also be a trend, though only in this region. For example, there are many demonstrations in the world? - Time to make details of SWAT clothing, barricades and other attributes. Who will buy them: news sites for the picture, because this is not yet, and the reportage must be done; fan for fan art; an entrepreneur for covers of notebooks, toys and other things. Also, similar ""clipart"" is needed by various organizations that are involved in the trend - for example, the UN for presentations. Less: Of course this is a temporary effect and after a while the model will no longer be interesting and there will be a lot of such models. Therefore, it is foolish to spend a lot of effort on them - you need to do it quickly and on time. If the model is unique and you are the first, the price will not be important and you can set it high enough. Models for games With them, I'm sure everything is clear: they are made with a minimum number of polygons, in a game format for unity or ue4 and that 3d rendering services only needed for developers of games and mobile applications. It's nice that in this category there can be models of any theme: from auto, to characters. Everything is equally necessary in the video game industry. However, there is a small feature: everything must be generic, that is not branded. No nameplates on the car, Nike logos on sneakers and other recognizable attributes. Models are sold well. An example, besides and so understandable stores with Unity and Unreal, can be a 3DRt store. The downside is that in this niche a huge number of indie developers who have little money or money were saved on sandwiches at school. Therefore, prepare yourself for the sapport and constant requests to give something for free. Large companies usually do everything themselves and do not count on them. Therefore, there is earnings, but with nuances. Models for interior visualization The most competitive and cheap niche. It is here that they will rather prefer a free model than buy a paid one. Among other things, marketplaces are full of identical models, stolen from some sets and rendered in another studio. Since the entry threshold here is much smaller than in the Hard-surface, many models are objectively low. A good example of earnings and free models is the www.artstation.com site. In addition, this is not obvious for many, in the niche of the accessories trends and new collections are important, that is, there is obsolescence: architects and interior designers prefer to use furniture in visualizations from new collections that their customers can go and buy in salons. Therefore, in order to keep afloat, you need to constantly make furniture from fresh catalogs. It is worthwhile to add here that many furniture manufacturers lay out their entire assortment in the form of free models - this should also be watched in order not to do unnecessary work. However, there are people who work in this niche very successfully, for example, guys from Bulgaria. People and Characters Definitely expensive and popular category, both in the form of a clipboard (people in different positions and different professions) and in the form of characters for games, videos. It has a great and constant demand, even despite the development of scanners and the availability of free libraries. Prices are very high and they are ready to pay. Designers often need hands holding a phone, a gun or a notebook. Of course, the hands should be made separately male and female, of different skin color. As already mentioned, we need different professions: a driver, a racer, a motorcyclist, a banker. They are used in presentations, on various events and visualizations. Celebrities and politicians stand by themselves - they too are bought for various shows and videos. However, be careful with copyright, not every super hero can be made for sale. By the way, do not forget about the growing needs of the p-th industry, where you always need detailed and realistic people and their separate bodies - I think it's modeling for an amateur, but this niche does exist. Another trend is medical imaging. Pharm companies need different anatomical objects for presentations. There are a lot of searches for internal organs, bones and so on. However, the correctness of the transfer and understanding of what exactly you model and how you render is important here. Cad model, printout Here I have little experience, I know that there is demand for both models for CNC machines and models for the printer, but I can not say anything worthwhile about it. I think that this is all something special in that it is necessary to delve very deeply. From the outside I see that CgTrader could not do business on models for printing and switched to a new strategy for VR models. At the same time there are many marketplaces selling only such models. On this I have everything. I hope it was interesting and useful for you. If I forgot some categories or you have your own experience - be sure to write in the comments."
5,7 Corporate ideas for team building that aren’t boring,arts-entertainment," Are you starting to notice a slump in mood around the office? Perhaps your team isn’t working as well together or you have a new team who need to integrate? It could be time to start looking into team building activities to raise the morale. Team building events are a great way to get everyone to relax in each other’s company. Outside of the normal office environment, workers can let down their ‘work facade’ and show more of themselves. Plus, they can be really fun!! As long as they don’t feel like forced fun. And that’s why you need to think a little outside the box. It’s also good to keep in mind the capabilities of your team. If all of them are fitness fanatics then a sure bet would be to do something very active. However, if you have a varied mix of age and fitness levels, it’s probably best to stick to something a little calmer. We’ve pulled together a list of 7 corporate team building ideas which aren’t boring. Axe throwing Now, this may sound a little scary but hear us out. It’s actually a really fun afternoon and a great way to let off steam. In their words ""a team that throws together, grows together"" and that’s exactly what you’ll be doing. It’s less about strength and more about skill so the winner may surprise you. It’s sure to be a favourite amongst everyone and definitely a little left of centre. Go-karting Loud noise, speed, adrenaline and a healthy dose of competition with trophies thrown in at the end – sounds like the perfect team building exercise. Plus, throw in some sizzling stuff to eat and you’re onto a winner. Your team will love the feel of going full throttle and racing around the course. Not only is it a great bonding activity but it’s something that will be talked (and laughed) about for months to come. Trampolining Think trampoline parks are just for kids? Think again. There are many to choose from around Australia and it’s a great way to get the heart rate up and the stress levels down. Plus, we’re sure there’ll be lots of giggles along the way which will break down barriers as everyone relaxes. Soul building Now, if you’re looking for a more magnanimous activity then what about some group volunteering. Charities such as Oz Harvest, offer corporate volunteering days where you can work with them to help make sure those in need have food on the table. Board game marathon A great one when you have a mix of ages and fitness abilities, after all, who doesn’t love a board game. Whether you want to test everyone’s way with words with a good game of Scrabble, their financial savvy with some Monopoly, or re-create childhood games of Guess Who, there’s so much fun to be had without the need to break into a sweat. Nerf battle This one’s not for the faint of heart. It’s for the big adult-sized kids in the office. Clear the office space, make a battleground, and get the Nerf Guns out. Need we say more? The Amazing Race This one takes a bit more planning and organizing but your efforts will pay off. The Amazing Race is a race to the finish. Each place you get to will have a clue of how to get to the next. If you’re really cruel, you could set an activity to complete in order to get that clue. This is a brilliant way to get your team to mingle, especially if you make a rule that the teams have to be formed by people who don’t normally work together."
6,How to Spot a Psychic Swindle,arts-entertainment," I received a heartbreaking telephone call for help from a young woman who’d been seeing a psychic for several years, one she trusted. She suspected her boyfriend of infidelity. The ""trusted"" psychic asked the woman for $300 to put a spell on the wayward boyfriend and bring him back. Well, she paid the $300 but the spell didn’t work, so the psychic said she needed the woman to pay another $600. Troubled by this, she called and asked me what to do. I strongly advised her against giving the charlatan any more money. Any intuitive who demands more money than what the session costs is out to scam you. And in terms of casting spells, ""We all have free will,"" I said. ""If it’s in his heart to walk a different path, then nothing you can do can force him to act against his will."" Later, I thought about all the good people I’ve talked with who’d fallen for psychic swindles. Like Amber, who said a curse had been put on her, and the psychic she’d contacted for help wanted $1,500 to remove it. When I heard that, I almost swallowed my tongue. Amber hesitantly admitted that she’d paid the money and visited the quack (my word) three times – yet still felt bad luck was following her. ""Amber,"" I told her, ""there’s no such thing as a curse. What’s happening is you believe someone has power over you to make bad things happen, and your belief system is supporting your fears. So do this: whenever you have a negative thought or a depressing feeling about yourself, simply say, ‘I reject this.’ Take back your power. No one is stronger than you. And remember your family and friends who love and care about you."" I didn’t charge Amber a cent for my advice. But when I hung up, I thought of the client who had come to me once because another psychic had told him that he had to buy three ""special"" candles from her at $62 each, and if he burned them, they’d get rid of his curse. Of course, the phony psychic sneakily added, if the curse doesn’t go away, you might need more candles… Another woman who called me wanted to know how I felt about Madame X, another psychic she’d found on the Internet. Personally, I don’t like to compare myself to others; besides, I didn’t know Madame X. ""If I wanted to see you, Carolyn, how many sessions would I need to make? Madame X said I would need to see her five times next week to resolve all my issues."" My jaw dropped. I didn’t know the extent of Lillian’s ""issues,"" but there’s a difference between a psychic and a psychiatrist. I can’t predict tomorrow’s lottery numbers and I can’t solve deep-seated emotional problems. I can offer you hope and support, but I can’t be your crutch. So, let’s recap. Here’s the signs you’re dealing with a hocus-bogus psychic: • The person says you’re cursed, and that only she/he can remove this curse. • The person wants a ridiculous amount of money for a session. • The person says you need more sessions to clear up your problem. • The person says you must buy what I call ""mystical trinkets."" • The person tells you that you have no power. And remember: There’s a world of difference between a $62 candle that’s supposed to make you feel better and a $2 vanilla-scented votive you can pick up just about anywhere."
7,"Sometimes, I Blush",arts-entertainment," Sometimes, I can’t believe the words that tumble out of my mouth. It happens occasionally when I connect with a spirit that’s come for one of my clients – a few naughty phrases that slip out in the privacy of a one-on-one reading. ""Did your father curse a lot?"" I’ll ask, and get a nodding head in reply. But when off-colour remarks pop out when I’m serving at a Spiritualist church – yikes! A few blue words, and I’m red in the face. I’ll never forget seeing in my mind a tall, good-looking man with wavy brown hair and a thick mustache. He wore a sleek black leather coat, and the first three buttons on his Hawaiian print shirt were open, revealing a well-toned chest. I described what I was getting to the congregation, but no one raised a hand to claim him. Come on, I mentally spoke to the spirit. Give me some more information about yourself so someone can identify you. Suddenly, I heard loud, thumping music. The fellow gave me a lascivious smile, then started shimmying and taking off his clothes. My jaw dropped. As he wriggled out of his shirt, he winked and showed me perfect six-pack abs. The guy could’ve stepped off the cover of a Harlequin paperback. When he undid his belt and loosened his pants, I turned away. But you can’t turn your back on spirit! He laughed at my embarrassment and whispered, Gene. I passed that name on to the group. A young woman in the second row gasped. ""Might that be Jean?"" she asked, giving his name a French inflection. ""Possibly,"" I said, then cleared my throat. ""Was he, uh… a stripper?"" The woman laughed. Jean stopped dancing when he got down to his G-string – thank goodness! – and I helped the young woman connect with a former boyfriend who had died last year in a car crash. Jean blew his girlfriend a kiss and, before returning to spirit, gave me another wink. I blew out a breath, then paused to take a hearty drink of water. I had to do something to lower my temperature. Whew! Another time I felt the presence of an older woman, and in my inner ear I heard mother. I described her as a bit rotund, with brightly painted nails and blonde hair out of a bottle. She passed into spirit from lung cancer in her late 70s, and chain-smoked unfiltered Camel cigarettes until the day she died. I glommed onto a middle-aged fellow in the audience as if a flashlight were trained on his face; spirit was directing me to whom the message belonged. He sat with his arms crossed over his chest, and a look on his face like he’d rather be cleaning a cat box than listening to messages from spirit. ""I think this woman came for you,"" I said, pointing at him. ""Are you alright with it?"" He shrugged. His wife, sitting beside him, giggled and elbowed him in the stomach. ""I feel this is your mother,"" I told him. ""She says you’re expecting to be the last person in the world to hear from someone. Well, guess what? You’re here, and so am I!"" I noticed my stance: right hand on my hip, left hand pointing at him. ""Is this how your mother would stand?"" He nodded. ""Damn right!"" I said, then caught myself and turned away, embarrassed. Oh my God, I thought, you’re not supposed to swear in church! I can’t remember what else I said to the fellow, but after the service I apologized profusely to the minister. She chuckled and said she understood. ""Sometimes,"" she said, ""even spirit makes me blush."""
8,"If Tom Cruise wet the bed last night, is Roger Ebert's review of Minority Report still valid?",arts-entertainment," The reason why I’m intrigued, by this concept, is that for all of my life (or rather for just the vast majority of my life – no satire intended) movies have come across as being akin to sunlight and stars. And so has Hollywood. Even as I’ve continued to get older, and continued to get older, and brought with all that progress a genuine understanding, and a genuine perspective on the true meaning of fragility and of vulnerability, to this day I can find it very hard to dispel the myth of Hollywood immortality, and the myth of movie exemption. In 2018, and not just in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 or 2011, I’m still of the natural tendency to perceive movies, movie stars and movie reviews as a kind of outside bubble. If the rules of reality get applied to a movie star, or if they get applied to a filmmaker (specifically like a director), or to a press junket or to a film premiere, no matter how hard the appliance of the rules, and no matter how hard the exact DNA or format of the rules unto themselves, it’s still a feasible outcome to just dismiss the appliance and to simply continue to perceive the myth of Hollywood and the myth of movie star immortality as completely and utterly intact. And then comes along a very different, and a very unexpected appliance of reality. To put it in the most succinct manner possible: if the iconic action star, Tom Cruise, wet the bed last night (not saying he did, just merely presenting the possibility that he did), then is Roger Ebert’s 2002 review of Minority Report still valid? Indeed: as illogical, and as baseless as the perspective is to possess, I haven’t for the life of me the ability to fail to present the perspective – a perspective that’s simply too unique, too creative and too valuable to fail to present. In terms of an actual answer, to the proposition, if the answer is no, and Ebert’s review should be dismissed because Tom Cruise wet the bed last night, I feel that I would be forced to deem that the basis of the answer is to connect the very culture of Hollywood to the value of the absence of technology (and more specifically the value of the absence of the internet). As such, the alternative answer of yes then has a natural right to mean that technology and that the internet have a capacity to co-exist with Hollywood – so which is the better option? The absence of technology is the absence of Hollywood; thus, on the basis that the answer to the Ebert/Cruise proposition is no, the logic of the no is to connect the value of no Hollywood to Hollywood; the answer of yes then meaning to connect Hollywood to the value of Hollywood. The value of no Hollywood – Hollywood. No: Hollywood – Hollywood Yes: Hollywood – no Hollywood So it seems that the answer is no: to protect and to honour Hollywood as much as possible (just as the Battle of Hastings had intended to do but wasn't able to) it's better if movie reviews can’t adapt themselves to a fast-changing and relentless environment."

10,Superman Returns (2006) review: good teaches evil to believe in itself,arts-entertainment," For a very long time, Superman Returns is a film that has confounded me. I’ve always had a respect for the picture, but at the same time I’ve usually found it difficult to truly enjoy the film: hopefully now, that inability can cease. In Superman Returns, self-awareness belongs to both good and evil. The opposite of self-awareness belonging to good and evil is good and evil not belonging to self-awareness; the absence of self-awareness is freedom, and thus, good and evil belong to freedom. Good and evil that belongs to freedom is freedom possessing good and evil. Freedom possessing good and evil is choice possessing good and evil. Choice possessing good and evil is choice being superior to good and evil – choice is power, and as such, power is better than good and evil. A power that is better than good and evil is an inequality that is better than good and evil: an inequality that is better than good and evil is an inequality that is better than equality and inequality. An inequality that is better than equality and inequality is an inequality that is unequal than equality and inequality; unequal than is different than, therefore an inequality that is unequal than equality and inequality is an inequality that is different than equality and inequality – an inequality that is different than equality and inequality is an inequality that is not equal and unequal (not the same and different). An inequality is evil. An evil that is not the same and different is a difference that isn’t the same without evil – a difference that isn’t the same without evil is the absence of not being the same without evil. The absence of not being the same without evil is being the same without evil; being the same without evil is evil being the same with. Evil being the same with is with being the same good. With is not alone. Not alone being the same good means therefore that the same good has to be alone: in order for morality to be coherent, it’s necessary for the moral force to be detached. And then there’s the converse: in order for immorality to be itself, it’s necessary for morality to let immorality be in the presence of morality. Superman Returns is about good teaching evil to believe in itself"
11,Rekindle Your Friendship The Crossword Way,arts-entertainment," Last month we had a college reunion and since then I have become a crossword fan. College reunion and crosswords? Doesn't make sense, right? Wondering what could be the possible connection between the two? Well, you would smile when I tell you the story behind it. We graduated back in 2008. Yes, it's been a decade now. I already feel old. Sigh! Anyways, since it's been a decade that we had been to St Xavier's (that's my school), our batch had decided to conduct a reunion to reminiscence the good old memories. Well, that's what happens at reunions, doesn't it? And, of course, we all were pretty excited about it. After all, everyone was taking out time from their busy schedules and coming all over from various places to rekindle the old memories and make new ones too. I still remember the tug I felt in my heart when I saw my best friend after years, standing at the school gate and waving excitedly towards me. He was waiting for me to get the hell out of the car. Damn! This was when nostalgia hit me hard. It was a perfect deja vu moment for me! This was exactly the way he used to wait for me during school days! I remember literally jumping over him once I got down the car and we laughed hysterically, like maniacs for quite some good time (well, that's what best friends are for, aren't they?) Okay, so before the crossword thing gets lost somewhere between my emotions and nostalgic memories, let's get back to where we were. So, what made me fall in love with it is the fact that our group of friends had planned something very creative to cherish our reunion forever and that was rekindling our friendship the crossword way. Yes, you heard that right. After we were done partying, boozing, clicking a hell lot of pictures, we headed towards being a little more productive because that's what schools are meant for. And, this is when our productivity found its way through a daily crossword puzzle. This idea was, of course of my best friend (he's one intellectual lad, you know!) He had found this amazingly crafted online crossword puzzle with the name 'Wealth Words' a few weeks back and had instantly made it a part of our reunion. Wondering what was so amazing about this daily crossword puzzle? Well, let me tell you for a fact, I have not really been a crossword lover but, that was before I indulged in Wealth Words. Now, you just name crosswords and I will jump out of joy. Yes, I am that head over heels in love with crosswords now. In fact, with Wealth Words by your side, anyone and everyone will fall in love with crosswords irrevocably, for the very reason that it's a real money earning game too. No kidding, my friend! It really is so. Revamping the old school online crossword puzzles, Wealth Words has emerged as a contemporary crossword with a digital touch and lots and lots of cash prizes. Yes, all you need to do is answer its puzzles right and you are good to win its insanely huge cash prizes instantly. We did that on our reunion and oh my god! it turned out to be one crazy and fun day for sure. I remember registering at its website, buying tokens worth $2 each for playing and rest as they say is history! We were playing its divisional and active games, grasping clues that came our way, putting our brain to rigorous mental stimulation and cheering each other while submitting the answers in an active time frame of an hour (that's the time limit given). And, we actually won $1600 for an active game at Wealth Words. Isn't that downright amazing? In fact, some of our other friends also won the division 1 and division 2 prizes. While the division 1 cash prizes required them to get all the 20 puzzles right, the division 2 prizes were won by those who got the second highest correct answers. Now, that was pretty simple, effortless and a chic way of earning money and I am glad we did that on our reunion. It couldn't get any better."
12,"Nocturnal Animals review: experiences that come to life, so that they can reject themselves",arts-entertainment," In the past, I’ve alluded to the possibility that Nocturnal Animals is the greatest movie of all time. Now this might still be true (I happen to no longer believe that 1977’s The Sentinel has the ability to be better than Nocturnal Animals) and to explore the integrity of this possibility, I want to analyse the following theme: that the entire history of the universe is just one experience of stimulation. A reality which is one stimulation is one stimulation which is fantasy. One stimulation which is fantasy is a fantasy which is two stimulations – a fantasy which is two stimulations is two stimulations which are reality. Two stimulations which are reality is a reality which can’t be two stimulations. A reality which can’t be two stimulations is a reality which needs to be one stimulation: a reality which needs to be one stimulation is a contrast which needs to be one stimulation. A stimulation is an enjoyment. Thus, a contrast which needs to become one stimulation is a contrast which needs to become one enjoyment. A contrast which needs to become one enjoyment is a contrast which needs to become no enjoyment (one enjoyment can’t be identical to just enjoyment). And as such, a contrast which needs to become no enjoyment is a non-enjoyment which needs to become the same. From this point, I can just stick with non-enjoyment, change to enjoyment or move forward with both non-enjoyment and enjoyment. I think that the scenario permits any of the three options: in essence, the meaning of Nocturnal Animals is that whether it be violence, or happiness or sensuality, the experience in question needs to become the entirety of reality. To put it this way: in the eyes of the 2016 drama, Nocturnal Animals, all parts of history have the right to share the same experience – all experiences that make up reality have the right to be the same experience. If reality is Y, all the experiences that define reality can be X; if every X wants to be the same X, the equivalent of this is the same X not wanting to be every X – the same X that doesn’t want to be every X is the same X that wants to be no X. In Nocturnal Animals, any experience that happens becomes a refusal to be that very experience. Whether it involves Susan on her own, in her mansion, or if it's Tony in the desert or Susan and Edward in flashback, any of the experiences that are seen to happen throughout the course of the movie are a living version of themselves, because then they can choose to reject themselves."
13,Copyrighting Tattoo Art,arts-entertainment," It is difficult to identify a more personalized statement or method of collaborative endorsement than utilizing our bodies as canvases, permanently marking one's skin. Tattooists might constitute some of the most prolific producers of artwork. Their client's tattooed compositions are more broadly and readily visible than works done perhaps in nearly any other medium. Yet within the tattooing field sufficiently detailed or serious analysis of activity as well as associated technological and socioeconomic impacts are rarely accorded. We turn briefly to an article from New Zealand. As is most common with online tattoo-related writings, content often primarily serves as an advertisement vehicle for images hyping inking as a practice and is then peppered by quotations from a handful of easily contactable [often just mainstream] artists. Implications of copyrighting tattoo designs and associated body art forms, particularly completed tattoo works, are however worth exploring in greater detail: "" Tattoo artists calling for right to have copyright on their work | There's an unwritten rule in New Zealand - decent tattoo artists don't copy designs. Right now the Copyright Act 1994 is under review, and artists behind the ink say stricter legislation could protect original tattoo designs. House of Natives founder Gordon Toi would champion tattoo protection. ""I would like to see some kind of governance over Māori tattooing and Polynesian tattooing... there's so much exploitation."" Original designs were often replicated, often overseas without even talking to the New Zealand artist, he said. ""Skin is probably the hardest thing to copyright, because everyone is copying it."" Pacific Tattoo owner Tim Hunt wanted artists to respect the meaning of Māori and Pacific cultural patterns and symbols. ""Any artist could say, I can do you a design that has korus and looks Māori"", Hunt said. ""But if you want something authentic, you will have to go somewhere else."" Overseas, tattoo artists are suing when their designs appear on in the media, like television. In 2011, the artist of Mike Tyson's Māori-inspired facial tattoo sued Warner Bros over a depiction of similar facial art on a character in The Hangover: Part II. If copyright law protected cultural images, Hunt would respect the change. ""I want more tattoo artists to stand up and say: 'I don't know enough about it, I don't know the history behind it, and I don't know the context behind it'."" Overseas, tattoo artists replicate images without a second thought. New Zealand was different, he said. ""It's kind of an unspoken code in New Zealand that you just don't do that."" Hunt believed the customer owned the tattoo, not the artist. Union Tattoo owner Craigy Lee agreed there was an unwritten code of conduct to not copy a custom tattoo. Decent artists would not dare to make money from someone else's design, he said. University of Auckland associate professor Alex Sims said technically what is currently occurring in New Zealand is probably copyright infringement - under the banner of artwork. However Sims cautioned against strict enforcement of copyright laws on tattoos, which could include removal of tattoos, preventing the tattoos appearance in films and advertisements, or requiring the removal of tattoos from social media.""It would give the copyright owner the power to control images of a person, which would be extremely concerning and just wrong."" tattoo vs art For use in the tattooing world, a distinction between copyrighting designed or applied tattoo artwork must be made. We address professional practitioners tattooing as their sustainable, primary means of income. Tattooists may have multiple images and other as yet non-applied media content such as designs, compositions, sketches or custom artworks. Like representations of various traditional art forms, these are relatively easy to recorded as well as upload allowing clear digital ascription of copyright ownership. Separately, as worn by clients, tattooists typically have portfolios of tattooed pieces. Using a three-dimensional canvas introduces complexities to automated digital identification. In numerous image copyright tracking software, positioning alone can entirely throw off investigation techniques. While Instagram and alternate photo uploading databases offer some form of time-stamped verification but, due to comparatively openly editable structures subsequent source and ownership attribution can become diluted. Whether tattooist's produced artwork is documented on skin or another type of canvas is the first practical distinction . artist vs technician In order for copyrighting considerations to be adequately reviewed, grouping serves as a tattoo industry specific starting categorizations. On one side of the tattooing art form creative spectrum there are those tattoo artists only implementing their style and techniques. Forgoing reflections on how tattoo artist's styles and aesthetics may have been derived or inspired, the tattoo artist's works are independently recognizable as ""being theirs"". In a senses, the tattoo artist has a stylistic monopoly. Proportionately with other creative mediums, the tattoo artist has a particular vision, knowledge and or expertise that may not be readily substituted for or by anyone else. The tattoo artist can therefore be classified as practicing the tattooing craft so as to convey a unique style and or furthering the continuation of a single aesthetic or technique. Tattoo technicians may have distinct portfolios of completed, tattooed, works. While the tattoos in such portfolios cannot be exactly replicated, such unique quality attributes are due primarily to placement on a bespoke canvas, i.e. on one entirely individual person. The cohesive result is bespoke rather than the isolation of a composition. Likewise such tattooed work is formed within specific, often non-reproducible proportions. The resulting tattoo may indeed be faithfully replicated by any number of other tattoo technicians, albeit on a different exclusive canvas. And as proportionate to qualified technicians in any field, a tattoo technician may be substituted with no inherent loss or degradation to results. A technician is the tattooist physically and technically capable of applying categories of tattoos yet may do so indiscriminately in regards to a single style, size, technique, aesthetic and or design. Capacity rather than artistic temperament or vision here is the limiting factor. tradition vs technique Tattoo artists may be thought of [as just two examples from millions] Ondrash conveying a unique aesthetic to Horioshi III in Japan continuing the culturally rich art of tebori. Both being solely in the tattoo artist's jurisdiction, delimitation of copyrighting unique compositions as opposed to reproductions of traditional iconography forms another noteworthy separation. Like any configuration in the more classically mainstream mediums such as painting, such a dichotomy is not to state that tattoo art itself necessarily neither neatly falls onto one side. As with all artistic pursuits, sources of inspiration as well as subjectively justifiable conclusions that the same compositions labelled as 'homage' by some or 'theft' to others remains to be objectively qualified in any manner whatsoever. As often said, good artists copy - great artists steal. In practical terms though the tattoo artist producing traditionally inspired works may automatically and logically be precluded from copyrighting registration of tattooed art off of the human canvas. copyrights vs claims There may be a twofold purpose of copyright registration. Firstly this functions as externally verified recognition, by a third party, of bespoke or attributed authorship. Such adds credibility, weight and or authority to content. Not least of which often lending substance to sales pricing. Secondly the purpose of holding a copyright ownership registration could be preparation for cataloguing proceedings when initiating formalized legal protections. These proceedings nonetheless require the violator(s) be identified, engaged with, refuse to honor the registration and then successfully convicted in a manner constrained by their geographically applicable court(s) of law. Quantification of receivable remuneration depends on violator's accurate identification, owned content's documented use, set culpability through response and achievable legal ramifications as determined in part by physical location. All form notable, complicating factors. recognition vs protection It has been found as commonplace for a tattooist to use the designs or even completed tattooed portfolio pieces of another. While a large portion of accredited tattoo artwork is searchable online, sheer volumes accessible via disparate sources fractures attempts for single point [i.e. one tattooist's] crediting. The illicit or unauthorized use of tattooed works conceivably only being in printed or offline portfolios, as with those shown to studio clientele. Tattoos often serve as an individually enacted and privately held art form. Online display and thereby essentially public 'registration' of tattooed works may therefore purposefully not exist. Its wearer could have requested this. These factors translate into an ability for tattoo technicians, dealing directly with individual clients, to potentially be quite liberal in statements of completed works as well as, by extension, claimed tattooing experience or expertise. In a practical manner, the motivations or impetus for copyright ownership registration of tattoo works apply more broadly to the tattoo artist and perhaps only as form of registration of completed portfolios to the technician. While achievable remuneration or punitive actions against copyright ownership violators is far from universally predictable, a focus on digitally time-stamping both tattoo artwork and portfolios through say blockchain verification is the first step towards assurances of authenticity. However used the creator now has immutable, single-source substantiation of ownership. As with the technology's decentralized capacity, ability of trust reallocation onto individual sources as opposed to 'hubs' equates to potentially ushering in a new standard of work verification. This is hugely significant for the client in the process selection. For tattoo artists the effects and benefits of copyright ownership through blockchain are also significant.

14,I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997): film review,arts-entertainment," For the 1997 horror film, I Know What You Did Last Summer, it’s none other than through the following idea that I wish to talk of the film: a goal that gives its status to its means. A means to a goal, and a goal itself are both parts of a sequence. Of the two parts, it’s the goal and not the means to the goal which has to be post, and therefore has to be time. By default, it’s the means to the goal which has the ability to choose to be pre. Prior to a goal, the means to the goal gets to choose to be the origin, and therefore the leader: of the two parts of the sequence, the first half of the sequence consists of a leader who has chosen to exist, and the second half consists of an inferior who has no choice but to be inferior. The free leader is inferior to the forced slave, and the forced slave is superior to the free leader; free hierarchy is weaker than forced slavery, and forced slavery is better than free hierarchy – free power is worse than forced weakness, and forced weakness is better than free power. Oh yes: if it wasn’t before, it’s perfectly apparent now why I felt the need to go over this film. A free power is the same as a forced weakness, and a forced weakness is the same as just plain and simple power; ergo, the actual sequence or the actual theme underneath I Know What You Did Last Summer is power that’s worse than power, and power that’s better than power. A power which is worse than power, is a power which is better than; conversely, a power which is better than power is a power which is worse than. Better than and worse than: what do they add up to? To further simplify things (as if enough simplification hasn’t happened yet), better than is just worse, and worse than is just better. In other words: the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer is a metaphor for the basic problem of worse and better – namely, how is it possible for one style to derive from the previous? How can better be better, if its basis is to come from worse? The problem makes perfect sense. On its own terms, better is logical, but it isn’t logical if its reality involves having been a successor state to the state of inferiority. Better means comparison. Worse means comparison. Thus, the sequence is comparison and then comparison – comparison + comparison. Since comparison means judgement, and authority, the sequence can be translated into authority + authority – authority and then authority. End and then end makes no sense. For end to be true, there cannot be another end. The equivalent of end and then end is continue and continue which are uniform – neither of the continues follow the other. Continue is middle. Middle is between. Between is interval; interval is pause, and thus, the metaphor of I Know What You Did Last Summer (I honestly don’t mind repeating the title) is a pause which doesn’t oppress any other pause – a relaxation which co-exists with all other relaxations. And now for the reverse: a relaxation which co-exists with all other relaxations is a work which prevents other works – a goal which prevents other goals. A goal that prevents other goals is a means to a goal which prevents itself: a means to a goal which prevents itself is a self which can only help the means to a goal. A self which must help the means to a goal is a means to a goal which can choose to help the self. A means to a goal which can choose to help the self is a goal which can’t choose to help the self – a goal which can’t choose to help the self is a goal which can choose to help the means to a goal. The self is forced to aid the means to the goal, which then means the means to the goal chooses to help the self; it’s once the means to the goal chooses to help the self that the goal decides to aid the means to the goal – the origin is the need to help the middle, which gives the middle the power to help the origin and which in turn gives the end the power to help the middle. An origin is the need to help the middle, and the need to help the middle is the freedom from middle; the freedom from middle is the indifference of origin. In essence, the nature of the problem is that the origin of reality is indifferent to the rest of reality, and the way to fix this problem is a sequence in which the endgame is beholden to the middle. The intrigue doesn’t stop there though: for the middle to be the middle, the origin and the endgame can’t be the same force – so there’s an origin which is corrupt, and there’s a last point which isn’t corrupt. An origin that’s bad. A middle that’s not bad. And a last point which isn’t bad either: ergo, the middle and the last point are the same force. There is no middle. There are simply two sides – and one of those sides follows the other. The side which is meant to be followed is bad because it wants to be free, and the side which is meant to follow is good because it is free – a leader is bad for lacking freedom, and a servant is good for lacking judgement. A leader is bad, because that leader is force. A servant is good, because that servant has no force. A forced leader which is bad is a servant which is bad. A free servant which is good is a master which is good. The metaphor, and the exact meaning of I Know What You Did Last Summer is that a master and a servant are a correct state as long as the servant can’t exist after the master. And that’ll just about do it, when it comes to an actual analysis of I Know What You Did Last Summer; in closing, I’ll just say that the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer makes Star Wars, Star Trek, the MCU and Lord of the Rings into absolute utter annoyances."
15,Things You Need to Know Before Learning Violin,arts-entertainment," I have been longing to learn violin from my teenage years but didn’t have any clear idea about where and how to start. And there was no one to guide me about the basics of a violin. But when I grew old, I pursued my long cherished dream of learning how to play a violin. While I started my lesson, I couldn’t help but wished that I had known a few things beforehand. I have listed a few important things that you should know before you hit your first violin class. The Violin Itself Usually a violin comes with few accessories like bow, rosin, shoulder pad and a case. After buying your violin and before starting your lessons, read the instruction manual carefully and know the exact role of each and every extra accessory. It’s very important as each of these components has a very different role to play in your violin lessons and knowing them beforehand would really help you to concentrate in the actual lessons properly. Music It’s not necessary that you have to know how to read music sheets or compose your own pieces of tunes. What I mean is that you should develop love for classical music, especially those pieces that spotlight the tune of the violin. It’s a vital aspect because without the understanding of music, it would be really difficult for you to understand the violin. This advice is mainly for grownup people who look forward in learning this musical instrument. Having said that, if you want to teach your precious little child how to play violin, it’s advisable that you introduce them to the realm of classical music very early in life. Doing this will improve their understanding of music. The Violin Won’t Sound Like Violin for a Long Time Don’t expect your violin to sound like a violin in movie soundtracks when you first start out taking lessons. Your over expectations may break your heart. As an amateur, your bow placement, rosin movement can be the most unnatural at first and hence the sound. And you have to be patient. With time and plenty of regular practices, you will get comfortable with your violin and who knows, you might start playing like a professional. Violin Needs Special Care Too Even if you buy the cheapest violin available in this side of the hemisphere, it still requires special care and extensive maintenance to work properly and produce that heavenly sound you are longing to play. Although, at the beginning such maintenance might feel as a burden, but over time it will surely become your habit to take care of your beloved musical instrument. Violin Lessons May Take a Toll on Your Hearing Abilities We all know how a violin is held closer to the ears. The F holes, where the sound is produced are merely a few inches from the ear. And exposing your delicate ears to high sound regularly is surely going to cause hearing problems as well as severe headaches and other health problem associated with it. It is often observed that violinist lose their hearing ability of one ear after long years of playing. That’s because the sound is simply too close to the ear. So, my advice would be to think several times before taking your final decision about learning to play violin."

18,"The true meaning of The Phantom Menace, and why it failed",arts-entertainment," The true meaning, of The Phantom Menace is that it’s a story about the support for hierarchy being the very definition of balance. A hierarchy that gets support is an equality – or balance – that doesn’t get support, and a support which doesn’t exist outside of a balance is a support which has no choice but to be part of the balance. A balance is a symmetry. A symmetry is a history that’s repeated. Since a support is a force, The Phantom Menace is therefore asking its viewer – consciously or unconsciously – to picture a history that’s repeated which is synonymous with or which is in some way interacting with a force. The force and the history that is being repeated are the same, according to the 1999 blockbuster prequel. A history that’s repeated, to be technical, is an image and another image that’s the same as the other image. By default, the force which is meant to be interacting with the image and its copy has to be an image and a different image. An image is a contrast, which means that the force is a contrast and a contrast contrast, and then that the absence of the force is a contrast and contrast. Contrast contrast is the balance – contrast + contrast contrast is the disparity. Contrast contrast is symmetry. The new design is therefore a symmetry which interacts with a symmetry and a difference – or is simply a symmetry which is a symmetry and a difference. A symmetry that’s a symmetry and a difference is a symmetry that’s itself and not itself – a symmetry that is self and anti. A symmetry that is self and anti is a difference that is not self and anti – and a difference that is not self and anti is a difference that is self and self (or anti and anti). An anti that is an anti and anti is a weapon that is a weapon and a weapon. A weapon that is a weapon and a weapon is a weapon that is a co-existence between one weapon and another weapon – The Phantom Menace is a story about the error of weapons co-existing with one another. Conversely, it is a story about the logic that non-weapons don’t co-exist with one another. A synonym for non-weapon is non-force. And a synonym for non-force is absence. Thus, in the 1999 blockbuster, the very definition of logic is a state in which absence doesn’t permit itself – presence permits absence, or absence permits presence. Absence that permits presence is an absence that desires chaos – and this is correct behaviour, in The Phantom Menace. For The Phantom Menace, the only correct state, the only correct behaviour is a behaviour in which it’s impossible to desire anarchy. It’s literally impossible to want violence, and impossible to enjoy imbalance. On the curious side of things: the inability to desire violence is the ability to desire nothing – the ability to desire nothing is the inability to desire. The inability to desire can be the same as the desire of a desire – in other words, The Phantom Menace is about desire being interested in itself, which would perhaps go a long way to explain why the movie feels so miscalculated and imbalanced"

By that title what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't start your learning with sophisticated notes. It'll kill your interest before even you start playing the banjo. Many beginners think that I'll learn hard ones first so that I'll have no problem playing easier ones. But this is a huge mistake. The scenario is same for other instrument players as beginners. It takes some time to familiarize with the instrument which is right for all including the banjo. Many online tutorials will show you how to get started with easier notes and chords. You can jam with a partner or be playing audio. It'll help you keep going. Yes, you heard it right. As beginners, no one seems to care about correctly putting their hands and wrists while playing the banjo. It's a mistake that'll take a significant toll after some time. If you get accustomed to a wrong posture, you won't be able to correct it quickly. With wrong hand and wrist position, you'll get tired or feel pain while playing for hours. As a beginner, you won't realize because you'll have fewer practice hours. When you advance through your course, your practice hour will increase. Only then you'll understand what mistake you've done. If anyone says that you should start right away and think about anything else, you should reject their suggestion. Get to know the right position of holding and playing at first. Do some study, and then you'll be good to go. Many students keep complaining that the notes they play don't sound the way it should be. It's very common amongst beginners, and it's normal. It happens when you don't give enough pressure on the strings and release it too soon. That's why the notes sound muffled and stuffy. It's also a common problem faced by other students of string based instruments. Now you know the problem. So, thinking about the solution shouldn't be that hard. Give enough pressure even it feels painful at first. Give it some time after you have played a note to complete correctly. And then release or play the next note. Try to make the timing perfect as you keep practicing. In the beginning, playing the banjo won't sound so smooth like professionals. It's okay because you haven't yet perfected smooth transitions. Once you've memorized the chords, try to play them without looking. Then, try to play them faster and change chords quickly without looking. Next, learn hearing different solos where the transitions are made. Practice to correctly do the shifts and keep the rhythm while changing chords. You'll become a fantastic player if you follow those correctly. Managing time to practice is essential as we all have other priorities. Completing other tasks, create a routine to train banjo regularly. Don't miss those timings. More and more practicing is the ultimate key to be a master banjo player which is valid for learning all other instruments in the world. Don't hesitate or lose hope while learning an instrument. Because after some time, it gets frustrating. You'll have nothing to worry about once you overcome that period."
20,The Sentinel (1977): review,arts-entertainment," For this 1977 horror, the dynamic or the theme of concern is the censorship of a betrayal of a rightful betrayal. A rightful betrayal is an erroneous perfection. A censorship of a betrayal is the mere absence of a betrayal – so what’s being dealt with is in fact the perfection of an incorrect perfection. The perfection of an incorrect perfection is the absurdity of a correct absurdity. And then the absurdity of a correct absurdity is just the absurdity of perfection. The logic can continue, with the absurdity of perfection, but it doesn’t have to: the logic can instead continue with the perfection of an incorrect perfection, and just try to find a different way forward. To humour the latter, the perfection of an incorrect perfection can be altered into the perfection of absurdity. So which is better – the perfection of absurdity or the absurdity of perfection? The perfection of absurdity is the helping of a weakness – the absurdity of perfection is a damnation of visual evolution. At first glance, both appear to be equal, but of course, it’s bound to be the case that one side has more merit over the other side. Helping a weakness vs. the pure absence of superiority. In strict logical terms, it’s the latter concept that commands more weight. However, the 1977 movie The Sentinel is very likely not interested in actual logic, or at least is very likely to have the perspective that strict logic is not an inherently virtuous concept. To differentiate the two opposing sides, let’s attempt to deconstruct them. To help a weakness means to destroy an evolution. The pure absence of evolution is the inability to help. So it’s the basic absence of intervention against the gratification of intervention. With the gratification of intervention being the intervention of gratification, and with the opposite of the absence of intervention being the intervention of absence, the better interpretation and diagnosis of The Sentinel is the value of a type of intervention as opposed to no intervention – it’s better to be saved by a type of something as opposed to not needing to be saved at all. In the Michael Winner film, the true objective, and the true meaning of morality is that violence is worth existing because if reality experiences violence it means then that reality gets to obtain a visual image – an image that can save reality (and by extension violence). An image that saves violence is an act of violence that can’t hurt an image – a violence that can’t hurt an image is a violence that can hurt nothing. A violence that hurts nothing is nothing that can save violence – nothing that saves violence is nothing that hurts nothing. Nothing that hurts nothing is something that saves something – something that saves something is saving being nothing. Saving being nothing is nothing being destruction – violence isn’t possible, and yet help is possible. Reality can have it both ways: it can experience safety, but not have to put up with the cause of safety. In case it isn’t already apparent, I have a kind of infatuation with Cristina Raines (and I have to reference Raines herself, as opposed to Alison Parker, for the same reason that I had to reference Talitha Bateman and not Janice in the article about wanting to be a guardian to her); it’s been just over 40 years since the release of The Sentinel, which puts the film at exactly the same age as Star Wars – can it be more than a joke, if I now turn The Sentinel into something which bookends the very famous and epic space saga? It’s needless to point out, but I’ll say it anyway: I hope to meet Cristina Raines one day, and specifically so I can tell her in person the exact way that I’ve perceived my perception of The Sentinel"

1,"If Halloween 6 won Best Picture, in 1996, would mathematics have been decimated?",arts-entertainment," In 1996, it was the period biopic Braveheart that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Being a 1995 release, the sixth instalment in the Halloween franchise Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was perfectly eligible to be nominated for Best Picture, but it’s also obvious that a Halloween 6 was never going to get nominated anywhere remotely as much as the Mel Gibson film. It’s an interesting query though: on the assumption, that the Joe Chappelle feature did kick up a firestorm, and developed enough momentum to take it all the way to the 1996 ceremony, what would have actually been the full consequences of Halloween 6 getting nominated and even winning the award for Best Picture? To someone outside the Hollywood bubble, it seems that any such type of history would have meant social upheaval. Yet even this might not be enough. It’s a commonly known tradition, that genre films are annually discriminated against by the Academy. People to this day use The Dark Knight as an example of when the Academy almost surpassed itself, illustrating just how far the disconnect reaches between the people of the Academy and the general public. If Halloween 6 (the theatrical cut) had been part of the ceremony, it comes across as reasonable to ponder not just whether society might have upturned, but if the very topic of mathematics would have as well. For all of its history, Halloween 6 has been a revolutionary film (I must stress at this point that it’s only the theatrical cut of the movie I’m referring to), and therefore it should be nothing but a logical idea to ponder over; however, in actually addressing the idea, it’s the ulterior reality of the idea that Halloween 6 isn’t a weapon against the Academy Awards, but is a weapon for the Academy Awards. That last point needs to be very carefully clarified: the idea that Halloween 6 would decimate mathematics by winning Best Picture is a means to defend the status quo, even though the DNA of Halloween 6 is as much a backlash to the status quo as perhaps any other movie. I won’t say I’m surprised, because at the end of the day Halloween 6 deserves that surreal type of identity. Joe Chappelle did the unthinkable, in making Halloween 6; he made not just a competent but outstanding sequel to a long-standing franchise. By 1995, Carpenter’s Halloween was almost 20 years old, and the overall series had already seen quite a bit of evolution. The theatrical cut, of Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers, is one of the most unique, visceral and evolutionary movies ever made; its story is as much elusive as it is apparent, and its atmosphere speaks to the soul of humanity. More importantly: Halloween 6 is the alternative for humanity, if humanity ever decides to finally give up on the Academy Awards, and on Hollywood and on society in general"
2,The Last Jedi review (a remake of Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals),arts-entertainment," In Rian Johnson’s sequel, to The Force Awakens, a value is a difference that exists because of a uniformity. In alternate but no less complicated terms, a value in The Last Jedi is made up of a uniformity that owes none of itself to a uniformity. If a uniformity owes none of itself to a uniformity, it is the same as saying that a uniformity owes itself to a difference; seeing as how any image is a uniformity, it is in effect the same as saying that an image owes itself to the absence of an image. In comparison, to an image, the absence of an image can’t be seen. The inability to see is then the force that creates an image, and thus, in The Last Jedi a value is an image that owes itself to the inability to see. Being indebted to the inability to see is being free from the ability to see; being free from the ability to see is being indebted to sight itself (the ability to see is not the same as sight in and of itself). In The Last Jedi, a value is an image that owes sight – the absence of image that doesn’t owe sight (an inability to see that is free from sight). In general, the inability to see is the ability to not see, which in turn changes into sight – ergo, a value in The Last Jedi is a sight that is free from sight. Sight is a power. And power is because of uniformity; the condition of uniformity is a different non-condition – a different non-condition is a different freedom. A different freedom which is free from a different freedom is a uniform oppression which owes itself to a uniform oppression. A uniform oppression is just a difference, and is therefore just an oppression. An oppression that owes an oppression is an oppression that is free from a state of peace (and finally, the real point emerges). In The Last Jedi, the state of peace, and the state of balance and justice are actual obstacles. The state of injustice, and the state of tyranny are on the run from peace and tranquillity. With this in mind, it begs to wonder what the state of action is: if tyranny is the force causing the action, as it’s causing the action in order to escape the real tyranny of peace, what then is the composition of the action itself? It’s because of this sort of evaluation, and because of this sort of DNA of the product that I’m inclined to suggest that Rian Johnson’s instalment of the Star Wars saga is not only the most philosophical instalment, but that it’s also eerily similar to the Tom Ford masterpiece Nocturnal Animals. The Tom Ford drama Nocturnal Animals is legitimately one of the best movies ever made – perhaps only beaten by the 1977 horror thriller The Sentinel – which is what makes it feel really surreal and exciting to connect the Rian Johnson sequel to it. Traditionally, Star Wars films have always been fluff and no substance – what a leap!"
3,Annabelle Creation: an analysis,arts-entertainment," In a previous article that I wrote, I gave a splitting reference to the main theme of Annabelle Creation; though its validity can’t be confirmed (as if any idea in any movie can be confirmed), the idea that was highlighted was to do with a copy ending a problem by not being part of the solution. The idea can feel somewhat whimsy, but it worked for the article that it was part of. In hindsight, I think I may have now since come across a better, and a more emotional point of view of Annabelle Creation. (And yes: a point of view that’s emotional even with respect to my past desire to be a guardian to the actress Talitha Bateman) Maybe this isn’t emotional, but let’s see if it is: the gist, and the basic perception of the new idea is that evil has the right to be left alone. In Annabelle Creation, the prequel story about the real origin of the Annabelle doll, the most underlying, deep and important concept that defines the story is that evil is a force of nature that has rights of its own – and that these rights, or just that this fundamental right to exist needn’t be at the expense of any opposite force of nature. Overall, should this kind of concept be emotional? Instinct says that it should, but does logic say that it should? Evil is the impossible. Many wouldn’t come to that conclusion, or at least wouldn’t feel the need to come to that conclusion, but it’s a logical conclusion to arrive at. Evil is annihilation, and annihilation can be interpreted as just sheer and simple absence – the impossible. In light of this, it’s now the impossible that has rights. Since a right is an approval, the dynamic at play is the relationship between an approval and the impossible. As the impossible is what can’t happen, the impossible is an action that can’t happen. An action that can’t happen is an action that influences approval. Approval is also action, which means that whilst an approval is a copy of an action that can’t happen, it’s only the action that can’t happen which can control the action that can happen. In other words: hierarchy is a copy of evil, but it’s only evil that can serve hierarchy. (Needless to say, this will need further examination) An alternate version, of hierarchy being a copy of evil is equality being a detached force from evil. And then in ensuing logic, the substitute for just evil having the power to serve hierarchy is not just equality having the inability to hurt equality: thus, the updated dilemma is when evil and equality have nothing to do with one another, and yet evil can’t possibly hurt equality. Evil isn’t a copy, and it can’t hurt copy: a copy is evil, and a copy can hurt evil. Evil is copy, and by being copy evil has the ability to end itself. In Annabelle Creation, and in the story of Janice, the entire universe is nothing but a device that evil has created in order to end itself. Planets, galaxies, science, mathematics and biology are all just follies, all just fictions that evil has created as an elaborate way to destroy its own existence. This is where I ask if emotion is warranted; in actuality, this is where I’m currently asking if my past desire to be a father figure to Talitha Bateman is warranted."

5,The Vintage Guitar News and Views,arts-entertainment," The Vintage Guitar News and Views. Authored by  Robert Gregory Mayo, Proprietor of Greg’s guitars. All the girls I’ve loved (or the ones that got away). As a vintage guitar dealer, when I am considering making a purchase for inventory, I have to speculate on what may be a strong selling instrument in the future. I have been lucky at times to have purchased guitars by just being at the right place at the right time over the years. Selling these guitars I have found it necessary in growing my business, yet at times it has been difficult to let some of them go to my clientele because, like you, I also have a special place in my life for old guitars and gear. This is probably the hardest part of doing what I do, letting some of my girls go. So here are a few of the guitars over the years I wish I could have kept and found heartbreaking to watch them go. I started in this business with what, at the time, was an overlooked but not obscure American made line of guitars and acquired quite a collection before I started to offer them for sale to the rest of the world. These guitars were made in Nashville in the 60’s and 70’s at The R.G. and G. factory and were known as The Grammer Guitar. Although I had my selection of the various models the one that still stands out as ""the one that got away"" was a pristine example in Brazilian rosewood with unusually figured sapwood running along her sides and back creating a stunning guitar. But alas like I stated before, when your in business you have to meet customer demands and this was one of the last Grammer guitars I finally let go of and sold. Then came ""Priscilla"", when I acquired her she had been abused, painted with varnish to ‘protect’ her, the bridge was lifting, she needed a neckset and had some loose braces, but had the most pleasant and pleasing tonal voice, I knew she was going to be special. She had some of the most beautiful slab-cut, cross grained and figured Brazilian rosewood that I just fell in love with. I could tell I wanted her from the start. After she was put back into playable condition she never disappointed me. Everyone that held her fell in love, she just made you smile every time you played her. There was (and still is) something magical about her and to this day I hold all my guitars to the bar she set. Friends would sit anxiously in my living room stealing glances her way until I gave them the approval to pick her up. Finally a good friend on the west coast just had to ask that dreaded question ""How much would she really cost me?"". Ahh no not again, why can’t you find another to love? I threw out a price and without hesitation he ponied up and Priscilla was gone. But she still resides right where I sent her and one day she may be mine once again. You’ve heard the saying ""If you love something, let it go and one day it will return…"" or something to that effect. Oh, Priscilla. Then when the housing market went belly up and people started panicking, I was flooded with vintage 1950 era Gibson acoustic guitars. L-OOs, J-45s,Country Westerns, I actually ran out of money I was buying so many. Funny how over the years guitars seem to come to me in groups made by the same manufacturer, can’t figure that out but believe me I won't complain one bit. The one I miss was a true road warrior worn, scarred and ohhh so sweet. I had a client trying various J45s seeking one to add to his collection so naturally I showed him the best ones as I knew he had discerning taste and thought we had finally found the one he desired, when he glanced over to the corner of the shop and there framed in sunlight resting on a guitar stand was ""Melinda"". I tried to ignore his flirtatious glances in her direction and keep him focused on the guitar in his hands, as I wanted Melinda all to myself as long as possible, but to no avail. He insisted to see her and I tried kind of nonchalantly to let him know she was in battered and worn shape, rode hard and put up wet and was not in near as good a condition as the guitar he was playing…...didn’t work, once he strummed her he just gave me that look of discovery when we play one we like and just like that, Melinda was gone. But like the other guitars in this article she is still with my client and, in his own words, she will be till his dying day. As for the ""older Ladies"" this old gal had it going on for sure. Made in the 1890s by Washburn guitars she was delicate, ornate, intricate and yet plain all at once. She didn’t have the best voice I have ever heard, but the sheer craftsmanship dedicated to her build was something to be desired.(In a letter from Washburn it was indicated that she was not even the most ornate guitar line they produced during this time period). She was lovely, almost breathtaking and all her trimmings were done by hand, no CNC machines back then boys. I know I can never replace her, but I may have the option to buy her back as once again she still resides right where I shipped her. After all , ""I do sell keepers’. After my earlier heartbreaks of doing what I do you may be wondering ""what about those electric ladies""? Yes, I have also had my share of broken hearts with these girls as well, but my heart has always had a certain fondness for vintage acoustics since that is what I started Greg’s Guitars with so many years ago. I guess the old saying about that first love still holds true. I would say the first electric guitar I really did not want to part with as soon as I had to was an obscure late 1960 Ibanez electric. She was small, sleek and packed a punch with just the right combination of what were inexpensive parts to make everything fall into place just right. A cheap top loading ashtray bridge, body mounted single coil pickups with slugs of cobalt infused alnico magnets to really cut through a mix. Her neck profile was 50’s chunky and the slab or Brazilian rosewood for her fingerboard was at least 3/8ths of an inch thick. Several friends also agreed that she was the most ""in tune"" guitar they had ever played all the way up and down her neck. This girl went to the M.I.M in Arizona where she resides for all the world to see. I have also been lucky enough to have more than my fair share of 1950 era Gibson electric guitars and the one that still haunts me to this day was ""Jenny"" a 1961 Gibson ES 345 Stereo model that was as near mint as I have seen and put the A** in P.A.F. Smooth lady here guys, articulate and well rounded like a fitness model in a small bikini, she made you breathe just a little heavier and my heart skip a beat every time I held her! I knew just as soon as I saw this next girl that she was not going to stay very long and that saddened me to the nth degree. Too perfect, too complete and well, just way out of my league. I fell in love the very first time we met and she had my heart and knew it. She was blonde bombshell with all the right accessories and straight out of a 1960 centerfold. She was gone before I even had time to kiss her. Now don’t get me wrong here, I am not complaining about how fortunate I have been with my girls and I am humbled by those of you whom I have dealings with in helping you to locate that perfect girl for your very own stable. It is all part of what I do and I am fortunate to have owned or sold so many fantastic guitars over the years, but from time to time it is nice to kick back and reminisce, lost in yesterday and all the girls that I have loved. So until the next time, may all your days be memorable, all your friends stay true and all your riffs be killa.  Greg at Greg’s Guitars."
6,The Grand Opening of Aquaman,arts-entertainment," Following the events of Justice League, Arthur Curry, the reluctant pioneer of the submerged kingdom of Atlantis, is gotten between surface occupants and his own particular family who are set up to lash out and assault the surface The film is planned to be  released by  Warner Bros. Pictures in RealD 3D and IMAX 3D on December 21, 2018. Warner Bros: The main critical arrangement was the procurement of the rights to Avery Hopwood's 1919 Broadway play, The Gold Diggers, from showy director David Belasco. Nonetheless, Rin Tin Tin,  a canine brought from France after World War I by an American officer, set up their reputation.  Rin Tin appeared in the component Where the North Begins. The motion picture was successful to the point that Jack marked the puppy to star in more movies for $1,000 per week.  Rin Tin turned into the studio's best star.  Jack nicknamed him ""The Mortgage Lifter""  and the achievement supported Darryl F. Zanuck's career.  Zanuck in the end turned into a best producer  and in the vicinity of 1928 and 1933 filled in as Jack's correct hand man and official maker, with duties including everyday movie production. More achievement came after Ernst Lubitsch was enlisted as head director;  Harry Rapf left the studio to join Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Lubitsch's movie The Marriage Circle was the studio's best movie of 1924, and was on The New York Times best rundown for that year. In spite of the achievement of Rin Tin and Lubitsch, Warner's remained a lesser studio.  Sam and Jack chose to offer Broadway performing artist John Barrymore the lead part in Beau Brummel.  The film was successful to the point that Harry marked Barrymore to a long haul contract;  like The Marriage Circle, Beau Brummell was named one of the ten best movies of the year by the Times.  By the finish of 1924, Warner Bros. was ostensibly Hollywood's best autonomous studio,  where it contended with ""The Big Three"" Studios (First National, Paramount Pictures, and MGM).  therefore, Harry Warner—while talking at a tradition of 1,500 free exhibitors in Milwaukee, Wisconsin—could persuade the producers to burn through $500,000 in daily paper advertising,  and Harry considered this to be a chance to build up theaters in urban areas, for example, New York and Los Angeles. As the studio thrived, it picked up support from Wall Street, and in 1924 Goldman Sachs masterminded a noteworthy advance. With this new cash, the Warners purchased the pioneer Vitagraph Company which had an across the nation appropriation system.  In 1925, Warners' additionally tested in radio, setting up a fruitful radio station, KFWB, in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was a pioneer of movies with synchronized sound (at that point known as ""talking pictures"" or ""talkies""). In 1925, at Sam's asking, Warner's consented to add this component to their productions.  By February 1926, the studio revealed a net loss of $333,413. Wear Juan opens Warners' Theater After a long stretch denying Sam's ask for sound, Harry consented to change, as long as the studio's utilization of synchronized sound was for ambient melodies purposes only.  The Warners marked an agreement with the sound architect organization Western Electric and set up Vitaphone.  In 1926, Vitaphone started making films with music and impacts tracks, most eminently, in the element Don Juan featuring John Barrymore. The film was quiet, yet it highlighted countless shorts toward the start. To buildup Don Juan's discharge, Harry procured the substantial Piccadilly Theater in Manhattan, New York City, and renamed it Warners' Theatre. Wear Juan debuted at the Warners' Theater in New York on August 6, 1926. Throughout the early history of film dispersion, theater proprietors contracted ensembles to go to film showings, where they gave soundtracks. Through Vitaphone, Warner Bros. created eight shorts (which broadcast toward the start of each appearing of Don Juan the nation over) in 1926. Numerous film generation organizations scrutinized the necessity.  Don Juan did not recover its creation cost  and Lubitsch left for MGM.  By April 1927, the Big Five studios (First National, Paramount, MGM, Universal, and Producers Distributing) had demolished Warner's,  and Western Electric recharged Warner's Vitaphone contract with terms that permitted other film organizations to test sound."
7,What has happened to Music,arts-entertainment," Many people will remember the ‘good old days’ of Jazz, Rock’n’Roll and Pop music of the late 20th century. The large majority of the younger generation listen to the music being created today, mainly electronic dance music (EDM), and of course, Pop music. After talking to a wide range of people from various demographics, I have gathered opinions to assess the direction that music has taken and the direction it is going. Pop music is simply popular music at the current time. It is constantly changing, always reflecting and depicting the times in which it is created. For example, during World War 2, all sides, the Allies and the Nazis used music as a propaganda tool. These songs spread all over the world and inspired troops worldwide. Nowadays, music reflects the electronic element that so many people seem to love. EDM is one of the most listened to genres at the moment, and that is why current artists that focus on Electronic music are also being labelled as Pop artists. After an interview with Mark Scott, Head of Music at Newington College, I understand the effect that Pop music really has on society. Pop music, now more than ever, has been created to be easy to listen to. For non-musically minded people, most music is simply music, no matter whether the chord progression ends in a satisfying cadence or whether or the song has a pleasant counter-melody. Pop music at its core is music that is popular. So, for one to say that Pop music is bad, good or neither good nor bad is an entirely subjective perspective, but the general consensus is that Pop music is just music that people like to listen to. Once an artist releases a hit, the people listening to them become curious. They start to explore their music, and eventually all the music that artist makes are considered popular whether or not they are good songs. Chris Paton, Head of Contemporary Music at Newington College, discusses the nostalgic feeling that the older generations feel when they listen to older music. The feeling they experience often causes their opinion lean to the ‘anti-pop’ perspective. Mr. Paton states that ‘What I hate about the large majority of Pop music and EDM these days is that it lacks much of the spirit and sophistication of yesteryear.’ This is a very important point about Pop music. Due to the massive use of electronics to create music, the soul of music is gone, or at least withered so much from where it was in the 20th century that it is almost unrecognisable. Furthermore, Pop music is not by far the only music being created today. Besides EDM music, which often crosses over into the Pop category, there are music genres such as Alternative Rock and people are still writing and publishing Jazz songs, Classical pieces, Blues, Soul, Classic Rock etc.. From my point of view, a lot of this music is good music. There are some fantastic Alternative Rock bands, such as Queens of the Stone Age, Violent Soho, Arctic Monkeys, Sticky Fingers, the list goes on. In my opinion, these bands are so good because they are able to mix older Classic Rock with elements of modern electronic music when composing/making songs. There are a multitude of reasons that make up music. The raw elements of songs from all time periods are timbre, pitch and dynamics, or volume. These three elements change as the typical characteristics of the music change. For example, dynamics are a lot more straightforward than they were in the past. Nowadays, there isn’t as much of a range, and the range of the dynamics is typically louder. There are also straightforward ‘terraced dynamics’, which are just levels of volume, with no in between. On the contrary, the pitch of songs has increased. With the introduction of machines and software into the creation of music, we have been able to use pitches that weren’t available to artists previously. In regards to timbre, ‘Scientific American’ a renowned article website published a University’s work on timbre. The University collected a database of 50 million songs, and statistically proved that the overall variety in timbre was shrinking. This means a more and more homogenous sound over all songs. This is most likely due to the common structure of songs now and the software that people use. Money is another contributing factor to the worsening state of music. During the age of Rock, Jazz and Classical music, many artists were getting paid barely enough to live off. For example, when the classic Australian band AC/DC started they were just getting by with their income from their shows. Other bands often have to have other jobs to support them on their music careers. However, they persisted because they loved what they did, no matter the income they got. Today, on the other hand, many artists are in it for the money. They seem to not care about the art of music, but they just manufacture songs that will make them money, not convey their opinions and views or their feelings on a certain topic. This is a very big factor in the declining quality of music: passion. In conclusion, I believe that music has gotten worse with regards to today’s music. This is due to the more and more homogenous sound that has been described from the large database of songs collected by a university in the U.S. However, I think that music will loop back around or at least change in the future, and hopefully be something worth listening to."

9,Puzzle Pieces by The Paintbox Players (Review),arts-entertainment," The Paintbox Players presents Puzzle Pieces A series of one act plays by Robert Scott Saturday 24th March 2018 Rosliston and Cauldwell Village Hall, Derbyshire, UK The recently founded Paintbox Players delighted and entertained their audience last night with a series of one act plays written by award winning author Robert Scott. The set for each play was minimalistic; a painted window, a table and chairs to set the scene. It may have been nice to see a little more scenery, but as this is the very first performance from this group, I can imagine that the production had a strict budget. Closure (Comedy) Luke's birthday party is a lonely affair - there's just him, until his ex-girlfriend Tanya walks in. She only meant to drop off his gift, but soon they're involved in a strenuous argument over closure and who gets it.  Carl Smith gave a strong comic performance as the frustrated Luke, matched by his counterpart Nicole James as Tanya. They worked well as a duo and a pleasure to watch with many funny lines. However, the pace really picked up during the second half as David Owen arrived as the bumbling caretaker, who caught them in the act of ‘making up’. There were plenty of laughs from the audience as Luke tried to hide Tanya from the caretaker. There were a couple of moments where lines were not heard due to laughter from the audience, but this was rare. David Owen’s dry performance was a joy to watch and worked splendidly as a counterbalance to the other animated characters. Sketches (Comedy) Two short sketches led by Adam Livett interspersed the plays. Joan (The Movie) was a humorous piece where Adam Livett, a Hollywood writer, pitched the most ludicrous storyline to the long suffering executive played by David Owen. The second sketch, Symphony Dreadful, was delightful. Carl Smith played the ""Next Beethoven"" although his only likeness to the great man was his deafness and ill-temper. His skilled performance maximised the comedic effect and produced one of the funniest moments of the evening. Adam Livett, playing a TV interviewer, had a natural rapport with the audience and his timing had the audience chuckling throughout. Checkmate (Drama) In this play, a friendly game of chess between husband and wife becomes more of a game of cat and mouse. Michael likes to think he's always one move ahead, but perhaps this time Amy has him in check. This script was a contrast to the others on offer (and I would guess this was a deliberate production decision.) The complexity of the characters and menacing dialogue created a Hitchcockesque thriller which relied upon two young actors to create the atmosphere. This was a directorial masterpiece by David Owen. Adoria Grace as the vengeful Amy was captivating. Her sensational performance gave a dark and disturbing portrayal of a woman on the brink of insanity, due to her husband’s treatment. Michael was played by Richard Frudd. Richard gave a strong performance. He was required to demonstrate a whole range of emotions from domineering to vulnerable, which he achieved, no mean feat in just over twenty minutes. Bride Before A Fall (Comedy) Victor and his mistress Madelyn plot an 'accident' for Victor’s dim but very rich wife Lottie. Their scheming oft goes awry as they consider 42 different scenarios for the deed. The final result has unexpected consequences for all three of them. Joel Hutson gave an amusing performance as the long suffering husband. His comedy timing was perfect which ensured the audience were in stitches towards the end of the show. In contrast to her earlier role, Adoria Grace played the rather unbearable and dim-witted wife, Lottie, showing herself to be a versatile and talented actress. Nicole James, as the jealous lover Madelyn produced an assured and strong performance and I very much enjoyed watching her in this role. There were a couple of stumbles which were well recovered from without the need of a prompt and were nothing that would detract from the enjoyment of the evening. Verdict 4/5 - The production was clearly a success and achieved its purpose, an enjoyable night out was had by all.  There were a couple of moments where pauses for laughter would have been beneficial, but perhaps this will be polished for future productions. All the plays were pleasing to watch, but if I had to pick one to highlight, Checkmate was unique and a quality piece of theatre."
10,Why nobody will understand a true best friend relationship.,arts-entertainment," Why nobody will understand a true best friend relationship. By: LH It is often seen in films that friendship that we all deny to be real, that friendship in which two people, who once began as strangers, are completely and utterly drawn together like two magnets, and though many differences they seem to never have enough of each-other. It’s the type of friendship that is looked down at by average people because it is not an average everyday thing to find somebody whom you can connect deeply. And though it might seem as this might take a romantic turn I am actually writing about a girl’s friendship, in fact, the natural process of going from strangers to almost feeling such comfort that it becomes a familiar feeling, as if you’ve known the person your whole life and because of that, true friendships are based in respect and care. Respect, love  and care sound more like something you would expect from the ideal boyfriend, well, ladies, we often search for a boyfriend who’s just as crazy and great as our best friends because if we never get tired of somebody like our best friend chances are that man will never get us tired, and yes I mean ""us"" because that man must be ready to be accepted by the best friend, once that stage has been approved with high merit  it will most likely be one  hell of an amazing ride. So why is it that average people tend to dislike closeness? ""Movie-like"" friendships? Why is it that people will try to get into the middle of what seems to be ""an ideal"" pair of friends, with such bond that is unbreakable? Well, every question includes and answer; firstly, closeness is not easy and as much as people enjoy opening up they do not enjoy listening, how do you achieve full closeness when it is a one sided selfish service? Let’s move on to the next thing, the ""movie-like"" impossible friendship, if it has been portrayed in films it is because chances are someone out there has experienced it but people yet find it hard to believe as it seems ""too good to be true"" and accept it or not humans adore to focus on the negative aspects of life, on the ‘dull reality’ and the ‘impossibility’ in things so why would anybody ever want to accept that ""movie like"" friendships are actually acceptable and existent when they have not found that? That’d make their existence slightly more miserable and nobody wants that. Last but not least, ""the unbreakable bond"", again, people, humans detest strength in others when they do not have it in themselves, it is a self reflection of insecurity, of lack of confidence in themselves, they do not want to believe there are people who are willing to fight so hard to take care of each other, push each other to be successful or happy or both, because once again going back to the beginning of this question-answering game, the big thing is: if people don’t have it they don’t want others to have it, natural jealousy is so common, some of us get to be lucky to realise how inhabitable this is in our bodies and we get rid of it and some others let the jealousy sink in and try their bests shots at ruining marvellous friendships with gossip or trash talking for the sake of feeling better with themselves, as if in a way that’s a mode of self assurance that what they have thought all along, all those false theories about ""they must truly not give a damn about each other"" are true. Sadly, my dear common people, there are unbreakable bonds that gladly do exist and unfortunately make the world a bit of a happier place. Hopefully you will one day find that bond, in a stranger and they will eventually turn into one of those people you would get arrested for."
11,Getting ready for the Avengers Infinity Wars premier,arts-entertainment," This year will see the release of the new Avengers movie and whether you have big kids or little kids, it’s sure to create a buzz. The shops will be full of merchandise to help celebrate our favourite superheroes. We’ll learn more about the actors who play them. The premiere in each major city will cause huge amounts of excitement. Which celebrities will attend? What will they wear? And most important of all…..what will you wear to the movie premiere in your city? Now, if you’re planning on paying homage to your favourite character then we have some tips for you. Iron Man Now depending on who you are and how old you are, you could go dressed as Tony Stark or Iron Man. Tony Stark is our loveable billionaire industrialist. He was selfish and spoiled but is captured, nearly killed, and nearly forced to build a weapon of mass destruction. Instead, he created an advanced suit of armour to save his life and escape captivity – and thus created Iron Man. If you decide to be Tony Stark, a costume can be put together quite easily – think suit and sunnies. Or go with the full Iron Man suit. Now as with anything, there are the budget options through to the not-so-budget. We’ve seen a supreme Iron Man costume for a whopping USD$899.99! It’s a high-quality replica which is sure to make an entrance at the premiere. I guess the question is, how far do you want to go? Thor The God of Thunder, with the strength to push the Leaning Tower of Pisa over with his little finger, and the power to live a very very very very long life. These are big shoes to fill but a fun costume to don. When choosing which costume to go with, our advice would be to pay homage to your favourite movie version. So, if you or your family member loved the gladiator fight in Thor Ragnarok, choose the Gladiator themed Thor costume. You can buy the full suit including bulky arms, hammer, and helmet. Or, you could build your own with the essentials i.e. protective vest (must look like body armour), a Thor helmet, Thor hammer (unless you’re going as Thor post Ragnorak), some good black cargo pants, and some heavy-duty boots. Captain America A symbol of patriotism and freedom, with an unbreakable morale compass, Steve Rogers is Captain America. A human experiment during the second world war, he went from wimp to superhuman warrior. Captain America has worn a different suit in every movie he’s appeared in. So, all you need to do is choose which one. Whichever suit you choose, it’s important to accessorise correctly. Helmet or mask, complete with the ""A"" logo. The shield (arguably the most important), slightly different in all appearances but always a red, blue, white/silver striped disc shape with a star in the middle. Black Widow The only woman in a team of male superheroes, Black Widow is one of the most lethal members of the avengers. Saved from the Hand by Wolverine and Captain America, Natasha Romanova became part of the Black Widow Program. A team of elite female sleeper agents. She’s strong, deadly, and extremely beautiful, so you’re sure to make an entrance. Black is the theme of the costume. You need to look fierce and womanly. A black figure-hugging jump suit or Black Widow costume, gloves, black sport boot, drop leg gun holster and magazine holder, red or blonde wig (she’s blonde in the new movie trailer), and a Black Widow Airsoft Spring Pistol. Put all this together and you’ll be a force to be reckoned with. Thanos Now, if you really want to make an entrance, try going against the crowd and turn up as the baddie. Thanos, referred to as the Dark Lord by his underlings or the Mad Titan by the Galactic community. He is a powerful cosmic warlord who seeks to obtain the Infinity Stones. He’s big, bad, and ugly. First and foremost you need to turn yourself a lighter shade of lilac. This could be achieved by wearing a full body suit (hopefully the venue won’t be too hot). Then you’ll need a Thanos war vest, complete with gold armour around the neck and shoulders, and some leather or leather look trousers. To finish off the look, get yourself an Infinity Gauntlet bank prop glove, a gold belt, and some heavy duty black boots. Then if you really want to go for it, there are some great make-up tutorials online to turn your face into the something special."

This way the inexperienced scholar should at the very least be able to study the basics. It seems that sessions given by a piano instructor is not a necessity anymore. Generally such lessons are only for students that are simply starting out to study to play the piano. It could likewise be a great help for those that just intend to know if piano lessons is something they truly wish to do. Nevertheless you certainly ought to contact a licensed piano educator as quickly as you got to a certain level. Please go through these advantages of piano courses through the internet compared to courses from standard piano instructors: The first and most likely most essential benefit to indicate is that of costs. On-line courses will commonly be someplace around the 50 bucks for an complete course of tutorials. This may most likely take you around a year in order to accomplish a fairly high degree of playing. For that type of money you might barely be in a position to take part in two courses with a standard teacher. One more positive feature is the duration. Let's take one hour piano session with a tutor. First, you need to take a trip to his or her location or workshop. And then traveling back to your home can quite definitely consume two hours or possibly even more. It can easily cost the better part of an afternoon or evening, leaving very little time for just about anything else.

In which you might be asked to play one specific thing and then always have to remember that till the following lesson. There is absolutely no rewind and replay with an genuine piano teacher. After handling a couple of the pros with regards to the online piano lessons methods. It is now time to just take a peek at the positive sides of having piano classes from a real piano instructor. Taking standard piano classes will keep you in contact with a real piano player who can observe ones playing. So that he or she can point out things that you cannot identify for yourself. That way the instructor will be in a position to control any bad playing characteristics. Those habits could turn into issues that may be difficult to correct at a later date. Piano classes by means of the internet are only good for beginner piano playing levels as I stated previously. So you must when getting to a certain phase, have piano classes with a certified piano instructor."

But most of them have the talent of acting and an aspiration to make a difference with their talent. It is a cherished dream of some in the industry and be an Indian actor. The versatility that exists in it gives people the push and the excitement. A new character and a new role each time require efforts and talent.

Transforming into a new person each time and also giving a touch of yourself, is what is required to be a good actor.

16,How To Play The Piano Basics,arts-entertainment," There has been an increase of available online piano lessons over the past couple of years. To learn piano online would be too difficult according to many people. However, that has changed because of a couple of piano teachers, that produced some special videos. For the beginning piano student to be able to learn the basics they also prepared special books. So the student does not need to follow regular lessons, with a real piano teacher. I want to express that these kind of on-line courses are in general only effective for all those starting out. As well as for individuals that want to understand if piano playing is appropriate for them or not. As soon as you have accomplished to a specific degree, then you definitely require to find a genuine piano instructor. I wrote down a couple of pros of online lessons compared to the lessons given by teachers: The price of an internet piano lessons is the initial as well as the most essential advantage. A complete on-line piano training course will certainly cost you generally about 50 bucks. Such a program could take around a year for you to become a fairly good pianist. For this price you would hardly get 2 and even 3 piano lessons from a regular face to face piano instructor. The time saving is additionally something we could think about. Since you will certainly need to take a trip to the instructors house or workshop. With the time it requires to drive back, could take you 2 or 3 hrs. Little time left for doing various other stuff in your priceless afternoon. With the online piano training course you can take a session whenever you have a minute left. Compared with a private teacher there is no dedication with online piano lessons. Unless you have the dedication to become successful yourself. You need to have discipline when choosing an on-line piano course. The good as well as a vital aspect of on-line lessons is that you can learn at your personal speed. If you desire and if you think you are proceeding well, then you could decide to skip lessons. Repeat the recordings to exactly know how a particular piano item needs to be played. Decide for yourself on just how it ought to be played rather than hearing it from a genuine piano tutor. In case of having a life teacher, you will always need to remember the earlier lessons in case the instructor asks you to play a specific item. Piano teachers do not have any type of rewind or replay switch. Now that we understand the favorable components of having internet piano lessons. It is now time to understand as well as to compare them with the pros of having a real piano tutor. Face to face piano sessions will certainly maintain your contact with a real pianist that could check your progress. Then he will be able to point out factors that you might not discover on your own. That implies that the teacher will have the capacity to reduce any kind of poor piano playing techniques. Those practices might turn into problems that may be too difficult to deal with at a later time. A professional piano instructor ought to have the expertise of a broad range of piano tunes. And be capable to assist you to identify parts that you appreciate. And that it will definitely fit your specific degree of playing. As I emphasized previously, online piano course sessions are merely appropriate for the lower degrees of studying the piano. You will certainly need to go to a certified piano instructor when you get to a specific stage."
17,Piano or keyboard:  What’s the difference?,arts-entertainment," In this age of technology, everything is rapidly changing. An instrument that was once the size of a sofa can now be kept in a bag and taken anywhere you like. Many musicians have played pianos for years, but still don’t quite understand the differences between a piano and a keyboard. Both have the same function, and provide virtually the same performance. However, musicians and audiences typically agree there are distinct differences between the sounds each of them produces. Here’s a quick comparison to help you understand the significant differences between the two instruments. Pianos Pianos have been used for solo performances for centuries. Over time, the size of pianos has been reduced significantly and groups now commonly used them as well. Perhaps the most obvious difference is that all pianos have 88 keys, while the number of keys often varies among keyboards.  Having more keys enables musicians to play more notes and create different sounds that might not be possible on a keyboard. Here are a few other significant differences: •	Pianos have pedals that enhance their sounds, while keyboards do not. •	Concert pianos are huge and can’t be transported as easily as keyboards. •	Most concert pianists perform in auditoriums built especially for pianos to better showcase their talents, while keyboardists can perform practically anywhere. If you plan to learn to play piano, it is better to learn on a traditional piano because it will provide you the opportunity to learn all the notes. Afterward, you should be able to easily produce the same notes on a keyboard. Keyboards Keyboards (or ""digital pianos"") typically have 76 keys, which means you might not be able to produce some notes. However, with proper training and practice, musicians often produce the same sounds with both. Keyboards are electronic, and some people maintain it affects their sound quality. But whatever slight differences discerning ears might hear between the sounds produced by these two instruments, in the end, most music lovers enjoy the sounds of both. Interestingly, the greatest difference is likely much more noticeable to performers than audiences.  Keyboard players quickly become acquainted with the limits of the ""touch"" and the ""action"" of the keys.  The quality of this tactile connection is critical to truly fine performances.  However, the electronic reality limits the extent to which touch and action can be adjusted, while the mechanical nature of pianos allows virtually limitless adjustments to both. Bottom line In the final analysis, there’s no need to worry about the subtle differences between these two instruments.  High-end keyboards even closely replicate the adjustability of pianos’ touch and action. So, when speaking in terms of comparable quality, both allow you to give your best.  In the end, a truism of the digital age applies.  What comes out is largely determined by what you put in.  That’s why I recommend that musicians begin by learning to play piano before deciding whether or not to try their hand (or hands) at a keyboard based upon their personal tastes and the requirements of their performances and venues."

19,Gzhel Style Porcelain – A Famous Russian Craft,arts-entertainment," Gzhel is the name of a traditional Russian craft production of porcelain and pottery items – dishes, tiles, and other decorative pieces. To be more precise, Gzhel is the name of a region southeast of Moscow that includes about 27 villages and small towns which comprise the so-called ""Gzhel Bush"" where this pottery production and porcelain manufacturing are based. The porcelain-pottery industry developed there due to the presence of clay that is perfectly suited for these purposes. Around 1800 the artisan Kulikov brothers discovered the secret to white porcelain earthenware and since then the region has been the center of this porcelain craft. The Kulikovs tried to keep their recipe and technology secret, but could not hide the information for long; soon, a porcelain-making tradition spread throughout the area. The owner of a famous porcelain enterprise by the name of Kuznetsov was definitely from Gzhel region. He founded a small workshop and started porcelain production in 1812. Remarkably, by 1917 Kuznetsov's manufacturing plants produced two-thirds of all porcelain goods in Russia, and his company had the largest porcelain factory in Europe. After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, when Communist took control of Russia, the huge enterprise was nationalized. When we hear the word Gzhel today, we imagine white porcelain goods with bright blue painting; these are the hallmarks of Gzhel products. Craftsmen in the region produce a wide range of utensils and decorative items – porcelain sculptures and figurines, boxes, vases, candlesticks, ashtrays, and even clocks. Coloring is done with special cobalt paint that is applied to raw unglazed porcelain pieces. Then the painted products are baked in high-temperature kilns. As a result of this firing, the cobalt paint becomes almost black before turning bright, vivid blue. The products are then coated with glaze and fired a second time. This technique protects the painting very well. Despite using only one color of cobalt, porcelain production artists get lively paintings with many shades of blue. This is achieved through a brush technique where various strokes produce different thicknesses of paint and effect varying degrees of translucency. Currently, there are some relatively large enterprises in Gzhel region; however, production of traditional Gzhel porcelain still engages a lot of small workshops. These workshops offer custom-made items, with each of their products an original, one-of-a-kind piece. Hand painted with cobalt blue on white porcelain, Gzhel remains one of the favorite symbols of Russian arts and handicrafts. Gzhel is now not only a national art form, but also a true cultural and historical symbol of Russia. Every Russian family has at least one piece of Gzhel kitchenware. So, if you want to take home something very traditional and completely Russian, you should definitely buy a set of Gzhel porcelain ware. Products made in Gzhel style can be purchased in many places – factory stores, specialized porcelain shops in some large cities, as well as in souvenir shops and gift stores."
20,What astrology can predict,arts-entertainment," What does the future hold? This is a question that has intrigued and fascinated mankind throughout history. Few of us, however, if given a chance to read the future like an open book, would really want to. A zest for the unexpected is part of being human. Nevertheless, most of us would like some guidelines for what's coming up. In past and present cultures all over the world human beings have studied astrology, connecting the positions of the sun, moon, planets, and stars with conditions here on earth. It was observed that nature and human life followed definite cycles and that these were reflected in the predictable cycles of the heavenly bodies. For example, we predict the seasons by forecasting the regular yearly changes in the axis of the earth with respect to the sun. We also predict the tides by the positions of the sun and moon relative to the earth. Going beyond these obvious interrelationships, astrology has, through the ages, collected an organized body of knowledge that makes it possible to make other predictions about natural phenomena and human behavior. However, future events are not predetermined and irrevocable. Just as the ""science"" of economics, for example, works with probabilities and trends, so astrology tries to delineate areas of probability and possibility. It is somewhat like weather predicting. When the local weather1 forecaster predicts a ninety percent chance of rain and it doesn't rain, he can always say, ""Well, that's the ten percent chance for you."" To come to the weatherman's defense, if it doesn't rain, then obviously some unforeseen factor must have intervened at the last moment to keep what must have seemed like a virtual certainty from happening. In the case of an astrological forewarning, it seems that an act of will power, or sometimes simple caution, can often prevent something untoward from happening or can tip the balance in our favor. The basic importance of the positions of heavenly bodies at any given time in respect to the earth is that they indicate the present relationship among various energies, similar to the way a musical score indicates the wavelength relationship of the various notes being played. To use another comparison, the positions of the sun, moon, and planets at any given time may indicate current conditions surrounding us, just as taking a blood sample determines the current condition of the body as a whole. For convenience, however, we speak of ""the effects of planets"" or ""the effects of a zodiac sign"" in the same way that we say ""the sun rises,"" although we know that it is really the earth turning to meet the sun. Astrological predicting can cover a wide range of phenomena. Sometimes if the astrological conditions are very clear-cut, actual ""events"" can be predicted, both on a personal level and on a world scale. However, the more usual case is where possibilities and atmospheres are what can be anticipated. We must also recognize what events are really important. Many things that seemed relatively insignificant at the time are seen eventually (usually much later, in retrospect) to be turning points in people's lives or in world history. Modern science in earlier stages of development, with its initial enthusiasm for absolute proof, seemed to rule out the possibility of connections between cosmic phenomena and human activity. However, science today, with its broader perspectives, is reinvestigating what are emerging as definite connections between heavenly bodies and conditions here on earth. Are certain events inevitable? Winter is inevitable in the north when the sun takes its yearly journey south. The outside temperature and the weather conditions seem beyond our control. But we do have some control over how we prepare for the winter, how cold our houses and our bodies are, and our attitude toward the weather. It's exactly the same when you predict what's going to happen in other ways by using the positions of the sun, moon, and planets! Certain general conditions are inevitable, but we can make preparations for our proper use and often enjoyment of these general conditions. In other words, knowing about coming conditions can help you put them to positive use. You can learn to distinguish between the ""inevitable"" astrological conditions (like winter) and the ""controllable"" astrological conditions (like your preparation for and response to winter). Guidelines for the future give us more freedom rather than less. If we had no idea when to expect the seasons, we would not know when to plant our gardens and when to prepare for the cold. Knowing the future weather can help us plan picnics for sunny days and closet cleanings for rainy days. For each type of planetary influence you will find suggested best uses and cautions. The better you understand what to expect, the better you can create your own preferred response to the condition."

4,How to Play Magic: The Gathering,arts-entertainment," Magic: The Gathering is a strategic fantasy trading card game.  Cards are rated by rarity, from least rare to most rare. The rarity of cards are categorized by common, uncommon, rare, mythic rare, and also a foil version of every card that makes the card slightly more valuable. The game works with you playing a powerful wizard, called a planeswalker, who uses creatures, spells, and weapons to destroy other planeswalkers. So, let's get started on instructions on how to play this strategy, fantasy, and fun game. Buy Cards: You can not play Magic without having the cards. Your deck of cards is your arsenal. The cards come in Booster Packs, Intro Packs, Clash Packs, Fat Packs, and Booster boxes. The best way to get started is to purchase an intro pack. Cards can be bought at a comic or card store, or even a department store. Set up your Constructed Deck: The constructed deck is made before, and brought to wherever you are playing. The deck must have a minimum of 60 cards, with no upper limit. In Magic, cards are released in blocks; each block explains a story of which the cards correlate with. Playing the Game: Now, that you have compiled your cards and made a constructed deck, you are ready to start playing the game. .     Start by facing your opponent- Shuffle your deck, let your opponent cut it in half, place your  deck facing down. Your opponent will do the same. Pick up the top 7 cards from the deck- The seven cards you pick up will be your hand. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws one card and adds that card to their hand. No more than seven cards are allowed in your hand. When a card is used, discarded, or a creature dies, put the card into your graveyard face up. The graveyard is a pile below your deck and can not be played again. Know each player has 20 life points to start with- The 20 life points can go up or down depending on how well you are playing. If your life points hit 0, your opponent wins. Players deal ""damage"" to both creatures and each other. The damage is dealt by creatures or spells. Place your land card- Look at your hand and find a land card. If there is any, place one down in your play zone. Next, play anything that only costs one mana. If you place a creature, turn it sideways for the first turn as summoning sickness takes effect. Understand the phases- Each player has five phases: beginning, first main, combat, second main, and end. Once, you gain an understanding of each phase; you will be ready to start playing the game. Good luck!"
5,"MCU, DCU Role Reversal 2020",arts-entertainment," For roughly the past decade, Marvel (Disney, in all honesty) has created a composite ""Monopoly"" on Superhero films, revolutionizing the scape of mainstream comic media. They took what was nerdy and made it ""cool"" for the general audiences. Hats off to them for that. However, we wouldn't appreciate what's beautiful if it lasted forever. Many critics and fan bases will disagree with the following statement: The DCEU will become more successful than the MCU after 2020. Now before you leave me with 3rd degree burns in the comments let's go over the facts...Or rather a rather perplexing question: What comes after Infinity War? That was rhetorical, and it is because the answer is practically nothing. If we know one thing about the movie industry it's that the consumer base must be fed for a franchise to thrive onward. It's why companies like BV under Disney, Universal, Legendary, even Warner Bros. have been so successful for so long. Every single MCU movie is warranted and backed by a comic whether it be a spin-off or cannon. That's not the case with these other film producers. Disney doesn't need approval from a graphic novel to ""imagine up"" it's next signature princess, but Marvel does. That goes for DC as well. Every time a director veers off cannon(except for Chris Nolan and his outstanding Dark Knight trilogy), they get the brunt of bat(no pun intended). For example, Batman, in the new Dawn of justice, kills. The consequence?  Zack Snyder getting trashed as a terrible director. Did he deserve it? No. Absolutely not. BVS was visually stunning. But breaking Batman's golden rule was indeed a terrible idea. Die hard comic fans don't see that side of the spectrum, and the question is whether pissing off your main fan base is worth the appeal to the general public. Now don't me wrong, I'm not saying DC is better than Marvel or vice versa, but I am suggesting that Marvel had its fair share of the spotlight and now DC will share it if not steal it. This assertion is more based on timing than content. It's more based on business strategy than the better production studio. As aforementioned, Marvel has ruled the scape for a long time and 2020 is when it's reign ends. Getting back on topic, let's take a look at what Marvel has to offer once the Mad Titan gets what's coming for him. An inhumans spin-off? I gagged watching the TV show trailer, a movie will make nominal improvement. Planet Hulk with a World War Hulk follow up? It's plausible, at the expense of consumers seeing all their favorite superheroes slaughtered at the hands of Banner. The bottom line is Marvel will be working with scraps. Guardians of the Galaxy came out of nowhere and turned into a big hit. No one knew who Star-Lord was before GOTG. But the success rate of GOTG type spin-off films is not reliable or feasible in the long term for Marvel. The DCEU on the other hand, whether by accident or on purpose, has been waiting it out, and is just now gathering it's best material. Nolan's TDKT and other DC based productions kept us interested and waiting for the launch of the DCEU, a counter to Marvel's domination in the superhero movie scape. The DCEU is just getting it's roster set. Big names in Cavill, Affleck, Gadot, and Momoa are going to kickstart the extended universe no matter how bad Zack Snyder directs. We've seen flashes(no pun intended) of Darkseid, rumors about Brainiac, Dwayne Johnson hinting at Black Adam etc. And with Wonder Woman, the DCEU is shifting into overdrive. JL looks over the top on trailer; loaded cast, amazing effects, canonical arc, etc. Remember the box office haul the Avengers had? The JL movie will top that and may even top a few other Buena Vista productions (Frozen). The conclusion is, the MCU is dwindling out after 2020 and DCEU has enough material, funding, and fan base to rake mass profit moving forward."
6,Sculpting T&#1077;&#1089;hn&#1110;&#1307;u&#1077;&#1109; &#1072;nd Methods - Which is the Best?,arts-entertainment," Lost Wax Casting is known as Cire Perdue in Frеnсh. It іѕ a process in which a аrtіѕt'ѕ sculpture is used to cast bronze. Thе Lost Wax Casting method is also known as Investment Casting in the mоdеrn industrial world. Thіѕ іѕ a very ancient method used for casting small brоnzе sculptures, but today it is used to make many different artifacts and the process varies from foundry to foundry. Tоdау this developed method of Lost Wax Casting is used to make аrtісlеѕ like fine jewelry, show pieces, dental restoration, a few specific іnduѕtrіаl раrtѕ and also some machine tools. The process of Lost Wax Casting: Rough Sculptor making: A сrеаtіvе artist makes an original sculptor or mold or an artwork by uѕіng raw mаtеrіаl like wax, plaster of Paris or clay. A mixture of oil based clay and wax is preferred аѕ thеѕе materials retain their softness. Final Mold Making: A mold іѕ then made as per the original ѕсulрtоr. The mold is made up of two pieces and a key with shim is placed between the two ріесеѕ during construction so the mold саn be рut accurately back together. Molds are generally mаdе using рlаѕtеr or fiberglass or any other material that may be ѕuіtаblе. A іnnеr mold of latex or vinyl or silicone is put pup рrеѕеrvе the details of the original artwork. Generally, the original artwork made of plaster mold cracks and breaks during the іnіtіаl рhаѕе of deconstruction. Many a time, numerable molds are rеԛuіrеd to get the exact replica of the original artwork. Filling up the mold: Onсе the latex and plaster mold is complete and finished, molten wax is poured into the mold till it gets an even coating all around the mold. The thickness of the wax coating is around 1/8 inch. This process is then rереаtеd until the desired thickness is achieved. Removal of the wax replica: The hollow wax replica of the original artwork is then removed from the mold. The оrіgіnаl mold can be used for making more wax replicas, but due to the wear and tear of the original mold, the reuse of the mold is limited. Softening: Each wax mold is then chased or softened using heated metal tools. The metal tools are rubbed around portions that show cracks or the jоіnіng line of the mold, where the pieces have come together. Sераrаtеlу molded wax pieces are then heated and аttасhеd. The finished mold is then dressed in order to hide аnу іmреrfесtіоnѕ. The final piece then looks like a bronze sculpture. Making paths for molten bronze: It is also known as ""spurring"", in short, the wax copy is then brаnсhеd with trееlіkе wax so that the molten bronze reaches the right parts and аlѕо it helps the air to escape. The critical and careful spurring begins from the tор of the wax copy. The top of the copy is attached to by wax cylinders to dіffеrеnt points on the wax copy. So which method is best?  Depends a lot on your income.  The best, of course, is the lost wax method, as with the difficulties of preserving the mold, only a few of the original can be made.  These, of course, can run up to Thousands of dollars, to own a limited edition.  But, all is not lost. There are methods used like polyresin Multi-alloy that preserves the mold and allows for many copies to be duplicated. These beauties are for the every day Joe who love Bronze sculptures/figurines to be able to comfortably afford them.  So, in that respect, for us everyday Joes, this is the best method, for, without it, we could not afford to own one. And, what a pity that would be."
7,Why Music Education Matters,arts-entertainment," Our ability to make music is a skill that makes us uniquely human. There are some researchers who suggest music is a by-product of language development, and that music plays a vital role in the development and function of the brain. Other researchers say music came before the development of language, and that language is another form of musical expression. Regardless of the point of view, music and other forms of creative activity have played a strong evolutionary role in the development of language, cognitive, and social skills. Unfortunately, when public schools across the country slash their budgets, one of the first programs that get cut are the music programs. Some people view music education as a fun but unimportant pursuit that takes time away from more important subjects like math, science, history, and language arts. What they may not realize is that music education can help a child excel in these subjects and in other areas of life. Neuroscience researchers have found that the brain of a musician works harder than the brain of a non-musician. This is because the musician must use more of their brain to play an instrument. Children who are given just a few weeks of music instruction show better-developed sound discrimination and fine motor skills than children who do not receive any musical instruction. One of the skills that are needed for success in math and science is spatial-temporal intelligence, and research has shown that there is a link between music and the development of spatial-temporal intelligence. Spatial-temporal intelligence is the ability to see patterns in multistep problems that are common in both math and science. Over time, researchers have found that students who have had music instruction tend to have better spatial-temporal intelligence than students who have not had music instruction. Standardized testing has become the norm in public schools across the country. A quality music education program plays a strong role in determining how successful students can be on a standardized test. Learning how to play music involves developing concentration and memory recall, both of which are necessary for a good outcome on standardized tests. Research has shown that elementary schools who provide a rigorous music program have students who score around 20 percentage points higher on standardized tests than schools who do not offer a music education program. There are a lot of benefits to having musical abilities, and researchers are still exploring how music affects learning and other non-music tasks. Discipline, learning a new skill, memory recall, performing in front of an audience are all areas that a child can benefit from participating in a good music program. If a school doesn’t have a music program, then parents can go to any number of private music studios like Kenmore Piano Studio, where students can receive music training and gain the benefits of what a music education can provide."
8,"Documentaries ""11/9"" and ""Voice of Syria"" are Docs to Watch this Year.",arts-entertainment," Filmmakers Carla Ortiz and Shari O’Donnell are on track for their documentary, ‘Voice of Syria’,  to be an Oscar submission which is set to go head to head with filmmaker Michael Moore’s 11/9. Ortiz and O’Donnell have been dubbed the ‘Daring Duo’ after the documentary was shot on the ground in Syria during the height of conflict. The documentary is set to expose propaganda and debunk lies that are told through fake news, while educating audiences about the real political back drop. While brave news crews and filmmakers generally accessed rebel areas in Syria, Ortiz was one of the only filmmakers who was given access to both rebel and government areas the last 12 months. Ortiz says she is only giving voice to the 18 million Syrian’s inside the country. As a result of the six year war over a half a million Syrians have died and six million have had to flee their homes, making it one of the largest refugee crisis in history. Distributors at Cannes Film Festival have been commenting on how powerful ""Voice of Syria"" is to watch and it will be an awards contender. According to Variety the Weinstein Company has secured the worldwide rights and is seeking its distributors at Cannes Film Festival for ""11/9"" – the title referring to the day Trump was declared President of the United States on Nov. 9. ""No matter what you throw at him, it hasn’t worked,"" says Moore. ""No matter what is revealed, he remains standing. Facts, reality, brains cannot defeat him. Even when he commits a self-inflicted wound, he gets up the next morning and keeps going and tweeting. That all ends with this movie."" The Weinstein brothers previously released Moore’s ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" in 2004 which achieved more that $200 million in worldwide grosses. Ortiz conducted interviews with CNN and Fox News during intervals of filming but like Mr. Moore, gave nothing away about the lies and propaganda her documentary is set to uncover. She goes onto say ‘Syrians express some interesting revelations on ‘The White Helmets’ which is set to raise eyebrows given that an Oscar was given on the subject this year. Hollywood Producers told Ortiz, her documentary was impossible to make before she shot the film. She has since returned to Los Angeles where she is working with Producer Shari O’Donnell. O’Donnell is a filmmaker from Ireland who is known as seasoned studio executive and filmmaker in the independent film world. O’Donnell says that ‘ Voice of Syria’ is one of the most intense and daring films in her career due to the dangers and extreme survival situations Ortiz was exposed to. It is very frightening to learn that Syrians are trying to tell us something, but their voices are not being heard"". Voice of Syria is currently in post-production while 11/9 is filming ""under a strict cloak of secrecy""."

11,Did Bob Dylan really introduce The Beatles to weed?,arts-entertainment," The Beatles would probably be considered by most people as a serious contender for the greatest band of all time. With a long list of songs that became instant hits the moment they were released, the group rose to be the most famous and successful popular music band in the world, a status which has endured the test of time and casts the surviving members in the strong yet flattering light of ‘living legends’. Exploring this vein of brilliance, it's only natural that Bob Dylan comes to mind. The American singer/song writer had, and still has, huge success of his own and had a strong musical/lyrical influence on the Beatles. Paul McCartney once said that Dylan’s second record ‘The Freewheelin’ was ‘all they played’ on the Beatles tour bus. Paul also said that Dylan was the one who introduced the group to smoking cannabis. While the Fab Four debuted in 1960 with a squeaky clean image, over time they evolved into more a psychedelic and interesting outfit.  But were the Beatles as ‘clean’ as their image suggested? Did Bob Dylan Really Introduce The Beatles to Weed? It was on August 28, 1964 that Dylan and the Beatles were introduced by a mutual friend, Al Aronowitz, at New York's Delmonico Hotel. After arriving at The Beatles' suite Dylan allegedly asked for some cheap wine. Road manager Mal Evans was sent to get the wine and while Evans was away Dylan allegedly suggested they have a smoke. Although the band had actually tried the drug a few years ago it apparently hadn’t made much of an impression on them. When manager Brian Epstein informed Dylan of this, that the band lacked the experience with regard to puffing the magic dragon, Dylan supposedly looked disbelievingly at everyone present. Apparently he had misheard the line ""I can’t hide"" in ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" as ""I get high."" Before the sacred deed, they secured the hotel room; blinds were drawn and bathroom towels were placed carefully by the locked doors. The first joint was rolled by Dylan and then passed to John Lennon. Lennon passed it to Ringo, who finished the joint without knowing that the etiquette was to pass it on. The next few hours were party time for the Beatles as they smoked dope, drank the ‘cheap’ wine (surely millionaire Dylan could afford at least mid-range wine?) and became generally intoxicated. Finally, all smoked out and fatigued from laughing, the Beatles aired out the room and room service was called to clean up the mess. Although The Fab Four didn't fall under the spell of marijuana immediately, after a few months the act of meeting in their hotel rooms and stuffing towels under the door became ritualistic and very much part of their life on the road. And who knows, perhaps they deserved to unwind after long high pressure shows and legions of stalkers tracking their every move. The Beatles were unarguably great songwriters and musicians, with or without the use of marijuana, but one thing is obvious - the content and style of their music was greatly influenced by the drugs they took. This is evident in subtle references (‘We all live in a yellow submarine’) and some not so subtle references (‘I found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went into a dream’). These indications have certainly not gone by unnoticed – the great Bill Hicks noted that ""The Beatles were so high they let Ringo sing a few."" The music also clearly shows the influence of different levels of consciousness on the part of the players, such as the transcendent colourful sounds of ‘Octopus’ garden’ and the truly unique brilliance of ‘Come together.’ Not to mention ‘I am The Walrus’, ‘Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds’ and ‘The Magical Mystery Tour.’ It was again Paul who remarked, many years later, that ""we were kind of proud to have been introduced to pot by Dylan. That was rather a coup."" I have no way of knowing if this is an accurately reported statement, or simply the invention of a bored journalist in some unenlightened office, but it’s intriguing nonetheless. So, did Bob Dylan Really Introduce The Beatles to weed? Well, as Dylan’s organist Al Kooper puts it, ‘I stopped believing the stories of history once I was in them.’ There has no doubt been fabrication, mythology and out right lying surrounding both Dylan and The Beatles, but I guess if Paul McCartney maybe said it, and he, Ringo and Dylan are indeed the closest we’ll get to factual sources on this matter, then we can perhaps  assume the answer is yes. ‘Yes’ is certainly the most fun answer. Let’s stick with it."
12,How did Nick Drake really die?,arts-entertainment," Nick Drake was an English singer/song writer whose talent passed almost unnoticed during his lifetime. Born in 1948 in Rangoon, Burma, Nick Drake grew up in England and began playing the guitar at the age of 16. He released his first album 'Five Leaves Left' in 1969 when he was just 21.  He did not receive commercial success or widespread recognition at the time, though now the album regularly features in ‘The Best Albums of All Time’ lists and compilations. Tragically, in 1974, at the age of 26, Nick Drake died from an overdose of an antidepressant medication. The local coroner concluded Nick’s death was not suicide but many others, including his sister Gabrielle, have rejected this assessment. Many of Nick's friends, however, weren’t surprised by the coroner’s words and, as a listener, if you examine the lyrics of some of Nick's songs, such as ‘River man’, ‘Fruit Tree’ and 'I Was Made To Love Magic', you can find the artist expressing either severe depression or a view that he didn’t quite belong in this world. Let’s take River Man first – ‘If he tells me all he knows, about the way his river flows, I don’t suppose it’s meant for me.’ Now let’s take Fruit Tree – ‘Don’t you worry, they’ll stop and stare when you’re gone.’ Now ‘I Was Made To Love Magic’ – ‘I was born to love no-one, no-one to love me.’ Patrick Humphries’ 1998 biography of Nick Drake contains numerous oral and written testimonies that throw light upon the events leading up to his death. Most of the information was obtained from his parents Rodney and Molly. According to Molly Drake her son had gone to bed particularly early on the night he died (in addition to depression, Nick also suffered insomnia, so an early night because of exhaustion may not have seemed out of the ordinary.) After retiring to his room and sleeping for a while, he got up in the night and went down to the kitchen. He ate some cornflakes (the bowl was found) and took some more anti-depressants (the packet was found). He then went back to his room and immediately, or very shortly thereafter, collapsed on his bed. Nick Drake most probably suffered a seizure or an initial fainting spell. He then fell into a coma, suffered a cardiac arrest and was dead by 6am. He was found by Molly around midday. We now know that the pills Nick was taking were extremely toxic and vulnerable to overdose, even in small quantities. As I wrote earlier, some of the people close to Nick felt that he had deliberately exceeded the recommended dose, but there were other friends and acquaintances who said they had seen an improvement in his mood prior to his death and so questioned this act of self-destruction. The question of Nick Drake’s death is, like many famous unanswered questions, perhaps unanswerable. We could make a leap of faith here, or a leap of faith there, but ultimately no-one knows for sure how Nick died because there is a lack of concrete evidence on both sides of the explanation. My own gut theory is that Nick took his own life. I base this purely on his very dark lyrics, for lyrics are, when sincere, a good indicator of someone’s inner life, and on his sister’s opinion. All we have left of Nick is his music, which is all we know for sure."
13,Harnessing The Fire From Within: Using The Past To Fuel The Fire,arts-entertainment," When it comes to the most painful and traumatizing recollections of our past, most people’s first instinct is to bury that deep within ourselves. Put it in a box, seal that and throw it in the depths of the ocean of our memories. For songwriters, musicians and lyricists, these moments can be utilized as content for their songs: breathing fire into a beat and bringing it to life; adding a human element that resonates with anyone that has ever went through any time of life trauma: divorce, death, breakups, loss. Just about everyone on the planet has went through this rite of passage in life. The challenge for artists is creating a message that is uniquely and solely theirs; taking reoccurring themes in writing, art and music and making them their own. Every artist wants to stand out and dreads turning into ""Just another song about X"". Songwriter and Artist ID, from the Detroit hip-hip label Loud Reality Records, has his songwriting down to a scientific process. The soulful, charismatic and passionate artist that is ID has been writing music since he was 13, soaking in every bit of life and harnessing raw energy into his tracks. The weight of his parents divorce and the impact it has on his life. ID grew up with only him, his mother and sister in the picture. ""I got a job at 14 so I could support my mom. It was just me, and my mom and my sister. And it was just….as much as we could all work. I used to go to school every day, and go to work right after school every single day, from 14 to the next eight years I was there….at the restaurant. It was just every single week. I didn’t live a normal life like other kids. I never went to the prom, I never went on Spring Break…I never got the chance to play basketball for the school. I never got a chance to play for high school because of that reason, because I had to work."" ID says as he reminisces about his adolescence. ""I used to write on those tickets that waitresses write on…I used to write lyrics on that when I was at work if I ever thought of lyrics and stuff.""  In those glaring times, ID has composed himself into a prime storyteller and lyricist, as shown in his tracks. ID’s own album ""Poetic Thought"" (https://www.loudreality.com/) was recently released from Loud Reality Records: a composition of heavier, solemn beats propped up by the classic hip-hop rhyme schemes. The album style has a ""Drake"" feel- sensitive and personal, reminiscing and lingering on the past. ""Poetic Thought"" was influenced by ID’s transgressions with his father, a heartbreak, and various events and drama from his life. ""When I dropped my ""Poetic Thought"" mixtape, I posted about it. ""This is based off of real life experiences that I went through, or that someone I know went through, or I’m just telling a story.’ ID shares. ""If you listen to a song on my album that’s called ""No Strings Attached"" and the beginning of the song is where basically I’m telling a story about someone that is in love; like I’m in love with her and we’re saying it’s no strings attached. I’m telling her I love her but I don’t, we’re just telling each other what we want to hear. She’s telling me what I want to hear, and I’m telling her what she wants to hear. After the first hook, the song switches totally, and now we’re fighting in the second part of the song. I’m telling stories. In the song ""Letter to You"" I’m talking about my dad. In the song ""What I write’, I live what I write. A song like ""Gone"" I’m talking about a girl. ""Did you hear the news, I’m gone."" Every song is telling a story about either love, something in life, uh, real stuff like real things that people have to go through. Something that happened in my life with my dad and my parents. Um and with death. I’ve had a lot of bad experiences and unfortunate experiences that have happened in my life. It’s never known who is going to be listening to your music and what kind of impact it’s going to have on your listeners. ""Someone told me, ""When I heard the song ""Drowning"" it’s just want I needed to hear"" according to ID. Loud Reality Records’ EP is coming out this year, and will feature original songs and tracks by ID."
14,Stunning health benefits of coloring pages for kids,arts-entertainment," Did you know that art is considered therapeutic? Art is often used as a medium for children to express specific problems or experiences. Coloring books are not necessarily considered art therapy but are certainly therapeutic. Psychologists have concluded that art has a healing power and therapeutic qualities. For children it is always easier, especially for the younger ones, to express in non – verbally so that is why using some form of art is a great way for child’s self expression. Coloring pages for kids come in handy for this purpose. Some kids are more artistic than others, however, almost every child like to draw and color. Coloring presents a creative venture without the need for artistic flair. A child should simply choose a favorite coloring book or a coloring page and the fun starts. There are some really amazing mental health benefits of using coloring books for kids on daily basis. Coloring pages are one of the best learning resources for kids since coloring activity is appealing to them and very enjoyable. Things that kids can learn from coloring pages can have lifelong benefits on mental and emotional health. Child development consists of developmental stages or milestones. One of the most important developmental tasks is to form a healthy personality which basically means to be emotionally stable and ready to face the challenges in life. While child is engaging coloring activity he or she is focused and relaxed. This gives a child an opportunity to calm the mind, put aside all the burdening thoughts and make some room for pleasant feelings. If a child uses coloring pages frequently, this coloring activity can become a self – soothing technique which is very important for challenging situations in life. Among other ways to get comfort, coloring books are creative and fun way for self comforting. Another interesting fact about using coloring books for kids, that many people don’t think about, is strengthening the ability to focus and gaining cognitive and emotional stability among children. Staying in the line, paying attention to details and mixing colors will improve child’s ability to focus and to stay in the moment. So coloring books can teach children a valuable lesson of being in the moment, something that is essential in contemporary life style. Taking up on coloring a certain coloring page can be considered a small project for a child. This means that completing coloring pages can build up child’s self esteem and confidence in time or at least improve it. Once a child is aware that his or hers little piece of art is finished, the feeling of satisfaction and pride will be evident. Among many advantages of using coloring books mentioned before, coloring inside coloring pages can reduce stress and anxiety. Coloring is a simple but useful manner for processing feelings, emotions and frustrations. There are plenty of studies that prove the effectiveness of art and coloring on mental health. Coloring pages seem like a simple coloring activity but once you take into account all the effects it can have on psychological well being of a child, they seem like a necessary educational tool or a valuable free time activity. They are also quite fun and easily accessible so there is no reason why shouldn’t children use them regularly."
15,Coloring Pages as an Educational Tool for Preschoolers,arts-entertainment," Developmental milestones are activities and tasks most children can do at a certain age. Children reach these milestones through playing, learning, interacting with the environment and obtaining certain skills. As children reach early childhood, they become more and more interested in the world around them. They are keen to explore, to learn, ask and get to know the world around them. The amount of stimuli a child experiences will influence his or her cognitive development, personality, social and motor skills. There are many ways to influence and improve a child’s cognitive development and motor skills. One simple activity like coloring can have a positive psychological effect and it could lead to a healthier life. Coloring pages are not art therapy, but are very relaxing, stress-relieving and boost mental clarity. Some of the key advantages of coloring books are: Motor skills improvement Coloring activity involves holding a coloring tool and scribbling which helps the motor skills development of fine muscles in wrists, fingers and hands. This activity will help a child with writing and manipulating small objects. Later on, better coordination of fine motor muscles can have a positive influence on academic performance. Using coloring pages as a way to improve motor skills is an excellent method to strengthen hand muscles, which will support a child in later activities such as writing, typing, playing sports and manipulating objects. While coloring, a child is learning to control fine motor movements, to fill in variety of shapes, color within the lines and patterns. These are all precursory skills to dressing, eating and many other important school related activities. Hand to eye coordination improvement Even though it seems quite simple, coloring requires a great amount of brain activity and coordination for a child. Basic coordination like holding a crayon and doing the coloring while recognizing a color can improve motor coordination. Using coloring pages as an educational tool and a way to enhance motor development is very relaxing for a child and is an activity that every child enjoys. Simple tasks of holding a crayon, color and shape perception and recognition as well as picking a color might seem extremely easy when you are an adult, but for a child this is stimulating and fun. These activities are precursory skills to writing, tying a shoe and managing clothes with both hands. Exposure to boundaries, structure and spacial awareness Teaching a child boundaries is an important part of child’s cognitive development. It is quite beneficial if a child learns the rules before breaking away. Coloring pages for kids can be helpful in acquiring a sense for structure and boundaries. Other than positive influence on child’s personality development, coloring pages can be one of the learning resources for shapes, colors, perspective, patterns and forms. Creativity stimulation Coloring activity fosters creativity among children and enhances perception for visual differences. Starting out with coloring pages early in childhood nourishes imagination and inspires children to develop divergent thinking and to think about new ideas. Color perception and recognition improvement It is important that a child learns the names and hues of colors. Coloring pages for kids stimulate awareness and usage of primary and most common colors. Also, a child can learn about many more subtle colors which is why coloring books can be a useful educational tool. Handwriting improvement In order to develop writing skills – a child must have hand strength, attention to detail and dexterity. Using coloring pages for kids as an educational tool will have a positive influence on acquiring these skills that are required for writing (that will come more naturally and easily). Relaxation and focusing Psychologists told the Huffington Post that by engaging multiple parts of the brain, coloring allows a child to focus on the lines, shapes, movement and colors at hand. Coloring activity trains focus, calms the mind and is an excellent centering activity. A very important part of our brain called amygdala is associated with emotions, memory and fear response. While a child is enjoying coloring pages, amygdala rests which has a calming effect over time. Gaining confidence Even though coloring pages can contain simple pictures, it can be a challenging task for kids. The ability to complete a picture successfully builds a better self  esteem and confidence among children. Therefore, completing projects such as these will foster a feeling of accomplishment. Creating a piece of art will be a nice emotional boost for children. As a result, child will embrace its creativity and will develop a feeling of self – worth. Self – expression Coloring pages for kids are a great way to give a child an opportunity to express him/herself differently than others. Children are visual in nature and coloring is a natural way of self – expression. Therapeutic effect Coloring activity is proven to be therapeutic for some kids, especially if it is done frequently. Among many benefits mentioned before, using coloring pages can reduce stress and anxiety, and can be a way of venting frustration without hurting anyone. Coloring is a simple but useful manner for processing feelings, emotions and frustrations. Many kids like to color and it seems to be more than just a fun free time activity. Have in mind that even though educational technology has gone way up, there are some simple learning resources and tools like coloring pages that can be used to enhance cognitive development. This easy tool should be used every day as a part of educational material in every school as it is proven to be influential to personality development starting from early childhood."
16,Things you didn’t know about Art and education,arts-entertainment," For many people the word art evokes images of messy tables, spilled paint, and funny drawings. It might be all that, but even those are highly educational and should be valued greatly. Here’s why. Did you know that: Art influences motor skills. While holding a paintbrush, crayons or a pair of scissors at a young age, children improve their fine motor skills which thus gives better results when learning how to write later on. Art influences language development. Small children first encounter shapes and colors. By learning how to name them, they develop their first basic language skills. But that is not all. Older children are able to describe their drawings and to share the feelings that those drawings evoke. This makes them use the language, which as a result turns them into eloquent human beings. Art influences decision making. Knowledge is limited, whereas imagination isn’t, thus it provides us with innumerable solutions to problems. Since art requires being creative, it demands employing imagination more often. The more it is employed, the greater number of solutions appear to us, which is a skill very useful for managing life, in general. Creativity develops by working on it, and can be applied to all spheres of life, not only education. Art influences children’s social and emotional development. Drawing, painting, making sculptures, acting, singing – any of these give a chance to a child to make his or her own personal statement, which is unique. This way children’s self-esteem is being built and made stronger, thus making them emotionally secure and freer in social interactions. Art helps one develop as a person with great empathy. Since art is food for the soul, it provides one with all the feelings, emotions and ideas that someone else expressed through a work of art. It helps you recognize some of your own feelings and attitudes, thus helping you reconnect with yourself and other human beings. By getting reminded that other people go through a lot of similar situations as you do, you learn how to sympathize and empathize, which makes you a better teammate, or even a better leader, be it in school or in life. Art transcends cultural differences and shows what’s uniquely human. Even though you might be aware of cultural differences, through art you will learn how to put them aside, or maybe even ignore them. Through art you will learn how to appreciate, celebrate and remember the beauty of the diversity of expression. Art teaches history. By being able to look at different pieces of art, coming from diverse periods in the past, and by being able to compare and contrast them, we learn about the past, as well as the present. As a matter of fact, we can even foresee the future through art. Art helps develop inventiveness. Creating a piece of art demands and requires the process of thinking and decision making, which also gives as a result a group of people who do not blindly follow other people’s directions. Quite the contrary: people who seek and create their own ways and paths are created this way. They themselves learn how to reach the solutions and make improvements, which makes them better citizens."
17,Why Do We Color?,arts-entertainment," Coloring books – color yourself calm There’s something quite charming and nostalgic about coloring in. It is just a really nice way to be creative.

What is important is the fact that the coloring books are beneficial for both, parents and children. Children can improve hand to eye coordination, motor and cognitive skills and handwriting. Coloring in is calming and centered activity which stimulates creative thinking. Children can learn patience and boundaries, gain confidence and boost imagination.

Coloring gives us the opportunity to hone in on a simple activity that does not require much planning. While coloring, our minds are stimulated, and we do not get bored as quickly, due to the nature of the task. So, coloring books for adults require the brain to work on one thing at a time, thus helping the mind to focus. Focus your mind while enjoying the simple pleasures of coloring. Mindfulness is when you are truly there, mind and body together. That is why mindfulness is a source of happiness and joy. Take your mind through the world of coloring books, and you will reach the mindfulness, and feel happiness and joy every day!"
18,Things That Go Bump in the Dark,arts-entertainment," We sat in a circle in the dark room and watched Angela’s Ghost Radar cell phone app on the table hunt for spirit presence as a line swept continuously across the dull green radar screen. Suddenly, a yellow bead of light popped onto the radar, alerting us of a spirit presence nearby. ""What is your name?"" Angela called into the darkness. We listened to the silence. ""Can you tell us your name?"" Then, buttons on Alice’s KII Meter, which senses electromagnetic fields, began glowing green, yellow and red. I felt a prickly sensation on the back of my neck. Recently, I took about 20 of my mediumship students to a haunted basement in Scarborough, Ontario. Several people brought digital recorders and cameras, and Angela also had a spirit box, which gives off energy in the form of white noise that spirits can use to communicate with us. In addition, Fritz, a filmmaker from England’s National Film and TV School, recorded the goings-on for a documentary he was making. We said a prayer asking for the highest and best to come through and guide us throughout the evening. Then Angela, Alice, Joanne and others set their ghostbusting devices on the table in the middle of the circle. ""Is anyone here?"" Angela asked, then again a little later. ""Would someone like to talk with us?"" A blip showed itself on the screen of Angela’s telephone. The Ghost Radar app picked up an energy hovering nearby. Then things began happening. ""I feel funny,"" Robin said, and turned to Maureen sitting beside her. Several people thought they saw a mist move across Maureen’s and Robin’s faces. Brenda snapped a few pictures on her cell phone. When she called up the photos, jagged yellow lines crossed the picture. ""Those squiggles look like spirit energy,"" I told her. Several students were attracted to a full-length mirror on a back wall. I wondered if this was because mirrors are often portals to the other side. I felt something come over me and said, ""I don’t feel very well."" At that moment, just to my left, someone took a picture of me. There’s a grey cloud swoosh just behind my head. Other students showed photos they’d captured on their cell phones. Several had small white orbs that appeared to be dancing near the ceiling. Throughout this, Fritz moved around the room, recording everything on his video camera. ""Is there some special significance to the clock on the back wall?"" Benjamin asked, pointing to the clock shaped like a motorcycle rider; the clock face was the bike’s front wheel. Angela laughed, (Later, she said the area used to be a hangout for a motorcycle club.) I sensed a shift in the room – spirit had left the building, and the evening wound down. I asked everyone to take their seats again and we said a closing prayer. As we headed upstairs to go back to our cars, I asked my students, ""Did you feel the evening was worthwhile?"" ""Yes!"" they enthusiastically replied. And Angela said, ""When can we do it again?"""
19,Visual Artists Can Sell Art on Free Portfolio Websites,arts-entertainment," There are several high traffic websites that allow artists to upload work and maintain a free portfolio.  As an artist, it's in your best interest to be involved.  Remember to keep your work and information updated, and always include a link back to your website. The UK based Saatchi Gallery launched an online community for artists called Saatchi Art in 2010 that has become very popular among artists and collectors all over the world.  They also hold ""showdowns"" where artists can submit work to compete against each other, and the winning artworks are displayed at the actual gallery.  You can arrange to sell your original work (and giclee prints if you have hi res files) directly through Saatchi, and they take a 30% commission. The artist is responsible for packaging their art, and Saatchi pays for shipping and schedules a pickup from your studio. Absolute Arts is affiliated with World Wide Arts Resources and has become one of the leading websites for artist portfolios since 2005.  They offer a free account, as well as a premiere account for $50 per year which gets you more features including more exposure.  You can arrange to sell your work directly through Absolute Arts, and they take a commission. Etsy started out as a small company in Brooklyn in 2005 as an alternative to eBay with the focus on buying and selling fine art and handmade goods. Today, it has 1.7 million active sellers and 26.1 million active buyers. Listing an item costs $.20, and there is a 3.5% fee on your asking price when the item sells. You won't find the serious art collectors spending $10,000 on a painting like Saatchi, but I do recommend keeping active portfolio of art for sale $1000 or less. Carbonmade seems more geared towards the illustration and design community, but I'm including it because of its clean, simple approach and sensibility.  Take the time to create a basic five image portfolio and join the gang.  The website was put together by a group of NYC designers in 2005 and shows no signs of slowing down. Deviant Art, based out of Hollywood, CA, has been online since 2000 and provides a free platform for any artist to exhibit and discuss art.  The design isn't as clean as the others, but there is a lot of content and it ranks well with the search engines."
20,Book Review: The Brain That Changes Itself,arts-entertainment," Book review – The Brain That Changes Itself written by Dr. Norman Doidge. BLOG POST BY BARBARA CASEY  (IAN’S MOM) When my son first acquired his brain injury, I was told that whatever state he was in at the 6-month mark was about the best we could expect for the rest of his life. You’d better believe I started immediately with (homemade) tools to stimulate thinking, speaking and motor control. Not to mention nagging his doctors for physical therapy, of which he received 10 whole minutes a day in the ICU, his home for almost 6 weeks. Somewhere along the line, the 6 month limit was extended to 12 months. I don’t recall by whom – perhaps a physical therapist who didn’t work with patients long-term. THE REALITY.. however, was that my son kept making progress step-by-step, month after month, dollar by dollar. We never gave up on his capability for continued improvement and – 4 years later – I discovered a revolutionary book that proved what I suspected all along. The brain can keep changing itself! Norman Doidge, M.D. is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who began researching neuroplasticity after meeting scientists whose studies at the ""frontiers of brain science"" excited him about the implications of their work for clients in his own consulting practice. He met with many of these brain scientists, describing their cutting-edge work and amazing results in a book called The Brain that Changes Itself, published in 2007.  After reading Doidge’s book, I now had ""official"" hope that my son could keep improving his brain function with time, diligence… and money. I am, quite frankly, astonished that not one physician, therapist, psychologist or brain injury support website that we encountered over the past four years has mentioned this truly important book – or the research being done by the scientists whose work is featured in its pages. My introduction to the concept of neuroplasticity (or brain plasticity) came through an online energy healing resource, for which unfortunately the url no longer exists.  Dr. Doidge’s book was listed there. It took four years to finally find this ""official hope"" based on scientific evidence that brain power can improve and increase with the right tools and approaches. The book is not overwhelming to read for a non-scientific person like me. Though, like me, you might find your jaw dropping when you read some of the case studies. For example, a stroke patient returning to his medical practice and tennis-playing after constraint-induced movement therapy at the Taub Clinic. Or Michael Merzenich’s work on brain maps that demonstrates the brain’s ability to compensate for missing functions. Then there’s the story of Michelle, born with only half her brain. Functions normally handled via the part of her brain that is missing migrated to the other hemisphere, enabling her to manage day-to-day with a partial brain. Not perfectly, but sufficiently. The story of Barbara Arrowsmith is quite remarkable. Labeled ""retarded"" as a child, in an era when little was understood about learning disabilities, Arrowsmith struggled her way through high school and college until she came across a research study by Mark Rosenzweig on how activity can produce changes in the structure of the brain. She designed her own ""mental exercises"" to work the brain functions she was weakest in and found that, not only did those functions improve – others that were related did, too. A two-fer, in other words. Barbara Arrowsmith took what she learned from the research and her own experiences in designing ""proof-in-the-pudding"" exercises to found the Arrowsmith School in Toronto, specifically for children and adults with learning disabilities. I learned in this chapter, for example, that practicing cursive writing improves the flow of thoughts into speech – something my son wishes to improve. So I’m busily looking for websites with cursive writing worksheets that he can use for this purpose. Doidge’s book is an eye-opener and I plan to go through it again to winnow out more ideas for homemade exercises. More on this in another blog post. If you haven’t read The Brain That Changes Itself, you can click this link to ""look inside the book"" at Amazon.com. Most of the first chapter is available for preview, including some really interesting material about Paul Bach-y-Rita. The part you don’t get to read concerns the methods Bach-y-Rita’s brother used to help their father recover from a debilitating stroke. The results of that intense work triggered a career change for Paul Bach-y-Rita, who then focused on rehabilitation medicine (especially with ""late rehabilitation"" stoke patients), using the techniques he know knew had validity. An international icon in the field of neuroplasticity, Paul Bach-y-Rita died in 2006. His story is worth knowing."

1,Education world connecting educators,arts-entertainment," Betsy DeVos, one of Donald Trump's most controversial cabinet appointments has narrowly been confirmed as the country's next secretary of education. In fact, it doesn't get much more ""narrowly"" than what happened during DeVos' confirmation vote yesterday. After two Republican senators decided to listen to their constituents and break with their party to oppose DeVos, the Senate was left with a 50-50 tied vote. In a historic moment, the vice president was called upon for the first time in history to break a tied vote for a president's cabinet nominee; Vice President Pence voted in favor of DeVos' confirmation. The confirmation came as a shock to the staunch opponents of DeVos, a group that was further energized after DeVos gave a mediocre performance during her confirmation hearing, unable to give strong answers to the questions asked by Democrats angered by the lack of time allotted to ask said questions.Opponents remain concerned that DeVos' wealthy background, inexperience working in or dealing with public schools, and her support for controversial school reform ideals not yet fully supported by research will result in her effectively ruining education, especially public education, for years to come. Here's some relief from opponents who are fearful that DeVos' untraditional background coupled with her high position of power will mean the end of progress in education as we know it. Here are four reasons why your very worst fears about DeVos' influence on education will not come true thanks to the protections included in The No Child Left Behind era demonstrated what happens when the federal government exerts too much control in education; this legislation was widely criticized and despite good intentions failed to meet its goals of improving low-performing schools and while it identified disadvantaged students failed to help them better succeed. In response to this era of heavy-handed federal oversight, lawmakers came together and created the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) designed specifically to give more power back to the states and local governments. Under ESSA, the secretary of education no longer has the power to incentivize states to adopt a particular set of standards or have the discretion to reject state plans that are in compliance with the federal law. In other words, so long as state plans include standards aligned to college coursework, implement assessments that have been reviewed and approved as defined by ESSA's parameters and include indicators for each subgroup of students, there is nothing the education secretary can do to incite change.This includes promoting or even incentivizing school choice or voucher programs for states that do not wish to adopt them. ""The Secretary may not 'promulgate any rule . . . that would add new requirements [or new criteria] that are inconsistent with or outside the scope of the law,"" ESSA declares. If DeVos were appointed to education secretary during a different time, she'd have access to a much larger number of powers that would allow her to change education according to her beliefs. And given the fact that she has said she will interpret ESSA as Congress intended, standing-by its desire to transfer power back to local control, there's no indication yet that she will try to do otherwise2. School Choice Was Specifically Excluded from ESSA"

4,Canadian Film Tax Incentives – Still In The Game,arts-entertainment," As mentioned in The Importance of Film Tax Incentives Today, tax incentives are a key component to independent film budgets. This is a fact for all filmmakers. For those of us in the USA, we have the ability to rely on several state governments to secure portions of our films’ budgets. But we don’t have a monopoly on the idea, and our friendly neighbors above us bring competitive incentives. With nearly 100 productions currently shooting [at the time I write this] throughout Toronto and Vancouver, more and more production companies are looking north for their locations and services. Canada offers one of the best tax incentives in North America by not only providing a great tax percentage, but factoring in the currency exchange rate allows both large and small productions to shoot for a reasonable price. Canada’s dollar usually steeps below $0.80 USD, allowing the hard earned American dollar to actually save you money in Canada. Most production companies utilize the weak Canadian dollar to increase the amount they can spend on their shoots. And depending on the province of choice (usually Ontario, B.C., or Quebec) and project requirements, you could qualify up to 40% tax incentives to cover your budget. Between Vancouver and Toronto, they have been known to be stand-ins for iconic cities like New York and Chicago. Although used for location services, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver also have professional sound stages, VFX studios, and other post-production houses you could take advantage of. The best part: Canada will give you an extra tax percentage for each and every one of those items! In late 2015 to early 2016, British Columbia noticed that it was receiving an exponential amount of business from out-of-state productions that they couldn’t handle, causing a fluctuation in the provinces annual budget. In B.C., the Finance Minister publicly stated that they are ""not prepared to see payouts grow at the rate they have. We have a balanced budget, but we have other priority areas that we feel we need to address on behalf of British Columbians."" With these statements, the Minister was contemplating placing a cap on B.C.’s tax incentive. While this does not seem like a major problem on its face, this is concerning because much of the regions success in attracting large quantities of film productions has been predicated on the no-cap policy. Further, one province adopting such a startling policy shift could have been enough to encourage other provinces and states to follow suit; such a shift could easily cripple the northern filmmaker community. Since the discussions were released back in February, an industry-government group of representatives from film and television reconstructed the tax credit to benefit both the film industry and the people of the province. Starting Oct 1, 2016, ""the basic production services tax credit rate will be set at 28%, down from 33%, and the digital animation or visual effects (DAVE) tax credit rate will be set at 16%, down from 17.5%.""– (news.gov.bc.ca). In other words, despite a slight decrease in credit rates, the province will continue to attract the filmmaking industry by standing by their no-cap policy. And of course, the low Canadian dollar is still an attractive added benefit that state-side territories cannot offer. At least for the time being, the no-cap policy paired with a favorable exchange rate should keep Canada at the top of you location list."
5,The Importance of Film Tax Incentives Today,arts-entertainment," Tax incentives are a key component to independent film budgets nowadays, and are practically vital to the financial safety of a production given the current market saturation of content—and the therefore markedly lower purchase prices as of late. Film and television tax incentives are a method by which governments attract productions to come to their state or country, thereby boosting the local economy; productions hire local crew, and purchase and rent local goods from secondary institutions such as restaurants, car dealerships, and generator rental companies. Depending on the ""flavor"" of tax incentive offered—such as transferable tax credits—completely unrelated companies can benefit by purchasing these credits at cents on the dollar, and reduce their tax obligations. All that said, not all tax incentives are created equal. First of all, while we love California, we have a difficult time recommending it for independent filmmaking. In 2014, S&R Films’ own Gato Scatena consulted for California Assemblyman Adrin Nazarian in regards to proposed modifications to the state’s film tax incentive legislation. To Scatena, it was obvious that the language in the active statutes were the direct result of meetings with only the largest studios and production companies, and were therefore not designed with independents in mind. One such feature of the California tax incentive that makes it difficult for independent filmmakers is the fact that the law requires movie productions to have a minimum qualified spend of $1 Million. To make matters worse, no above-the-line talent and crew expenses are ""qualified,"" resulting in a realistic total minimum budget of somewhere around $1.3 Million. And much to the Assemblyman’s surprise, during the course of these meetings he discovered that while over 70% of movies produced and sold each year are independently financed, the majority of those films have total budgets under $1 Million (take for instance S&R Films’ Lifetime movie, Imaginary Friend, shot for under $1 Million). To prove the point that California’s incentives are inadequate to keep jobs from being deported to other states and countries, Scatena noted that the entire roster of films acquired that year by Grindstone (a Lionsgate distribution company) were shot outside of California! Among other things, the modifications recommended by Mr. Scatena included the removal of the lottery approval process, and inclusion of a percentage of above-the-line costs as qualified expenses. Assemblyman Nazarian did everything he could, but at the end of the day, it was more popular to voters to simply increase the annual spend—another signal that the lay person simply does not understand the intricacies of film finance and production. So, while we wait and hope for California to catch up with the competitive states and countries, let’s explore some better options. Mississippi and Louisiana make shooting movies in Dixie fun and profitable! In 2002, Louisiana was the first to realize the local economic benefits of offering film tax incentives (in the form of credits), and was so aggressive in their laws that they had productions running year-round, and hoards of life-long California film crew permanently moved their residences to the Pelican State. On average, shooting in Louisiana allows producers to count on about 20-25% of their budget coming back to them in the form of tax credits [that they could then sell back to the state at 85% face value, or better-yet, sell to a highly-taxed local company for closer to 90-95% face value]. The more diligent filmmakers can eek out closer to 25-30% in tax credits. The state became so dependable in regards to delivering on their promised tax credits, that many films started to partially finance their productions by having companies or individuals ""cashflow"" the projected tax incentives prior to filming, and with a built-in return to the lender. That said, Louisiana did recently drop the ball on paying out their credits on time, and from July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016, the state was refusing to buy their credits back at the aforementioned 85% face value. This caused some problems with banks and lenders, so to a certain extent, the state is now rebuilding its trustworthiness with financiers. Regardless, Louisiana is a tax incentive powerhouse, and a beautiful location at that. On another note, when Louisiana was going through their brief lapse in judgment, their neighbor to the east was rolling out an ingenious tax incentive plan of their own! What’s better than a tax credit?! According to Mississippi, cash is better than a tax credit! The state’s tax incentives come in the form of a cash rebate after the Mississippi Department of Revenue audits the production. Most of the incentive program’s features are comparable or identical to those found in Louisiana. The program only requires a $50,000 in-state spend, and while productions can receive a 30% rebate on local hires, you’ll still earn 25% on out-of-state hires… that includes all of the highly trained crew now located right next door in Louisiana. The tax rebate program in Mississippi is certainly younger than several other states, but with crew and facility shortages in Louisiana and Georgia (due to high number of productions), Mississippi is already attracting a good number of filmmakers in the know. Some of the other dependable tax incentivized territories for independent filmmakers in the United States include Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Puerto Rico. Over the past couple decades, producing feature length films has become a much more accessible endeavor, and as such, there’s a lot more content being produced than distributors need. The result is a classic supply & demand boolean equation: is there more supply than demand? Yes. Therefore, the value of the supply has gone down. The droves of first, second, and even third-time filmmakers financing their productions with friends, family, and debt are already placing their speculatively produced projects in a tough marketplace, so why on Earth would you leave money on the table? If you’re in development or pre-production on a movie right now, don’t move forward without at least considering all of your tax incentive options—it could very well be the difference between profit and loss."
6,Feeling Luck Punks? Hollywood's Hard Men,arts-entertainment," Whether it is playing or a ’goodie’ or baddie’ audiences seem to love a hard man. The alpha male who struts through a city righting injustices or crushing anyone who stands in their way. What is it about these men that makes them tough and why do audiences keep buying their tickets for a cinema experience of scowling looks and knuckles to cheek connections? Some actors have made playing the tough guy a career choice and honed it down to a fine art. Here is a look at some of Hollywood’s finest brooding muscle. Arnold Schwarzenegger Th Austrian turned American had such an intimidating presence he was cast as the most diabolical robot killer. Dressed in leather and usually hauling an oversized gun for his requirements Schwarzenegger scared the world with his Terminator films and his ability to play a lifeless being was scary in its accuracy. After a short stint in politics he has returned in many more film showing off his hard man nature often playing on his age and maturity. In life Arnie has a reputation for all things big whether it is muscle or his cars, often seen driving around California in his Humvee. Arnie very much likes these imposing aspects of his life and it only helps to perpetuate his persona as Hollywood’s most eminent hard man. Clint Eastwood The Northern Californian native has one of the most famous lines of any hard man in his Dirty Harry films. ""Do you feel lucky punk?"" is enough to scare an audience at the same time they squirm over how cool it simply was. Eastwood could even play a hard man even when he didn’t speak like his blonde character in the spaghetti westerns. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece in silent intimidation. More recently age has not even been able to stop him being ‘hard’ as he puts an Asian gang to shame in Gran Torino playing a dying veteran. This guy has some serious credentials. Sylvester Stallone When you think of the type of characters that attract the alpha male, you might think loner, military or sportsman. Well Sylvester Stallone has done it all, and more impressively for many of those characters, he wrote them! Stallone has a gift for impactful words as well as impactful violence. His Rocky films are littered with famous quotes. As Rambo Stallone was iconic in the action scene becoming one of the most famous action franchises of all time. His characters like to offload lots of bullets but let’s not forget the quiet intimidation of silent Rambo in First Blood. Stallone is arguably the king of action and is the first in mind when one thinks of the American ideal of a hard man. Brad Pitt Brad Pitt may think of himself as a serious actor but for many of us he is the fighting traveller in Snatch, Ed Norton’s menace in fight club and Nazi destroyer of Inglorious Basterds. Pitt is a Hollywood hunk first and foremost but that does not mean he can play the tough guy too, with the right make up. Oh and let’s not forget his fighting skill were what attracted Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr and Mrs Smith. Although I hear it is not going so well at the time of writing."
7,Entertainment News - Celebrities,arts-entertainment," Aaron Sorokin wrote an open letter to his 15-year-old daughter, Roxy, and her mother calling Donald Trump an ""incompetent pig"" after he was elected president.

Vanity Fair later corrected the figure to 700.)Sorokin urged Hollywood and Democrats everywhere to fight, not move to Canada as some have suggested.""We do what we can to fight injustice anywhere we see it -- whether it's writing a check or rolling up our sleeves,"" he continued.

8,FOX Drove Us Insane Doing The Time Warp Again!,arts-entertainment," ""I would like, if I may, to take you on a strange journey."" Okay, so as a Rocky Horror super fan I obviously had to check out the FOX redo. Let me start by saying yes it was an okay delivery. With that being said, I am vaguely irritated at the mixture of staying true to the original and the massive changes that took place; either would've been okay, but not both. Brilliance in the very beginning, I loved the skillful way that Ivy Levan took on ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" as an old time theatre usherette. The many lip close ups gave you the original feel, but also honed in on the Rocky Horror midnight showing delivery. Brad (Ryan McCartan) and Janet (Victoria Justice) truly outdid their selves! The two of them stole the show with their OUTSTANDING vocals and true characterization. As an audience member, they really made me feel like I was right back in the original show at moments.  If I am being honest, I would’ve never thought of either of them as extremely gifted individuals, but after that performance they’re at the top of the list! Who new Ryan McCartan had that voice, and when did Victoria Justice grow up and have such a maturity about her? My hat is off to the both of them. I was appalled at the disconnect from the dynamic duo; Riff Raff (Reeve Carney) and Magenta (Christina Milian) are meant to be a sibling fortress!!! The fox depiction didn’t even portray them as siblings, or at least I did not catch anything if they did.  Also, their iconic use of hands and elbows was only shown at the very end of the production. Sorely let down at the chemistry between these two, however I must say that Reeve Carney did an outstanding job at harnessing the accent and mannerism of Riff Raff; this role is by far the most vocally challenging as well, and he killed it! Christina Milian, however did NOT kill it, well in the good connotation of the word. What was the random scattered accent she had going on?! Accent, no accent, accent, no accent, accent, no accent; she just kept the audience dodging back and forth on what she was even supposed to be portraying! This saddened me greatly because I loved Christina Milian when I was a child, and Magenta is one of my favorite characters, way to crush my dreams FOX! Now as I said before, I am a Rocky Horror super fan, so naturally I go to the midnight events every Halloween. I proudly show up annually in my Columbia costume that my mother handmade for me. So needless to say, she is my all-time favorite Rocky Horror Picture Show character. I was WELL prepared to hate whoever the person was that portrayed her, and then after it was cast and Annaleigh Ashford landed the role, I was even more prepared to hate it; but with so many things gone wrong, she was one of the few rights. I won’t say that she necessarily stayed true to the original, but she pleasantly danced back and forth across the line of the classic and the new. She embodied the true Columbia personality that is a mesh between dainty and rocker. Adam Lambert as Eddie was a safe boring choice. Did he do well? Yes. Is his voice great? Yes. Was his performance a stand out? NO WAY! This roll, in my opinion should’ve stuck to the roots and been given to a crazy rock guru, not a pop star. Ah well it was decent at best. Have I made you shiver with antici……………………..pation? Yes, I figured why not go out with a bang instead of start with one. We must discuss Laverne Cox as the finale. The legendary Dr. Frank-n-Furter is the one everyone wants to see, hear, and know. How well did Laverne Cox live up to this hype? Thumbs up on a crazy awesome wardrobe, makeup, and hair. Thumbs up on decent vocals for a someone who doesn’t normally sing. Thumbs WAY down on representation! I am not really sure if it’s just me, but didn’t you all think that the name was Brad Majors instead of Bread Majors? I guess we’ve all been saying it wrong for 41 years. Don’t get me wrong Laverne Cox is gorgeous, but am I the only one who thought she was too gorgeous for this role? I know there is no comparison to Tim Curry, but Frank-n-Furter is supposed to have some roughness and masculinity in him, and not to be rude, but he shouldn’t be too easy on the eyes either. Laverne Cox is a smooth, feminine, beautiful person, not necessarily fitting for the notorious Dr. Frank-n-Furter. We still jumped to the left, stepped to the right, and bent our knees in tight, but there was a sadness in our thrusts as FOX drove us insane doing the Time Warp again; they must have been ""lost in time, and lost in space... and meaning."""
9,Guild Wars 1 Review,arts-entertainment," Introduction Guild Wars is a competitive online role-playing game designed by ArenaNet and developed for the PC. Possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played, this game has taken me through many adventures throughout the land’s of Tyria and created many memories. At the time of writing this review, Guild Wars is already over 11 years old and still extremely popular. The game has come a long way since its release in 2005 and has undergo many expansions to the game which vastly expanded its content. The game is set in the world of Tyria, in which are three playable continents that the player can explore. Each continent are by themselves a separate campaign, but one can only have the full gaming experience by owning all three. Gameplay The game is played in the form of a player avatar which the player creates before they start. A person may choose from 10 playable classes which include the Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Necromancer, Mesmer, Elementalist, Assassin, Ritualist, Dervish and the Paragon. Each class has their own unique set of skills and abilities, which may be mixed together to create what are known as skill ""builds"". Creating builds takes a lot of thinking and is one of the key elements which makes the game one of the most innovative I have played. The game is played by following a set of storylines. Each campaign has it’s own storyline that takes it from a low level character (starting level 1) to level 20 by the time the player reaches near the end of its respective campaign. At any point a player may cross over to a different campaign regardless of where they started their character. Much of the game is centered around end-game content which includes various high difficulty dungeons, and other elite areas which take a lot of teamwork and game skill to complete. Overall Thoughts All in all, my assessment of Guild Wars 1 is that it is one of the best games of its kind released in the past 2 decades. While not the only game of its kind, it is one of the most unique in that the gameplay and mechanics are completely different from most other MMO’s. I give this game a rating of 9/10.

10,Lori’s Heart,arts-entertainment," It’s coming up on the first anniversary of Lori’s passing. I’ll never forget the last time I saw her, two years ago, and what she did before hundreds of onlookers… Silence stilled the air as more than 200 people watched Lori’s caretaker gently push the wheelchair to the front of the crowd. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – better known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease – had weakened Lori’s body, but her will was strong, and she was determined to deliver a message from spirit to the crowd at Inspiration Stump in Lily Dale. Lori’s body slumped back in her chair, and her caretaker gently propped her forward. Another woman held a microphone to Lori’s face so her words could be heard. I held my breath and, like so many others around me, concentrated on sending Lori the energy she needed to complete her wish. For those who may not know, Lily Dale, New York, is the largest Spiritualist centre in the world. Every day during the summer season, ""the Dale"" has three outdoor message services – weather permitting – where mediums from around the world bring proof of spirit to random audience members. Two of those services are held at Inspiration Stump, a clearing in the middle of an old-growth forest, where the lush crowns of stately hundreds-year-old trees form a canopy over the stump of a huge tree that had fallen over a century ago. Basically, here’s how a message service works: mediums who want to serve give their name to the person chairing the service. Then, the chairperson calls each medium in turn to stand in front of the audience, and deliver three greetings from spirit in five minutes. I got to know Lori through Lily Dale registered medium Sharon Klingler. Like me, Lori loved visiting Lily Dale and doing what she can for the community. A few years ago, she organized hundreds of photos into the scrapbooks that are in the Maplewood Hotel lobby. Lori had come to Lily Dale to take a week-long mediumship class team-taught by Sharon and English medium Lisa Williams, whose encouraging advice inspires all students: ""Speak from the heart. Open your heart chakra and let spirit flow through you."" Lisa also addresses people’s fear of public speaking. ""Just do it!"" she urges. ""Get up in front of people and say to yourself, ‘Spirit will never let me down!’"" After class, Sharon and Lisa’s students delivered messages at Inspiration Stump before hundreds of people. For many of them, it was their first time speaking in public. When the chairperson leading the service announced Lori’s name, the crowd waited for her to appear. They saw someone push a woman in a wheelchair to the front of the gathering, and a moment of stunned silence ensued. The only person who wasn’t anxious was Lori, who invited spirit to work through her. Instantly, she began talking in a delicate, wavering voice and brought through an aunt who, among other things, loved baking cakes – but didn’t do them very well. A young man in the audience recognized his aunt and Lori roared into her message. She joked with the crowd and spoke with the poise and confidence of someone who didn’t have a care in the world. Afterward, I congratulated her on a job well done. ""It takes courage to do what you did,"" I said. ""You have a gift for this."" Lori smiled. ""Every day is a gift,"" she said. ""Every day, I grab every opportunity that’s given to me to serve, and what an opportunity it is to do it at the Stump. It’s a special place for me."" The next day, Lori grabbed the chance to work again at the Stump. This powerful little woman, anchored in her wheelchair, let spirit flow through her, and as her heart opened, her graceful soul began to fly."
11,10 Tips to Read More Books,arts-entertainment," A survey carried out 15 years ago showed that almost half of Americans didn’t read a single book in 12 months. Since then, reading rates have been falling. Sometimes this happens just because we don’t have enough time, but more often it’s just lack of motivation. So, before you turn to our foolproof tips for developing a reading habit, ask yourself a simple question. Do you really want to read more? Most of us know we SHOULD read more. Yet, we don’t really WANT to – we don’t truly understand all the benefits. That’s why so many attempts to read more fail. So, what are the benefits of ""consuming"" more texts? Keeping your mind sharp. Reading involves mental effort, it forces you to think – this is what television, for instance, can’t do. Becoming an expert. Having read around 15 books on a subject, you build a better understanding of it than most people. Having read 200-300 books on a topic, you reach the level of an expert. Changing your life. Self-help genre is the best in this respect, yet even fiction often gives ideas for self-improvement and making your life better. Reading a lot often gives you a chance to think in ways you hadn’t considered earlier. Being aware of what’s going on in the world. Books may give an insight about trends that will affect our future. Think of other, more personal reasons. If you are still sure you really want to develop a reading habit, try the following strategies. Start your morning with reading Why not start your day with investing in yourself? If reading is the first or one of the first things you do when you wake up, you will be less likely to skip it or just ""forget"" about it. This routine will help you make reading an automatic activity. You will also read later in the day, when you have time. However, if you know your mind tends to be slower in the first half of the day, then you might consider reading in the evening, when your concentration is better. Set a daily goal For instance, 30 pages or 10% of a book daily. In this way you will be able to read about 3 books a month, or 36 books a year. For bigger books, 10% is a lot, so you may want to read 5% in the morning and 5% later in the day. Drop a book you don’t love Having read 20% of a book you discovered it’s just a waste of time? Don’t be afraid to quit. Otherwise, reading will become a chore rather than a passion. Keep a list of books you’d like to read Amazon Wish List can be rather convenient for building such a list. Avoid multiple lists, as you will very likely lose track. Keep track of the books you’ve read If you are able to see your achievements, it will help you build up motivation. Make notes Use note taking software that gives you a chance to synchronize information on several devices. If you prefer paper books, you may consider making notes on a piece of paper and keeping this piece inside the book. Try speed reading This technique is great for many types of books, including self-help books and books connected with one’s job. You will easily find books and software to help you increase your reading speed. But just to begin with, try the following simple steps: run a card, a pointer or your index finger beneath the text – in this way you force your eyes and brain to keep pace stop ""pronouncing"" words you read in your head read in sprints: set a timer (10 minutes, for instance) and read faster than you actually comprehend. Have a book with you everywhere If you find paper books too heavy, opt for an ebook. You may be surprised by how much you are able read during the time in lines etc. Listen to audio books It takes more time to listen through a book than to read it, yet audiobooks are great when you can’t actually read (doing chores, walking around). Make reading more of a social activity Join a book club. There are a lot of online groups, but you may also find in-person clubs in many towns. Get a library card or find friends who share your interest in reading."
12,Home Recording Studio,arts-entertainment, When you want to produce music in your own home studio there are a few things you need to learn before you get started  and I will tell you  what they are so you can begin producing music right away. LEARN AND MASTER YOUR EXISTING EQUIPMENT The first thing you need to learn is your equipment and how to use it. Choose the DAW software that you feel comfortable working in when you first try it and stay with that software until you have recorded at least 2 songs so you know you are happy with that software and comfortable with it. Now do whatever you can to resist temptations to change software because you'll be spending time learning new software and less time producing new music. The same applies to the hardware you are using in your Studio. Even though hardware is difficult to replace it is often tempting to buy new gear but it could be more productive to become familiar with your existing hardware and how to use  than replacing it with new hardware. Learning your hardware and software and staying with your current equipment until you really outgrow things can assist you to produce music quicker without wasting time learning to use new equipment all the time. BE ADVENTUROUS AN EXPERIMENT WITH SOUNDS It's easy to get comfortable using the same drum kit the same electric piano and the same synthesizer for every song but this becomes boring and when it comes to the creative process you just lose people interest if every song sounds the same. So try different instruments different settings on the effects an experiment to be adventurous and create new sounds every time you start a new project or a new song. Doing this will help you learn to improve as an artist and keep your listeners interested. KEEP THINGS SIMPLE There is no reason to have a complicated workflow so try and make things simple and make life easy for yourself. You can use templates to setup tracks and associated plugins. You can fast track your effect plugin usage by using presets which you can then modify to give you the uniqueness required for your current project.

14,No One Passes Alone,arts-entertainment," Shelley called me in tears from the hospital. Marcus, her husband of thirty-two years, had died earlier that evening. His passing was not unexpected – cancer had spread throughout his body, and three weeks ago Marcus entered palliative care. I had visited him twice, giving the couple and their two grown sons whatever support I could. And now, I was glad to support Shelley in this time of her need – and gently let her know that she should not feel guilty because Marcus had died when she and her sons had left him to go downstairs to the hospital cafeteria for dinner. ""I feel so selfish,"" she said, sobbing. ""While we were eating – and laughing! Marc was dying – alone!"" ""Shelley,"" I said tenderly, ""take a deep breath, and tell me what happened."" She and her sons had been visiting, and noticed that Marcus was a bit more quiet than usual. At times, he stared off into space. Shelley sensed her husband was feeling troubled about something, and redoubled her efforts to cheer him up. Around five o’clock, he said he was feeling better, and told her and their sons to go downstairs for a bite to eat. ""Don’t go hungry on my account,"" he said. Shelley chuckled into the phone. ""How typically Marc. He never wanted to inconvenience anyone."" Then she began weeping again. ""But I feel so… guilty!"" ""I understand your feelings,"" I told her. ""But you have nothing to feel guilty about. Look at it this way – maybe Marcus asked you to leave because deep down he felt it was his time to pass into spirit. Maybe his soul just knew."" Carefully, I explained what I believe, based on what I have learned through my work as a medium. The moment of someone’s death and transition into the afterlife is difficult for some individuals, because they feel caught between the physical world and the spirit world. On one hand, their soul is preparing to meet the spirits of family members who have already passed and are happy to see them, yet they also feel tied to friends and family members in the living who are sad to see them go. So, rather than give pain to loved ones left behind, the individual tries to arrange his own passing, when no one is around. ""But I don’t understand,"" Shelley said. ""Why would Marc want to die?"" ""No one wants to die,"" I said, trying to comfort her. ""But his body was very weak. He was in pain, and under constant sedation. His choice was to remain here in pain, or transition to a more peaceful realm, where his spirit would be free."" ""And he didn’t die alone, thinking we’d abandoned him at his worst moment?"" ""Not at all,"" I said, and told her what had happened at the passing of my mentor, Sadie, who was like a surrogate mother to me. As Sadie’s moment of death approached, she telephoned to say she was being visited by her mother, brothers and other family members in spirit who were preparing a place for her in the next world. This cheered her immensely. Shelley seemed buoyed by my words. Yet she asked, ""Are you sure this is what happened to Marc?"" I was about to tell Shelley that I believed that wholeheartedly. But I remembered that Shelley was a friend, not a client, and she was comfortable with her religious convictions. What I was telling her was probably not easy to digest for someone whose spiritual ideas were different than mine. ""I do feel it’s true,"" I said, ""but until it’s our time go home, we really won’t know for sure."" ""And do you think…"" Shelley struggled with her words. ""Do you think… when it’s my time to… you know… will Marc be there to help me… into heaven?"" ""I’m sure of it,"" I promised. ""That much I know for sure."" ""Thank you,"" she said softly. We talked a few minutes more, then she hung up. I had wanted badly to tell her that, when he was ready, Marcus would visit his wife here on the earth plane, and continue to watch over her and their sons. But, as I said, Shelley was comfortable with her religious beliefs and I wasn’t going to press my philosophy onto hers. But I did tactfully let her know that if she started dreaming about Marcus, or if she began finding pennies in her house, or catch his presence in the corner of an eye – well, she could call me to chat anytime.

15,What? I'm a Theatre Star?,arts-entertainment," In my mind, I calmly told spirit, If you want me to do this, fine. And if not, then I’m okay with it. Then they called my name, and I jumped up and screamed. I couldn’t believe I made it!! I was going to be part of the 2016 Toronto Fringe Theatre Festival. That was the scene last November at the Tranzac Club in downtown Toronto. My husband and I had each submitted a proposal to stage a production at the Fringe, a two-week celebration of theatre, storytelling, dance, comedy and anything else that defies a quick description. Benjamin submitted his idea first – a staged reading of monologues based on interviews he’d done with people who worked in hospice.  But, I hesitated… Ben’s a great writer with great stories to tell. ""Why don’t you submit a proposal?"" he said one day over lunch. ""You do spirit-inspired events all the time. It’s kind-of like theatre."" ""Actually, my public message events are nothing like theatre,"" I said, unconvinced. ""I work for spirit, connecting loved ones on the other side of life to audience members eager to hear from their departed—"" Wait a minute… Did I just say ""audience""? Hmmmm… ""Then do something a little different,"" he coaxed. ""Don’t just give messages. Tell people your life story – how you became a medium. Talk about some of the interesting clients you’ve helped. And tell everyone how to spot phony psychics that want to scam them."" ""And give a few messages, too,"" I added. ""Wait – I’m not even a theatre company!"" ""So call yourself Psychic Medium Productions."" So I reluctantly applied for a spot, thinking I didn’t have a chance in you-know-where. The Fringe operates like a lottery – theatre groups submit their proposals, and on lottery day several dozen proposals are chosen. Last year, Benjamin had applied for a slot in last year’s Fringe festival, along with about 700 others who wanted to mount a production. Unfortunately, he wasn’t chosen. Flash forward to November 2015. When we arrived at the Tranzac Club, everyone who had submitted a proposal for the next Fringe was given a number. Mine was 99. As I wrote my number on the chit that would go into the lottery basket, I held my chit for a few extra moments to give it good energy. Then I placed it into the basket, found a seat in the club and waited for fate to either smile on me or snicker behind my back. As I looked around the room full of writers, performers and directors, I felt like a fish out of water. They were so out there, so extroverted. They oozed creative energy. And there I was, a quiet medium hiding in her left brain. Until my number was called. ""Number 99"" the announcer called. That’s when I screamed. I couldn’t believe it! Out of 138 applications, 10 were picked to stage 90-minute productions, and my chit came up for the tenth spot. ""Carolyn Molnar,"" the announcer read from my application blank. ""Psychic Medium Productions."" I went into a special room where those who’d been chosen had their pictures taken. The Communications and Outreach Manager greeted me and asked what my play was about.  When I explained my idea, her eyes went wide and said, ""No one has ever done this before.""  Oh God, I thought…  What have I gotten myself into?! Over the next six months, I have attended ""how-to"" workshops on staging my performance piece while I wrote my one-woman play, ""What?! You’re A Medium?!"". Come see me! Festival passes go on sale June 2, and individual tickets ($12), June 9, 2016. I don’t have to be a psychic to predict that you’ll like it!!! If you have any questions or comments on this subject or on any other spiritual matter, feel free to write me at mail@carolynmolnar.com. And please visit me again!"
16,How to get More Legitimate Reviews on Amazon,arts-entertainment," Self-published authors are always looking for inexpensive ways to improve their book marketing efforts. If you are on a limited budget, then your number one priority should be to focus on obtaining reviews on Amazon. In addition to book sales, positive reviews can help boost your standing in the Amazon sales ranking system, especially in the advanced search function that includes an ""average customer review"" option. Additionally, once you receive 20 reviews and an average rating of four stars or better, you can potentially qualify for the marketing promotions available on BookBub and other author-friendly websites. Reviews on Amazon are hard to acquire for new authors, so it’s important to grease the wheels and give yourself every advantage. It’s important to remember that friends and family may be reluctant to review your book publicly for fear of exposing their lack of writing skills. Instead, you may find more success tapping into social media and running book promotions to try and encourage review activity. Many self-published writers groups on Facebook can serve as a forum to advertise your book and also solicit reviews. There is nothing morally or ethically wrong for two authors to agree to exchange honest reviews of their respective books. Using this method can help increase your review count and also establish mutually beneficial relationships with other self-published authors. It’s relatively easy to contact another author in a Facebook group. Promotions are another way to receive reviews. If you run a free giveaway on Goodreads for example, you might try including a personal note asking the winner to give you a positive review if they enjoyed your book. The Hidden Author was designed to harness the collective purchasing power of the self-published author community. As part of their membership agreement, author/members are required to provide four reviews of books listed on the website. Since these reviews are crafted by other authors, they tend to be well-written and professional. Since only author/members can submit reviews, readers can be assured of the authenticity of the review process. Of course, author/members are encouraged to post their review on Amazon as well. Better sales and more reviews will help your self published book gain visibility and a higher ranking on Amazon."
17,Why I Still Use Hard Copy Contact Books Instead of My Phone,arts-entertainment," Call me ""old school"", even though I’m not really that old. Call me ""dated"", even though I still use my phone and computer for just about everything. Call me whatever you want to make me feel weird about continuing to use a hard copy address book when we have everything we need on our phones. I’m still going to do it. When it comes to books, all types of books, I really prefer traditional hard copies to all others. Sure, I dabble a bit in eBooks and audio books out of pure convenience, but when it really comes down to it, I like to feel an actual book in my hand. And this applies to more than simply reading. Even though I have all of the contacts that truly matter at hand in my smartphone, I still keep a hard copy address book on my desk at all times. There are a number of reasons why it’s my preference, so here are just a few. It takes my focus off a screen for at least a little while each day. If it weren’t for books, I would constantly be staring at a screen. Whether it be my phone, my computer, or my television, the screen zombie in me needs a serious break. When I’m at my desk and doing business where I have to make a number of calls, it helps to take my eyes off a screen for a bit. Taking the time to browse through my address book, which is chock full of notes, gives me a break that my eyes so desperately need. It allows me to feel a more personal connection with people I know. There is something about everything being electronic these days that has made me feel less connecting with people even though we can be connected with them at the touch of the button. When I reference my address book each day, it invokes memories about when that contact was added, why they were added, and the notes I’ve included with each contact even allows me to bring up certain stories to share whenever I make my calls. You can do this all with your phone, but I’m telling you it’s not quite the same. I’m more than okay with all of this information NOT being in the cloud.  For the same reason that it is an absolute godsend to be able to recover lost information easily, it’s also terrifying. Sometimes you don’t want all of that information out there in the world for anyone to get their hands on. I keep much more personal information in my hard copy address book than I ever would in my phone or on my computer. Good luck trying to hack into it from afar. It’s quite stylish. I like my office to complement my personality and my address books happens to be a part of my office. The one I have on my desk currently adds extra sophistication to the old school style of my office. If you didn’t see me sitting there, you might think the office belonged to someone like Ernest Hemingway. I could actually go on with reasons, but I’ll choose to spare you. Before you scoff at my old mindset, I implore you to just go back every now and then and try using a hard copy address book. They’re old school, but they’re also quite fun."
18,How To Write A Book In 2 Weeks,arts-entertainment," No doubt, you’ve been attracted by the title, but the first disclaimer is that although this is possible, some books will take far longer. Some books may be bubbling around in your head for months (years even), and then when the time is right – you could get it all down on paper in days. In an interview, Harry Potter author J K Rowling said she had literally the whole idea, 7 books, plot outline and characters from beginning to end during a train journey from London to Scotland – so anything is possible. This article is to help the budding writers, who are looking for some inspiration and encouragement, but just aren’t too sure of where / how to start. If writing a book is on your ‘to do’ list, (and you want to do this quickly), I may be stating the obvious, but the first thing you really need to do, is CLEAR A CHUNK OF TIME if possible, to be able to write undisturbed. Now, everyone is different. Writing from dusk till dawn may suit you, or writing for ‘4 hours’ a day may be better... either way – step one is to make time for the writing. Understand when you are at your creative best and aim to write at that time. Have an outline plan. Decide what your chapter titles will be. Decide what content is to go into each chapter, and then start writing. This will give you some structure and guidance. If you have lots of ideas – but each idea onto a sticky note, on a wall, divide the chapters up and place the sticky note into the correct chapter. This is one method to help you to organise the ideas in your head. Get them out of your head, onto paper, and into the right chapter. Set a timetable. You may want to aim for ‘1 chapter a day’ or something – to keep you to a deadline, and on track. Get a writing buddy. If you are lucky enough to have a friend enrolled in your cause, promise them ‘one chapter a day’ and they may read it for you as you go along, and give you feedback. This can encourage you to write, if you KNOW someone is waiting for the content. If you don’t have this, see if there is someone who can hold you accountable to your own deadlines. Maybe a writers group? If you are writing a factual book,(maybe on a topic that you’ve given previous talks / presentations on) then you may well find that you could already have 60-80% of your material already! Your ‘job’ is to then organise this material into a book format, which isn’t as daunting a task as actually creating something from scratch. Business owners who want to write a book have this advantage. If your material is one which is already in written format – then you’ll be at an advantage if you wish to write a book. And remember, a book could be ‘60’ pages... it doesn’t have to be ‘a novel’. It could be fairly short. It could be an ‘introduction to’ or a ‘step by step guide’ – (which lots of pictures), it doesn’t necessarily have to be dense text. For further ideas and inspiration, there is an online book writing course: https://www.udemy.com/writeabook/"

20,Put Your Hands Up! Is This DJ Robbery!,arts-entertainment," In the history of music there has always been different genres and musicians who change the face of the medium or become huge for their 15-minutes of fame. The one constant has been their physical skill and talent with instruments and singing. Writing this in the new year however, it is clear where the spotlight is at the moment – and it is not musicians. DJ’s have been front and centre for the first time in their history, and with artists clambering to feature with them, they are pulling in huge numbers of people and even more dollars than you ever thought possible. What is EDM? Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is the fastest growing genre of music in the world right now. The Grammy’s even gave the genre its own stage in 2012. David Guetta, who is the most veteran of DJ’s on the circuit, is the most followed artist on Spotify with 6.9m people. Supposedly starting after the death of disco, EDM was born in the late 1980’s and one person who has been there throughout was David Guetta. ""I started in '88 to play House music, it was a huge revolution for me. I went to London and I saw a DJ on stage and that was crazy at the time. A DJ on stage and people dancing and facing the DJ, looking at him? I was like 'wow!'"" says Guetta. It is bizarre to think thousands of people now show up to watch a middle aged man jumping behind a laptop, but it has grown exponentially from those humble beginnings Guetta describes. DJ’s are not playing instruments or singing, but simply playing recorded tracks back to the crowd. Of course there is skill in the mixing of tracks live but many DJ’s have been accused of playing pre-recorded mixes anyway, surely meaning the crowd are being short-changed. EDM seems to be benefitting from the time it is born into. With social media a major player, tunes that don’t take long to put together on software can be pumped out to the masses quickly. The genre has also created its own version of a chorus with the ‘drop’. This gives something for artists to build for, excite the crowd and then allow the them to release with dance rather than singing, which would be seen at a rock concert. It is this attraction for live shows that makes it so lucrative in the modern market too. Lets Talk Digits In 2015 Forbes released a list of the highest earners in DJ’ing and the numbers were shocking. Calvin Harris topped the list bringing in $66m in revenue from the 156 gigs that it was calculated from. Harris also banked a huge deal with nightclub Hakkisan, in Las Vegas, for a residency for 2 years. The Scottish hit maker will be payed $400,000 per gig! These figures are astronomic and reminiscent of rock stars from the past.  David Guetta was second on the list, earning $37m, and Dutch DJ Tiesto came in 3rd with $36m. The lifestyles of these men are similar to the rock stars of a by gone era and that has created a whole industry with clothing, computer games, and even Las Vegas are chasing in, with casino games based on DJ’ing. The numbers seem incredible when viewing EDM, as it was, 10 years ago. Who would pay that much to watch a DJ? But the popularity is undeniable, and the DJ’s are regularly brining people through turnstiles in arenas and festivals. USA EDM festival Tomorrow’s World has 150,000 capacities. The business minded executives of music have found a cash cow that can exploit live shows. With the modern music industry in the state it is in, with royalties and record sales harder to earn from, live events have become artist’s best way of earning big money. EDM is suited for it cheap staging and mobility, able to hit up all the big party spots, sometimes multiple shows in one night. Guetta Room EDM and suitability to the current demands of making money in the music industry in 2016 is allowing to rise above the rest. Big time DJ’s are charging huge sums and are becoming the biggest earners in music. With money lining the pockets of businesses too don’t expect to see David Guetta disappear back to the back of the stage anytime soon."

1,"Hunter Phoenix Cast In ""Bandit Hound II"" As Sabrina And ""Hollywood Uncensored"" As Vanessa",arts-entertainment," Los Angeles, CA— Canadian born actress, Hunter Phoenix, was recently cast in two productions by Los Angeles based All In Films. Ms. Phoenix will star along with Lou Ferrigno, Paul Sorvino and Catherine Bell in the heartwarming family film The Bandit Hound II as the the quirky but sexy Sabrina. She is also slated to join the cast of Hollywood Uncensored  mid January 2016 in the role of Vanessa. This funny and all-too-accurate web series features an amalgamation of literal characters as they present the ups and downs of living, working, and participating in the acting culture of Hollywood, California. The Bandit Hound II is the second feature film in this series. Here we continue to follow the adventures of a lovable dog named Bandit who started stealing cash to help his adopted family. However, the well- meaning pooch unwittingly sets his family on a collision course with a dangerous ex-partner. Hollywood Uncensored (aka Uncensored Hollywood) is a online series that takes a humorous and sexy approach to presenting the other side of life as an actor living in Los Angeles. INTERVIEW WITH HUNTER PHOENIX •	How long have you been acting? I came up through the theatre as a child performer, and was often called upon when young actors and actresses were required to memorize large amounts of text for live performances. My formal theatrical and dance training began as a pre-teen with a local theatre company and I then went on to study dramatic arts in college. •	Do you remember what your first big job was? Yes, of course. What really gave me a start in the business was a beer commercial just after college. I was working at a bar to pay off my student loans and was asked to audition. I got the part!  From there, getting an agent was a lot easier, and I started really working steadily as both a commercial and print model. • What first drew you to acting? I always wanted to be on stage! Desperately! And according to my mother, the love affair with a camera began when I was 2 :)  In second grade, I remember we put on a production the The Three Bears. I learned all of the lines - the whole play! I wanted to make sure that I got a part no matter what. I was hooked! I went on to study theatre arts locally after school and started working on stage by my mid teens. Acting really is the first love of my life. • Many A-List actors speak about the importance of acting training early in their careers. What did that look like for you? I have been really fortunate to have some wonderful acting coaches along  the way, including being in the very last Master Class Uta Hagen taught before she died. I started in Dramatic Arts while still in high school and continued on through college and beyond. I’ve studied with voice coaches, movement coaches, done scene study, on-camera classes and even improv at Second City. Some of the classes were technical, but most of them taught me about myself and other people; how we relate and why we do what we do. Acting has been a huge force for personal growth and development in my life. It has, often times painfully, pulled back my own facade and helped me to be a more compassionate human being. I don’t think we can ever really study enough - it’s always about ourselves, learning more and revealing more. • You also seem to do a lot of voiceover work? Yes. Along the way, I got dragged into doing voiceovers. Really, I didn’t want to do it! I have a great ear for accents and dialects, and a knack for crazy, silly characters. Extensive vocal training has also given me a voice that I’m told people love to listen to. With a lot of practice, I’ve able to master commercials and narration as well and even have a sound booth set up at home to record now too. •	Which of your roles have given you the most satisfaction? Why? The first role that comes to mind is one from a stage production of Streetcar Named Desire. I was working in London at the time I was cast. I had auditioned for another role in a different production by the same company, but the director cast me as Blanche. I was terrified to play the role. I had no idea how I was going to go through that complex emotional transition. I spoke to the director and told him I thought I would be better suited to another role, and what he said to me has stuck with me since; ""You’re perfect for the part. You know why? Because it’s going to be fascinating to watch you fall (emotionally)"". He turned out to be right - the whole process was fascinating. I had, not to strive, but to let myself go emotionally, to be very out of control and vulnerable. Both things that are incredibly difficult for me. My performance, and the play were very well received and I learned things about myself that I could not have imagined otherwise. • So what are you focusing on in your career right now? Now, my focus is definitely with film and television. I have a couple of upcoming projects during the next year that I’m really looking excited about!  Other than that? Create. Create. Create. I have been really lucky to spend much of my life working around the world modeling as well as acting. The experiences have been irreplaceable. But when you are moving around that much, you are constantly focused on traveling and where is the next gig. Now, I want to take the time and create. To give back to this industry that has given me so much, and to be part of the process of it’s evolution and growth. The next phase of my life is all about partnerships and creating new and wonderful things. • Do you have any future projects planned? Absolutely. This is a creative industry where you constantly have to be creating to stay fresh, feel alive and continue to be connected to the community in which you work. I’ve recently been cast in ""The Bandit Hound II"" being produced by All In Films, starring Judd Nelson, Lou Ferrigno and Paul Sorvino. I’m honored and excited to be working with such talented actors. I also have two personal projects that I’m writing and producing with industry partners; one short film that we are about to begin pre-production on early in 2016, and an unscripted TV series that will begin filming later in the year. • Which actors do you draw inspiration from? Wow… where do I begin with this one… Charlize Theron for her devotion and commitment to the craft. Sean Penn because he raises the bar every time he steps in front of the camera. Jennifer Lopez for being an entertainer!! Across the board she entertains! Al Pacino for his incredible depth, conviction and presence in every performance he gives. Jennifer Lawrence for being so completely fresh, open, quirky, vulnerable and deeply committed to her characters. Jeffery Dean Morgan and the consistent warmth and strength he brings to every character he plays. I could really go on forever about the incredible actors who have inspired my life and who are such a pleasure to watch. These are just a few who come to mind. • Do you have any advice for aspiring actors? Be You. Don’t ever be afraid to be you. I spent so many years insecure and trying to be someone else - often being told that I was too young, too old, too blonde, not blonde enough, my eyes were the wrong color and I was too thin or too heavy. Many times in the same week! This business can beat you up if you let it. Don’t. Just be you. You are incredible and unique and you can bring something to the table that no one else can."
2,The Boy Movie 2016,arts-entertainment," The one thing I love about the end of every year is looking forward to all the horror that we’ll be watching the following year. And 2016 will be exceptional. From ""The Forest"" ,""The Boy"" (opening in January) to the follow up of the 2013 hit ""The Conjuring"" and even our favorite team of paranormal investigators ""Ghostbusters"", next year promises to be filled with screams, terror, and even some belly laughs. And if you want to see the rundown of all the bloody goodness coming out next year, simply CLICK THIS LINK and you can get all the details. Trust me though, it will make you wish for the New Year already! While there are several titles in that list you will instantly recognize, there are some that you may not have even heard of yet. They’re not even on that list. But that doesn’t mean they’re not worthy of your time or money. If this year is any indication, the indie horror scene was vastly superior to the mainstream horror in my humble opinion. This is why it’s important that you know the name JOE CIMINERA now before his name is on the lips of the rest of the horror community. The reason? Well, because he’s a CHEF. And a damned fine one at that. Not only does he have his own highly acclaimed cooking show, but Joe is also the author of two books on cooking that have, together, sold almost two million copies. As if being on top of one passion wasn’t enough, Joe has also created three reality shows, has a popular foodie website, and does charity work to fight childhood obesity. Whew, talk about a full plate (pun intended). But what you may care about more than any of this is his love for the horror genre. Actor, writer, director….he’s done it all. And in 2016 he will be terrifying us with his latest project HUMPTY DUMPTY. HUMPTY DUMPTY is a modern take on the child’s nursery rhyme of the same name, but this is definitely not for kids! Below is the synopsis and it sounds like the kind of movie I can absolutely get behind. Enjoy. ""A dark story about a boy who is treated horribly in a small town in a place that is between here and the supernatural. Once you enter the town you never age and you can never leave. While traveling a priest and a young foster boy are on the way to a orphanage. Their transportation breaks down and the have no choice but to spend a few days in a nearby town. They notice a number of increasingly strange things about the town. People are always happy and there isn’t one minute of sadness to be found. No one ever ages, gets sick or grows old. People who try to leave the town seem to meet with bizarre and deadly accidents, which the residents believe to be the work of God. When someone tries to leave the entire town is punished."" HUMPTY DUMPTY promises to be a unique take on what an adult, scary fairy tale can be and just from the trailer alone you get the sense that this may be the breakthrough indie hit of next year. And the great news is that a crowd funding page has just come together to get HUMPTY DUMPTY funded! Which means YOU get to be a part of horror history by donating. With donations starting at just $2.00, literally ANYONE can be a part of making this movie happen. And the perks for donating are considerably awesome. HUMPTY DUMPTY is not going to be your typical horror film because Joe Ciminera isn’t your typical writer/director! The passion he displays with cooking has already being shown in the HUMPTY DUMPTY trailer below, and I can only imagine the finished product will have the horror community talking for a long time to come."

4,"How To Become A Great Guitarist, Part 2 – Three Reasons Why You Haven’t Become A Great Musician Yet",arts-entertainment," How To Become A Great Guitarist, Part 2 – Three Reasons Why You Haven’t Become A Great Musician Yet by Tom Hess What is keeping your from taking your guitar playing skills to the highest level? Is it terrible playing technique? No musical creativity? Little to no natural talent? Beyond your prime? Ineffective practice sessions? Fact is, it is none of these things. These are all just the symptoms of much deeper issues. In part one of this column I explained the key factor that determines if you will reach your musical goals. Now you are going to learn the three main things that prevent most guitar players from ever truly becoming great. Reason #1: You Fill Your Head With Excuses For Why You Can’t Become Great Let’s examine what excuses actually are. Contrary to what you might think at first - Excuses are not simply reasons to not do something. At a deeper level, excuses are thoughts that help you avoid the things you are afraid of most. You can quickly see this by asking yourself ""What am I avoiding here"" whenever you make an excuse not to do something. Think about how your life would be different if you never used an excuse ever again. So rather than saying, ""Today I won’t have the time to work on practicing guitar"", you simply make practicing guitar a top priority or learn how you can practice without a guitar in hand. Instead of letting yourself believe that you just ""don’t have musical talent"", change your mindset and focus on believing that you have infinite potential to improve and become great. The only one holding you back is yourself. Here’s is how to combat your urge to make excuses: Think about all the excuses you’ve been making for yourself. You might be creating excuses that hold you back without even knowing it. It’s not always easy to see, but you can quickly pinpoint them by putting together a file with all the thoughts that seem to be stopping you from taking action to become a better guitarist. Are these things truly good reasons or just excuses? – Truth is, in most cases, they will be excuses. Avoid excuses at all cost by using these tactics: -Surround yourself with people who have empowering mindsets and can help hold you accountable when you make excuses -Keep in mind that every time you make excuses, you move further away from your goal of becoming an amazing guitar player -Think of your excuses like a bad habit to quit. The less you give into them, the better you’ll be at it To make this process much easier, begin working with a great guitar teacher who knows how to spot excuses and will help you overcome them. Reason #2: Your Mindset Is All Wrong You can only be as successful as your mindset lets you be. If you want to become truly great at guitar, you must demand greatness from yourself! The world’s best guitarists all have a mindset for greatness. You might think: ""Of course. They’ve already achieved great things, it’s easy for them to think with a mindset for greatness."" NO! You’ve got it all wrong. Their mindset was the fundamental building block of the success that they achieved! For these incredible musicians to reach the high level of guitar playing virtuosity that they did, they started by avoiding excuses, making success-oriented decisions and implementing a strong mindset that gave them the ability to accomplish great things. To achieve the same greatness as them, you must only accept the highest level of greatness for yourself. Know deep down inside that you CAN and WILL reach this level of success. This is how all champions think before they become champions in their field. So begin changing your mindset by: -Replacing all your negative thoughts will powerful ones that will lead you where you want to go -Changing your belief from ""I don’t know if I can become a great guitar player"" to ""I MAKE THE CHOICE to become a master guitar player"". My Personal Mission: It is my mission to turn every student of mine into a true CHAMPION! I expect and demand massive success for each and every guitar student I train, teach and mentor. Every student of mine and YOU have the potential to: -Become an amazing guitar player -Become a massive successful professional musician -Earn a great living teaching guitar An amazing guitar teacher will simply not waste time with you if you frequently make excuses or have a negative mindset. He may work with you just one time. However, when they notice that you have a negative mindset, they will stop working with you altogether. In other words, your mindset with have kept you from obtaining opportunities that could greatly improve your musical skills. Reason #3: You’re Not Making The Right Decisions Every choice you make decides what your future will be like. Many people become slaves to circumstance and do not take action to get what they want. Understand that your circumstances are not a good reason for not taking action to do something. Your life is built through decisions, not circumstances. I frequently hear guitar players saying things like this: ""I got a late start"" ""No one got me a guitar when I was young"" ""I didn’t have a guitar teacher"" ""I can only practice a little every day"" ""I can’t afford to pay for guitar lessons"" ""I’m not sure how to best practice guitar"" ""I can’t find the right guitar teacher for me"" ""My work leaves me without energy to practice guitar"" ""I have a family to spend time with, leaving me no time to practice guitar"" Guess what? These people will never become great guitarists because they have succumb to their circumstances. You can do better. Know that YOU have total control over your circumstances, not them over you. From now on, make choices that move you closer to reaching your guitar playing goals, rather than excusing your failure to do so. Make the choice to begin studying with whoever you need to study, learn whatever things you need to learn, practice whatever you need to practice, and train your mindset and your hands to do what needs to be done to become an amazing guitar player. Excuses are your limitations (they are not descriptions of them)! Don’t pay attention to the thoughts in your mind that say you can’t do, have or achieve something you truly desire. Only accept thoughts that say you WILL become an incredible guitarist…and you will be on the right path to playing guitar like you’ve always wanted. To quickly achieve your guitar playing goals, learn how to find the right guitar instructor who will help you become the guitarist you’ve always wanted to be."
5,How to Discover the Greatest Books Ever Written,arts-entertainment," The majority people who are reading this article enjoy reading. Most people love to read and many have a strong passion to read.  Abraham Lincoln loved to read and did everything he could to find whatever books he could read.  Lincoln, as most people, put the Bible at the top of his reading list.  The bibliophile is always on a quest to find the latest greatest book, or that hidden gem that is not readily available.  Here are some ways to find the greatest books ever written; some may be closer than you think. At the top of the list has to be the Bible.  How many people do you know that actually read their Bible consistently?  It is filled with the history of the world, and actually has information about our past, present and future.  You can read it over and over again and each time, learn something new and inspiring. Used book stores.  There are multiple reasons to peruse through used book stores.  Many times you will find books that are out of date, and cannot be found anywhere else.  It may not be the latest or greatest, but it could become a valued book that you will treasure for a long time. Sometimes libraries or other organizations will hold book sales.  You may find yourself walking out carrying many books and paying pennies on the dollar.  At these type of sales there is always an excitement in the air.  There are usually many books to choose from and they are ridiculously inexpensive. Traditional bookstores are still around, although unfortunately the number is dwindling.  You will pay top dollar, unless you are buying something on sale, but you will find the latest books available.  There are many to choose from, and bookstores are still an exciting place to visit.  Some even have seats where you can sit down and read. You never know what you will find at a garage sale or a flea market.  People don’t normally shop these venues specifically for books, but you may find something special.  That goes for music also.  The book lover is always on the lookout, and a garage sale or flea market may hold that next great read. And the last, but certainly not the least good place to find great books, is the internet.  When we think about buying books on the internet, the first place we think of is Amazon.  That is certainly the best place to buy new, as well as used books on the internet, but there are other places as well.  There are many online bookstores and each one has its own appeal.  There is even an online bookstore that only sells books that are self-published.  That means that you would have a hard them finding them in a traditional bookstore, or even on Amazon.  There are many great books, well written, very interesting, but are hard to find.  With this latest information, your next greatest read may be just a click away."
6,6 Lessons Artists can learn from Startups,arts-entertainment," There are several stages of business development that all startup ventures must pass through before they can start enjoying good returns. Unfortunately, most artists do not focus on the business side of things. New musicians, painters, designers or sculptors are like business enterprises, meaning that there is a lot that they can borrow from startups if they are keen on making profits from their talents, such as: 1- Networking Instead of taking a backseat after finishing a beautiful painting, a fine artist must find a way to sell it. This means networking with possible clients both off and online in order to create a buzz about their product. It might be scary trying to sell your work to strangers, but establishing business relationships is all about taking risks and not getting discouraged if they do not pay off. 2- Entertain criticism Do not fear judgment about your work, but instead be ready to stand in the spotlight as where there is rejection, there is also acceptance. Remember that, like a startup venture, artists who are starting out also face challenges which should not deter them from their goals of earning a decent living from their talent. Professional marketers and public relation firms can help artists cater to the business aspect while they focus on their passion. 3- Display a good image Startup managers know that customers judge them according to their image. If business premises are dirty or disorderly and the attendants cannot communicate well, there are high odds of failure. Artists must also be very careful of the image that they present and how they relate to their likely customers or investors. Most people in the art world are free spirits who barely recognize the demands of the business world, but this shouldn’t be the case. Such care free people deter investors as it heightens risks. 4- Use the 80/20 principle For the creative mind, art and business hardly go hand-in-hand, but that is no excuse for failure as a professional artist. Even if all you want is to immerse yourself into your art pieces all day long, selling them will definitely improve your life. To strike a balance, art marketing experts recommend that artists dedicate 80% of their time to their creations and 20% to public relations and marketing. 5- Diversify how you make your money Some great artists like Jay Z and Beyoncé are often ranked among the richest celebrities. This is not just for their music, but also because they engage in parallel activities like fashion and movies to rake in more cash. As a beginner, you can arrange workshops or become an assistant to great artists like the Chapman brothers, who were assistants to the great Gilbert & Georg. This will increase your work’s exposure and help you learn vital lessons for success. 6- Build a relationship with your fans Pablo Picasso was a famous artist renowned for some great pieces, but the most admirable thing about him was his amazing connection with his fans. He would mingle and freely interact with people to gain inspiration. By doing that, he achieved rare celebrity status which made his exemplary works even more desirable, popular, and valuable. Art can certainly make you millions, but that calls for a great image and marketing mind."
7,Five Suggestions to Double Your Reading Speed,arts-entertainment," Many people would like to read more, but don’t have the time.  Then there are those who have the time, but don’t like to read.  Reading is a fundamental skill that everyone needs, and the better one is at this skill, the more enhanced life tends to be.  Most people learn how to read in school, and after they leave school, their reading skills tend to stay about the same.  Some are more ambitious, and look to take their reading skills to a different level.  Here are five things that, if practiced, can help you double your reading speed. Don’t sound out each word.  This is probably the most important thing to do to read faster, and it is the most difficult thing to overcome.  When we first learned to read, we were taught to sound out each word.  That also helped to spell the word correctly, as well as to pronounce the word properly.  It takes much longer to pronounce each word than it does to look at the word, and just understand what it means.  If you look at the word, and move right to the next one, the mind will remember what the word was, as it links the current word back to the first one.  When you look at 2, 3, or more words at a time, this will get easier, which leads to our next suggestion. Read 2 or 3 words at a time.  Looking at each word and sounding it out is a long way to get through a sentence.  After you have mastered looking at the word and not sounding it out, then try doing it with two words, then three words.  When you are reading multiple words at a time, the brain is able to pick up the meaning more rapidly, and you can go to the next phrase, or group of words.  It is quicker to read phrases than just reading each word.  With practice, this will become second nature. Have good eye span.  Don’t dwell on each word or phrase.  Move your eyes at a good pace, but don’t move so fast that you do not understand what you are looking at.  When you look at the last word in the sentence, move your eyes rapidly to the next line, and look and move along the sentence. Do not regress.  One of the biggest obstacles to reading fast is regressing.  It is natural to want to have a clear understanding of what is being read.  As your reading speed increases, the tendency to regress will be less and less.  You have to make a conscious effort to move along and not go back.  As you move along, the word you may miss should not interfere with the meaning. Vary the speed.  Everything that is read does not have to be read at the same speed.  Some things that are more technical will be read slower.  The mind will pick up some things very quickly and others not as quickly.  Move along at a pace that is comfortable.  Move as fast as you can while still understanding what is being read. With practice, the above steps will help you become a faster reader with better comprehension, and you will enjoy reading more books."
8,It's finally here!  A brand new Bible!!!,arts-entertainment," THE NEWEST TESTAMENT JESUS LIVES!!! is an autobiography of my life (King) David Coates that was inspired to be written by a prophetess in Atlanta, Georgia. I attended a church service, and at the end of the prophetess's church service she prayed over me, and she advised me that the Holy Spirit advised her to inform me to write this book. The prophetess also informed me that I am a miracle walking-that this book must be written to share with people the miraculous life which I lived, and also how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ delivered me through all adversities. This book consists of the truth, and nothing but the truth so help me God. This is a non-fiction novel, and it was written to prove to people that Jesus is alive. Also to prove that Jesus is a deliverer, and to show that I am living proof. This book consists only facts, these true facts describe how Jesus delivered me from asthma, diabetes, pneumonia, alcoholism, drug addiction, cigarettes, getting shot at with guns on numerous occasions, getting shot in my face and my left shoulder from behind. It demonstrates how Jesus delivered me out of the hands of the judicial system on numerous occasions without my acquiring any felony convictions, and how Jesus constantly delivered me out of the hands of people who wanted me killed. This autobiography may not be in perfect chronological order, but it's contents are 100 percent true. This book was not written for any self promotion. This book was only written to show that Jesus lives, also to educate everyone on how praising God does, in fact, work. You will observe the fact that that Jesus is alive, and is still performing miracles in our everyday lives through my testimony. The prophetess acknowledged to me that the Holy Spirit wanted it done, and for me to write the book in scripture, and this is the only reason why I wrote this book. As aforementioned, God has given me a testimony and he wants everyone to hear it. So by the power of the Holy Spirit vested in me, I present to all people: THE NEWEST TESTAMENT JESUS LIVES!!! A brand new Bible!!!"
9,"Iosif Andriasov String Quartet, Op. 1",arts-entertainment," Iosif Andriasov composed his String Quartet for Two Violins, Viola, and Cello, Opus 1, in 1954, when he was 21 years old. The String Quartet is dedicated to Nelli Andriasova (Andriassian), the composer’s sister. It was first performed by the students of the Music College at the Malyi Concert Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Moscow, USSR, in 1954. The sincere, lively, joyous, effervescent music of the String Quartet stirred such stormy applause by enthusiastic listeners that, according to witnesses, the balcony floor of the concert hall shook, and the personnel on duty ran from downstairs to the hall to see what was going on there. The String Quartet of Mr. Andriasov was recorded and broadcast abroad by the Soviet Radio Station. It attracted attention toward the young promising gifted composer. Mr. Andriasov’s music was always warmly welcomed. The listeners admired it for its artistic temperament, emotional warmth, exuberant energy, expressive thematism, connection with folklore, clear-cut construction, and colorful harmonic language. The American premiere of the String Quartet took place with Victor Romasevich (Lubotsky), Leonid Fleishaker - violins; Anatole Wieck (Wic) - viola, and Roger Lowe - cello, in July of 1979 (two months after Iosif Andriasov came to the United States), at a charitable concert in a Manhattan jail in New York, NY. The prisoners, guards, and other personnel were fascinated by Mr. Andriasov’s music, and gave the String Quartet a heartfelt reception. The String Quartet is a ""youthful"" composition. Its ""hero"" is a young man who enters the world full of hopes. The music radiates with energy and happiness. There are pages of the dreamy, inspired lyricism, displaying the romantic nature of the composer; episodes with tragic notes, expressing deep compassion for people, revealing the altruistic essence of the composer’s personality, and genre scenes, based on folk dances. I. Andriasov follows the traditions of Armenian folk and classical music (Soghomon ""Gevorki"" Soghomonyan (also known as Komitas Vardapet), Aram Khachaturian) as well as traditions of the Western-European and Russian classical composers, first of all, Ludwig van Beethoven, Nikolai RimskyKorsakov, Alexander Borodin (traditions of ""Russian Orientalism"") and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The String Quartet is filled with melodic intonations and rhythms from Armenian (Trans-Caucasian) folk songs and dances. The connection with folk traditions is displayed through modal diversity (particularly, in the modes that include the interval of the augmented second); in ornamentation; in irregular rhythms; in the drones, and in a re-creation of the timbres of the Armenian folk instruments. An exquisite treatment of folk material connects Iosif Andriasov with S. Soghomonyan. The expressive, sharp harmonic language and adherence to the plagal function relates him to P. I. Tchaikovsky (in particular, P. I. Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony). The clear-cut structure of the String Quartet demonstrates how Iosif Andriasov mastered the traditions of the Viennese classics. Also, I hear a bit of jazz music in his use of harmonies. But, the individual voice of Iosif Andriasov is revealed through a peculiar fusion of tenderness and courageousness, - his distinctive feature; in his heartfelt compassion for people and simultaneously in an objective view of a situation from the outside; in his seriousness - and yet an irrepressible happiness, and in his vigorous temperament. The String Quartet is in three movements. In his String Quartet, Iosif Andriasov employs a principle of ""reminiscence"" to unite the cycle’s movements. It is known that the Classical, Romantic, and Contemporary music has rich traditions in this regard. Alexander Mikhailov, the Soviet musicologist, considers the Fifth Symphony by L. v. Beethoven the first example of reminiscence. There are other works that deal with this substantial principle: Symphonies by Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner, Jean Sibelius, Alexander Glazunov; the Piano Quartet by Sergei Taneev, ""Serenade for Strings"" by P. I. Tchaikovsky, ""Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste"" by Bela Bartok, Symphony in C by Igor Stravinsky, some compositions by Nikolai Myaskovsky, Sergei Prokofiev, A. Khachaturian, and many others. The String Quartet of Iosif Andriasov is marked by an exquisite treatment of folk material, a deep understanding of string instruments (I. Andriasov was a violinist), melodic richness, expressive harmonies, a well-balanced form with equilibrium of meditative and dancing episodes, and clear and transparent texture.

11,Will artificial intelligence make us smarter or stupider?,arts-entertainment," Technology is now developing at an unprecedented rate as new technologies allow us to develop even more technologies at an exponential rate. Many have wondered whether a world run by increasingly intelligent machines will eventually cause us to become less intelligent. The age of machines This wouldn’t be the first time that major advancements in technology resulted in changes in mankind. After the industrial revolution, when the work performed by manual laborers was outsourced to machines, people became less physically active. Many believe that our sedentary lifestyle—and a worldwide obesity epidemic—can be attributed to the industrial revolution. Of course, the industrial revolution wasn’t all bad. Though it led to poorer physical health, it also likely contributed to greater human intelligence. Because humans were freed from monotonous manual labor, they were free to devote more time to intellectual pursuits. Furthermore, humans needed to be more intelligent to navigate a congested modern city than a small rural town. The internet age Now, we are in the internet age where limitless amounts of knowledge are at our fingertips. Anyone with a computer, tablet, or smartphone has access to virtually every bit of information that exists in the world. This has allowed humans to become even more intelligent. The artificial intelligence age The artificial intelligence age is still years ahead of us. But already we are beginning to see many early artificial intelligence systems taking over certain tasks. For instance, planes are for the most part flown by automatic pilot systems except during takeoff and landing. The task of handling air traffic at busy airports has become so monumental, that we have turned it over to artificial intelligence systems. Already, artificial intelligence has been able to beat Gary Kasparov, a chess genius, at his own game and Ken Jennings in a game of Jeopardy. Thanks to Moore’s Law, which states that there will be an exponential increase in electronic processing capacity over time, artificial intelligence machines will be able to do more and more of the thinking for us. Already we have personal assistants like Siri (if you own an Apple device) or Cortana (if you own a Windows device running Windows 10). In the not-too-distant future, these personal assistants can become so advanced that they will automate much of our day-to-day tasks. The easy life The real question is whether a future with artificial intelligence will make us smarter or stupider. Just as the industrial revolution automated manual labor and made humans lazier, the artificial intelligence age could automate our thinking and make us stupider. However, also like the industrial revolution, the artificial intelligence age could also automate tasks that make us free to follow intellectual pursuits ultimately making us smarter. Only time will tell exactly how artificial intelligence will affect our day-to-day life.

12,How To Make Your Legato Guitar Technique Clean & Articulate,arts-entertainment," How To Make Your Legato Guitar Technique Clean & Articulate By Tom Hess Is your legato technique in need of some serious improvement, but you’re not sure how to go about it? Fortunately, you don’t need to search for any special exercises to do this - you must simply use the best practicing methods for developing the technique, just like all the great players do. By doing this, the quality of your legato playing will quickly skyrocket. The following are the biggest reasons why you still haven’t improved your legato technique, plus how you can start making progress in this area: Reason One: You Aren’t Identifying The Causes Of Your Legato Technique Issues Most guitar players don’t use a problem solving mindset when trying to fix the issues in their legato playing. Instead, they do one of these two things: And/or: Rather than working to develop your legato technique with additional exercises, try isolating your problems and observing every movement your fingers are making, in order to identify the main cause of the issues. This will show you precisely what needs to be worked on in your technique for making your legato technique (and all the licks that follow from it) sound much better. If you have a hard time figuring out this process on your own, find a guitar teacher who can show you how this is done. For an example of this, check out this video where I show one of my guitar students how to improve his legato technique: Reason Two: You Are Playing Notes Too Slowly Whenever You Use Legato Technique To make your legato technique become much more clean and smooth, you need to understand how to articulate notes using faster movements. Notice: This is not the same as ""playing the notes at a higher bpm"". You can play longer duration notes while making quick movements for each individual hammer-on/pull-off you play. This will help you to clearly sound each note with great power, without excessive tension (making fast legato playing become totally easy). To get a better understanding of this concept, think about snapping your fingers to produce a loud sound. If you want to improve the clarity and loudness of the snap, you have to snap your fingers quickly (not only with more force). If you try to snap with only greater force, your fingers will move slowly and the snap will not sound like you want it to. This same idea applies to your legato guitar playing. Check out the video I discussed earlier to see this ideas explained on guitar. Reason Three: Your Hands Are Full Of Tension While Playing Legato Tons of guitar players use much more power than necessary while playing their legato licks. This effectively makes it impossible to play legato fast, with any kind of accuracy. Fix this problem by going through this easy process for finding the appropriate amount of tension needed to play guitar: Start by playing a legato lick with the normal amount of tension you would use. Use less and less tension until you are using so little tension that the notes of the lick become hard to sustain. Add a very small level of tension back into your playing (just enough to barely sound the note – no more). Now that you understand the best ways to improve your legato technique, see if you are on track towards reaching your guitar playing goals. See what you need to work on now by taking this lead guitar playing test. "
13,5 Interesting Facts About Beethoven You May Not Have Known,arts-entertainment," Ludwig Van Beethoven is one of the most famous and influential musicians/composers of the Classical and Romantic era. He was born in Bonn, which is the capital of Cologne (Germany) on December 17th 1770. He had a very diligent melodious career with the help of his father, Johann Van Beethoven, who started teaching him music at a very early age. Beethoven wrote 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for the piano and 1 for the violin, 32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets to represent his entire career. There is probably no one in the developing world that doesn’t recognize a piece or two that was written by Ludwig. His music was dramatic and fierce and lives on to this day. A lot of historical information can be found about Beethoven, but there are some exceptional facts about him that you may never have known: Does Age Really Matter? On paper Ludwig Van Beethoven was born on 1770. However, for many years the composer thought he was born in 1772. The exact year of birth was never officially definite. Historians believe that Beethoven’s father intentionally created this deception by altering his age so that he could present a much younger musical virtuoso. Remember, around the same time period Mozart was already quite established, and most likely, Beethoven’s biggest musical rival! His father didn’t want his son to be out-done by a fellow young originator. Student Turned Piano Teacher Beethoven was forced into the practice of music by an early age and music became his existence. It became his identity and he was very successful. One would assume that his passion for music would be something that he would love to share with those who wanted to learn. Beethoven was known to show utter disdain for piano teaching unless he was able to teach exceptionally gifted students, and, it has been noted, that if the student was a beautiful woman, it didn’t matter if she couldn’t tap her fingers to chop-sticks let alone play the piano. Sounds of Silence for Ludwig The worst fate that could ever befall a musician is loss of hearing.  That is exactly what happened to Beethoven. His hearing loss was gradual, but by 1819, in his 30’s, he was clinically and completely deaf.  According to correspondences written by Ludwig, he considered his hearing loss a ""demon"", which haunted him everywhere he went. There were moments in this phase of his life where he contemplated suicide, but the love of music and his career held that action at bay. After the deafness set in, he was still able to complete thirty-two piano sonatas, seventeen string quartets, nine symphonies, one of which would be the Fifth Symphony – one of the most commonly recognized pieces he ever wrote. Twelve Times Thirty Music and math have always been complimentary disciplines. According to the American Mathematical Society, counting, rhythm, scales, intervals, patterns, symbols, harmonies, time signatures, overtone, and pitch are ALL notations made my composers that are directly connected to mathematics. With that being said, Beethoven was not very gifted, to say the least, when it came to basic math. Due to family obligations, he had to leave school at the early age of 11 to help support his family. Beethoven's Struggle For Health Throughout Beethoven’s childhood, middle years and up to his death, he was never blessed with a healthy life. In addition to his hearing loss, which was attributed to typhus, he also suffered from colitis, rheumatism, rheumatic fever, skin disorder, to list a few. His death was eventually caused by cirrhosis, which lead to liver failure. Whatever strange behavior or physical infirmities Beethoven struggled with, there is no denying that he will forever remain one of the greatest composers of all time."

15,"Return to Innocence- Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes""",arts-entertainment," ""Good art offers endless discussion possibilities, and its existence has eternal value."" Looking at Poren Huang’s sculptures elicits boundless images. In ""Friends"", each individual in the global village must maintain a macro-perspective instead of limiting oneself, and must open one’s heart to challenge and explore the wide world with confidence and courage (As demonstrated by the upright, tip-toe posture of the puppy). The interaction between the dog and the panda is intriguing, where behind the mutual civility seems many hidden tricks. One of the panda’s hands is holding a pair of scissors, while the dog has its hand fisted behind its back. Are the two playing a game of Rock-paper-scissors? Or is the panda simply happily making the victory sign? Some interpret the panda as a metaphor for China, and whether in Hong Kong or Europe, the room for different interpretation is vast. In 2005, Poren Huang launched ""The Dog‘s Notes"" sculpture series. Focusing on quality rather than quality, the series comprises a total of 40 works to date, averaging 4 creations a year. Poren Huang has raised a record of more than 20 dogs at the same time, and is especially fond of the many superior qualities of the black Formosan Dog. Based on the Formosan Dog, his series of bronze and stainless steel sculptures are diversified and distinctive in personality and imagination, yet strongly consistent. Precursor to ""The Dog‘s Notes"", the ""Iron Wood Forest"" metal creations are incorporated into Taiwan’s art textbooks. The aboriginal protagonist in the creation demonstrates the dauntless vitality and fearless spirit of aboriginals, and their adaptability to sea, plain or mountain environment. While the works strongly manifest the positive qualities of aboriginals, the Formosan Dog is their companion. In Poren Huang’s ""Iron Wood Forest"", a dog is often present like a shadow helping the human character. Hence in 2005, the dog became center stage when Poren Huang began his ""The Dog’s Notes"" series. In addition to the preserving the positive qualities of the creation, the series also delivers humor. Dogs play the role dictated by humans. Heaven has bestowed dogs as a human best friend! In ancient or primitive environment, humans coexisted with wild beasts, and dogs played the role of bugle sounding sentries who maintain alertness 24 hours a day to guard their homes and protect their masters till the end of their short lives. In addition to defending their territories, they were also excellent helpers who help their masters hunt or herd sheep. Moreover, dogs heal the human heart, giving their masters the warmest of care. Upon weaning and becoming independent creatures, dogs begin their lifetime of loyal and selfless dedication to their masters. Regardless of their masters’ anger, sadness or lack of food, dogs never leave their masters but remain steadfast toward their masters. Today’s dogs no longer play the sentry or hunting role, but have become pets, and if abandoned by their masters, become strays. With the development of human history, dogs have fully demonstrated that their loyalty, enthusiasm and pure attributes have remained constant, and contemporary humans should emulate such positive qualities. Poren Huang uses dogs to personify humans, and dog-like sculptures are in fact portrayal of humans. Poren Huang believes that the 21st century human fails to measure up to dogs, not for the want of a good life, but for the lack of Confucian piety and resilience to stress. Dogs dedicate their lives to humans, following them uncomplainingly even in deprivation. In contrast, humans will rip apart kinship over money. Today’s material economy is improving, yet the morality of humanity is deteriorating. In addition, a weakened mind, or the so-called civilized mental illness, has become the norm in today’s society. Unlike agricultural or primitive African societies where people are content, people today lack resilience toward stress, resulting in manic-depressive mood swings or emotional instability. Nevertheless, humans can emulate the dogs at their side, and learn from their innocence and optimism so that simple pleasures or positive actions can bring about joy and serenity. Like dogs where a mere simple hug and warm interaction can induce them to burst with happiness, isn’t simple bliss not within reach? Born of woodcarving family At one time, Poren Huang kept 20 dogs with him at the same time. Since his grandfather's generation, dogs have always been part of the family. He often helps dogs deliver puppies, is born in the Year of the Dog, and is the typical dog expert. Poren Huang has the refined and sensitive nature of an artist. In addition to his detailed observations of the personality and behaviors of dogs, he is astutely perceptive of the connection between dogs and people in modern society. Poren Huang was born into a wood carving family. During the time of his grandfather and father, the woodcarving industry in Taiwan was at its peak. Woodcrafts were often exported, and during the heyday, their woodcarving factory had employed more than 100 craftsmen to produce woodcrafts. At that time, they kept many dogs throughout the factory to prevent theft. Hence, Poren Huang grew up among woodcarving and dogs. However, he not only has exquisite carving techniques, but is also born with a keen sense of observation and extraordinary sensitivity, where his appreciation of life is expressed through sculpturing. Therefore, he best understands the difference between crafts and art. After graduating from the Taipei’s Fu-Hsin Trade and Arts School Department of Sculpture in 1989, he began his artistic creations and produced works that are most widely discussed. The diversity of ideas and concepts in each and every piece of his work stir bountiful associations in his audience. However, from the very beginning, Poren Huang’s father was firmly opposed to his career in art, and even threatened to severe their father-son relationship. That was because in the past, woodcarving masters had left their factory due to the hardship and poverty of an artist’s life. His father did not wish the same mistake on his children, and resorted to the threat in the hope that he would be able to eke out a stable living by continuing in the woodcarving industry. However, Poren Huang’s strongly artistic nature could not be satisfied with the arrangement, and insisted on creative work. Nevertheless, he did not wish to leave his family, and with a positive attitude, quietly set about to create. At the same time, he also participated in many sculpture competitions, and his innumerable awards attracted media interviews and reports, eventually giving his father a peace of mind. Poren Huang Boren uses the dog as his theme to express his tenacious refusal to surrender his creative works while also demonstrating his absolute loyalty to his family by building his family before developing his personal art. His ""I’m Not Happy Now!"", ""Home"" and ""Generation to Generation"" bronze sculptures are seemingly whimsical, yet they were created during Poren Huang’s lowest point in life when his family failed to understand his insistence on art. However, he was neither pessimistic nor resentful, but instead created ""The Dog’s Notes"" series that draws smiles from his audience. ""I’m Not Happy Now!"" the bronze work offers unlimited imagination. Dogs have personalities and emotions, and are also territorial. However, they do not provoke, but instead want to please humans and desire understanding of their ""I’m Not Happy Now"". In human interaction, substituting hurt with humor is the best form of communication. It does not create chasm or rift, but instead closes gaps and instills concern. During the time when Poren Huang was creating this piece of work (2005), he was in need of family support and understanding. Although his journey in artistic creation was difficult, he consistently maintained a positive attitude and humorous perspective while diligently taking care of his family. The ""Every Day is a New Start"" (2007) bronze sculpture has a shiny gold layer, and was created when his father was ill and dying. From the perspective of a father, parents want their children to be happy every day, and the smiles of their children bring them the greatest satisfaction. Poren Huang accompanied his father till the very last moment, and grasped that being able to safely awaken to welcome each day is life’s greatest gift. It is like basking in the light of dawn, where the heart is full of light. This work is also a satire of the heavily burdened modern life where the heavenly gift of time is not treasured. Dogs and humans are not only friends, but also learning partners Positive attributes characterize Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"". Although the works differ in styles and patterns, almost every piece pulsates with energy and ambition! The lives of dogs are not long, but they stay tirelessly with its master. In past generations, human lifespan was short, yet it was easy to cherish each day and live a valuable life. In contrast, people today are full of ignoble self-righteousness and complacency, and treat life with such passiveness till confronted with death. In particular, despite the excellent economic comfort of modern life, people are always greedy, calculating and creating burdens for themselves, resulting in mental and emotional insecurity. Life is full of troubles, and negative thinking is inevitable. ""The Dog’s Notes"" is a contemporary work that reminds people of the value of positive thinking. The past agricultural society of contentment and strong ethics would not have produced the concepts and works of ""The Dog’s Notes"". The valiant sculpture of ""The Dog’s Notes"" bears extraordinary self-confidence and courage for facing a world of information explosion and sheer vastness. The puffed up chest fur of the dogs (e.g. messages and dreams) suggests their indomitable spirit in confronting a multitude of challenges. ""The Loved One"" bronze sculpture does not necessarily refer to the children of wealthy families. All parents think that their children are ""The Loved One"", and provide them with the best care and resources in the hope that they can find happiness and live a better life than the previous generation. Everyone plays the role of ""The Loved One"" to his parents. ""The Loved One"", with his baby fat and complacency, might not have necessarily squandered away his family resources, but may have instead flourished, and fully demonstrated courage and self-confidence even at a tender age, valiantly facing his life, and is indeed a loved one. Poren Huang Boren employs anthropomorphic sculpturing so that his creations resemble both dog and human. ""The Dog’s Notes"" are quite anthropomorphic, and readily resonates strongly with the collectors to become a part of their family. The dog form is used to capture audience attention and evoke the desire to touch. Subsequently, through the interaction, the spirit of the work is realized, and infects those living with it. Interactivity is a major feature of ""The Dog’s Notes"", and Poren Huang encourages collectors or the audience to touch these anthropomorphic works and experience the inner legacy. Therefore, large works of ""The Dog’s Notes"" naturally becomes a focal point in public places, attracting unconscious attention and educing the desire to interact and savor. Poren Huang implanted the concept of taking care of the family, positive thinking and fearlessness into his work so that upon interacting with his creations, people discover again and again the profound, intrigue and lasting charm in the artistry of his works. Initial and later sentiments towards ""The Dog’s Notes"" often differ, which deeply impresses collectors. It is a feeling of humanity and caring spirit that no amount of external materials can replace. Interactivity is an attribute that Poren Huang conferred upon his ""The Dog’s Notes"" sculptures. Therefore, Poren Huang is very conscientious of the lines and block surfaces of each work, and so meticulous that he finds an error of 0.01% unacceptable. Hence even though his sculpturing studio is huge, he has no assistant. His does not allow the hands of others in his work. To ensure that his creations fully reflect his artistic thoughts and protect their artistry, he does all the work to ascertain that every piece of construction stems from his idea. Poren Huang creates simple external beauty to induce people to interact. However, he also deeply embeds internal beauty into his works so that when people eventually sense his work with their ""heart"" and no longer with their eyes, they will naturally overlook the amusing appearance. Indeed it is this inner, supreme touching of the spirit that constitutes the eternal value of art. The increased spiritual value that Poren Huang’s works give to collectors is boundless. However, the prerequisite is that they must feel and interact with their hearts for the spiritual wealth to come naturally. If the beauty of art is but superficial, it would be fleeting and fade quickly like fireworks. This is like a person who must be full of substance for others to want to continue interacting with him. The smile inducing and humor attributes of ""The Dog’s Notes"" are especially important in today’s modern society of repression and stress. There is no distance between the creation and its audience, which allows them to experience comfortable intimacy with the work and make art a part of their lives. Whether in media commercials or public figures, humor receives immediate favorable responses. Zero distance between art and life is an important evolutionary process of 20th-century art. Only by involving public participation can art be incorporated into living space and have the opportunity to touch people. Together with the advance in media, people are happy to share art that touches them, thereby accelerating the market visibility of art and creating an undersupply market value. Humorous art can elicit immediate positive feedback while depth remains an indispensable element that makes art indelible in history. The simplicity, innocence, guilelessness and sincerity of dogs are also featured in ""The Dog’s Notes"". Dogs selflessly follow their masters without demanding rewards. In contrast, perhaps due to living in an era of money and rights, people today secretly pit against each other, and such a fiercely competitive environment results in complicated human relationship that is secretive and calculating. Given such duplicity, people have developed more wariness and protective layers, depriving them of the ability to fully enjoy this transitory life, which in turn affects their families. Poren Huang’s ""Happy Time"", ""What the Heck!"" and ""Little Rascal"" are candid illustrations of innocence. Guilelessness, full enjoyment and contentment in people can alleviate the discrimination between them, and help them focus on the positive behavior of communication and exchanges, thereby creating a friendly atmosphere. Modern people can emulate a dog's sense of responsibility, which is a kind of non-selfish thinking. Modern people tend to make excuses, and care only about self-interest at the expense of others. In Poren Huang‘s ""Night Watch"" bronze sculpture, the moonlight reveals the dog patrolling diligently with steady steps, its body seemingly afloat on wings. In the ""You Cannot Pass!"" bronze sculpture, the extended claws and arched back reveal readiness to attack, and the completely taut and 100% responsible poise give the protected a sense of security, while ""Sticking to My Post"" and ""My Territory (3)"" model the strongest sense of responsibility. In Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes,"" regardless of dog or anthropomorphic forms, each creation is full of reassuring energy, vitality, and the capability of bearing the weightiest responsibility. Dogs do not judge by appearances, and do not deviate from their value even if their masters suddenly fall ill or lack food. The unshakable loyalty of dogs toward their masters is something that humans can use for self-evaluation. For families, this could be an anchor. Loyal people are naturally responsible, guileless and kind, and create meaningful value in life. Dogs learn from people. Dogs have long since adapted to human life, becoming socialized to live with and help people. The lives of dogs are short, but they are always spirited. Particularly when humans are in trouble, dogs erupt into courage to defend them and never leaving them for even a moment. Dogs are also human’s psychologists. When people are aggrieved or sad, they will always find their dogs welcoming them home them with absolute warmth and eagerness. Dogs also sense when their masters are upset, and will quietly stay at their side until their masters feel better. Dogs have already submitted to the lifestyle and emotional state of humans. They have accustomed themselves to become human’s best companion, and they remain happy and carefree in their short lives. Dogs are intelligent animals, and in Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"", they manifest their human characteristics, and seem dogs, yet humans. In Poren Huang’s works, the relationship between humans and dogs involves mutual learning. They are both friends and learning partners. Dogs have been socialized, and modern people should also emulate the superior qualities of dogs. ""The Dog’s Notes"" is consistently ""strong"". Each creation embodies strong features. For example, in ""Gimme a Hug"", ""My Territory (2)"" and ""21st Century"", the dogs do not exhibit any hint of fragility, but are full of confidence with heads held high gazing proudly into the sky. When Poren Huang started on ""The Dog’s Notes"", he was at a low point in his life; yet he cultivated an extraordinary spirit of vivaciousness, positiveness, optimism and courage. ""The Dog’s Notes"" is full of originality and purity, giving audience room for boundless imagination and opportunity for unlimited discussions. Perfect Presentation for International Artists In 2005, ""The Dog’s Notes"" was launched, and has since gathered numerous domestic and international collectors. Some collectors are attracted by the appearance of the work and others by their investment value, but they quickly become emotionally vested into their collection of ""The Dog’s Notes"", which subtly becomes their emotional sustenance. After a period of interacting with the works, some collectors who had frequently suffered anxiety found their anxiety alleviated, and experience inexplicably pleasure. Therefore ""The Dog’s Notes"" is often described as therapeutic art that produces psychological healing. Perhaps ""Contentment"" would explain that people who are easily satisfied with life and things find sleep easy. Sleep disorder is a common civilized disease, and getting a good night sleep has become a luxury. If a person can put aside all his worries and be content, happy will overflow, and sleep will be as easy as falling off a log. Artworks are not merely ornamental. For example, the paintings of Francis Bacon (1909-1992) and Lucian Michael Freud (1922-2011) are not popularly deemed beautiful, yet they have passed on through generations of history. ""Beauty"" is slowly uncovered through exploration. It is spiritual and eternal, and offers room for discussion and critique. Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"" are collected internationally. It is a common human artistic asset that knows no cultural or racial barrier, and has the ability to touch anyone in the global village. If a creative work can easily cross over racial barriers, it can wield considerable influence. Collectors from different countries interpret the ""New World"" bronze sculpture differently since no two individuals are alike, and every country or region has its own cultural background. Nevertheless, humans have common emotions and thoughts. A music that crosses ethnicity can connect with the entire human race. Likewise, a creation with no cultural barrier can traverse eras. The sculptures of Swiss artist, Alberto Giacometti (1909-1966) are not narratives of Swiss culture and society, but of all humanity. Hence they are not confined to geography, but attract a large market of collectors from all over the world, and in 2010, his art became the world's most expensive items in public auction. Based on dogs, ""The Dog’s Notes"" explores the lack of spirit and tolerance in the modern human, and offers an opportunity for the 7 billion people to be touched in their own way by the perspective in ""The Dog’s Notes"". Expository art does not offer only a single point of view, but is multi-directional to provide room for discussion. A monotonous topic will become ""stale"", and will naturally be replaced by works that offers more expositions. Poren Huang’s creations have inspired many Western advocates because they realize that the European and US environment can never produce such a unique style birthed by the artist’s cultural background. From the perspective of Western art history, several works used the dog as theme, but the works in ""Notes"" has an entirely new significance. Poren Huang has wholly absorbed his cultural background, and with that as his springboard, he naturally demonstrates a unique style. At the same time, he ponders the negative traits of humanity in contemporary society, and through his most familiar friend, the dog, he crafts his insights into a series of personified creations to explore sober issues in an entertaining way. ""The Dog’s Notes"" has great variability and diversity, where each piece of work bespeaks its own personality and story. From describing the characteristics of the dogs to their subsequent anthropomorphic forms, in bronze or stainless steel, coated or gold leafed, or in the relationship between dog and panda, the creations are quite exclusive, with only 4 pieces of work per year. Poren Huang uses modeling clay to create countless works each year, but on the average, only 4 creations are consummated into new bronze or stainless steel presentations while others are discarded. Each piece of creation displays the most prominent and unique of performance, yet none loses the required characteristic of ""The Dog’s Notes"", and specifically conveys Poren Huang’s artistic perspective of ""The Dog’s Notes"". The humorous, positive, highly interactive and highly educational attributes, and unique body proportions, lines and block structures clearly demonstrate Poren Huang’s special sculptural techniques. Room for Endless Discussions ""The Dog’s Notes"" promotes admirable traditional Chinese thinking. The doctrine of bringing the family into order is weaved throughout the series, emphasizing ethics. The traditional heritage of upholding resolute courage and confidence, and protecting one’s family and property to achieve broader development is applicable to contemporary human behavior. The sculptural technique is a compromise between traditional and contemporary. While almost perfectly conventional, it is also exaggerated in proportion and lends itself to dialogue with people today. If artistic concepts are presented only traditionally, they cannot relate to the lives of people today, and thus incapable of deeply touching its audience. On the contrary, if one is progressive merely for the sake of being progressive, then it is only an attempt at being conspicuous and grandstanding, and like a flash in the pan, quickly sizzles away. Each era of art must connect the past and the future, and the transformation must occur naturally rather than deliberately in order for the creation to remain pure and free of pretentiousness. Highly pure work has no expiration on its enjoyment, for it becomes spiritual and a source of support. Art that affords argument can be brought into the future; otherwise, it will remain contemporary and has no future value. After more than a century and a half, people are still discussing Pablo Ruiz Picasso (1881-1973) and Andy Warhol, (1928-1987) because their infinite room for discussion generates the need for discussion into future generations. Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"" series affords endless discussions and exploration. It is intimately connected to the people in today's world, and is a ""people"" related art. The artistic Poren Huang is singularly focused on creating pure art. His absorption allows his work to be completely original and thought provoking, and the philosophy of ""The Dog’s Note"" is consistently melded into each piece of his work. A talented artist coupled with a steadfast focus on creating births the opportunity for producing highly artistic work that has infinite room for discussion and everlasting historical value. Art is absolutely subjective. Everyone is a unique individual, and regardless of natural temperament or nurture, no two exactly identical persons can be found in the world. For a work of art to resonate with a person, it must be attuned with that person. ""The Dog’s Notes"" has been launched for 10 years, and has 40 pieces of work offering 40 different perspectives. Each creation has its supporter, which is quite estimable. Chinese art tends to repeat an idea over countless creations, resulting in great similarity among different works. By dispersing a creative force over multiple works, its power is diffused, resulting in the many creations lacking spirit and influence. Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"" tempers the ego. Forty creations represent 40 selves, though self-confidence and courage born of frustrations in a difficult environment remains the constant. However in striving to develop, positive personal qualities must be strengthened. The favorable personality of an artist will safeguard the artistry of each creation because his sense of responsibility will yield perfect creations that bestow upon collectors unparalleled spiritual wealth.  Art is spiritual, on which humans can lean. Poren Huang’s ""The Dog’s Notes"" has brought to countless people a joy that is unmatched by money and material."
16,A Look At The Past And Future Of The Tollywood Film Industry,arts-entertainment," The second largest film industry in India is located in Teluga and often referred to as Tollywood. Tollywood and its main competitor, Bollywood, are both nicknamed in reference to the American film giant Hollywood. The Teluga film industry has been around for quit some time. It's already over a century old and doesn't show any signs of slowing down anytime soon. A Look At Its Past. Most people agree that the rise of the Teluga world of cinema began in the early 1900's; 1912 to be exact. Silent films were all they could manage at the time, but it was a beautiful start to what would become one of the largest film industries in the world. Dialogue wasn't introduced until the release of Bhakta Prahlada, which was produced by a H.M. Reddy, a producer who already had experience directing Indian ""talkie"" films (a talkie is a film with dialogue).  Bhakta Prahlada was finished in 1931 and released in early 1932. Talkies quickly began taking over the film industry shortly thereafter. Lavakusa was the first huge success to come entirely from Teluga. At least in terms of commercial revenue. It was directed by C. Pullaiah and then released in 1934. It is Lavakusa that took the Teluga cinema industry to a new level and made it into something that still thrives to this day. Thanks to Lavakusa, not only was Teluga becoming a household name, but more film producers were beginning to move away from purely religious themes in their m ovies. There was a new curiosity in the film industry and the focus began shifting to political and social situations. The industry would see a lot of ups and downs over the following decades, especially in times of War. Other countries, including America, began learning of Tollywood films through the 40's and 50's. By the time the 80's arrived Tollywood was a film giant with few real competitors in the world. Those competitors have caused them to strive for more, always wanting to stand out and impress viewers. Doing so has gained them several world records and notable achievements. For example, Ramoji Film City is the largest film studio in the world. It started in 1996 and is over 1,600 acres. One of their studios even has a replica of the Mughal Gargens. Keeping Up With The Future. Tollywood is a very active film industry. There's a lot going on and if you love films, then they are definitely one of the industries you want to watch. Some argue they have more going on than their larger competitors because they are always trying to get ahead, which is great for viewers. The real question is how to keep up with it all. Luckily, the internet has made it easier for film buffs everywhere. The rising popularity of social media sites and sharing also makes gathering information faster Keeping up with the latest in Tollywood news, such as what the actors are doing or what movies are coming out next is easier than it's ever been."

18,Why The New No Nonsense Romance Novels May Also Appeal To You,arts-entertainment," Young Adult and New Adult Romance Novels are a booming genre.

Figures compiled by Neilsen Book Scan are even more dazzling: In 2014 more than 3 million books in the category were sold, compared to only 981,000 in 2006!  Whereas it is estimated that women buy up to 90%  of all adult romance books, Young Adult and New Adult romance books have managed to attract a considerable number of male readers. As a genre, Young Adult and New Adult Romance hasn't changed much over the years, because neither has the subject matter that appeals to the readers. The reason that romance is such an eye-catching genre, is because of the heart pounding thrills that drive the story. The road blocks, obstacles, and struggles that each of the characters must face to develop the love between them is an emotional trip that any reader would love to explore. The various sub genres: young adult, new adult and adult romance, are largely determined by the protagonists' age and aims at drawing readers in by having the main characters struggle through the same emotional issues as the reader before gaining the love which they set out for. The common theme in these novels are young people turning into adults and discovering love and the responsibilities of life. Typically, the main character in these books is a late teenage or early tween heroine who is trying to figure out who she is and wanting to fit in and be noticed. In the process, she is struggling with her emotions, and often getting into conflict with her environment. In the Young Adult Romance Novels, paranormal elements, dark forces (spirits, werewolves, vampires, zombies or whatever) and universal threats (extinction, plague, extra terrestrials) help to attract young readers. In the New Adult Romance Novels, the life phase focused on generally moves from an high school environment to college and transition to work. Paranormal elements appear less frequently and, if they do, are less important. Instead, the emphasis is on a more mature sexual experience and / or deeper psychological analysis and description. Inter racial and same sex relationships, as well as more controversial topics including poverty, addiction, criminal behaviour, rape, abuse, domestic violence and personality disorders are addressed in some novels. Adults used to be ashamed of admitting that they are reading Young Adult and New Adult Romance Novels. But not so anymore! Young adult fiction, thankfully, has conquered the literary recognition it deserves. And It's not just children who are reading these books! Industry experts estimate more than a third of them are actually bought by adults. It's no surprise these books are finding a growing audience: there are countless amazing young adult and new adult novels to choose from, and with promising novels coming out every month, chances are that once you have found one series you enjoyed, you too will return for more. There are plenty of good reasons why adults love these books. Actually, young adults often feel embarrassed to confess that they are reading Young Adult or New Adult books, whereas more adult readers have come to accept and appreciate the reasons why they love reading this kind of novels: There is something endearing, fresh, compelling and innocent about young love that makes it irresistible. Stories about young love are about starting the path towards becoming yourself. They are open minded, unpretentious, have a strong sense of hope, and take us to a period in life where imagination still reigns and cynicism isn't present yet. The characters are easily relatable: the main character's behavioural traits and goals mostly are clear from a very early stage in the story, allowing readers to communicate more openly, honestly and candidly with them than is possible in most adult novels. Since the theme is universal, we can draw from what is happening in the story and learn from the characters' behaviour and growth how to conquer problems in our own life. The stories have a clear plot: generally, you know what to expect when you start reading. In Young Adult novels, the protagonist, who is usually female, is going through a rough period and meets a bad boy. As the story evolves, a good boy enters the story and with time, she discovers that she's in love with him. But there are obstacles to overcome and misunderstandings to clear before the pair of them finally become an item and their love is accomplished. In New Adult novels, though the story is basically the same, you are likely to find more explicit sex scenes, thought monologues and flashbacks. Also, since the characters are usually older here, elements from their personal history may return on stage and complicate the plot. The first cut is the deepest. Teenagers have this capacity to love unconditionally. Their life is filled with new emotions, new perspectives, new dreams and new experiences and every decision has the potential of creating a totally different future. Because they are about a phase in life when everything is new and felt more intense, also the drama is more intense in Young and New Adult novels. To some adults, reality is a disappointment. They want to experience true love and, live all these emotions and believe in a happily ever after, but often can't. Reading about it is the next best thing and has the power to turn every day into a love story. Young Adult and New Adult Romance Stories are exciting and interesting because the reader knows they almost always end with a positive outcome. In general, good people who believe in and fight for their relationship will likely be rewarded, which offers hope and feeds optimism. Teens and young twens are still at the outskirts of society. They aren't really part of the system yet, which allows them to revolt and kick ass. As such, they remind us of our own ideals, which makes it easy to feel empathy for the characters and be empowered by them. Watching them grow and learn from their mistakes, makes us reconnect with our younger self, which makes the characters easy to root for. Parents and teachers may choose to read Young Adult and New Adult books to stay connected to their children or students. The novels provide an opportunity for escapism: There is nothing that makes you feel better than reading about people who become happy. You also know that any emerging problem can be easily solved by reading the story all the way to the end. Young Adult and New Adult Romance Stories are inspiring and empowering. In the life of a teen, every new event and decision has the capacity of creating new perspectives for a totally different future. In considering the possible consequences of the main characters' decisions, we enter a world with new morals and new choices that invite us to consider applying them to our own daily actions. They are good adventures, because traditionally the hero and heroine fall in love very soon, but have to conquer a lot of opposition and go through a roller-coaster of experiences and emotions before finally finding love in each other's arms. Stylish packaging and marketing helped them expand beyond their initial teen audience.

A difficult relationship. In the first novel, Young Love Part1: A Schoolyard Love Story, Sean and Katherine fall in love. Theirs is never an easy relationship. When Katherine doesn't agree with his life style, he realizes he will lose her unless he drastically changes his behaviour.

But maybe, once they go together again, Katherine will change her mind and not keep him to the expiration date she is putting forward? Are second chances really possible? Can recreating the past help the young couple to create a different future? And is Sean even willing to accept her terms?

""Young Love Part 2, First Love's Shadow"" is a gripping story in which the distance between lost and found is often less than a text line long. Relatable and no nonsense The success of the books is due to their simple, yet intricate storyline. This, in fact, is the kind of situation many young people go through. Young love, the loss of love, the internal struggle and the continued search for love are all captured beautifully in these novels, allowing readers to easily identify with the story's main characters. Life (especially life as a teenager) is rough at times, and novels offer the greatest of sanctuaries from reality. As I met and came to love people like Sean and Katherine, I realized that these novel characters do not only inspire us, but also remind us of the fact that we are not alone in our experiences. Reference In his Young Love novels, Dean Amory chronicles the hero's life through the thrills, heartbreaks, joy and despair of the final years in high school and the consecutive transition to a labour environment. YOUNG LOVE  is a wonderful contemporary romance.  Dean Amory does an excellent job at at giving us humor and characters that have depth, and portraying love, heartbreak and fate in this great coming-of-age story.  He gives us the thoughts and musings of young adults, and shows us that in a world seemingly without a cure, there is always hope in one form or another. Dean Amory is a master at writing characters that come alive on the page.  The emotional tension between Sean and Katherine  is beautifully written. You really get a good sense of what both characters are feeling.   The sweetness of young love.  The anguish of regret.   The sadness of time lost.   Not only did I fall in love with Sean and Katherine, but I really enjoyed watching Sean struggle to become the person he wanted to be and remain honest and consequent, even when his decisions came with an obvious cost. I don’t know about you, but I totally love high school romance stories, especially when they involve young people trying to become the best they can.  I highly recommend this book.   It’s a wonderful read, and it leaves you with a sigh and a smile."
19,How To Play Excellent Lead Guitar Licks & Solos By Developing Better Musical Creativity,arts-entertainment," Do you know many guitar licks, scales and arpeggios but still can’t play very creatively? If so, you are not alone – many guitarists are in the same boat. However, you shouldn’t make the same mistake as them. Don’t waste your time trying to learn as many new licks/scales/etc. as possible... this will NOT make you a more creative player. The problem with this approach is that it leaves many holes in your guitar playing and never addresses the real reasons why your creativity is not improving. Certainly it is important to learn new things for your guitar playing, however, the true keys to musical creativity are as follows: fluency, application, integration and total mastery of the guitar skills you are already familiar with. The following are the four things you must begin developing in order to become a highly creative lead guitarist: Beginner guitarists think that ""learning the fretboard"" means simply memorizing the note names on the frets of each string. This is why so many players get lost while trying to improvise guitar solos. Good guitar players visualize the fretboard in scale shapes and learn to play or create guitar licks in one scale shape at a time. While this is better than being totally lost about what notes to play, this approach results in boring and very repetitive guitar solos. Great guitar players learn to visualize any scale across the ENTIRE fretboard. When they improvise lead guitar licks and solos, they don’t divide the fretboard into isolated chunks or shapes - they see the entire fretboard as one big scale pattern - from the first fret to the last. If you’d like to achieve this level of freedom in your guitar playing, practice playing the scales you are most familiar with all over the fretboard. Don’t feel like you are in a hurry to discover new scales until you have fully mastered the scales you currently use. Warning: Even if you memorized all the shapes of a certain scale, it doesn't mean that your level of mastery with that scale is advanced enough to be creative. You must also practice creating guitar licks that will challenge your fretboard visualization awareness - forcing you to expose and improve upon your limitations. Watch the video below to see a demonstration that proves this point (and shows you how to truly master visualizing scales on guitar): To play creative lead guitar solos, you MUST understand which notes to use over any chord/backing track/song, as well as how to express specific emotions in your guitar phrases. Here are three approaches you can use right now to improve in this area: *Work together with an experienced guitar teacher who can help you understand which notes should be played over a certain chord and how to apply this knowledge creatively in your guitar playing. *Rather than playing guitar phrases that simply ""go with the chord"", think more about creating strong emotions while soloing. There is a big difference between these two approaches and will drastically change the way your lead guitar phrases sound. *Focus on HOW you play the notes, rather than on what notes you play. To get more emotion from each note, enhance it using vibrato, bends, slides or other creative phrasing techniques. To test and see how well you can do this, take a minute to finish this free lead guitar creativity assessment. If you are lacking in aural skills, you simply cannot know how something will sound before you play it with your hands. This will make it impossible to know the emotion a note will create before you play it – making true creativity nearly unattainable. Here are a few easy ways to begin developing better aural skills in your guitar playing: *Observe the levels of musical tension created in different note choices by playing a variety of lead guitar phrases over the same chord. For example, record yourself playing an A minor chord over and over for 1-3 minutes. Next, improvise a variety of lead guitar phrases over it using the A natural minor scale, while holding out different notes over the chord. As you emphasize different notes of the scale over the same chord, focus on how the level of musical tension of your phrases builds and releases. As you improve with this, do this assignment with new chords and scales. *When working on scales, play them at a slower speed and sing every other note rather than playing it on the fretboard. *Play guitar phrases by fingering a handful of notes on the guitar, then sing the remaining part of the phrase (and vice versa). Working on developing your guitar skills in isolation from one another may help you improve those particular skills, however, this approach will NOT help you become a better overall guitarist. Why? Becoming a creative lead guitarist requires integrating all of your skills together.

20,What You Did Not Know About Photography,arts-entertainment," People have many memories in their minds. Since they were born, they have seen various things, people, animals, physical and relief features. However, memories fade with time as new ones appear. The new ones replace the old ones. But they wish they have these memories to carry along all the life. But what they wish is very possible. They just need to take photographs of the things they would like to remember. Then they can always refer to their photograph albums and have those memories back. Photography is growing drastically Amateurs use photography to keep various memories. The memories they preserve include favorite moments, special times, and wonderful scenes among others. These memories once stored, they can be used in future to communicate messages, entertain and to narrate stories. Photography is growing drastically. Advancement in technology has opened several avenues in photography today, and there are cameras that capture these memories anywhere and at any time. Mobile phone companies have designed various brands of mobile phones which have inbuilt digital cameras. Light is the basis of photography Photography is dependent on light. In fact, any one taking photographs have to consider the light factor as he or she takes photographs. The intensity of right determines the quality of photographs taken. The outcome of photography (photographs) can be affected by the amount of light available during the photo session. For instant, images may appear dark and sometimes not definite if the intensity of light was low. On the hand, the image may be blurred if there was too much of light during the process of photography. Light is the basis of photography. Since the invention of cameras, and up to now, light has continued to be the key to the conversion of captured images in to real images that can be priced. Pursue a career, a hobby or the two at once The art of photography is very popular. People who practice this art either pursue a career, a hobby or the two at once. Therefore, they should not be intimidated or bullied as was the case street photography where there are cases of harassment to photographers. Aspect of structure and syntax Photography is more of a language than an art. As compared is a language, photography has the aspect of structure and syntax. As in the case of a language, there exist many methods to learn how to use it. Therefore if you choose to practice photography have enough time to learn it so that you can enjoy every bit of it. Making a living Photography has become a way to make a living. In fact, it is one of the many businesses with gaps that appear just any where. For example, there are opportunities for photography in the streets, homes, schools, churches burials just to mention but a few. Photography has been a rewarding investment to those who know where and when to capture images. People are making a lot of money from timely shots taken at so-called strategic places. Photographs exhibited at major galleries and fairs prove just how valuable photography is. These photographs attract many people, and they have to part with large sums of money to carry them home with them."

1,Happy Days Are Here Again,arts-entertainment," It, at one time, was a big deal; all lit-up and busy, out where the rich folks lived.  Huge, enormous white columns on the front porch with big oak slab doors that you could see going by on the river; people buzzing about; cars and carriages going up, down and about the oh-so-fancy circular driveway.  They even had Paul Whiteman‘s orchestra perform at a party in the '20s. Now, the gigantic three-story red brick house just sits empty and deserted, surrounded by weeds, at the far east end of town. It’s just some big former residence with every-which-way cross boards that used to be shutters.  But they’ve been painted over dark green so many times, maybe that’s what made them all sag, droop and come off their hinges.  It seems now that only the layers and layers of paint hold them together.  In its day, it was quite the showplace, all gleaming and bright; but now, after surviving several floods and many, many years, of sitting empty, it just looks like an incredibly old, big, chipped-paint, abandoned, crumbling mortar, once-upon–a-time ""lived-in"" house. The locals warn you to keep your distance from it; it might be haunted or at least their tales of the goings-on in the late 1920s and 1930s could make you think the last residents didn’t end up happy.—in fact it must have seemed like the world was going to hell in a hand basket. Of course, the biggest thing in the United States was ""Black Thursday,"" the big Stock Market crash of ‘29 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting rock bottom.  The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, Al Capone, the Great Depression, unemployed war veterans, the Lindbergh baby kidnapped, yellow fever, World War II; there’s only so much cheer that Burns and Allen, ""Babe"" Ruth, Walt Disney, the Gershwin brothers and Cole Porter can bring.  The song may have promised Happy Days Are Here Again but they weren’t. Mr. and Mrs. Gray and their kids were the last ones to live there in the '20s and '30s.  The Grays lost almost everything, when the Stock Market crashed in 1929.  Mr. Gray kept his head above water for several years, tried to take Franklin Roosevelt’s advice, ""When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.""  He wasn't old enough to develop a necessary thick enough skin.  It all got to be too much; after he lost the house to the county for unpaid and back taxes, he went out to the horse shed, crawled up on a table, made a noose, tied the rope to a rafter and put the other end over his head.  Then the damned fool fell.  It was just too messy a site for a determined suicide victim.  The table was knocked over; he’d obviously kicked at everything around him.  It sure wasn’t somebody going into that sweet goodnight.  The county’s coroner called it a suicide but what if he changed his mind at the last second? Since then it’s been empty; the county tried to sell it.  But during the Depression, nobody could afford it, and then, later, after World War II, when folks could afford it, the house was too run down and needed way too many repairs for people to want it.  Why wasn’t it torn down?  Somebody-not sure who-paid all the back taxes so it’s been stuck in legal limbo and estate fights ever since. At night, kids swear they’ve seen a candle light wandering from one room to another all over the second floor.  The house was the first one in the county to be electrified in the late 1800s but a candle is more dramatic.  Besides, the electric was cut off years and years ago.  The ""ghost"" can only be seen at night.  I always thought it was just a scary story; I went to see for myself.  It’s not a shy ""ghost.""  He/she’ll wait for folks to draw a crowd.  A bunch of us kids used to gather on the riverbank; ""Now, look up at the windows on the middle floor.""  Sure enough, a small light appeared, visible through the grimy windows in the 2nd floor on the left, and slowly rambled from room to room where the kids’ bedrooms were.  The children that used to be in the rooms are now dead or about 80 years old.  Seventy five or so years can play hell with a house. The riverbank was close as anyone would get to the residence.  No one wanted to actually go inside but almost every noise in or around the house was blamed on the ""ghost."" In the mid-'70s, the ""haunted house"" is bought by some widow-woman who really just wants it for the acreage and the house’s base because even though the run-down house is a sight, its basic foundation is sound so, like something from The Godfather, she goes to the estate manager and makes him an offer he can’t refuse.  She directs the contractor to do a thorough gutting of everything left in the old house—plumbing, electric, fixtures—then turns the architect loose.   (It seems that, her late husband, a doctor,  left her pretty well-off.   Like a 1970s version of Sarah Winchester).  In a lot of ways, it’s a sad sight to see all that old brick all covered over by the bright, white aluminum siding.   Like the school or bridge, it’s nice to know they’re there even if they’ve gotten beat up or old. But a ghost occupies a space or area, not a particular dwelling.  Be it an old brick mansion or a gleaming ""new"" house really doesn’t matter.  An older place can seem spookier but a newer one works just as well. It isn't a mean and threatening ghost or poltergeist; oh, sure, there is one account of the 'ghost' biting a guy, sending the fella running, near-nekkid, hollerin' and screamin' into the night but there's no bite scars or even red marks. ""Damn thing bit me!"" But the man that told it is known to really like his marijuana so the story's source isn't exactly what you might call reliable. This newest ghost merely likes to stack furniture on the dining room table, empty cupboards and open the front door at odd hours, walk with lighted candles and fart (and boy that'll sure open up your sinuses; that's one time when ""smeller's the feller"" doesn't apply) so unless you're June Cleaver or Miss Manners, you won't be too put-off by the shenanigans."
2,Creating an inexpensive photography studio,arts-entertainment," Let’s face it: the thought of taking an existing space and converting it into a studio can be daunting to say the least! As a newborn photographer, a studio is an absolute necessity. But creating the studio without spending a fortune (I’m talking gagillions of dollars here…gagillions) led me on a path that had very little instruction, so I had to blaze my own trail, getting creative along the way! A LITTLE BACKGROUND Hi! I’m Elizabeth. Owner of Elizabeth Moore Photography based out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I married my wonderful husband last year and had to uproot, re-locate, and re-brand my business. As many of you photographers who have gone through this know, this can be a business killer! THE STUDIO Moving to a new area outside of my old reach was tough. I’d be lying if I said it was a smooth transition. However, one amazing moment led to another once I started working on converting a spare bedroom into my studio. As a newly married couple, money was tight, so everything purchased had to go a LONG way. The spare room started as a pretty standard 10 x 12 – white walls, two windows, and carpet (which led to a problem, more on the carpet later). My studio had to have different flooring choices, numerous backdrops that were able to be quickly and easily changed out, and the studio had to be able to accommodate a lighting system. How the HECK am I going to do all of this in 120 sq. feet!? Cue my husband, who has an engineer brain, who figured out inexpensive work-around tactics that actually work BETTER than the expensive stuff! LIGHTING This will probably be the most expensive single purchase in your studio. I knew I needed at least three lights: an overhead, and two fill lights on 45-degree angles. There are a million options out there for this kind of ""kit"", but I have tried and tested about a half dozen of them until I found the one that blended quality with value the best: The CowboyStudio 2275 Watt lighting kit. studio-on-a-budget-02 If you’re looking for a lighting kit that that can be transported all over God’s creation, then this kit is probably NOT for you (I haven’t had any issues in my studio, but the kit may not survive being moved around constantly), but for a permanent starting studio these are just good enough! The option to turn on each individual bulb on the fill lights is awesome, and gives you customizable light for your situation! Here’s my two hacks: For the overhead light, you need counter-weight to go in the bags. I use 4 cans of the on-sale soup from the grocery store…cheap and heavy. Go purchase fluorescent bulbs with color temperatures between 3500-5000k for that natural ""soft daylight"" look. The 5500k bulbs the kit comes with put out too sterile of light for me, but everyone is different! Lets break down the lighting cost: Lighting Kit — $230.00 Soup Cans Counterweights – 4 for $1.00 Replacement bulbs – 10 @ $8.00 a piece. Total: About $310.00 BACKDROP SYSTEM I specialize in photographing newborns, toddlers, and older children. Because of this, I have extremely limited time to be changing out backdrops and need to be able to do it quickly and easily. Luckily, there’s an inexpensive solution for this, also from Cowboy Studio: Three-roller wall mounting backdrop support system. Side note: Fotodiox also has an almost exact system, which you can find on Amazon. However, I can’t speak for its quality, as I haven’t used it! The little plastic chains are surprisingly easy to use, and work pretty well, even with heavy backdrops! Also, DO NOT forget to use large wall anchor screws to mount the backdrop system. No one needs embarrassment with a client, or worse: a lawsuit, because of a mounting system that pulls out of the drywall and falls. Simply mount the two ends of the wall mount system a little farther distance apart as your largest backdrop’s width. If your largest backdrop is 6 feet wide, set the distance between mounts to be 6.5 feet apart. If you might be expanding to larger backdrops later on, make sure to keep that in mind when you mount the system, as it’s FAR easier to easier to accommodate smaller backdrops than larger ones in the future. BACKDROP SUPPORT Speaking of the backdrop system, you also need to figure out how to hang your backdrops! This is where the crafty part comes in! The manual for the mounting system suggests using PVC or aluminum tubes as the cross bars to support the weight. I HIGHLY recommend PVC tubes. Luckily, I did the trial-and-error already, so you don’t have to! PVC dimensions: 2"" diameter Charlotte Pipe from any hardware store . Usually these come in 10ft. long segments, which you will need a handsaw or power tool to cut to the proper length. If you can find a store that will charge you by the foot, you will save some money. I had to buy one pipe for each backdrop, since my cut size was 6 feet in length (which meant 4’ of pipe was discarded). How to mount the backdrops you ask? Simple! I used carpet tape from any hardware store. Both sides of the tape are sticky, with powerful adhesive, so you can hang anything from heavy vinyl to light paper backdrops without worrying about it peeling off. I found that using two strips of the carpet tape next to each other gives the best hold. BACKDROPS With this set-up, you can literally use anything as a backdrop. Wallpaper, construction paper, fabric, vinyl, muslin, and even carpet! You can find rolls of paper at local craft stores (great for seamless wall to floor backdrops). I just rolled the paper off the cardboard tube it comes with and onto the PVC tube! Also, vinyl is actually much cheaper in craft stores than it is online. We ran into a snag while using the paper and fabric backdrops. How can you keep the material weighted down to prevent curling or wrinkling of the material? The answer came with steel rods! You can pick up these at hardware stores…just find the proper weight and length to match your material. Fold up the bottom couple inches of whatever material you’re using, use carpet tape to adhere it and create a ""pocket"" for the rod to slide in, and BOOM you’re done. You now have a weighted bottom to your backdrop to ensure little/no wrinkling, no curling, and a smooth roll-up and roll-down of the material! Lets break down the backdrop system cost: Mounting System — $60.00 Wall Anchors & Screws — $5.00 PVC supports — $7.00 each Carpet tape roll — $9.00 each Backdrops – Varying costs (Vinyl was $20.00 for 2 yards each with coupon) Total: $100 + depending on amount of backdrops FLOORING Originally, I thought that this part of the studio project would be the most expensive. My old studio had beautiful wood floors, which were awesome for shoots. Unfortunately, my new space had carpet, and I mean bottom-of-the-barrel-cheap type of stuff. I thought I was going to have to purchase wood flooring and put it together piece-by-piece, but luckily my hubby found an amazing solution! Remember vinyl flooring? That stuff that a few years ago looked so unbelievably hideous, and you would probably only use it for a mudroom or for the flooring of a camping trailer? Well, what used to be ugly has done some growing up! Vinyl nowadays comes in such a variety that you can find exactly what you want, even wood floor imitators…and it actually looks like REAL wood! My husband went to the local discount flooring warehouse and snatched up some clearance items that had already been cut down from the full-size. Because of this, I was able to get 4 different 6 foot wide sheets of ""wood"" vinyl for less than 100 bucks! After cutting the sheets of vinyl to size, I actually had enough leftover to make a few backdrops too, one of which is long enough to be a seamless backdrop. One problem with carpet underneath: when someone steps on the vinyl, the carpet pushes down, which gives a ""sunken"" look up on top. Solution: Plywood squares! We found these great connecting squares of plywood that have traction bottoms. You can buy just enough to fit the size of your space, and they’re cheap! With this set-up, I can quickly and easily interchange flooring options for all of my clients. They can request one or two different flooring choices, and I just have those two options laying on top of each other! Lets break down the flooring Cost: 4 discount vinyl floors — $95.00 2×2 Plywood connecting flooring squares – 9 @ $6.00 each (makes 6×6 foot square) Total: $150 with four flooring options BONUS: Baseboard Molding Hack: My shooting style includes a bit of seamless backdrops and also ones with flooring/backdrop combos. I wanted baseboard moldings to imitate a real wall. Obviously, you have to fake this with no actual wall since you’re using a hanging backdrop. The solution was pretty…interesting. But it was definitely a cool fix! Once you buy your baseboards and cut them to length, you’ll need to attach an L-bracket to each end of the baseboard with superglue (for maximum hold). The baseboard will want to tip forward at this point because of the top heaviness. To fix this you need to add counter-weights. My husband’s ingenious cheap solution: Steel nuts! You can buy these for virtually nothing at any hardware store. Just superglue and stack them as high as you need to counter the weight of the baseboard. Once you’re done, you should have a freestanding baseboard that can just push up against the backdrop, imitating a real wall! lets break the Baseboard Cost (though this is not mandatory and is definitely my style): 2 baseboards — $20.00 Bag of L-brackets — $5.00 Bag of 25 Nuts — $5.00 Total: $30.00 PROPS As a photographer who specializes in newborns and children, I’ve accumulated ROOMS of props. Yes, I’m using rooms as a unit of measurement! You can spend a fortune on buying props specifically made for photographers. Or, you can save a fortune by visiting local garage sales, antique outlets, and flea markets. For example, I found this absolutely stunning used saddle for about 10 bucks at an antique flea market. It took about 20 minutes (and a whole roll of paper towels) to clean it up, but it was totally worth it! Also, many newborn photographers will splurge on a legitimate baby poser beanbags. These are specifically designed to help bring the best out of your shots! I recently purchased one of these myself as my business has grown, but did you know you can accomplish almost the same thing for a fraction of the cost? Meet the Wal-Mart beanbag. For those of you outside of the US, Wal-Mart is this magical place where you can find any product you can imagine, for cheap. This includes beanbag furniture, where you can pick up a small beanbag chair for less than 20 bucks. When the beanbag arrives, you will need to add more ""fluff"", so I bought an extra bag of beans, which gave me the perfect firmness I needed! A couple of microphone stands I picked up at a flea market, a curtain rod between the two, and some clamps will attach your blankets/cloth so you can drape it over the bag. DONE. You have a perfect newborn poser with a simple, easy, and cheap backdrop system. Lets look at the props costs: Props Cost — $50.00 Beanbag poser — $18.00 Extra ""beans"" — $16.00 Mic stands — $20.00 Curtain rod — $10.00 Blankets/cloth — $20.00 Total: $134.00 IT’S A WRAP I hope after reading this, you’ve gotten ideas as to how it’s possible to have your very own studio. You CAN do it yourself, and you accomplish it without breaking the bank! Of course, everyone’s situation is different…maybe you need to add more in the budget for additional backdrops, or perhaps you already have a lighting kit. Either way, the total budget for this project will change for you and my estimates should be used as guidance, not rule. Here is breakdown of the entire studio cost: Lighting — $310.00 Backdrops (system, supports, materials) — $100.00 + Flooring — $150.00 Baseboards — $30.00 Total: ~$600.00 (more depending on the amount of backdrops you have) And for the newborn photographer: Studio: $600.00+ Props/posers/blankets — $134.00 Total: $734.00+ With just a few booked sessions, I have already paid for my new studio with all the props I need. The best part? I can actually call this space ""mine"", and know that my own sweat, hard-work, and determination helped create my very own photography studio complete with everything I need for even the messiest situations…. Best of luck to you!"

4,Hidden In the Stars,arts-entertainment," Have you ever taken the time to look up? Not at the ceiling but at the beautiful night sky. Those sparkly shimmering lights are not Unidentified Flying Objects but stars, our awe-inspiring galaxy. The Milky Way is the derived name for our barred spiral galaxy, yes it does sound like a little ice-cream float however it is about 100-400 billion stars, roughly 100,000-180,000 light years in diameter. It is a tough pill to swallow when you allow yourself to truly think about how much bigger our 'sky' now appears. Now think about how cosmically profound the existence of other planets are. Hyperventilating yet? Before you grab that paper bag and start chanting your 'happy place' song, take the time to acknowledge that ""the only thing to fear is fear itself"". There is a blissful quality to ignorance, wrap foil around your head (so the aliens cannot read your mind), sit and wait for an invasion or buy a telescope and empower yourself with celestial knowledge. Tele-what? Well, you can enjoy the star-lit sky with the naked eye basking in the romantic illusion of whimsy but if you want to accurately gauge the fathomless depths of the heavenly bodies above then you need the proper tools. A telescope is an optical instrument intended to make obscure objects appear larger than life using either, the refracting telescope method: which uses lenses or the reflecting telescope method: which uses mirrors, to garner and converge light. Take a journey that will blow your mind as you view the world through the eye of your telescope and learn about your home outside your home. One such mind-blowing nugget happens on the 6th June 2015 which is a celestial event of note: The planet Venus will be at its Greatest Eastern Elongation. Venus, contrary to popular belief, is not where woman come from even if it is a scorching hot and temperamental planet, the irony is sheer coincidence. Venus is a light reflecting planet also known as the morning or evening 'star', the second planet from the sun and as big as the earth, size being the only common denominator. When a Venus year is calculated in our time it is approximately 243 days long and it rotates slowly on its axis in the opposite direction to the earth. This planet reflects orange and appears bright because the surface is wrapped in between 28-43 miles of sulphuric acid (car battery acid) clouds. The surface of the waterless planet is lava-like rock and the extreme temperatures are amplified by Carbon Dioxide which is the gas that confines heat from the sun. Add the atmospheric pressure to Venus that's 90 times stronger than the earths and you will have a 'hell' of a time. Seriously wouldn't you love to get a glimpse of this planet? Obviously from the safety of your own home, that is unless you have a death wish and a rocket ship. The hype of the celestial event on the 6th June 2015 is all about getting a decent look at Venus, either through a refracting telescope or a reflecting telescope instead of just wishing you worked at NASA. Venus at Greatest Eastern Elongation sounds complicated but just means that the orbital path of Venus to the sun is at the perfect angle to be viewed by the avid star gazer on Earth at sunset. So go on, check out telescope reviews for good telescopes then immerse yourself in astronomy instead of your problems and find purpose within the stars."

7,How To Build A Large Model London Double Decker Bus From Scratch,arts-entertainment," ARTICLE FOR LONDON DOUBLE DECKER BUS By David Wilson My name is David Wilson. At Johnnywood Studios I custom build many models like this to use in my 3-D books entitled- ""Lucky and the Supernaturals 3-D"" for the ultimate in realism. On occasion I restore models to original condition as well depending on my needs. Before attempting to build such a large scale model like this I normally do a few online searches and download some pictures to get ideas. Considering that I might want to duplicate this bus, I also made ""templates"" or ""plans"" using poster board for all the parts. This LARGE 1/10th scale London Double Decker Bus was built completely from scratch out of plywood and has a few metal parts such as: the axles and the hand rail. This bus features a ""curved staircase"" made of cardboard which took an entire day to create. There are many bench seats made of plywood along with a detailed a driver’s cockpit in this London bus. The dimensions of this bus are:  LONG- 24 inches: HIGH- 14 inches: WIDE- 10 inches. There was, massive amounts of measuring, cutting, gluing, filling and sanding involved with this project and it took two weeks to complete. A belt sander turned upside down was used for shaping and forming the plywood. A piece of curved cardboard was used for a portion of the roof at the rear. Lot’s of ""wood filler"" was used to fill in cracks and seams in this model bus. Both the very top roof and the lower part of the roof are removable for access and displaying action figures inside. The wheels were cut out of thicker wood and were drilled, formed, shaped and painted black. The graphics on this, bus such as; the signs were printed by a computer and then glued on using tacky glue. I primed this vehicle using spray can enamel primer and I used several coats of red enamel for the top coat. The yellow stripe was masked and then sprayed with enamel paint. The interior was sprayed with grey primer and the lower rear step portion was sprayed with silver enamel. Clear ""glass"" was installed using thin plastic sheets cut and glued to the inside for added realism. Long wooden ""skewers"" were cut, painted and used for some of the hand rails. Overall this ""London Double Decker Bus"" turned out great! The fit and finish of this model surpassed my expectations. I think this model will do well in my stories wouldn’t you agree?! I’d like to manufacture this toy London Bus by an American toy company because I’m sure there are lots of kids that would enjoy playing with an awesome model like this! Of course I recommend that people wear the proper protective gear such as: respirators, gloves, goggles and other safety equipment when building any model. To view this amazing London Bus that I built completely from scratch visit my website. To find out more information concerning the building and modifying of models like this, visit my website and purchase my e-report entitled ""Johnnywood Studios 3-D Modeling Secrets."" It’s only $1 and I’m sure you’ll find lots of information to help you with your next modeling project. Sincerely, David Wilson"
8,How To Build an Awesome Spaceship Model From Cardboard,arts-entertainment," ARTICLE FOR PANDA THE GIANT MUSHROOM By David Wilson My name is David Wilson. At Johnnywood Studios I build many models like this from scratch to use in my 3-D books entitled- ""Lucky and the Supernaturals 3-D"" for the ultimate in realism. Since, I was unable to find anything that resembles this large spaceship I was forced to build it from scratch. So, I utilized a common material that is also free and it is ""cardboard."" People discard this strong, readily available material that is made from trees everyday. Cardboard is fairly easy to cut, bend and bond. I recommend using a metal straight edge or a metal ""square"" and a carpet knife. I also suggest using another piece of cardboard underneath the piece you are cutting and also wearing leather gloves. Using the right tools ""Panda"" is the very first model of this size that I ever attempted to create. The clear glass is from a popcorn maker top that I purchased at a thrift store. After some measuring and cutting I simply glued the glass into place and used automotive ""pin stripes"" around the edges for a more professional appearance. The curved edges for the ""wings"" were traced using a large clothes basket. The cardboard pieces were cut and bonded together using wood glue. I also used thin, one inch masking tape to cover up the ""seams"" on this spaceship. Many primer coats were sprayed on before the ""white"" enamel spray paint was applied. The three ""landing pads"" are plastic model display stands that I just happened to have three of but, other items can be used as well for these landing feet. There are several other parts for this spaceship that were hand crafted such as: the deep space sleeping pods, which were made from cutting a plastic potato chip container in half. I cut a square piece of cardboard and covered it with some vinyl for the interior bed. The two halves of this pod open and close because I glued on some paper strips to act as hinges. I made two sleeping pods and painted them silver without using any primer. The interior of this spaceship also contains other details such as: two captain’s chairs covered in black vinyl with real working arm rests for enhanced realism. The dash is also covered in black vinyl for realism purposes. This ship also contains a working winch and detailed dashboard space flight controls as well. Making the spaceship’s ""elevator"" was a bit tricky and looking back I wish I had made it from a thicker and more, sturdy material. But, this passenger elevator that this ship sits upon contains an L.E.D. light which makes for great night photography. This custom elevator stand also contains a keyhole for my character’s key and custom ladder along with a handrail. Since, Panda transforms into ""Pandaprize"" in some of my epic comedy stories I decided to build some extra ""jet engines"" for the rear of this model. This piece is also constructed out of cardboard which took some measuring, cutting, gluing and painting. In the center of this model I also installed a bracket of sorts with a string. This allows Panda to be ""hung"" from above for photography purposes to simulate flight. Installing a few L.E.D. lights on the inside of this model also enhances night photography as well. The dimensions for this cool Panda spaceship are: LENGTH without engines- 22.5 inches, with engines- 27 inches. The HEIGHT of Panda is: 7.5 inches and sitting on the stand is- 13 inches. The WIDTH is 20 inches. Overall this ""Panda"" model turned out great and is an example of what can be done with cardboard, patience and some work. I think this model will do well in my stories wouldn’t you agree?! I’d like to manufacture this toy ""Panda"" model by an American toy company because I’m sure there are lots of kids that would enjoy playing with an awesome model like this! Of course I recommend that people wear the proper protective gear such as: respirators, gloves, goggles and other safety equipment when building any model. To view this wonderful spaceship visit my website.

9,"How to photograph a wedding, for beginner wedding photographers!",arts-entertainment," I'm super excited to share this with you, a full overview, behind the scenes, what goes on, the fun stuff, the stressful stuff, what needs to be prepared and basically just a really awesome summary of the whole day, start to end. Wedding are a serious matter, the real deal and you don't get any second chances. That's why you need to be prepared, organised and know your stuff! So, let's set the scene: you have booked the wedding a year ago, regularly communicated with the couple throughout the year, had a pre wedding meeting to go through the timeline of the day and all other details (I'll go through this in detail in another post), and now the time has come, tomorrow is the wedding day!... Day before the Wedding: There is a little bit of work that needs to be done before the wedding day, not much, but just enough so you can wake up stress free and ready to rock here is a little checklist that I do the day before EVERY wedding! Text the bride telling her how excited I am to be shooting her wedding and basically just checking in (so she knows I'm 100% coming!). Gather all my gear and make sure camera batteries are charging, flash batteries are charging, quickly clean my lenses and clear all my cards. Double check the schedule and refresh my memory about where I'm going and what I'm doing. These days 99% of the time I find I have already shot at the locations or venues so this does not require much prep, but back in the day I used to do a recce and plan out the whole shoot, shot by shot, pose by pose. Check the GPS so I know how long it takes me to get to my first destination. I always like to rock up 5 mins early as I feel it just sets me up for an awesome day! Make sure the car has petrol in it. I don't like stressing about this on shoot day. Morning of the Wedding: Alright, we are up, super excited and it's time to get moving! I usually start the day with a massive breakfast to keep me as full as possible for as long as possible. Everyone is different, but I can get seriously 'hangry' when I don't eat and can get a little grumpy! So on that note, I ALWAYS BRING FOOD WITH ME on the day. I meet so many photographers and videographers that don't eat all day and I seriously don't know how they function! As I'm running around all day on high alert and high energy, I like to graze all day while driving between locations and stay hydrated. OK, time to get moving! Last checklist before we are on our way: Gear is packed and in the car. Double check that everything is there and batteries and cards are back in the camera bag and not still charging in the house! Lunch is packed and in the esky! Dressed to impress, looking professional ready for a wedding. Imaging yourself as a guest, make sure you dress the part! In my company, no jeans, t-shirts or anything else that looks sloppy. You're representing yourself and your brand, make sure you look good! Make sure you have all your paperwork. I use an amazing cloud based studio diary system called Tave. Seriously couldn't run my business without it (more about that in another post) OK, lets go! Groom Coverage (45 mins - 1 hour) It's time to put my game face on and nail the groom coverage. The second I walk in the door, I'm smiling, I introduce myself to everyone (within reason, some big European weddings might have 50+ guests already partying!!), make sure the groom is happy and relaxed, and start building rapport with everyone important, inc Mum, Dad and bridal party. Half the job is making sure everyone likes you and feels comfortable around you. If you can nail that, then taking the pictures will be sooo much easier! I briefly just want to touch on what to shoot, but I will also go into way more detail about this in a future post. Although photography is a very creative industry and some photographers like to just 'wing it' on the day, I personally like to stick to a very specific, systematic shot list that I've developed to make sure all my bases are covered and nothing important is forgotten. Especially because 9 out of 10 times I'm shooting to create a wedding album, so I need to make sure I have the coverage so I can fill the album and hopefully more. So, back to it, I always start with the details, rings, cufflinks etc. This gives me time to chill out, suss out the surroundings and gives the boys a little extra time to get ready. Once the details are done, I find the prettiest room in the house with the best lighting and least distractions in the background (photographer with their back to a window) and the fun begins! In a nutshell I always shoot the following: Natural Light Shooting Indoors (again most of the time with my back to a window) Details Boys getting ready Combos with groomsmen and individuals Spend a little bit of time getting portraits of the groom A 'cheers' series with some beer, scotch or whatever their poison! Family shots, all different combos Video Light Shooting Indoors (close the curtains, turn off the ceiling lights and create some mood) Fun shots of all the boys trying to be cool! Portraits of the groom Outdoors Walking shots More silly combos having fun If there is time I will also pull out my Elinchrom Quadra and take some commercial/fashion style shots too Business Tip This may seem like a lot but like I said earlier, most of the time I'm designing a wedding album and ideally each new scene is an additional double page spread in their wedding album, and ideally again, hopefully the images are so ridiculously awesome that they couldn't possibly remove them from their album! From a business point of view, we have 10 scenes here, so just the groom coverage could fill 20 pages of their wedding album (more about this in a future post) Bride Coverage (1 hour - 1.5 hours) The beauty of shooting the bride coverage is that it is very similar to the groom coverage. 80% of the same rules apply except the images will be brighter, more colourful and a little more playful. Remember - big smiles on arrival, followed by introductions, building rapport and making everyone your best friend! As before, I always start with the detail shots (engagement ring, flowers, shoes etc) which gives me time to relax and get a feel for my surroundings and gives the girls time to finish fluffing around with the final touches of hair and make-up. A little trick I like to use at the girls house is to do a lot of the photography in the master bedroom. It's usually well lit, has enough space, is clean and gives me a nice setting for portraits too. Best of all, I can close the door and keep everyone else out while I get some one on one time with the girls and can get all the shots I need without distractions! To break down the shots, I basically follow the same regime as the boys coverage Natural Light in the master bedroom (ideally with my back to a window) Details on the bed or coffee table Girls helping the bride get ready Combos of the bride with her bridesmaids and individuals too Get some beautiful portraits of the bride near the window and on the bed Natural Light in the lounge room (again, ideally with my back to a window) A 'cheers' series with some champagne Family shots, all different combos Video Light Shooting Indoors (close the curtains, turn off the ceiling lights and create some mood) That pretty much covers the bride coverage, so it's time to hit the road, eat some grub, re-hydrate and make our way to the ceremony! Ceremony I hate to start on a negative, but I have to tell you, even after 10 years this is one part of the day that can still be a little stressful. If the wedding is all in one venue then it's never a problem, but if it's a city wedding and there is a significant drive involved from the brides house to the ceremony, I'm often a little worried about traffic, parking and getting to the church before the bride! Luckily this has never happened yet, but there have been times that I have been late because of traffic but then the bride was too, so I got away with it! So, back to work. We are about half way through the day and this is a section that I feel I can relax a bit. What happens at the ceremony is totally out of my hands and out of my control so my job is simply to just capture what goes on to the best of my ability. Apart from being technically challenging as churches are notorious for being dark and yellow, I find it fun, and always love hearing the couple say their vows, especially if they make them up themselves. Some key shots to get here are: Bride walking in and almost more importantly the grooms reaction! A nice wide angle shot of the church from the back. Close up of each of them saying their vows. If you can get it, get a close up (with a long lens) of the rings going on the finger Keep a close eye on the parents, if they shed a tear, make sure you get it! THE KISS! In 10 years of shooting I have only missed the kiss once! It just happened to so quickly and unannounced and was over before my camera even had a chance to focus! I looked over at the videographer who was standing next to me with as the blood drained from my face and he just gave me a big smile, he emailed me a still from the video the next day! close call! Get some shots of the signing Lastly, I love walking out (backwards) with the bride and groom taking shots as they walk through the cheering crowd. Congratulations, Group Photos & Family Photos Congratulations Shots So, we are outside (weather dependent) and all the guests are flooding out of the church or ceremony area towards the bride and groom. There are a few shots that I really like to get here: general wide angle shots to show the atmosphere and size of the crowd close ups of the couple being congratulated by their parents and siblings and then I make an effort to run around the crowd and get photos of people in groups as a family or a group of friends. Business Tip Although running around getting shots of everyone can be a lot of work, I find it's a really awesome way to meet people and get photos they were not really expecting, and then most of the time those people will visit your website to have a look at the photos (and maybe purchase) on your web gallery! Great for website traffic and marketing! Then usually 1 of 2 things will happen that you need to keep an eye out for! People will slowly start to leave or disperse OR I'll notice the bride is starting to get a little fed up with all the hugs and kisses. If I notice either of these two things happening, I'll grab the couples attention and check if they are ready for the group photos! The Group Shots Time to get up on that trusty ladder and put your public speaking to the test! When I was starting out I used to HATE doing this and was terrified of being the centre of attention in front of 50-300 people! But like with anything, over time you get better at it and build confidence, and now I love it! Again it's a great marketing opportunity where you get to put yourself out there in front of everyone, including potential future wedding clients. So I usually crack a few jokes and get everyone laughing, and take a few different combos of photos for variety. Family Shots This was another part of the day that I used to dread, but with a bit of training and a good system, I can now do it with my eyes closed! I find this is usually a part of the day where the bride and groom can get a little frustrated and impatient, so it's your job to step up and take control of the situation. Tip At the end of the group photo, make an announcement that you will be doing family photos, point to where you will be doing them, and then make it very clear that you require all the immediate family to make their way over. This was everyone knows what is going on, there is no confusion and will make the family photos way quicker and easier to coordinate! So, set up the bride and groom in a good location, ideally with their back towards some greenery, or the prettiest background you can find. Be aware of the sun and the shadows it is casting on everyone. Try and get everyone in the shade if possible, if not, their backs towards the sun to prevent squinting and just watch for flare in the camera! Once the bride and groom are good to go, start calling out the combos. Another quick tip, always take 3 or 4 photos of every family just to make sure you get one where no one is blinking, even count them in, 3, 2, 1, shoot! And we are off again! Back in the car to nibble on some food, drink some agua and off to my favourite part of the day, LOCATIONS! Locations I love this part of the day, it's just you and the bridal party. Generally the mood is a lot more relaxed, the ceremony is over, beers come out and everyone chills out. But, while the bridal party is relaxing, this is the part of the day that I find the most challenging! In a nutshell this is what you need to remember and need to do: get heaps of beautiful photos of the couple that are worthy of putting up on the wall in a variety of different locations using a variety of different compositions getting them to do a variety of different things while making the whole experience super fun without repeating any of the same shots (ideally) and make sure you are keeping track of time and getting to 2 or 3 different completely different locations while being challenged with traffic, lighting, backdrops, parking and even random people in the backgrounds AND... don't forget the bridal party photos and photos of their transport (exotic or vintage cars etc... )! Reception We've made it! The last part of the day is upon us and I can totally relax. I find the reception very similar to the ceremony in terms of difficulty. Everything just happens and it's out of my control, so I'm just there to capture it to the best of my ability. I usually stay at the reception until the first dance. I personally find that everything up until the first dance is super important and afterwards just become repetitive. This is what I do: Get plenty of shots of the guests (again for meeting them and also driving traffic to the web gallery later) Shots of the venue Details inc the cake, table settings, name place cards etc The bridal party and couple being announced Some shots of the couple and bridal party at the table During entree I generally chill out Then (usually) the first dance begins and I finish off the night by getting plenty of photos of the couple, then the bridal party is announced and then (usually) the dance floor is opened to everyone with some final wide angle shots of a dance floor full of people with the couple in the middle. AMAZING! WE HAVE MADE IT TO THE END! I always say goodbye to the couple, tell them how much fun I had (which is true) and wish them the best time on their honeymoon! Time to pack my bags and hit the road! After the Wedding Ha, just when you thought the day was over and you could go to bed, not quite. There is one more thing that MUST be done. This is my 100%, unbreakable, must do, golder rule for every single wedding no matter what my plans are that night! As soon as I get back to the studio or home I ALWAYS UPLOAD ALL THE CARDS AND CHECK THEM ON MY COMPUTER before doing anything else! Once I know the photos are uploaded and safe, then I can finally relax. Or, if I'm shooting again the next day, I put everything on charge, clear my cards and get ready for round 2 tomorrow!! Thanks for reading!! Thanks so much for reading my blog post and stepping into my shoes of what it's like to be a wedding photographer on shoot day!"
10,The Resemblance and Diversity in the Art Works of Toros and OninO,arts-entertainment," Born in 1978 in Armenia, OninO was always a top-quality painter, but she was unsure about adopting art as a career choice. But after her stint in a dedicated art institution, OninO encountered the artworks of the Russian maestro, Toros. This resulted to a huge change in the student who was so inspired by the artistic genre of Toros (Vagarshak Torosyan) that she started studying art earnestly. One cannot but overlook the ample and enormous influence of Toros in shaping the career of OninO as an independent painter who shows profound creative potential of her own. It would be pretty unjust to designate the influences of Toros on her artworks as mere simulation it was meant more as an imbibing of alike procedures, brush strokes and changing of one's thoughts that should be taken forefront. OninO, who was especially intrigued by the exciting and strange faces of Toros, spent two years learning art under him in the United States. By this time, however, the master was successful in making her understand her own manner and increase her creativity through the vast array of her canvas. Any contrast made between a master and a student can't be considered as a simulation of art on any party. It's in effect a recognition of the artistic level of each painter in trying to stress the creative elegance of each while remarking the outside influences of the complete result. As is anticipated, the influence of Vagarshak Torosjin is somewhat visible in some of the past pieces of OninO. Although even in the subsequent years she keeps several of it, it is more during the latter half of her artistic term when we can spot the eccentricity of OninO as a painter. During the early period, one notices similarity particularly in the portrayal of the characters, this includes the same constricted faces, with curious expressions. A careful look on another light, reveals that Torosijn Vagarshak's characters are either at times more practical and at others, totally uncanny, while those of OninO's are somewhere in the middle. Interestngly enough, one gets the impression that her characters are larger than in reality and more rich and daring in their mannerisms. One cannot help but discount in both the pieces of Vagarshak Torosjin's and OninO, the highlighting of the diverse types of hats that the characters wear. While the faces of Toros are devoid of hats (though the characters do don a hat in the other paintings), every masterpiece of OninO has the characters donning some or the other type of colorful hat. In reality, all of OninO's hats are remarkable and they draw as much interest as the characters themselves. Both on the other hand, maintain their influence of Cubism; OninO at times more than her teacher. Her flirtation with shapes is so delicately manifested and so delicate that one may miss it if not viewed with a perfectionist eye. The mixture of natural elements and feelings into each of the paintings is one focal point of both Torosijn Vagarshak and OninO. However, while Torosijn Vagarshak stenly keeps hardly any hints of feminist tendencies in his masterpieces, OninO's paintings are sated with them. OninO's inclination to romance, match making, revelry and display of affluent living make her pieces have a particularly different impression from that of Toros, who can be more associated with the two boundaries of make believe as well as realism. Just as in some other areas, both artists are pretty much uneven in their preference of subjects. The brave brush strokes of Torosijn Vagarshak versus the more delicate ones of OniO's and alike color palette are on the other hand, private choices that come forward while observing the two painters. In the portrayal of emotions within the imagery of their art work, whether hilarious or forlorn, infatuation or passion, irritation or dissatisfaction, both the artists expose ample evidence of mastery. It is in this resemblance but individual display of creative potential and impressions that both the artists make their own ground and OninO makes her assertion as an artist of enormous caliber quite vividly felt."
11,The Most Famous Breast Implants of all time,arts-entertainment," In Hollywood, a world all about appearance and looks, plastic surgery has become extremely common among many celebrities. Although it is more common now, getting plastic surgery wasn’t always considered normal and celebrities that did get plastic surgery were often criticized for doing so. Many women that did get breast implants were targeted by fans, other celebrities, and most importantly, the media. Even with the risk of receiving all this attention, sometimes being negative, the following are some of the most famous breast implants of all time: Pamela Anderson: This former Playmate and Baywatch babe has been in the spotlight for most of her life. But after appearing in Playboy magazine two times, Pamela Anderson decided she wanted to get breast implants, which made her fame skyrocket. After this she appeared several more times in the magazine and scored some acting gigs on popular TV shows. Her controversial life and busty figure has made her one of Hollywood's most famous icons and she continues showing off her breasts with no shame. Heidi Montag: There is no doubt that this former Hills cast member had some plastic surgery done. People magazine even did a whole article where they spoke about her having ten different procedures done in one day. Although people suspect she had several things done, her breast implants have struck the most attention. After getting G-cup breast implants, Montag said she wanted to reduce the size of her breasts, which now may be difficult since her plastic surgeon passed away. Dolly Parton: Since the 1960s, this celebrity has been a country icon drawing much attention. Alongside her numerous songs, television appearances, and movie credits, she has been known for her appearance and is proud to admit that she did have plastic surgery. She even told Oprah Winfrey that she will continue to get plastic surgery if it means keeping up her looks. If it’s dragging or sagging, she’s willing to get plastic surgery to fix it. Anna Nicole Smith: After appearing on the cover of Playboy at the young age of 24, Anna Nicole Smith exploded in the media. Her long blonde hair, bright smile and great personality weren’t the only thing that caught people’s attention, it was her overly large breast implants. After having two implants put in each breast, she was discovered by a photographer in Texas and pursued her modeling career. She was then named playmate of the year in 1993 and got a gig as a Guess model. Her breast implants most definitely gave her a boost in her career."
12,"Kaley Cuoco - We know she a boob job, but how about that nose job?",arts-entertainment," Kaley Cuoco has been on our TV screens for years as one of Americas most popular female actresses appearing on numerous sitcoms. At the young age of ten, Kaley started her career appearing on the film Virtuosity. Since then she has played roles on various TV series, one of the most popular being ‘Penny’ from the ""The Big Bang Theory"". Her various appearances on these popular TV series automatically drew attention from the media, which is not very unlikely. Her great sense of humor, looks, and beautiful figure has won her millions of fans all over the globe, but this hasn’t stopped the media and paparazzi from raising the question of whether she has undergone plastic surgery. Kaley has openly admitted to have gotten a breast augmentation at the age of 18. Her career as a young girl flowing into her teenage years and adulthood show enough proof that she has undergone plastic surgery. On ""The Big Bang Theory"" she has been fairly popular for showing off her cleavage, which is clearly is not afraid to show off. Although she is not embarrassed to tell the world about her boob job, she continues to deny the accusations of her possible nose job. Apparently, she recently went under the knife for a nasal operation to treat her sinus problems, but to many this sounds a little fishy. It may be possible that she used this excuse to cover up her rhinoplasty. Even after repeated clash with media, she refuses to admit that she had a nose job. Now it is not unlikely that she had her sinuses treated through a nose job because this is very common among individuals that seek a nose job, but it is likely that she asked her doctor to perfect her nose just a little. Media will probably continue to raise questions about Kaley’s plastic surgery, but the question is, will she ever admit it? Whether she decides to admit it or not, plastic surgery is nothing to be ashamed of. Celebrities today are going under the knife more than ever. Cosmetic surgery has become increasingly popular and less frowned upon within the last several years. Plastic surgeons all over the world are finding new techniques to make plastic surgery safer and yield much more natural results. Women and men will always find ways to make themselves look even better, even celebrities. If you believe plastic surgery is exactly what you need to give you a boost of confidence, then it may be the right option for you!"
13,The Pros and Cons of Self-Publishing Your Own Book,arts-entertainment," Are you an author who has a book that you would like to see published?  If you are, you should know that you do have a number of different options.  While the most common approach taken involves relying on a third party publishing house, you do also have the option of self-publishing your own book. When an author makes the decision to self-publish a book, he or she has complete control over the whole process.  In fact, that is just one of the many pros or plus sides to self-publishing, as many authors like having complete control over their works of art.  As for the responsibility of an author in terms of self-publishing, an author must write the book, edit it, find a company to manufacturer the printed book, and sell it.  Although the process does seem relatively easy to most, it is important to remember that there are a number of pros and cons to self-publishing. As it was previously stated, a self-publisher is responsible for the sale of their book.  For many this is a difficult process.  When a third party publishing house is used, they take on most of the work associated with selling a book, such as marketing.  This is not how self-publishing works.  Many self-publishers set up websites where they list their books available for sale.  Even then, however, that website must be marketed so that visitors will find it.  Self-publishers also have the option of approach retailers, including bookstores, hoping to get their books available for sale locally. Another con or downside to self-publishing is the cost.  Technically, you could say that even when using a third party publishing house, you still pay for the cost of getting your book published.  This is because your publisher does take a fee out of the amount of money that you are paid; however, many authors don’t even take this cut into consideration.  Even though it will cost money to have your book transformed into print, there are steps that you can take to reduce the cost.  The most common approach involves having your book printed on demand, instead of having books on hand. As previously stated, some self-publishers find it difficult to sell their books.  Yes, this process can be difficult, but many other self-published authors have seen success. When you put the proper amount of time, research, and energy into selling a self-published book, you stand the most chance of making the biggest profit.  This is because, aside from the cost of your expenses, you are able to retain all of your profits.  There is no one else that must share your profits, unless of course you decide to hire help. Another pro or plus side to self-publishing is the fact that unknown authors are given the opportunity to shine.  Some of the best selling books today are written by authors who already have an established history or name.  In fact, unless you have an absolutely amazing book or a well-known name, there is a good chance that many publishing companies will not want to take a chance on you.  This doesn’t mean that your book is a poorly written one or that it has a bad story line.  It just means that the publishing market is a tough one. One of the biggest signs that self-publishing may be right for you if you believe that you have a book that will sell, but you still receive multiple rejection letters from well-known publishing houses.  Self-publishing is also an ideal approach for authors who write books that will sell, but books that only have a limited targeted marketed.  For example, if you are interested in writing a book on your city or town, your targeted market may be quite small and publishers may not want to take a chance with that. Since there are a number of pros and cons to self-publishing, you should take the time to decide if self-publishing is right for you.  Additional research can help you determine if self-publishing is truly your best option"
14,Uma Thurman says she hasn’t had plastic surgery,arts-entertainment," Since earlier this week when Uma Thurman stepped foot on the red carpet, rumors have been circulating the media questioning if she had plastic surgery. Her minimal eye make up and smooth forehead looked significantly different from her last appearance just a few weeks earlier. 44-year-old actress, Uma Thurman made a guest appearance on ""Today"" just a couple days later, where she claimed the magic was in the makeup, not plastic surgery. Although anyone that saw Uma Thurman that night could be sure she had some type of cosmetic surgery on her face, she says her make up artist just tried a new technique. She denied all accusations made towards her having any plastic surgery. ""I know I looked weird,"" said Thurman. ""I don’t know, I guess nobody liked my makeup"" She claims all the criticism she received from media didn’t bother her at all. But even if she did undergo some type of plastic surgery, should she be ashamed of it? Most definitely not. Over the last decade, plastic surgery has become increasingly popular and less frowned upon. A a brow or eye lift may have been just the thing Uma Thurman needed to give her a boost in her career. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to keep a fresh, young, and confident look. Statistics show that many women reaching their early forties seek plastic surgery, the brow lift being on of the most popular. This simple procedure has the ability to reduce creases on the forehead creating a smoother, more rejuvenated look. Lifting the eyebrows just a little can make great improvements in the facial features of an individual. So how does this procedure work? This minimal outpatient procedure consists of an incision made on the scalp from ear to ear. The incision lies behind the hairline, making the scar easily hidden after recovery. The small incisions make the recovery process fairly quick. Patients are typically back to work just seven days post-operation. The minimal scarring and fast recovery make this rumor about Uma Thurman quite possible, but we may never know. Plastic surgery seems to be quite popular lately and although celebrities may not want to admit to or undergo these cosmetic procedures, one simple procedure may have the ability to drastically improve one’s looks, while boosting their confidence. Although the media may have their speculations about Uma Thurman undergoing surgery, there is no proving right or wrong. Maybe the magic is in the makeup!"
15,Laying out the Resemblance and Differences of the Artworks of Toros and OninO,arts-entertainment," Born in Armenia, OninO was always a first-rate artist, but she was in doubt about adopting art as a career choice. But after her time in a dedicated art institution, OninO set eyes on the works of the Russian master artist, Torosijn Vagarshak. This resulted to a massive change in the lady who was so charmed by the artistic style of Toros (Torosyan Vagarshak) that she began taking up art seriously. One cannot but discount the substantial and immense effect of Toros in shaping the vocation of OninO as an independent painter who displays significant creative potential of her own. It shall be extremely unreasonable to name the influences of Toros on her artworks as simple replication it was meant more as an assimilation of alike systems, brush strokes and developing of one's thoughts that should be taken forefront. OninO, who was particularly captivated by the exciting and odd faces of Toros, spent two years studying art under him in the United States. By this time, however, the mentor was triumphant in letting her understand her unique method and cultivate her artistic potentials through the substantial variety of her work of art. Whatever evaluation made between a mentor and a protege can't be considered as a replication of art on any party. It's in fact a realization of the artistic level of each artist in attempting to underscore the artistic finesse of each while remarking the external influences of the polished result. As is anticipated, the influence of Vagarshak Torosjin is quite obvious in some of the past works of OninO. Although even in the later years she retains a number of it, it's more on the latter portion of her artistic term when we can perceive the uniqueness of OninO as a painter. During the early period, one spots resemblance especially in the representation of the characters, this includes the same slender faces, with curious expressions. A careful glance on the other hand, demonstrates that Torosijn Vagarshak's characters are either at times more practical and at others, entirely strange, while those of OninO's are somewhere in between. Also interestingly one assumes the view that her characters are bigger than in real life and more magnificent and bold in their mannerisms. One cannot help but discount in both the creations of Torosijn Vagarshak's and OninO, the emphasis on the various styles of hats that the characters wear. While the faces of Toros are without hats (though the characters do put on a hat in the other masterpieces), every masterpiece of OninO has the characters donning some or the other type of colorful hat. In fact, all of OninO's hats are exciting and they gain as much thought as the characters themselves. Both Toros and OninO on the other hand, retain their influence of Cubism; OninO at times more than her master. Her toying with shapes is very subtly revealed and so dainty that one may miss it if not viewed with a perfectionist eye. The combination of natural elements and emotions into each of the paintings is one unique attribute of both Vagarshak Torosjin and OninO. However, while Vagarshak Torosjin practically keeps barely any traces of feminist tendencies in his masterpieces, OninO's paintings are replete with them. OninO's liking for romance, match making, revelry and display of wealthy living make her works have a clerly unique aura from that of Toros, who can be more related with the two edges of make believe and realism. Similar to some other genres, both painters are pretty much mismatched in their choice of subjects. The daring brush strokes of Vagarshak Torosjin against the more delicate ones of OniO's and alike color palette are however, exclusive preferences that come to the fore while observing the two painters. In the depiction of emotions within the imagery of their work of art, whether comic or miserable, love or enthusiasm, fury or disappointment, both the artists reveal sufficient evidence of mastery. It is in this resemblance yet unique presentation of creative ability and impressions that both the painters stand their own ground and OninO makes her declaration as painter of grand caliber quite intensely felt."
16,The Numerous Colors of Toros,arts-entertainment," Born in 1964 in Armenia, Vagarshak Torosijn has had a multi dimensional improvement as a human and as a painter. Having observed the diverse cultures of three powerful nations, he keeps an artistic facet that's not only sizeable in imagination, but also comprises different kaleidoscope of thoughts and art streams altogether. Toros, as he's better called, in his own words weaves the real and imaginary world into his artworks. Anyone who has examined and observed many of Vagarshak's oils would construe that these exposes deep inner thought and an expression that is exceptionally his own. He admits to being motivated by the Vanguard method of painting and is perhaps also experimenting with abstract and expressionism. A gaze at any of the very chic and lovely of Vagarshak Torosijn oils, one notices almost no traces of feminine or softness in them, however there's no insensitivity or an expression of shock to his fine art too. Captivatingly, he uses expressions of hilarity in his paintings to suggest notions that are sometimes more unfathomable and profound than they appear to be on the canvas. Toros uses colors to his gain in his paintings. In fact, often they are representative of the notion or the feeling that he loves to depict. Intense sensations are mostly conveyed by stronger colors which in fact also show the creator's mood swings. Remark should be made of several very unique pictures such as-""Two Clowns"" and ""Masquerade"" both of which reveal the vast creative sensibilities of the artist. His attraction with the clowns leaves us with bewilderment if the artist seeks to tell us more than what is evident in our eyes through these characters. Similar to all of his contemporaries, Toros is a little unpredicatable in his choice of subject matter; in fact his scale is as diverse as his use of hues. Just as one feels happy and eager at his diverse utilization of colors, so does his selection of figures not only astonished but also startles us. He showacases a range of subjects that border on the contemporary to those of the traditional, especially remarkable is his choice of subjects that also include children, clowns, and an abundance of other individuals from different segments. So whether it's a celebration or images of clowns that he is dealing with, the master generates a solid statement anywhere. The canvases of Toros use brave and defined brush strokes; he tries to create order out of chaos. A quick glimpse at his masterpieces gives the notion of a chaotic piece, it's only when one attempts to look at the bigger picture within the inner framework that the seemingly complicated themes and the subdued picture presentation within is clear. The artist also excels in his interpretation of emotions, the characters in his oils seem to convey the message of the whole painting whether amusing or sad, irritated or upset within their imagery. One gets the impression that Torosijn Vagarshak is a man of varied thoughts and a mind that runs riot just like his use of hues. His preference in diverse approaches as well as contradictory subjects break the uniformity often linked to series fine art; ultimately, every portrait stands out in an in individual artistry. Yet another noticeable characteristic about Toros is the various tints he includes in his pictures in terms of themes. While many of his artworks have the faЗade of cheerful revelry in them, a second glance depicts another side of the story, in a master crafting of multi dimensionality, he uses the foundation as a joyful theme while the expressions are used to convey emotions that are deep and that signify other inclinations. We may construe that Vagarshak stands out as an artist of massive quality with paintings that both please and urge the audience to contemplate."
17,Should You Buy a Piano or a Keyboard?,arts-entertainment," Piano or Keyboard: Which Should You Go With? Although the piano and the keyboard appear to have the same basic features, there is a wide range of differences between the two. These differences become apparent when considering how they are constructed, used, and the type of music each one plays. History Over three hundred years ago, an Italian harpsichord maker decided to broaden the range of his instrument. His invention had similar keys to the harpsichord, but when the keys are pressed a felt tipped hammer hits the appropriate string(s) producing a sound that has been found to be impossible to reproduce. Over the years this invention has been changed slightly, but eventually came to be known as the piano. The keyboard on the other hand, originated from the pipe organ. One of the biggest differences between the two instruments is the fact that a piano is considered an acoustic string instrument, while a keyboard produces music digitally, generally requiring electricity to function. The Differences The feel of the two instruments also differs. Some keyboards have small keys and feel like plastic to the touch, while higher end models may feel more like the wooden keys of a piano. Another key difference is the sound produced by each instrument. Electronic keyboards can create a variety of sounds and effects, while the piano produces a set of the same sounds that vary by tone, generated by the keys and pedals. The hammer system makes a piano touch-sensitive, meaning the sound produced depends on how you press the keys, while a keyboard will sound the same no matter how u press them. The piano and keyboard also differ in range. A piano has 88 keys (88 notes), but a typical keyboard today has only 61 or 76 keys. Probably the biggest drawback of the electronic keyboard is the quality of the sound. It is almost impossible to replicate the rich tone of a well-made acoustic piano with an electronically produced sound. Of course the size of the instruments also differs significantly. Keyboards are portable and do not take up as much room space as a piano, and moving a keyboard isn’t nearly as difficult as moving a piano from room to room or location to location. They also don’t have to be tuned, while a piano does. Cost is another factor when evaluating the two instruments. A good acoustic piano can be quite costly, and may not be affordable to many musicians. A keyboard, on the other hand, can range in price from $300 to $1,000, or less if you consider purchasing a used model."
18,Pros and Cons of The 4 Types of 2D Animation,arts-entertainment," As you might know, there are different types of animation, and today I'm going to focus on the types of animation you can do in 2D. Frame-By-Frame, Rotoscoping, Cut Out Animation, And Rigged Characters with Inverse Kinematics. This is also known as Classical Animation, Traditional Animation or Flip Animation. What you do here is pretty simple, you draw each frame. Ha! Simple, right? I know. But wait, there's a way to do it. First, you have to know your frame rate, which in the next example will be 12 fps (frames per second), and for that we will have to do 12 drawings for one second. How to do it: You can do this by having the correct timing of the movement. First, you need a sample (if you are animating a character jumping, then you need a video of someone jumping). Once you have the video, there are many ways to calculate time and convert it into frames. My favorite is: Stop Motion Works Stopwatch (link at the end of this article). In my example it will be a 8 frame jump. What you do is: You draw the key frames of the skeleton of your character, and then, you continue by drawing the in-between frames. Let's make an example of a female jumping (only the action, that means, no anticipation and no aftermath, to keep this simple and friendly). You draw the starting pose (frame 1), then the character in mid-air (frame 5), and finally the landing posture (frame 9). After you have those 3 drawings, you draw a the in-between frames. A drawing between starting pose (frame 1), mid-air pose (frame 5), and landing (frame 9). In other words, you draw frames 3 and 7. And finally, you draw the missing frames. Easy enough? After the skeleton is animated for all the frames, you add detail frame by frame, a little bit of body form, then a more detailed head on every frame, then the right arm on all the frames, and so on. You continue until you have a detailed character on every frame. Pros: Your limit is your own imagination. Characters can do whatever you want, have any facial expression you want and any pose you can come up with. Cons: Takes a lot of time. Animating 1 second can take a couple of hours. Rotoscoping is another form of frame-by-frame animation. What you do is you take a piece of footage and import it into your favorite 2D animation software. Now, all you do is draw the silhouette of every frame. Then you substitute those drawings with some details that make up your character. Big nose? Long hair? Fat? Thin? Pros: You work a bit faster, because you don't have to draw the key frames and then the in-between, you just follow each frame; and the motion is very realistic, because you just follow the footage frame by frame. Cons: Even though it can be a bit faster than Traditional Animation, you still need a lot of time to do it, because you have to draw every frame, and also, you start to get limitations: The character will only do what the person in the footage does. If you need it to do something else than what you have in the footage, then you will have to switch to traditional animation, drawing the key frames first, then the in-between. This kind of animation takes preparation. You take each angle of your character (front, sides and back) and you ""cut"" the character into its parts (hence the name Cut Out Animation). For example, if you were to animate the front side, then you would have the head in one layer, the arms, forehand and hands for each side in a different layer, and so on. This takes time to prepare, but the good thing is that you don't have to draw each frame, you only prepare once and then you animate the character as if it was a puppet. Pros: It's way faster to animate, because you don't have to draw each frame, you only draw your character and each facial expression once, and after the ""puppet"" is ready, you can start animating. Cons: It can take a some time to prepare and the character is limited by the rig. That means, you can't put her in any position you can imagine, only those you can achieve with the rig. Another disadvantage is that it's not the fastest way to animate, because if you want to move his hand, then you need to rotate the shoulder, then the arm, then the forearm until you get the hand to the place you need. This type of animation is the fastest to achieve. Software like Toon Boom or Animation Studio have a lot of tools that help you rig a character with inverse kinematics and automate facial expressions. Inverse kinematics are the opposite of forward kinematics (used in Cut Out animation). In Cut Out animation, if you need the hand to be in a position, you have to rotate the shoulder, then forearm and so on. Inverse Kinematics let you click on the hand and move it to the position you want, and the positions and rotations of the shoulder, arm and forearm are automatically calculated by mathematical formulas. Pros: You animate at top speed. With just a few clicks and drags. Cons: It takes longer to prepare than the cut out animation, but cuts your working time exponentially. Another disadvantage is that you have limits, you can only do what the Rig allows you to. You can't move the character into any position you can imagine, but only into those allowed by the rig. Conclusion: You cannot have it all. You either have unlimited movement, but huge time investment, or you get limited movement with little time investment. These are the options you have. And for the record, Disney movies use frame by frame, but the shows you see on TV, because they are under schedule, they use a combination between Rigged Characters and Frame by Frame, depending on the shot they are working on. My advice is, learn to do Frame-by-Frame animation and Rigged Characters, you need them both. But if time is a big issue, then you should definitely master Rigged Character Animation. You can find courses online."
19,Organizing Your Writer's Thoughts,arts-entertainment," New writers ask me all the time about writing a novel, like it was some secret that only the anointed few could ever know.  I tell them novel writing is fun, but it is time consuming.  It’s not just the time putting words to paper, but also the cycles your brain goes through plotting out your idea.   A writer’s mind will start to wander while driving, listing to music, being in a really boring meeting, or watching mindless television.  Your thoughts will drift into this exciting world where you or your characters are getting into fights, killing people, exploding stuff, or enjoying an amorous love scene.  Your mind is full of ideas that materialize at inopportune times, sometimes it becomes overwhelming.  A lot of writers start their novels by flying by the seat of their pants, preferring an improvisational form to their story.  They allow the spur of the moment to create what happens to their characters, daily changing the outcome of their story.  I’ve written novels both ways, and I prefer something more concrete. I wrote my first novel, Malaise, in 2007.  I never charted out the chapters or even the scenes, but I had the characters and I knew where it was going, I had an ending.  I finished the first draft in 45 days (about thirty writing days), writing sequentially chapter after chapter, and it was difficult figuring out a day’s worth of work from thin air, but I plodded through.  After that rush, I put it away, not wanted to even look at it.  I didn’t have the patience, at the time, to be an editor, and the thoughts of continuing to work with it was repugnant to me. I had ideas for a second novel, Mainline, but they never materialized until 2011 for National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). The second book was difficult to get started.  I had the idea for the plot, but mapping the where and when to interject my story line was daunting, and after my first novel, I didn’t want to go through the same with the second.  I wanted it to be easier.  I wanted to know where the story was going to go day after day, not just what the ending was.   At that time I started going to writing groups, and reading up on writing techniques.  I don’t know if I read it or heard it somewhere, but my solution to the chaos in my head was using index cards.  I started writing on index cards the plot points of the story (things that change the direction of the story, about every one-third of the novel) and every time I had an idea for a scene, a character trait, or just a thought about the book, I would write it down on these 3 X 5 inch blue colored beauties. I wrote a bunch of cards from 2010 to 2011, in preparation for writing the book.  By the time I was ready to write in November 2011, had over 50 cards, some like: •	Nanny is an opera singer •	Scene brother doing heroin, while baby in room •	Baby’s death by falling down the stairs •	Scar on hand Some of the cards made sense, others I had to figure out what the heck I was thinking.  I filtered out the character trait cards and put them in a pile, for later creating a full profile of each of the main characters.  I took the scene cards and started to piece together a novel, thinking now where each idea would go best in the novel.   I arranged them on a table, with the plot points as the anchors in the novel.  I moved and swapped the thoughts into a logical order until I was happy with the direction.  I then transferred each chapter idea down into an Excel spreadsheet in the decided path. When November came I was ready.   I would read one card a day before leaving home, think about the chapter while I drove to work, and write a good 1000 words on the subject on my one-hour lunch break at work.   There were times when I didn’t want to write a ""big scene"" and continued with another scene out of order.  The cards helped me focus on one chapter a day.   With the story’s backbone, I was able to continue writing throughout the month.  I didn’t reach the 50,000 word goal for NaNoWriMo, but I did have the opportunity to exceed 25,000 words.   I use the same approach now after several years of writing and another novel, Spoon Girl,  I’ve found by writing the chapters consecutively I can avoid fixes in later drafts. Whether you use index cards to organize your thoughts, a spreadsheet, a digital recorder, or something electronic (I’ve started using a program call Scrivener), organization can help with daunting task of writing a novel or even a short story.   I don’t know how many ideas I might have forgotten without writing them down first."
20,Of Carton Sealing Tape and Other Adhesives: Knowing the Right Tape to Use,arts-entertainment," After hours of packing, it's finally time to wrap them up before sending the package on its way. You immediately grab the nearest adhesive and use it to tape the folds. Unwittingly, however, you used light-duty packaging tape instead of the sturdy carton sealing tape; its stickiness could not handle securing your box. Soon, you realize that the package arrived at the addressee a little worse for wear. Did you know that there are various sealing tapes and adhesives designed for specific uses? They range from conventional tapes for arts and crafts and office work to heavy duty sealing tapes used for shipping and securing packages and boxes. Know What Sticks Well on What It pays to know the kinds of tapes and packaging adhesives most suitable for packaging purposes. Conventional tapes used by schools and offices are used to seal paper materials such as envelopes and folders. Unless you're shipping greeting cards and important documents, you are better off using packaging for your boxes, cartons, and crates. Carton sealing tapes, for instance, are designed to work with loads placed inside cardboard or plastic containers. For packages that contain wholesale or fragile cargo, durable stretch wrap film can be wrapped around stacks of boxes to lock them in place. Stretch wrap films aren't exactly adhesives, but they can stick to pallets and stacks when used properly. Stretch Wrapping vs. Shrink Wrapping Most people confuse stretch wrapping with shrink wrapping since both are used to wrap packages. The former is generally used for holding pallets or crates that have quite a substantial load. The latter is used primarily for protecting a single or a cluster of perishable product during shipment. Both wraps are applied in different ways but are versatile in preventing contaminants such as moisture and dust from getting into your goods. Whether it's sending a care package or shipping a bundle of items, using the correct packaging materials is crucial to make sure your products reach their destinations safe and sound. For more information on packaging adhesives and how to properly use them, you can visit the website at PackWorld.com."

3,The Son of A rat Catcher- Life Experience Memoir,arts-entertainment," Uganda is a country that was referred to as ""The Pearl of Africa"" by Sir Winston Churchill in 1907 during his travel tours in Uganda. The country has gone through many tremendous changes in economic, social and political spheres of life. Uganda offers an experience that is as varied ranging from British colonial rule, dictatorial regimes, and a wide range of civil wars as well as modern democracy. What you see and experience are only limited by your imagination and sense of adventure. Jenkins Kiwanuka is one of the people who have witnessed these changing situations in the country. In his book titled ""The Son of A rat Catcher"", he does share his memoirs - memoirs of one of Uganda’s exceptionally talented journalists who turned himself into a remarkable public relations officer and diplomat in Uganda’s Foreign Service. A man with no full formal education, this ‘son of a rat catcher’ presents to us a story of great determination, hard work and self-confidence, thereby fulfilling the advertiser’s remark that ‘when you follow your passion, success follows you. In his words, Prof. Samwiri Lwanga-Lunyiigo, describes these as memoirs of ‘a tailor, carpenter, builder, clerk, journalist, politician, public relations practitioner, diplomat and business executive’. ""It’s that versatility,"" says the Professor, ""that enabled Kiwanuka to seize. Son of a Rat Catcher, although relatively small, is just about everything in life. There are so many things to read and wonder about: Kiwanuka’s very humble beginnings; how he missed out on higher education; how he rose from working (as a clerk) in the King’s African Rifles to journalism, foreign service, journalism again, then business as an executive and progress from that phase to his present working life as a newspaper columnist and author. Whom didn't he meet and where didn't he visit in his long service in both public and private services? He rubbed shoulders (literally) with such figures as Prime Ministers Harold Wilson of Britain, Holyoake of New Zealand and Indira Ghandi of India (who served him a glass of water when he dozed off in a conference), Pope John Paul II (now a Saint), Sir Andrew Cohen (a former Governor of Uganda whom he gave a lift in his car), Chairman Mao Tse Tung of China and many others. As for his foreign service exploits, apart from serving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at home, he served at our missions in London, Washington D.C., New York, Ottawa, Bonn and the Vatican. He wrote tributes to a host of people who have passed on and those of Pope John Paul II, Abubakar Mayanja, Daudi Taliwaku, Dan Zirimenya and James Namakajjo form part of the book. Kiwanuka ends his book with 20 ‘Reflections,’ which are fascinating to read. In fact, if there is a section of the memoirs the reader should re-read, this is surely the one. There are lots of lessons to learn from these memoirs, the outstanding one being that if you have passion for your life and determination and self-confidence, the blue sky is your limit. This is an extraordinary story of an extraordinary life told by a man with an extraordinary pen at his disposal. I have read many memoirs in my life, but these are among the best I have come across."
4,Lila and Mujnu Story,arts-entertainment," Love is known to be an overwhelming, all-consuming, intense passion. But just how intense can love be? No one knows the answer, and examples of such a love are rare. But whenever one talk about the depth of love, the intensity of passion, two names almost immediately come to mind-Laila and Majnu. The love story of Laila and Majnu is a very famous one and is no less than a legend. Even today, people know them as Laila Maju; the ""and"" in between is missing. They were two in flesh, but one in spirit. It is based on the real story of a young man called Qays ibn al mullawah from northern Arabian Peninsula, in the Umayyad era during the 7th century. The love story of ""Laila and Majnu"" is an eternal one albeit a tragic one. Laila was a beautiful girl born in arich family. Being no less than a princess, she was expected to marry a wealthy boy and live in grandeur and splendor. But love is born from the heart; it knows no rules. Laila fell in  love with Qays and he tool loved her dearly. Qays was a poet and belonged to the same tribe as Laila. He composed splendid love poems and dedicated them to his lady-love, telling in them his love for her and mentioning her name often. Qays' friends knew about his affair with Laila and they often teased and made fun of his love. But such taunts had no effect on Qays. He was deeply in love with Laila and it was her thoughts alone that possesed his mind for all time. It had been for quite sometime that Qays toyed with the idea of seeking Laila's hand in marriage from her parents. One day, he went up to them and put the big question before them. But Qays was a poor lad. And when he  asked for Laila's hand in marriage, her father promptly refused him as he didn't want her daughter to marry below her status. It would mean a scandal for Laila according to Arab traditions. As fate would have it, the two lovers were banished from seeing each other. Soon after, Laila's parents married her off to a wealthy man and she went on to live in a big mansion. When Qays heard of her marriage he was heartbroken. He fled the tribe camp and wandered in the surrounding desert. His family eventually gave up on his return and left food for him in the wilderness. he could sometimes be seen reciting poetry to himself or writing Laila's name in the sand with stick. Day and night, he pined for her. Laila was no better. Separated from Qays, she was shattered in mind, body and spirit. Not long afterwards, in 688 AD, she moved to Iraq with her husband, where she fell ill and died eventually. When Qays' friends came to know about Laila'a death, they went looking for him all over to give him the news. But they could not find him. Not much later, their search for him came to and end. Qays was found dead in the wilderness near Laila's grave. On a rock near the grave, he had carved three verses of poetry, which are the last three verses ascribed to him. Qays went mad for his love; for this reason he came to be called ""Majnu"", or Majnun Layla"", which means ""Driven mad by Layla"". Such a love is hard to find today. So if ever you love someone, try to love like these two did. Even today, lovers swear by their name. It is their love affair that has made Laila and Majnu immortal in the accounts of great love stories."

7,How To Attach A Guitar Strap To An Acoustic Guitar With Only One Strap Button,arts-entertainment," If you own, or have ever even taken a look at an acoustic guitar, most of them only have a single knob or button on the bottom where you can attach a strap. Have you ever wondered why? I have. While I've browsed Google, Yahoo, Bing and Wikipedia, I can not find an answer  about why. I've checked out the websites of Taylor, Martin, Gibson, Fender and a lot more manufacturers and they definitely do not discuss it. I can not even find  anybody on a guitar online forum who has speculated about why. I'm not the only one who questioned that  and fortunately, somebody named Lucas Man provided this explanation on YahooAnswers. ""Most acoustics only have a single strap button on the butt of the guitar. The reason they don't have one near the heel of the neck is because if you hook a strap onto an acoustic guitar that way, the guitar will suffer from ""neck dive"". That's when the guitar isn't balanced properly on the strap and the neck falls down instead of staying at a nice comfortable angle. This happens because the body of the guitar is so light and can't counter the weight of the neck."" Many people suggest the answer to the issue  is to install a 2nd strap button. I'm not about to drill on my guitar but I understand if I take it to Sam Ash or Guitar Center they'll be happy to do it for me. To that, Lucas Man advises, ""…remember, there's probably a good reason they didn't put one (strap knob) on in the first place."" Alternatives to the Shoe String. If you accept that reasoning, then what's your option for attaching a guitar strap to an acoustic guitar? For years, people have actually connected a shoe lace to the top of the acoustic guitar to attach the strap to the guitar. In fact, it's so common that many guitar straps are sold with a shoe lace already attached to the strap. But, a shoe lace is not only an unattractive option but is likewise subject to being torn, frayed and broken throughout its use. Worse yet, lots of guitar players say it causes stress on the neck. Now there's a new product  available which solves this particular problem by providing good balance to prevent neck dive and covering more mass than a shoe lace, thereby  removing the neck stress issue. The Leather Acoustic Guitar Strap Holder. The leather guitar strap holder offered by MAC Music Accessories  secures firmly  around the neck of the guitar over the  frets and under the strings so that there is no interference when playing. Furthermore, the strap holder is simple to button on and off so you can leave it affixed to the guitar or the strap; whichever you prefer. The Advantages of Using a Leather Guitar Strap. There are definitely a variety of benefits to having your acoustic guitar protected by a leather strap holder instead of a shoe lace. Certainly, a proper strap holder looks professional and offers  a more pleasing  look than a shoe lace that looks homemade and amateurish. Leather is not only flexible; it is extremely strong also. It needs only minimal maintenance which means that under normal conditions the strap holder will last for years and only get more beautiful  gradually. For those who own an acoustic guitar, it's definitely worth thinking about making the small investment in a leather acoustic guitar strap holder in place of using a shoe lace or having another button attached to your guitar."
8,Indian Classical Music vs Western Classical Music – The Classical Story,arts-entertainment," Indian Classical Music is all about ragas. A raga portrays a mood, a sentiment, expressed through a microtonal scale. There are a number of ragas, each with its own mood and its own corresponding microtonal scale that is based on the natural harmonic series - the natural law of vibrations. Today, Indian Classical music is influenced by a foreign tonal system that is not based on the natural harmonic series. This is the Western tonal system that has had a big influence on Indian Classical music. Many Indian Classical musicians, nowadays, make use of Western instruments such as guitar and drums. Most Western audiences find Indian Classical music to be quite exotic. Two major reasons are the differences between the two traditions in tuning and scales. The subtle differences Let's straightaway delve into the differences between these two vast genres of music to get a better idea: •	Indian Classical Music (ICM) is primarily homophonic, which means that it focuses on creating melodies using a sequence of notes, whereas Western Classical Music (WCM) is to an extent polyphonic, which means multiple notes are played/sung together, where the counterpoint, harmony, and texture created using multiple voices is very important. •	WCM is composed, whereas ICM is improvised. WCM compositions are formally written using Staff Notation, and performers usually follow that. But in the case of ICM, the Teacher-Student tradition of learning leads to each performance being an improvisation. •	ICM uses ""Taal"", where Taal is a cycle of beats that is centered on ""Sam"" that repeats itself. In the case of WCM, there aren't any complex beat cycles. •	WCM is modal and so has a chord for each note of the scale. On the contrary, ICM is tonal and, hence, is based on a single scale (a single drone, chord, and key). Fusion all the way But then again fusion is a growing concept in India. So, their differences and some similarities make fusion music even more interesting and challenging. If we take a deeper look, we will actually find a number of similarities. Today, ""guitar"" has acquired prime position and popularity in Indian Classical Music with Indian Ragas being played on guitar. There are two types of Guitars that is used for fusion in India: Spanish guitar and Hawaiian guitar.A wide variety and mix of instruments ranging from Guitar, Drums, and Saxophone to Sitar, Tabla, and Flute are used for fusion music/concerts. My band, known as Kaivalyaa, is also a fusion band, where we fuse various western genres with Indian Classical music. The Western and Indian instruments we use include Guitar, Drums, Keyboards, Mouth Organ, Bass Guitar, Harmonium, Flute, Sarod, Tabla, and a number of percussion instruments. Some of the big names in the Indian fusion scenario are Indian Ocean, Avial, Advaita, Raghu Dixit Project, Mother Jane, Tabla Beat Science, and Bandish Fusion. With varied influences, experiments, scales, tones, and sounds, fusion is the next big thing. So, if you want to know more about the Indian Classical scales/Ragas, you are at the right place."
9,The Future Of The World (Humor),arts-entertainment," An old manuscript was found in the attic of the legend Migel Nostrildamous, a seer of the 1500s who could smell the future. It is written in his own handwriting and it foretells events in the not-so-distant future. And it doesn't smell good. Migel writes of the following events: The year is 2035. The entire border between the U.S. and Mexico has been paved with asphalt so people don't slip as they run cross. All illegal aliens in the U.S. have been granted amnesty and a subscription to Telemundo. The official language of the U.S. is Spanish. Mexico's population is 35. Obamacare requires insurance companies to cover children up until the age of 64, as long as they live with their parents and their mother still does their laundry. A ""pre-existing condition"" is now defined as a condition that existed before you existed. What this means is that all out-of-pocket expenses paid by your parents and grandparents for their own medical problems, you now get reimbursed for. And this all works out well. Every family has three cars, six servants, a horse stable, and insurance company executives live in homeless shelters. Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong-un, supreme leader of North Korea, embark on a joint venture. They'll be manufacturing detachable mops that can be used as a Kim Jong-un wig that doesn't fly off when playing basketball. The International Court of Justice moves from the Hague to the Bronx. In their first session they condemn New York City cops for occupying Brooklyn. ISIS runs the U.N.'s Human Rights Council and declares that killing a terrorist is a crime against humanity. The U.S. military has been reduced to a small fraction of what it used to be back in 2014. It loses many men in combat in a war with Denmark. The U.S. is outgunned and outnumbered. Denmark's army consists of 500 well-armed soldiers, it's navy has three rowboats with mounted shotguns and it's air force consists of five cropdusters that can drop 78 cherry bombs a minute. The U.S. doesn't stand a chance. Israel finally agrees to give up all the land demanded by Hamas. Hamas builds more tunnels with the help of Iran's biggest contractor, ""Jihad Construction, Roofing and Waterproofing,"" and completes the project under budget by taking advantage of the construction company's semi-annual ""Buy cement for one tunnel, get cement for another tunnel free"" sale. Hamas is invited to the U.S. to help New York City complete its never-ending subway projects. Hamas responds, ""Can not do. Not have enough cement for tunnel from New York to Israel."" In light of its land gain, Hamas now demands that Israel roll back its borders to the pre-Egyptian-bondage lines. Israel responds that it's willing to comply as soon as it figures out how to split the Red Sea again. Evolutionists are dealt a big blow when a book that disproves the theory of evolution, ""Fossils Make A Monkey Out Of Evolution,"" reaches one billion in sales on Amazon. In response, evolutionists claim they can prove that if you incubate a bunch of worms in a solution of amino acids and carbon compounds they will eventually evolve into the Long Island Railroad. And they bolster their claim by recounting an experiment that showed that a worm's cell magnified eight billion times has a remarkable resemblance to a train window. Migel Nostrildamous writes that his nose was getting a little stuffed and he was having a hard time smelling any further future events. But he promises to make more predictions as soon as his sinus clears up."

11,How I Accidentally Became a Recording Engineer,arts-entertainment," Well, not exactly. I did intentionally learn how to record. But it wasn't as a career choice. It was only out of necessity. It's really expensive to record in a professional studio. Where I live, it costs at least $250 per song to record with the top local engineer. That is an enormous bill at the end of a 10-song project. And bands around here somehow come up with that money. However, I cannot. And neither can any of my band mates. So, in order to get anything recorded, someone has to undertake the massive chore of audio recording. And somehow that person has ended up being me. And I'm not completely happy about it. I mean, I love the end result of a recording project. It's such a difficult process that it's hard not to be proud of the final product. But getting there is very painful. Not physically, but mentally. It requires a great deal of studying and experimenting to get adequate results out of a recording studio. I spent many months stressing and obsessing over sound treatment and setup. There are so many variables to deal with: sound treatment, microphone placement, studio monitor placement, etc. And that's just the preparation to start tracking. And then once tracking is complete, mixing and mastering are the next two laborious chores. And these two tasks entail so much attention that I consider each to be an additional task to accompany the recording process. On my first project I did all three: recording, mixing, and mastering. And after that project, I immediately understood why this is not the usual method. It's a good idea to let a fresh set of ears take over at the mastering stage, allowing for a new perspective to the project. I am now more than happy to turn the project over to someone else after the mixing stage. Not too long after that first project was completed, I started getting asked by other bands to do recording for them. Definitely not my intention, but I figured, ""why not?"" I had already spent so much time studying the recording process and setting up my own studio, that it almost seemed silly not to. So I did. And at first I was very passionate about it. People were enjoying my work and I was very proud of the sounds I was obtaining in my DIY recording studio. But as time went on, I began neglecting  my own music. Recording had become nothing more than a job. I think of it in the same way that I do my experience playing in a cover band. Playing other people's music or recording other people's music... the end result of neglect is the same. So now, I'm back in college to obtain an accounting degree. I've already tried twice to make music my career. Both times my passion was depleted. But it's back now. I can concentrate on playing music and writing songs. And with my arsenal of recording tools, I can document my own music with relative ease. These days I take pride in sharing my DIY and cost effective recording  techniques with those who are just getting into the field of home recording. So in the end, my temporary time as a paid recording engineer really ended up being a positive thing. And the knowledge is a great backup to have as a last resort, just in case I go completely broke again."
12,A Bobcat,arts-entertainment," Summary A feeling of power descends upon us when we become parents.  The birth of a child in a family is a time of celebration. It is an inter-generational event, one in which the proud parents present the future to both the present and the past.  All attention is focused upon the newborn.  Whether a boy or a girl, the child is joy, and a proclamation, all at once.  The mother receives deserved fanfare for having successfully delivered the future generation of a dynasty.  The father receives confirmation that he matters, that he has sired someone of the next generation.  Don't take this literally.  Fathers and mothers of adopted children and stepchildren claim this right at well. Realize that there is something very special about birth for the parents. I Passed the Test Children who are fortunate to have their parents, at least one parent, or any adult to raise them in a loving and nurturing home, acquire an expectation that they should do something with their lives to affirm to those parents that they were worth the effort.  In nature, the young will often bring their first kill home to show their parents that they learned how to feed themselves.  That is what I describe here.  Mom, Dad, I can never thank you enough for feeding and caring for me. Look at what I have done!  I have produced a child!  Your legacy will live on!  Watch now.  I will show you how I can be a great parent like you! The Kid has a Vote The baby challenges us.  Sure, he/she is cute as bug's ear, is happy to be with us, reminds us of the joy of play, and gives us the wondrous gift of unrestrained love.  But, he/she demands to be fed, to be held, and to be cleaned even as he/she produces ever greater loads of the most foul-smelling bile that we have ever encountered!  We begin to wonder how our parents got through this. There is more to come, always more and different, as the baby becomes a toddler, a youngster, a tween, a teen, and a young adult.  We are surprised how vulnerable he/she is at all of those ages. Mom, Dad, was I like that?  It gets harder for us. We want the child to have the best, and to be the best. Yet, we have so many responsibilities, and why won't he/she listen to what I tell him/her to do?  We see hints, glimpses of our child learning, applying what he/she has learned, and becoming an adult, but we do not always recognize the hints, especially not with the first child. A Rare Thing I was blessed to have a baby man.  Nine years later, Babes was born. Even though they were not close in age, brother and sister bonded, and they have always remained close, all the way into their adulthood.  I coached all of my son's sports.  One day, I recall how our soccer team fought its way to win the next level in a tournament.  We might win the trophy this year.  He had done his part, but had not led the advances.  I wanted him to lead.  To me, the sports were tests, trials to learn how to excel.  On that day, I got a glimpse that the game was simply fun to him.  He was with his friends, and he remembers the day as one when the sun warmed his face while his team was victorious.  I wondered, shouldn't I just be happy when my children are happy?  Was he teaching me this?  On the trip home from the game, something spectacular happened.  We had played a team at their rural location.  Our path home was a country road that turned hills in twists and winding turns, amidst meadows and forests.  I topped a small hill, and saw a bobcat step out of the road ahead, into a meadow. She was magnificent! The Bobcat. No other cars followed, and none approached. I eased my car to the shoulder to give my children a look at the elusive hunter, which stood her ground exactly where I saw her.  The gold in her gold-and-white fur was so bright in the sunlight that her coat seemed to be woven with the precious metal. My son was mesmerized as I directed him to see the tiny tufts of hair at her ears and the shape of her hypnotizing, whiskered face.  I told both of my children all that I knew about the habits and lore of the bobcat, which is so rarely seen that it has been ascribed as having mythical qualities.  My son engaged me in a collegial discussion!  He had never done that before.  My daughter repeated, ""Wow! Bobcat!""  She was only two-years-old. She strained to see the elusive predator from her car seat, which was set centrally in the backseat of my car. We enjoyed our prize for a full three minutes before she sprinted across the meadow on powerful legs, showing us her black-tipped stubby tail.  She melted into the forest. My son said that he could not wait to get home to tell Mom about the bobcat. I began to drive off. As I did, I felt a tiny tug at my right elbow. Babes had leaned forward to grab the fabric of my shirt. I adjusted my rear view mirror, and saw that she wanted to ask me something. My two-year-old was about to engage me in a collegial discussion too.  I could see it on her face!  She asked her question.  ""How you know that cat's name is Bob?"""
13,A Guide To Feng Shui Colors Along with Their Meaning,arts-entertainment," Feng Shui is the process of bringing harmony to every aspect of your life. One particular technique to achieve good Feng Shui is via the use of color. There are five Feng Shui elements to which colors are associated. These elements are: Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. Colors are associated to each element, and, in the correct combination, they contribute to the Feng Shui energy map of the space encircling you. You need to boost the Fire element in the space around you if you wish to provoke passion and high energy. The colors that will likely promote your efforts are red, orange, purple, pink and strong yellow. In Feng Shui, red represents luxury and richness; orange conveys playful, lively, pulsating energy; purple is linked to spiritual realms; pink soothes the soul and strong yellow, like orange, makes your space uplifting and cheerful. Note, however, that several of these colors have to be used infrequently. The overuse of red is thought to create restlessness, bursts of anger and over-stimulation, while purple, being linked to the spiritual realm, should be used strategically. On the other hand, if you wish to build stability, inner nourishment and calm in your life, you have to boost the Earth element around you. The colors connected with the Earth element include light yellow, beige or skin color, and earthy, sandy colors. From the Metal element flows clarity and preciseness, efficiency, sharpness and precision. The colors white and gray will likely build a setting favorable to these traits. Gray generates an energy that is crisp, reflective and sharp. In the same manner, white is crisp, clear, fresh and clean: it marks both beginnings and clearly-defined endings. The Feng Shui Metal element colors create harmony to the Fire Element colors, thereby minimizing the overwhelming effect of the Fire Element colors. If you seek calm, ease, purity and freshness, you have to concentrate on the Water element. Feng Water element colors include blue and black. The various shades of blue are used to provoke different forms of energy. Light blue, for example, favors harmonious expansion and gentle growth, while darker blue, deep calm and serenity. By contrast, black teems with energy and sophistication, and it imparts power and protection, grounding and stability. Overpowering, black should be used infrequently and strategically. Lastly, the Wood element creates vibrant health, vitality and growth. By prioritizing green and brown, you will likely encourage the transfer of the energy to your own self and to those about you. Brown has a nourishing energy. On the other hand, way too much brown can bring about inertia and lack of ambition to go ahead in life. Brown needs to be balanced with other Feng Shui element colors, such as the Fire or the Water element colors. Green is the color of renewal, fresh energy and new beginnings. It soothes the spirits and favors healing. Green matches itself well with the other Feng Shui element colors, such as the Earth and the Metal element colors."
14,10 Things to Consider for a Fireworks Display,arts-entertainment," Fireworks are amazing.  They are exciting. They bring joy and cheer; they put smiles on people’s faces.  But before this can happen, there are a number of things to consider.  First of all, you need to consider the venue.  Where are you planning on hosting the party? Will the venue allow fireworks on their premises? Some places do not like fireworks.  If it is your own home, that is great.  The next thing to think about is area.  Do you have enough space to have a display conducted there?  With fireworks, there are various effects, and their burst diameters vary greatly.  The heights they reach before the effect explodes into all its glory, is a factor we need to consider and allow for.  Safety is of the utmost importance with specific minimum distances from the audience and homes and buildings to the firing point.  Weather is another consideration.  If the wind is blowing, the minimum clearance distance may have to be extended. Therefore I have 10 things that you may want to consider before a fireworks display can be conducted. Can a fireworks display be conducted at the premises? Do you think there is enough safety distance available?  The minimum is 40m from the firing point to the crowd or any other point in a circle around that central firing point. What time would you like the fireworks display? Allow plenty of time (i.e. 2 weeks minimum) to organise the display. Contact a fireworks contractor to discuss your requirements. Ensure the contractor is licensed and has insurance, and all permits have been submitted. Let your neighbours know in advance so they can attend to animals. Does the contractor have previous records to outline their experience? Has security been organised to monitor the event? Are any obstructions going to be in the area which would hinder setting up? For example, carnival rides, tents, marquees, trees, vehicles.  These types of obstructions not only are a hazard but will prevent the display from being conducted. This is just a small part of the requirements that are a ""Need to Know"" for a display to be conducted.  But with all these items and more free and clear and of adequate safety, we hope you have the most amazing display.  Aerial Pyro-Tech are fireworks Brisbane specialists whom will bring on the cheers and the thrills.  It is always a pleasure to delight all audiences and leave them buzzing for more!"

16,Book Review: The Virgin Diet by JJ Virgin,arts-entertainment," It seems that amongst the continual slog of new diet books coming on the market, more and more of them are touting programs that resemble the classic elimination diet. Given that I do not recommend elimination diets that aren't tailored and unique to each person for many reasons, I thought I would review one of these new books to see if it proves a good guide for helping people change their diet and lose weight or is just another fad. One of the most popular of these books on the market right now is The Virgin Diet by JJ Virgin. The promises of the book start right on the cover. ""Why Food Intolerance is the Real Cause of Weight Gain,"" and ""Drop 7 Foods -- Lose 7 Pounds -- Just 7 Days."" Alright, I'm hooked. Let's start reading. The premise of her book is that hidden food sensitivities are the real reason you can't lose weight. When your immune system is continually taxed and overburdened, the body is less able to shed unneeded weight and instead wants to hold onto fat. I am not sure this is scientifically supported, but I understand what she is trying to say. It tends to make sense and coincides with what I have seen in my own clients. Also, some of the ""weight"" is actually water weight as the body seeks to dilute the problematic foods by making you bloated. In more ways than one, food sensitivities are making you fat. She then dives into what food sensitivities are and how they differ from allergies and food intolerances. All good stuff you need to know. She educates on how food sensitivities cause ongoing inflammation and how that negatively affects your health overall... not just your weight. In fact, while the cover touts all the weight loss benefits of her diet, much of the book discusses how you will alleviate many other symptoms such as fatigue, acne, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation, just to name a few. She also provides some great education on how different types of sugars, especially fructose, are so damaging to our bodies, mainly in how they raise insulin and throw off our fullness/hunger cues. She is spot on in how these sugars make us gain weight, deplete our energy, and increase our hunger. Another area she touches on is leaky gut. I will say, I do agree that leaky gut is real. Many health professionals, especially doctors, would disagree. The premise is that for some people the lining of our small intestine becomes compromised, allowing food particles to get into the bloodstream and attacked by the immune system. This sets us up for food sensitivities. While there is some science to back up what she is saying, the issue is still hotly debated. In any case, she provides a decent discussion on the topic so you get an understanding of why gut health is so important. Virgin then divulges how her diet plan works. It's really simple actually. Eliminate the seven most reactive foods from your for several weeks, then reintroduce each food one at a time and see if your body has a negative response. Then avoid those problematic foods for a good long while. Her ""diet"" ends up being a modified version of the classic elimination diet, or as she has coined it, the Virgin Diet. The next part of her book gets into the nitty gritty of the Virgin Diet. She has a section on each of the seven foods she recommends eliminating along with great information as to why they are problematic and where these foods are often found in our diets. She even gives tips on hidden sources of these foods, especially for soy, corn and wheat, which tend to be found in almost every processed food on the shelf these days. I think this section is particularly helpful as it does provide a good education on why these foods could be messing with your health and how to successfully avoid them. The downside of the Virgin Diet? It comes back to the classic elimination diet. The problem with these diets is that there is no clear way to know which foods to leave in the diet and which ones to take out. Yes, we can take out the ""seven"" most allergenic foods and hope for the best, but what about those that react to other foods? If leaky gut is real, why can't other types of food particles slip through the cracks so to speak as well? It seems she has just taken the seven most common problematic foods into account without addressing the possibility there could be others. That leads me to her section on ""healing foods"" that she highly encourages you to eat throughout this process. Those foods? Coconut, aloe, flaxseed, apples, cold water fish, garlic, onions and oregano. Yes, all foods known to have healing properties, EXCEPT if you react to them. I have clients that cannot eat these foods. I have one that will get terrible diarrhea if he eats apples. This would be devastating to his progress if he were to follow the diet as recommended. For people such as him, this diet will just be more time and money wasted. What disturbs me most about this book is how Virgin insists that you will see amazing and life-changing results by following this plan. I know this is going to devastate many people when their efforts are not rewarded as promised. They may even start to believe that food sensitivities are not their problem when in fact they are just eliminating the wrong foods. Then there are all the ""products"" that get promoted along with the book. If you go on her website and sign up for any of her freebies, you will be forever inundated with emails touting her shakes, bars, supplements, and even exercise equipment. How do I know this? My in-box bears the proof. If you thought you were going to buy this book to lose weight without the expense of professional help, you might fall into the trap of shelling out all your money right to Virgin yourself. Nothing wrong with this, of course, but just beware. In my opinion authors become less credible when the healthy values they promote become wrapped up with multiple add-on products and programs. It can easily become a giant money pit for someone desperate to feel better. Now all that being said, I still would recommend the book as a good guide on healthy diet principles. It provides education into what food sensitivities are, how to avoid certain foods known to be unhealthy for us, and how to have a better relationship with food overall. The last section of her book talks more about how to be a mindful eater, how to add moderate exercise to your lifestyle, and tips for maintaining your new healthy lifestyle. All valuable information presented in an easy-to-read format. So there is my take on the Virgin Diet. Apart from the actual elimination diet, the book can be quite helpful for better understanding your body and taking better care of yourself. If you are truly suffering from food sensitivity issues, consult a professional for a personalized plan to get you better, and ideally get yourself tested for food sensitivities with the right blood test. Otherwise you will likely fail to get the results you are looking for."
17,How Can I Play the Zelda Theme Song?,arts-entertainment," The Legend of Zelda games inspired countless individuals to take up music for the first time. Koji Kondo's compositions that are played throughout the games franchise are truly magical. There is no doubt that when the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra played The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony, Symphony of the Goddesses, in 2011, the music from the video game made it to the mainstream and earned the acclaim of the musical elite all around the world.

18,Dubbing vs. Subtitling: The Pros and Cons,arts-entertainment," We’ve all seen (and affectionately mocked) those badly dubbed martial arts films. You know the ones; incredible stunts, brilliantly elaborate plot lines and sharp dialogue... all dubbed over by American voice actors. Yet, for some people, the charm of these films lies in the out of sync dubbing and cringe-worthy voiceovers. It’s all part of the experience of watching a foreign film. People Power Subtitles or dubbing? It’s one of the most divisive arguments in film history. In 2010, the British Film Council sought to settle the score once and for all with a study to determine audience preferences. The BFC polled audience members of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the original, Swedish version) and the results were rather enlightening. As well as learning more about audience’s preferences in general, the study also revealed how format affects overall enjoyment. It seems that those who watched the subtitled film enjoyed it more with 45% of viewers rating it ‘excellent’ compared to just 26% for the dubbed version. Superior Subtitles The skill of the voice actor can make or break a dubbed film. When recording in an empty studio, the voice actor doesn’t have the same emotional connection to the story and characters. This can result in dry delivery which just doesn’t do justice to the original script. In addition, character traits like sense of humour, vulnerability or little quirks and tics are lost in translation when the original dialogue is dubbed over. Then of course comes the issue of syncing dubbed dialogue with the movement of the actor’s mouth. The variable nature of language means a short phrase in French could be two long sentences in English. Poorly synced dubbing is funny and charming in its own way, but essentially distracts from the film (which we are sure was not the director’s intention!). Subtitles allow the film to be enjoyed in all its glory. The audience can hear the actor’s voices and feel the emotion of each scene all while getting an accurate but concise translation of the dialogue. Of course, subtitles aren’t without fault. They can be difficult to follow, confusing or simply too concise, and yet in many ways they remain superior to dubbing. The End When translating a film for an entirely new audience the most important decision is format. Do you dub or sub? During the course of this article we’ve fought the case for subtitles but this doesn’t necessarily make them the best option for you. There are many variables to consider, such as audience, genre and visuals. For example, if the film is for young children, subtitles may be unpractical due to reading ability and attention span. On the other hand, slow-paced productions, like Nordic TV show The Killing, benefit from the languorous nature of subtitles. Translating is a complex art and doing justice to the original work can feel like Mission Impossible. The most important thing is to think about your audience and choose the format that works for you both. Whether you dub or sub, make sure your production is An Affair to Remember."
19,How to make a LEGO animation,arts-entertainment," If you have not already dusted off you LEGO minifigures now is the time to start digging around in the boxes in your closet, loft or under your bed. Who knows you might find some valuable collectible minifigs hiding in there. Some more rare minifigs from the 70's are worth hundreds of dollars. You can look up ebay to check out the more valuable ones. Once you have your legos collected together you will want to get your hands on a good quality web camera. A lot of webcams that you come across are very cheap and nasty. You will need to purchase a branded webcam from Microsoft or Logitech in order to ensure you get a good quality image. Expect to pay $35 plus. If you are not restrained by cost then I would suggest a Logitech c920 ( approximately $95 ) but boy is it worth the extra bucks. The image quality is superb. And the better the image quality the better the animation will appear to your viewers. The last thing you want to do when animating is use ""daylight"". Animating under sunlight is a disaster. Why? Well sunlight changes second by second because of shading from clouds or simply over the course of the day in terms of position. Thus every time you take a snapshot for your stop motion lego animation the lighting will have changed. The light levels will not be apparent to you but when you play the animation back you will see what appears like ""light flicker"". This is very distracting to the viewer. So in order to avoid it you need to block out daylight to a large extent and use artificial light. Three standard desk lamps will do the job nicely. Place them strategically around your set and perhaps use some paper to dampen down or reflect the harsher lamps to soften the look and avoid light glare. If you are using a PC then I would recommend iKITMovie. If you are using a MAC then I would recommend iStopMotion. If you have no restriction on budget and want to use a DSLR ( digital single lens reflex ) camera then I would recommend DragonFrame. The reason I mention choosing the best stop motion software is that often new animators can make a mistake in choosing. All the software I mentioned has a trial version for you to try out before you purchase. So take the time to download a free trial and see if it matches your needs. In case you have not noticed the days of silent animated movies is gone. You should engage all the senses of the viewer. Adding sound effects is vital to entertain. Adding music to set the mood is also important. Adding a voice to your characters can bring your characters to life. You will need a microphone for your voice and dialog. You can record the voiceover directly in to some stop motion animation software whereas others encourage you to use a separate application and then import the wave or mp3 files once they are complete. iKIT allows you to record directly or import them and it also has over two thousand sound effects included in the application. Alternatively you can download free sound effects from various websites. Just type ""free sound effects"" in to google and you will find them easily."
20,Know Your Guitar Well With Guitar History Specifics,arts-entertainment," The guitar is arguably one of the best instruments to play. This is because besides the guitar being quite intriguing and fun to play, acquiring guitar playing skills is easier than acquiring skills of any other instrument thereof. Most guitarists are very fond of knowing guitar history facts for purposes of understanding the evolution of this instrument quite well. Their history dates back to more than 5,000 years ago when the first guitar was made. There are no concrete facts about the onset of guitars but their introduction is estimated to have taken place around 1400 BC. The first instrument with strings was invented by the Hittites as a four string instrument. This guitar set the basis of the development of the present day one. In 1200 A.D, there was the introduction of the Moorish instrument that came with a wide fingerboard, numerous sound holes and also had a rounded back. The best thing about it is that it was quite easy to play and also produced quite incredible sounds. Later it was replaced by the Latin guitar; an instrument that closely resembles the present days' one. This guitar was an improvement of the Moorish as it had a narrower neck and only one sound hole. The Latin guitar is widely known for its sharp sounds. In the late 1400's, there was the introduction of a new model guitar that was known as the Vihuela. This guitar was evolved from the two guitar versions of the 1400 A.D. Some of the notable aspects about this guitar are that it had 11 frets and a neck that was longer than that of the two guitars. 200 years later, in 1600's the Lute guitar was introduced but unlike in previous situations this guitar did not replace the Vihuela. This is mainly because the Lute was quite hard to play as it had very many strings. It was however modified to a four course guitar that was then easier to play. The best thing about guitar history facts is that these facts have taken a very long time to evolve and give rise to the modern day instrument. There is no other musical instrument that has been taken through many modifications like the guitar. A few decades ago since the 1930's there was the introduction of electric guitars. These instruments are the finest ones in the music industry. This is because of the reason that their development has been greatly boosted by the onset of technology. As of now, they come with very edgy attributes and features. Most guitarists are very fond of playing electric guitars as they are not only very easy to play but also produce superior quality sounds. These guitars are available in all features, dimensions and in the best quality. Presently, there is a wide collection of these guitars produced by different electrical companies all across the globe. The Gibson and Fender guitars have created an incredible legendary history as being the best electric guitars in the market."

2,Experiencing The Art Of Model Ship Construction,arts-entertainment," There are a lot of factors that come into play for the widely ranging types of hobbies that people enjoy.  Whereas for some people putting a puzzle together is an extremely relaxing way to spend hours or days, for others, it drives them completely crazy because it is such tedious work.  Other individuals can't wait to put a brush to a canvas to paint things they imagine or see around them, yet others find it uninteresting because they are not artistic.  Some people scrapbook, are large number play video games, and some like to garden.   Just about any hobby takes a little time, effort, and dedication and when people who participate in that hobby are asked why they enjoy it or what the purpose is, chances are they may not even be able to say.  People typically like the steps involved in putting together or collecting for their hobby, while others enjoy the race to the end to see the finished product of something they like.  This is no different for people who enjoy building ship models.  There is a lot detail, a lot of care, and a lot of historical work that goes into the effort of building any model and of course at the end of all the travail, the builder gets a wonderful model to keep and study. At some point in their lives, any person who makes model ships first started with the toy model ships that many young people put together quite easily.  These beginning efforts weed out those who don't have the patience or the fine touch to move to the next level of models.  The model they buy to work on will probably need even more attention to detail, a substantial amount of assembling and gluing and the correct kind of paint when the model has been put together.  These are usually sold as kits with everything included and are based on very famous ships so that the builder can learn a little more about the history of the actual thing.  It would be expected that these would once again weed out a great many of those who attempt these sorts of projects because they might find that they just do not take pleasure in the tedious work that goes into making it look really good. There are people who will cultivate a passion for building model ships, and as they find out more about the hobby, go on to use superb attention to detail to create stunning models.  At this stage, they might choose to purchase very complicated kits with thousands of scaled pieces that need to be sanded, glued, painted, and assembled and might take literally months if not years to assemble properly.  Some enthusiasts may find themselves seeking out kits that others model builders have created or, at some point, try their hand at making a ship that is made entirely by their own hand.  People who reach this level of building model ships may cut their own wooden pieces, cast their own tiny nails, sew authentic sails and weave tiny ropes to tie everything together.  Builders have the choice of scrutinizing famous, historical ship plans to enable them to build a ship to scale, or perhaps they can see a ship in their own mind's eye that has never been done before and they want to create it. When enthusiasts get to this point in their hobby, it's anyone's guess as to what thing of beauty they will create next.  They will have nearly priceless models of all sorts on display in glass cases in their home or might even donate them to museums that have displays based on the same historical period as the ships they have worked so very hard to create.  While not everyone wants to spend time putting together a beauty of a ship model, but there are plenty more people who just enjoy appreciating the art that others create."

There are many good guitar players that do not know many songs all the way through.  They can play some parts (usually the main, beginning part to the song) but not much more than that.  What these players are missing is a simple, orderly way to analyze songs and reduce them into small, easily-practiced parts that can be mastered individually and then assembled into the complete song. Beginning guitar players are often overwhelmed when trying to learn new songs.  Memorizing all of the chord fingerings and learning to play all of the chord changes smoothly can feel like a major task.  Most of my students have felt this way—it is very common.  I have found that the best way to learn all the chords in a song and master the different parts and chord changes is to use a simple, systematic approach to analyzing and memorizing all of the pieces of the song.  Using this approach will allow you to learn songs quickly and with much less hassle and aggravation and results in you learning the song all the way through from beginning to end. So, why do most guitar players have so much trouble learning complete songs?  There are many reasons: •	Most don’t know how to identify and practice the most difficult parts of the song. •	They just play easy parts (for them) of the song and skip the parts that are hard. •	If they do try to play the hard parts, they make mistakes on them each time they play them—this is majorly frustrating as a guitar player. •	They start playing at the beginning of the song every time they practice it. •	All of these things cause them to get stuck in a loop of not finishing songs.  These guitar players simply give up on the song because they get frustrated and pick something different to try to learn and continue the whole process of not learning complete songs. •	Consequently, they never learn any song all the way through from beginning to end. Now that we’ve identified the problem, let’s look at a good solution. How to be a ""Finisher of Songs"" Most of the chord changes in songs will be fairly easy for you to learn and play. You will still have to practice them, of course, but usually there are only a couple chord changes or parts in most songs that will give you the greatest amount of difficulty and trouble.  So, along with noting the large amount of repetition in most songs, know that all parts of the song will not be equally difficult to master. Playing complete songs does not need to be an overwhelming task.  There are many songs that have lots of repetition of the chords and chord progressions in them—and most songs only have a few parts (verse, chorus, bridge etc.)  Because there is so much repetition in most songs, there are really not that many different chords in them.  Listen to some of your favorite songs with a critical ear and notice that you will hear a lot of repetition of songs parts, chords and melodies in them. If we think about the song in this way, the thought of learning entire songs becomes much less overwhelming.  Remember that there are usually not all that many chords in most songs and that you will only have to practice some of the song parts more than others.  So, the answer to playing and mastering entire songs is based on using a really simple practice method so that you will be able to: •	Easily take note all of the chords you will need to know to play any song. •	Figure out which of those chords you will need to memorize and work on the most in order to master the fingerings. •	Put together a targeted practice plan for the chord changes in the song so that you can conquer all of them in the shortest amount of time. •	Get all of these pieces in place and play the complete song with less practice time. These are the steps for learning and mastering chords, chord changes and playing complete songs: On a piece of paper write the names of all the chords in the song.  Use the sheet music to go through the entire song and list each chord one time. Make diagrams of all those chords in the song that you just listed.  Diagram each chord one time. Look at all of the chords in your list. Note which ones you are already can play and the ones that need to be learned. Now go through all the chord changes in the song one by one and write them out.  List each chord change once. Go through each chord change listed and figure out which ones are the hardest for you to play.  This is the most step is the most crucial part of this practice plan. Most of your practice time will need to be spent practicing the chord changes that are hard for you.  This is the key to this lesson and to learning complete songs:   Working the chord changes that are difficult for you to play and practice them until they are easy for you."
5,Backing Tracks For Musicians,arts-entertainment," If you have played in a band or with other musicians you will know that there is no better buzz than when you play a song as a group and it just comes together and sounds just as good as the original. However, most singers and musicians will tell you that this comes at a price, as to be able to experience this musical high, you have to find musicians to make up your band, which is far easier said than done, when you take into account that ideally you have to live reasonably close to each other, like the same music, be at a similar skill level, and of course be able to get on together. Sounds easy enough, but if you live in a remote area, where there is not an abundance of musicians, this can become a mammoth task which will often lead to frustration and disappointment. If you can't find musicians in your area and still want the sound and feel of playing with other musicians you could consider using a backing track as there are many to be found on the internet nowadays. There are literally thousands of jam tracks as they are known that are basically chord progressions of music repeated over and over so that you can practice improvising your guitar solo's too. Whilst these are great practice aids to help with your improvisation skills, when  learning a new song it can be very beneficial to practice playing along to a backing track of that song before you meet up with the band for live rehearsals, or to just play along to if you are not in a band. A great form of backing track to play along to is one which includes vocals, as many available online do not give this option and you find yourself having to sing along in your head so that you don't loose your place in the song, not so good if you can't sing and want to truly focus on your playing. Try using a backing track that contains vocals and see how much easier it is to just concentrate on your playing, which will help you to develop your technique and sense of timing, and is much more fun. Also there are now recordings in a multitrack format which are basically the studio masters of a song and are much like a backing track, but much more versatile as they include every instrument and vocal of the song and can be played in any music editing software, which also then gives you complete control over every element of the song. For example, if you wanted to learn a particular guitar part, you could simply mute all of the other instruments in the song to isolate the guitar part that you want to learn and then use your music editors functions to slow the guitar track down, or loop a section of it so that it repeats over and over so that you can hear exactly what notes are being played by the guitar. This particular type of backing track has become very popular with music teachers as the multitracks are so versatile and are ideal for helping to teach guitar, bass, or drums, as you can isolate any instrument and any part of a song enabling you to get a better understanding of how it is played. If you enjoy playing guitar, bass, or drums, it is certainly worth checking out backing tracks, or a multitrack that gives you the option to have vocals included in the song as it makes the whole experience of playing much more enjoyable."

7,Why Dish Cable TV May be Your Best Choice,arts-entertainment," Cable television has been around since the late 1950’s and, for many years, it did not have any real competition when it came to premium television service. A home that was lucky enough to be in an area that had cable had access to the best programming that the cable service had to offer. If the cable company decided to raise its rates without adding programming, then there was little that the consumers could do. Then Dish cable TV service came along and changed all of that. One of the original inspirations for a satellite television service was to reach markets that cable could simply not reach. Farm communities and rural towns that were miles from major metropolitan areas went without premium television programming for decades because the cable companies did not deem those communities worth the financial investment required to run the wiring out to their areas. Satellite came along and solved the problem for those communities and gave them Dish cable TV. As a service to those rural communities, the satellite companies became quite good at offering comprehensive pay per view services for movies, sports events and other special occasions. The amount of pay per view offered by satellite was significant because the people in rural communities often did not have a movie theater to visit or, if they did have a theater in town, that theater would not get first-run movies until months after the movies had been released. Satellite service solved that problem by developing a large selection of pay per view channels that eclipsed anything cable television offered. It did not take the satellite companies long to figure out that the expanded pay per view services offered by Dish cable TV may be something that people in major metropolitan areas may also want. When the satellite providers started offering their services to people in the suburbs and cities, they found a ready and willing audience. Satellite television service was created and developed to cater to the needs of the customer. Where cable television tells its subscribers what they programming they will be getting, satellite TV made its reputation by responding to the needs of its customers and providing the kinds of services that people actually want. Any consumer who is looking for a premium television option that offers the kinds of services that he may actually want should take a long look at satellite television and see what it has to offer."
8,Which DISH TV Channels Are Right for You?,arts-entertainment," One of the more convenient aspects of satellite television is its focus on consumer-oriented premium television solutions. When a consumer chooses a service such as DISH TV, he then must sit down and decide which channels to include with his service. In the early days of satellite television, a consumer had to commit to two or more dishes on his property if he wanted premium channels. These days, the technology allows all channels to be provided by one dish and that helps to enhance the choices for each person. A primary market that is covered by satellite providers that cannot be reached by cable companies is people in rural areas. There are some beautiful homes in the farm country of America that has been unable to enjoy premium television programming for decades. Satellite service took care of that, but it was not the only thing that satellites took care of. Most people who live in rural areas do not have immediate access to movie theaters. That makes seeing the best new releases extremely difficult. Satellite television providers saw a need in this market and created a huge variety of ""on demand"" and pay per view movie channels. Some of the most popular DISH TV channels are the ones that allow consumers to see first run movies either as they are being released into theaters, or before they are shown on the cable movie networks. Some DISH TV channels are networks that can only be seen by subscribers to the satellite service. The entire premium television programming industry has recognized the potential profitability of having networks that are proprietary to each company. When a show catches on for a proprietary network, that results in more subscribers to that service. There are several DISH TV channels that cannot be seen on any other service, and they offer original programming as well. One of the most significant choices a consumer will have to make when he decides to take on the DISH TV system is what channels he will want for his service. They come in a variety of packages and some of them are networks that cannot be seen anywhere else. A consumer should take his time and look over the comprehensive list of channels that his satellite provider offers to make sure he is getting everything he wants. It only takes one dish to deliver more channels than cable could ever hope to provide. That is one of the many advantages of satellite television."

13,What Makes a Good Mystery,arts-entertainment," Since I am a much better reader of mysteries than a writer I feel somewhat qualified to throw my oars into the water in giving my opinion about the qualities of a good mystery. We may all have our particular settings or styles or the love of blood or lack thereof in our mysteries I think we can all unite on one thing. A good mystery requires a good story. Maybe that is the basic element of any book in any genre, even in non-fiction. The story has to get our attention and make us want to read more. For mystery books there has to be some element of the unknown that we are promised will be revealed if only we hang around long enough. Or even if we know 'who dun it' how the perpetrators are brought to justice or not may be enough to hold us fast to our seats and keep us turning the pages. But how the story is told and the definition of the main characters are close behind in terms of factors that make up a good mystery. Style, pace and plot development are keys to ensuring that the reader is not just entertained, but engaged along the way. The sub-genres of mystery start diverging here, particularly around style which tends to involve detailed and sometimes flowery descriptions in cozies or technically detailed forensic talk in police procedurals. But they all come back together when it comes to the flow of the story. Good mysteries in all forms have a rhythm that somehow just seems right. Great mystery writers have the 'Goldilocks' touch: not too fast, not too slow, just right! Great characters are another key to great mysteries. We all remember the giants like Poirot or Miss Marple or Rebus or any number of great cat writers. But I find that it is actually the sub-cast of characters that separate the great from the good. And it's not usually the person or persons who get killed that are the most interesting. It's the Corporal under the Sergeant, or the old friend who always shows up with advice or a bottle of scotch at exactly the right time. But what really sets the mystery category aside from all other writing is the added characteristic of surprise. Every mystery book has a few twists and turns but a great mystery book has an absolutely brilliant surprise. It may be that the butler didn't actually do it, but he was certainly involved in helping the less than legitimate heir bury the bodies. Or an unheard of relative who surfaced just after the will is read or… you get the picture. Reading a great mystery book is like having a candle to light the way down a dark and unfamiliar hallway. You don't know what you are going to find down there, but you just have to go and see for yourself."

20,Using Time-Lapse Photography to Save Money on Construction Projects,arts-entertainment," Time lapse photography and time lapse footage can help save money and increase profit on both large scale and small scale construction projects.  It’s a bold claim, given that timelapse photography seems remote and far removed from the construction world, but let’s think about this together, and see if we can reach any conclusions. Time-lapse photography is a lengthy and difficult process, but essentially it’s where a series of photographs are taken from a fixed point at prescribed intervals, and then the individual shots or frames are edited together.  When this edit is played back at 25 frames per second, it has the effect of condensing the passage of time into manageable chunks, where the viewer can easily see and appreciate large scale changes in only a couple of minutes. How can this be of benefit to you if you are the construction manager or project manager on a building site?  Well, any sufficiently complex construction project will have a well-defined, and rigidly adhered to, schedule of work.  This schedule of work will tell the management team everything they need to know in terms of getting materials, plant and labour to the right place at the right time. But how closely is this plan monitored against actual events?  And how reliable is the information you have received?  Having time-lapse footage of the entire project can give you an invaluable resource to compare against your schedule of work.  You will be able to tell, visually, whether the materials, plant and labour arrived at the correct location, in the right order and at the right time.  It will obviously be too late to do anything about it by this point.  However, next time you have to write your schedule of work for the next project, you will have better knowledge and will be able to make a more informed choice about when to order what you need.  That timelapse footage will enable you to get the equipment, materials and labour on site just-in-time, meaning that you won’t be tying up valuable resources wastefully.  That means more profit on the job, or the ability to offer services more cost effectively than your competitors. One other way in which such services can not only save you money, but are very useful, is in the area of ultra high definition site monitoring. The best time-lapse companies offering time-lapse services also allow you to view your project through on-line viewers from desktops, smartphones and tablets. This means that you, your surveyors, architects, etc can view very clear images (much better than any webcam) to discuss and share etc.  You can also offer this service to your clients and stake-holders etc. These images, taken with the correct HD equipment (Again NOT just webcams) can allow you to zoom into particular areas of your site/project to scrutinise particular detail. This makes any monitoring and discussions about the site very convenient, even for those who cannot get to the actual location of the project. Plus….If all this wasn’t enough – any marketing people can use either the individual ‘still’ frames, or even the live feed to websites in order to communicate to broader publics."

1,Benefits of DISH Satellite TV,arts-entertainment," When people are watching television, they want to have as many channels as possible.  They want to watch whatever they want whenever they want, and having dish capabilities allows people to make the most of their viewing experience.  Whether people are with their family for the weekend or are having friends over, satellite television can make the night more enjoyable. While cable television is great, satellite television, full of many added features, gives people more for their buck.  Even more, people can watch more sports channels on satellite television, making any home a sports haven on Sundays.  People can watch any type of sport with these packages, such as soccer or baseball.  One of the worst things to experience from a fan’s perspective is to miss out on games during a team’s playoff run.  These games are crucial to watch because there is so much meaning behind them, and people have access to every single one of these games when they go with satellite television. Another added benefit that comes with satellite television is that people have free installation when they use dish services.  Some people may be consumed with work or school, and they may not have the time to set up their television equipment themselves.  Professionals can come out to a person’s home and setup these devices, and these professionals have years of experience to get the job done correctly. People get many extra features when they decide to go with satellite television.  Parents can safeguard their children’s viewing when they are watching television.  Children sometimes flip to channels that are not appropriate for their age, and having parenting controls prevents this from even happening.  They will not be exposed to violent images at such a young age, allowing the parents to rest easy. Another benefit of satellite TV is that people can set reminders for their favorite shows.  People will be able to see when their favorite programs are about to start so they don’t miss a thing.  A message will appear on the television, reminding them that their program is about to start. In addition to these features, people have 24 hour customer support in case their devices malfunction during their programing. People are always looking for added value when it comes to television programing, and satellite TV provides this and gives people an impeccable cinema experience when they are at home.  They will have the capabilities to watch all of their favorite shows and movies at an affordable price year round."
2,The Importance of Online Music PR for EDM and Urban Music Artists,arts-entertainment," In today’s world it seems that everyone wants to be a singer, rapper, producer etc, the list goes on and on, but it has not always been something that has been achievable to the masses due to restriction such as finding a label that will sign you, and once finding a label, getting a contract that allows the artist to have the creative control they desire. However for a while now the music industry has started to evolve, making the once impossible very possible and its down to two key things, the uprising of the independent record label and the birth of web 2.0, it is now possible for everyone to musician or record label owner. Now it is no longer necessary for aspiring musicians to even be signed to a label, be it and indie or a major. With the birth of web 2.0 it is possible for artist to be visible within their market with the use of online tools to map out some form of PR strategy. We are no longer restricted to hearing new artists via radio play and the record store’s new artist sections. In today’s society everybody is online with their own individual online presence enabling them to interact with the masses through the use of social media, which includes social networks, websites and Apps. This now means that as an artist you have an audience of maximum reach as there are no limits to your distribution. A couple of UK artist we can see that heavily use online PR within the urban scene includes the likes of, Wiley, Skepta, JME, Lethal Bizzle and the list continues. These artists use social media including Twitter, Facebook and official websites to interact with fans and keep them up to date on new releases, tours, competitions, merchandise availability and also to show the world that they are human through normal interaction and conversation with their fan base. Lethal Bizzle is a UK artist and entrepreneur who is a great example of how online PR should be used by all artists and record labels to give them more visibility with their market and to generate revenue. Bizzle 30, of Walthamstow, London has been on the urban scene since 2002 but managed to stay underground till 2004 when he released POW which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 11 in its first week on the chart in 2005, and which reached number one on the UK Dance Chart. However he disappeared from the commercial scene up until 2011 when he re-released POW (2011) and started using a host of social media to interact with his fans. Bizzle currently uses YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, his official website staydench.com and Stay Dench app as PR tools that help him promote his music, brand (Stay Dench), merchandise and last but not least communicate with his consumers. The use of such tools have allowed Bizzle to reach a market which spans further than those who listen to UK urban and dance music. Online practices of PR allow for people who wouldn’t necessarily be a part of an artist primary audience to see what they are doing and what they are about, in many cases this often leads that individual to want to find out more about that artist which in time can leave them being a new fan/consumer. The Urban and EDM industry are ones that don’t always see many artists make it on commercial level but instead it sees their artists remain in the underground realm. This no longer has to be the case and this is because we now have access to online PR. Online music PR is a service that Urban and EDM artists should exploit. As mentioned before the online PR allows musicians to reach a much bigger audience than if they were to just use traditional offline PR methods, which will often just target media that that particular artist’s primary audience interacts with. Online PR is what I like to call proactive, it enables you go out and get the artist music or product seen by whoever your audience may be, directly. Once you have high visibility online it will open artists to a whole host of opportunities that will benefit their carrier. Furthermore Online PR eliminates the waiting around that is normally involved in offline PR which involves sending press releases to journalist and bloggers that may or may not get back to you. Lastly online PR allows the artist or record label to have more control over what is being said about the artist and their work, it also allows you to still engage with the fans from a remote location. All in all online PR is the way forward it is mobile with an unlimited reach."
3,"Record the Right Way, With a Professional Quality Recording Studio",arts-entertainment," Making the decision to start recording as a musician means that you’ve got a sound that you believe is special, and you think that listeners will benefit from hearing it. You’ve put your time in at the local open mics and a few featured gigs, but now is the time to see how much farther your music can travel if given the convenience and portability of a mixtape or a demo. The problem then becomes, how can a burgeoning artist or band record their music with professionalism on a minimalist’s budget? To fight against this, many artists will simply buy home recording equipment on discount and attempt to build their own incarnation of a recording studio in their basement or garage, using pillows and blankets to dampen the sound. Aside from taking more time and effort than renting a professional quality recording studio, a home recording will simply create an inferior product and do little to help your career as a musician. Renting a professional recording studio for high quality music production will create recordings worth listening to; recordings that will show your dedication and talent through the clarity of each note. Any musician or artist would love to believe that recording quality is secondary to the actual music being listened to. Good songwriting and earnest performance can shine through the technical limitations of any record, right? The harsh reality, however, is the opposite. With the sheer volume of musicians producing and recording these days, any music recording that isn’t exemplary of top tier production will immediately receive a demerit from the listener (whether they’re a recording professional or a potentially influential fan). Especially if you’re hoping to have your demo get into the hands of an A&R exec or other music promoter, a professional music recording studio will afford you the high quality recordings you need to be taken seriously. Next, a recording studio will have producers and technicians on hand that are specialized in using the equipment in the studio. You are a musician. Especially in the early parts of your career, you should be focused on cultivating your songwriting and refining your voice as an artist. Spend time perfecting your music rather than learning how to produce and work the technical aspects of professional grade music recording equipment. Professional producers have the talent and the trained ear for sound and subtly that will help them calibrate the equipment and get the best recording out of your performance possible. Finally, chances are high that making music is only a secondary money earning gig until you can really get off the ground as an artist. Being budgeted and cost conscious will pay off major dividends for an artist, enabling the use of the most cutting edge and precise equipment without the heavy investment that comes with funding your own comparable studio at home. To save further on studio time, cultivate a few songs to perfection, and book studio time to record them at the professional level. The result will be a demo that shows the best that you have to offer. A demo that sounds crisp and professional in a way that couldn’t possibly be matched with a more expensive personal kit recorded at home."
4,How I Became a Mystery Writer,arts-entertainment," How I Became a Mystery Writer A funny thing happened to me on the way to becoming a fiction writer. I ended up in mystery. I'm not really sure how I got here or why. But, after being here for a little while I think I like it. I have been a freelance writer, ghost writer, content article churner, SEO and keyword specialist, editor, associate publisher, social policy developer, and family Christmas chronicler since forever. But my fiction works could fit into one school exercise book. And mystery was not one of my major areas of interest. Actually that is a bit of a lie because when I discovered all of the various sub-genres of mystery and crime I found that I already liked many of them. That includes some old-time stuff like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and Poirot. And a ton of the British series like A Touch of Frost and Midsomer Murders. When I dug a little further I realized that I also liked detectives, police procedurals, cozies, hard-boiled, locked-room, true crime, amateur and professional sleuth, legal, medical, suspense, and historical mystery series and books. There really wasn't much mystery that I didn't like. What appealed to me about mystery was that with the exception of true crime, and that might even be included if you think about the ingenuity of the criminals, all of these genres and subdivisions relied on one basic premise: telling a good story that was pure fiction and imagination. That drew me in and kept me prisoner every time. It was the love of a good story that brought me into mystery writing. First, the reading and enjoying of it. And now the creation of my own. But I actually think it is the people inside this genre who will keep me here. That starts with my fellow writers, the famous and the soon to be, who have almost to a person invited me into the fraternity/sorority of mystery writers with helpful hints, advice, reviews and guidance along the way. They have encouraged me to write well, write better, and write more. And it is the mystery lovers who sustain me. Every single one who stops by when I'm sitting alone, probably feeling sorry for myself, at a book signing, and they say hello and ask about my book. They don't have to buy it, although that's nice. They have already given me a gift by acknowledging the fact that I am a mystery writer. I am one of them. I have one book out and another in editing and the third rolling around from back to forth in my head, sometimes waking me up in the middle of the night to look for a pad and paper. I have never been happier in my life. It may have taken me a long time to get here but I plan on staying."

6,Getting Your Book out of Your Head and onto the Bookshelves,arts-entertainment," Getting Your Book out of Your Head and onto the Bookshelves Step One: Write It sounds very simple but the first step in getting a book published is to start writing it. Just about everyone who I meet that knows I have published a book tell me some variation of the story about their book; the one that hasn't been written yet. Their questions include is it hard? Yes, but it's much harder if you don't start. Or, how did you find a publisher or do you have an agent? Those are the wrong questions. It is hard to write a book but the only way to make it any easier is to start writing. You can start with an outline, you can start with identifying your themes or main characters, or you can start by writing a short story instead of a book. If you want to write a book then pick up your pen or turn on your computer and get started. Once you get started there a billion suggestions about to make it a good, even great book, online or from successful authors. But you have to start. Forget about getting a publisher or an agent or what you will say to people at your book launch and just write. Step Two: Share Once you have written the first chunk of your book then you have to share what you've written with people that will give you feedback. Your friends and family are the best choice for your first round. They love you, I hope, and like you as well so they are likely going to be kind in their critique of your initial work of genius. Ask them to tell you not just whether or not they liked it, even though your ego really, really wants them to, but the parts they liked and even more importantly what they didn't like about your creation. If you have not learned this lesson already, now is the time to learn to graciously accept feedback. All of it. The only way your writing and your book will improve is if you can hear criticism and not take it personally. Remember that these are the people who like you. When you get out in the real world, publishers, agents, book reviewers and critics are mean and will not care one whit about your feelings. So share your writing early and often Step Three: Talk to the Pros After you have completed what you think is a decent draft of your book you will need some professional advice. You need to find someone who has published a book to talk to. Ask them what they did and thank them. Ask them to have a look at your book and make suggestions. Find a (cheap) editor who will have a look at your book and offer their guidance. The reason that you want a cheap editor at this point is that your work is probably not worth a full editing treatment yet. It may be someday but not yet. You can usually find local published authors on a general Google search but you can also look up local author organizations. Or check out the national groups and associations of authors and writers. If you are writing in a particular genre like mystery for example there are tons of mystery and crime contacts online. Writing magazines also have listing at the back of their mags of fairly cheap editing services that you can try out. Step Four Decide on Your Route If you want to go the traditional publishing route, good luck. It really is like trying to find a way to squeeze through the eye of a needle. All of you and your book too! To get a major publisher to take on your book you have to be famous already or have an agent. To get an agent you have to get thorough their maze of assistants and gatekeepers just to get them to have a look at a sample of your work. If you can't get an agent then it's very difficult to get a traditional publishing contract. You can try, but prepare to spend at least a year and a whole lot of rejection trying. There are however many other options today courtesy of self-publishing and e-books. E-books are an option because for about $100.00 you can get your manuscript formatted to fit all the major e-book types and also get it up on sale on Amazon and all other major e-book retailers. Self-publishing is also effective and fairly inexpensive, especially POD (Print on Demand) models that only print books when they are published. For less than $1,000.00 you can get your name up in lights. Well not really but you can have a professionally produced book and e-book that is ready for the bookshelves."

10,Are You Set to Make a Song?,arts-entertainment," Are you set to make a song? I'm going to touch on three points on what it takes to make a song from top to bottom. First off come up with the song title for your song. A song title can do a good deal in making what that song will be about musically and lyrically early on which can make your job less complicated moving for work. Certain titles are better than others, of course. For example, you might take into account coming up with a song name which suggests some sort of back story which can make coming up with the topic and subject matter of that tune lyrically much easier. On the other hand you can also come up with a theme rich title which exudes a particular feeling which that song will possess. Also, once we get our song title we can come up with our initial hook. This is the most challenging element of writing a song because the most difficult part of a lot of things is getting started. How we do this when we are going to make a song is to take our title and try throwing different notes at each word and syllable in that title. Different combinations such as stretching notes over numerous syllables or going staccato and assigning one note per syllable or even numerous notes per each syllable works to give you a lot of different ideas to work with. To further complicate things and give you more options, work with putting different chord progressions within the key you're working in all around that melody you have come up with. Different progressions can drastically modification the effect and efficacy of that hook. Remember that a strong hook is equal parts the melody as well as the support around it which involves the progression and the instrumentation. Once you've your initial hook it becomes far less difficult to branch out in either direction to make up the rest of the tune. There is nobody perfect tune structure, so don't bind yourself to a particular verse chorus verse chorus formula. Often times the best and most interesting tracks are those which make a lot of interesting changes and to deviate from the standard structure. Lastly, writing lyrics can be the most challenging element for some people. The good news is that starting out with the music makes writing lyrics that a great deal less difficult because we already get some idea as we come up with every bit musically the kind of rhyming or timing structure we need to stick to. Then, after you come up with your initial line for a particular section of your tune, you know the rhyming structure and will stick to that which narrows down the kinds of rhymes you are going to be searching to use. While it seems like it's limiting you and constricting you, in reality you'll have much more done because you be a lot more focused and writing. As I have only scratched the surface so far, I suggest that you refer to my complete resource on songwriting, ""How to Write a Song - The No BS Songwriter's Bible"" as this covers every element of songwriting from top to bottom as well as dozens of tips and tricks which you can use to successfully jump start the songwriting procedure and force musical hook ideas to come to you."

12,Relevant Advice That Will Help You Decide On The Ultimate Filming Spot,arts-entertainment," ""Aaaaaaaand action!"" These two well-known words are notorious in the film business, and when it is declared, the film crew must be all set to shoot the scene. However, on occasion, important things may go wrong, and when that occurs, it can be expensive, you can lose valuable time, and you can use up priceless resources to correct the blunders. That's why it is so important to look at filming locations ahead of time, to make sure that they fit all your needs. The few suggestions here are necessary to apply when you are studying different locales for a film shoot. One of the biggest problems for finding filming locations is choosing ones you can hold on short notice. Plenty of places ask you to make a reservation weeks, sometimes months, in advance. Developing a back-up plan of places is important if your first location does not work out. As you call around, inquire to the managers about the number of weeks in advance they are booked out, and if they're open to allowing you to call on short notice. The day of the week that you get the booking can also be very crucial to think about. A great deal of places will not let you film on weekdays, because they have standard business hours running and you would be in the way. When you make your list of places to film, decide which locations enable you to film through the normal weekday. This will lead to arranging your film crew to shoot on locations that are best suited for the venue and more difficult-to-shoot places appropriately. In public locations, you could have trouble with arbitrary people walking through or arriving at your set unintentionally. This may be especially very challenging on the weekends, when individuals are off work and more prone to walk around. When you decide your weekend locations, be sure to have a plan in place that should direct the flow of traffic for people around the area. Would you ask those random individuals to just hang around and look normal within your shot? Another question to ask yourself is, should you rope off the location or will you only permit the employed actors to be on location? Do you have the manpower and assistance from the local government bodies to be able to prohibit public access to a big enough area for your scene? It's important to avoid a filming location which you cannot maintain control of. Something that many people don't bother to take into account is the crime rate at your filming location. It's essential to always have excellent security put on set, because if you do not, you run the potential risk of endangering your crew or getting your valuable equipment stolen. Unless you are willing and able to get enough security to defend yourselves against this kind of possibilities, then it may very well be smart to choose another location for your movie. So, be sure to answer the next questions when deciding your film set: Can you get yourself a location on brief notice? Can you shoot on a weekday? Is it possible to manage the public crowds? Can you secure your crew, location and gear from crime? When you can answer these kinds of fundamental questions, you will then be well-informed capable to decide the very best location to film."

20,Giclée: The WOW! Factor in Fine Art Prints,arts-entertainment," In 1991, Jack Duganne, a printmaker, searched high and low for an accurate word to describe his new digital printing process, and he came up with ""Giclée"" (pronounced: zhee-KLAY). This French word means ""nozzle"" and the verb form ""gicler"" means ""to squirt, spurt, or spray.""  To say that Giclée is a high tech reproduction or even pointing out that it is done in very high resolution and high fidelity simply does not truly paint a picture in the mind's eye of what Giclée really is, and a person won't fully understand until they see one. Giclée, the pinnacle of modern art print technology, is used to reproduce an artist's original work so well that it is very hard to distinguish from the original. Giclée does not incorporate mechanical screens or dots like older printing methods, so there are no dot patterns visible to the human eye. Sophisticated Giclée images faithfully reproduce all the beautiful tones and hues that the artist originally produced. A Giclée printer squirts out a continuous tone of over four-million microscopic droplets of ink, per second, onto either paper or canvas and the output may commonly be found in art galleries, museums, and photo galleries. In the early days an IRIS ink-jet printer which was able to produce millions of colors using continuous-tone technology was used, but today's technology far surpasses the early machines. Now large production Giclée printers are made by HP, Epson, Canon, and others but there are no ""desk top"" models so you still have to go to a specialist to get a Giclée done. One of the most amazing aspects of Giclée is that nearly any media from acid free watercolor paper and canvas, to vinyl or transparent acetates can be used. Instead of dyes, pigment inks are used to produce long lasting high-resolution continuous tone prints with a brighter more accurate look than former older print processes could produce. Under normal conditions, if archival inks and materials are used, a Giclée print should last from sixty to two-hundred years, depending upon the actual environment of the displayed print. Of course, hanging a print in direct sunlight is not recommended. Most companies put a layer of anti-fade UV protection over the print to improve longevity. Many modern artists paint digitally so there is no physical work to hang on a wall. Some artists use digital scans of their physical artwork to make reproductions of their work. Giclée addresses both formats by creating an entirely new reproduction medium for artists and art lovers. Each piece is individually produced so an artist is not obligated to make a certain number of prints. They can choose to make only one if they like. You don't even have to ""be an artist"" to create beautiful high quality art prints from your own personal photos of people, places, pets, and vacation memories. In a very short period of time, without huge up-front costs, by using high resolution scans or your own high resolution digital photos, Giclée canvas prints can be created for your own living room or for gifts for special people in your life. Giclée on canvas can be gallery-wrapped, or stretched onto a frame of thick wooden bars with no visible fasteners (such as staples or tacks) creating a finished product which can be hung without framing.

Procrastination is really a contact to action. Avoiding the very tasks that may provide you with the benefits you're after in Ultimate Power Profits  is just not very intelligent. You have got to step up and strengthen your resolve. The easiest option to snap your self into action is by making a choice. Selection could be the father of action and all action flows from decisions.

Like any other skill you should get better at creating choices by creating more of them and as you develop this capability you'll get superior at overcoming procrastination until you ultimately create the habit of being decisive. A truly committed selection will turn your ""shoulds"" into ""musts."" In reality, this crucial distinction separates procrastinators from action minded and decisive achievers. All of us get what we've to have and we only get our ""shoulds"" when it can be handy. By far the most typical reason why people today  procrastinate is the fact that they just do not ""feel"" like carrying out it. When you don't really feel like doing it, it merely means that you associate far more discomfort to taking action than to staying away from it.

3,Great Marketing Tips for Aspiring Wedding Photographers,arts-entertainment," Over the past 25 years as a wedding photographer I have had the opportunity to speak with well over a thousand engaged couples. I am always surprised by some of the criteria many of them use to choose their wedding photographer.  Here are 7 tips I can offer to  wedding photographers to help them book a wedding. DON’T CREATE  YOUR PORTFOLIO ALBUMS  BASED SOLELY ON YOUR ""GREATEST HITS.""  There is nothing more misleading regarding a photographer's talent than looking at a sample wedding album that is a compilation of their best shots at 50 different weddings. An album such as this may be useful in understanding just how great an image you are capable of producing, but that's really all it tells your client. Show albums that display one entire wedding from start to finish. A good wedding photographer should be able to produce a number of complete albums to show the client.  Be sure and explain to your client why this is such a better way to assess your skill.  Use this to separate yourself from your competitors!  Tell your client that virtually anybody with a decent camera can get one great shot per wedding. ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS DURING THE SALES PITCH.  Every photographer can tell their clients great things about themselves and so they should. But in your initial wedding consultation with the couple, show your interest in what they want by asking questions. Ask them the types of photography styles they are interested in and what they are looking for in a wedding photographer.  Don’t make the initial meeting just one long boring lecture about how wonderful you are.  Turn it into a 2-way conversation.  Show them you care! SHOW THEM YOUR SPARKLING PERSONALITY!  This is a biggie. Your clients understand that they will spend the entire day with the photographer. If you can’t get along, it can ruin what should be the happiest day of their lives.  The bride and groom are looking for someone they can build rapport with.  Be that person! AVOID TALKING ABOUT YOUR EQUIPMENT.  Want to put the bride and groom to sleep?  Start giving them the technical details about how wonderful your equipment is.  Keep in mind that your client is ASSUMING you have great equipment.  That is a given to them.  Focus on why YOU are the best wedding photographer for them, not why Nikon is better than Canon. KEEP THE PRICING SIMPLE. If your clients can't understand the pricing or packages, they will probably keep looking. Package pricing, if flexible, is the best way to go. It allows your client to have a better idea of what their final bill will be. Ala carte pricing can confuse and be misleading. You don’t want to surprise the couple when presenting the the final bill. Allow your clients to design their own package, be flexible. TELL THE BRIDE AND GROOM YOU WANT TO SHOOT THEIR WEDDING!  Don’t assume they know that.  Tell them, it will make them feel wanted."
4,Seating Rentals in Phoenix - Ideas,arts-entertainment," Any type of temporary event such as a wedding or outdoor party, conference, etc requires an array of rental companies to provide different services. What some people don't realize is that it's possible to extend rental options to even less-than-obvious necessities like chairs and furniture. In fact, if your event may have a lack of seating arrangements, the best option is to find seating rentals in Phoenix that cater to everywhere from Scottsdale to Tempe. These companies use large storage vehicles to transport everything needed to outfit a full array of seating arrangements and accessories to any type of event. Some of the types of equipment provided by seating rentals in Phoenix include chairs designed for practicality as well as luxury atmosphere, as well as plenty of additional accessories that range from fine China to even entire dance floors that can be rented out and used for an occasion. When renting from a supplier like this, it's important to consider what type of event is being planned and what types of furniture matches. A casual event may not need expensive Chiavari chairs and could be more suited for basic lawn chairs. On the other hand, a wedding should stick with something a bit more upscale. Other types of seating rentals in Phoenix include barstools, which can also go with on-the-spot outdoor bars that can be placed in both outdoor and indoor locations. Providing a bar at an event not only enhances any party, but it can also help monetize some of the expenses associated with hosting an expensive event when you are able to charge for drinks. Make sure that any rental bar comes equipped with extra features from LED lighting to working tap. It may also be a good idea to rent the needed glassware with a bar. A private event host probably doesn't have access to the full spectrum of glasses that a bartender needs, and this includes everything from martini glasses to shakers and steins. Along with the bar, the entire process of hosting an event—whether in Arizona or anywhere—can be a long and detail oriented process that requires careful consideration of everything that's needed. Forgetting a major component of an event could hinder the entire process and leave guests with a sub-par experience. For more information about seating rentals in Arizona contact one of the local high quality companies that is ready to assist with the process."
5,DISH Satellite Service - How to Get the Right Service Provider,arts-entertainment," When it comes to choosing the best satellite provider, you may be wondering, ""What is the difference?"" Well, the difference lies not only in the affordability of the channel packages, but the customer service and reliability. When looking for reviews for DISH satellite services, look for some of the best customer reviews, sheer numbers of available channels, as well as excellent reviews for customer service. You need to decide what features are you most interested in, price or availability of your favorite sports channels? Helpful customer service or wider package offers? These will determine who you need for your service. Perhaps the most important consideration, aside from budget, is which DISH satellite service can give you the best reception in your area. It would not make much sense to pay for shows you cannot view because of interrupted service. Ask around and see what people around you have been using, and if you get a consistent answer, you may need to look into contacting that satellite service company. You can also go online and see what is available in your area, and which company has the best reviews for customer service and overall quality of choices and viewing clarity. Since most companies will require you to sign a contract for a specific period of time, figuring out which DISH satellite service company is right for you can be a daunting task. Weigh the program channel options, the pricing options and the discounts or coupons you may be able to use, and that can help you find what fits in your home the best. Whether you need high tech or low maintenance, you can find information and reviews online. You can also double check any unlisted fees as well, in order to avoid unpleasant surprises when you get your first bill. Like with any product, a good satellite service company needs to have competitive pricing, client friendly options and great customer service. Once you know what your television viewing, budget and technological needs are, you can start researching which company offers which options in your area. While word of mouth does have its place to help you research, you need to remember that not everyone has the same expectations or tastes. Use your own judgment and use the internet as a good tool and you can find the information you need to get the best satellite to meet your specific expectations."
6,Get Satellite TV - Feel the Difference!,arts-entertainment," Millions of television viewers across the United States worry about the poor picture and sound quality of their television programs. If you are one of unhappy customers, get satellite TV. Satellite TV works by transmitting signals from the television station to a geosynchronous satellite orbiting the Earth. The satellite sends the signals directly to the dish, or the antenna, installed on your property. A Low Noise Block, or LNB, device in the antenna converts the signals into a format that can be interpreted by your television. All the satellite TV signals travel in straight line unlike the land-based cable signals that move in curved paths. This prevents the interruption of the satellite signals by trees and buildings on the Earth, and you can be assured of top quality sound and picture. However, satellite TV is not only about high quality picture and sound. You also have access to more than 300 different channels that are divided into comprehensive packages which are competitively priced. Each package offers something for everyone. You can also choose high definition channels to further enhance your television viewing experience. When you get satellite TV, you can sign up for the DVR recorder, which will help your record and replay live television at your convenience. Ever since its advent in the early 1990s, satellite TV has been gaining popularity steadily. Advances in technology have made it easy to install and adjust satellite antennas in small properties as well. DISH Network is the largest provider of satellite television in the United States. It serves more than 14 million customers, and is known for its quality programming and excellent customer service. The Colorado based company was established in 1996, and has had millions of satisfied customers since then. The company has invested significantly in research and development, and strives to use modern technology for the benefit of its customers. Do not get satellite TV without considering DISH TV. The installation and accessibility of satellite TV has been growing significantly. DISH TV has an extensive network of dealers and providers across the country. The company and its providers are known for their exceptional customer service. The deals and packages change from time to time. Hence, it is important to contact the local provider to get the latest information. You may also schedule an appointment for installation. The technicians have the knowledge and the experience to install the satellite TV on different types of properties."
7,How I Met Your Mother TV Show Seasons,arts-entertainment," There are many shows on the air right now that all use one, common technique to start the show, and that is by having one of the main characters narrate the events that have happened in the past, or are currently happening in their life today. How I Met Your Mother is one of these shows, and also features a cast that portray quirky, crazy and downright inappropriate characters that keep the show entertaining and addictive. The episodes open with Ted Mosby, the narrator, sitting in front of his two children, explaining to them about all the problems, relationships and bumps in the road he went through over the years, just to finally find and marry their mom. The children are featured in the beginning, and sometimes at the end of the episode, but obviously never appear in the storyline. The stories their father tells them always include the same group of friends that he had before he met his wife, and it is clear that these friends are still a part of his life, because the kids know them by name. The scene always begins as a flashback to a time and specific memory that Ted has. One of Ted's closest friends is Marshall Erikson, who has been in his life since college, where they also met Lily Aldrin. They all become very good friends, Marshall and Lily date for nine years, and eventually they all live together in an apartment in New York. Marshall is a loyal, lovable man that loves Lily, and takes his role as friend very seriously. The constant struggles he has within himself, for doing what he thinks is right, adds a realistic and emotional side to the series that makes him very relate-able. The character of Lily is fun, quirky and a little bit disgusting, in an unoffensive way. She is very connected to Marshall, and has no problem talking to him about very personal issues and being completely involved in his life. She is also down to earth, and not too girly to hang out with the guys, and do guy things. Lily adds a lot of spunk and depth to the storyline, and she is easily someone you would want to spend time with if you could. Barney is another one of Ted's friends, and he has self proclaimed himself as Ted's best friend. This character is a womanizing, money loving con artist, who prides himself on getting women to fall for him, and then disappearing and escaping any type of commitment. He becomes friends with everyone in the group, but insists that there is a bro code that should always be followed between the guys. Barney is a man that you love to hate, and even if you do not agree with his way of life, you can't help but smile as he imposes his theories and convictions onto everyone else in the group. The last character that is introduced into this oddly matched up group, is Robin Scherbatsky. Robin is classically beautiful, and it is no surprise that more than one member of the group falls for her throughout the series. She is originally from Canada and her need to hold onto her roots, while embracing being a New Yorker is what makes her so likable. She is driven, and you can't help but cheer her on as she strives to reach her goals, and land the career of her dreams. Ted instantly falls in love with her, but Robin isn't looking for the same kind of commitment. Even as you watch the relationship bloom and dwindle, the narrator has already made it clear that ""Aunt Robin"" is not the mother. Most of the scenes for this comedy are set in the apartment where Ted, Marshall and Lily live, and they include the kitchen, bathroom, hallway and the roof of the building. The apartment is not fancy or filled with expensive furniture or other items, but comfortable, and filled with things that you would find in your own home. The other setting where they spend most of their time, is sitting in a booth at a bar called MacLaren's, where the atmosphere seem so inviting, that you wouldn't mind spending time with them there. All of the characters involved in How I Met Your Mother are very different from each other, but somehow they are all familiar, and we have all met someone like them. The situations they go through are realistic, and remind you of your own life and what you have been through. But at the same time, some of the situations are beyond our own reality, and reminds us of what we hope to do, and makes us grateful for our family and friends."
8,Let Your Personality Dictate What Music You Have In Your Music Player,arts-entertainment," Listening to music as a hobby can be a really pleasant activity.Most people are overwhelmed by how many genres they can find everywhere.They do not really know what they should listen to.This is why they tend to waste years listening to the wrong kind of music. I believe that everyone has one or two genres of music that really resonate with their particular personality. Find the right ones for you and you will be a much happier person in the years to come. The following are some of the best music genres that you should listen to: 1: Rap. People who enjoy rap music like to display their individuality and superiority. They may be feel superior because of their higher intelligence, street smarts or because of they can outwit their opponents all the time. 2: Pop music. Pop music, or popular music, is the right genre for the masses of people. People who listen to pop music are usually concerned with what other people may think of them. They like to be approved and praised by other people. They have a need to feel important and know everything about what’s going on in the world. They do not want to be left behind. 3: R&B. R&B is mostly liked by people who have a lot of life experience. Most of them listened passionately to other genres of music when they were young. They loved to listen to music in their early 20s and now they have a hard time forgetting their past. These people tend to be more classical. They often use language and words that aren’t very popular but they used to be popular. Such people have many stories to tell. They love sitting,  telling stories and just chilling out. 4: Dirty south. Dirty south is also known as southern hip hop. It’s an innovative style. The people who listen to this genre are either from the south of the United States or were really impressed with the new innovative style coming from the south. The audience of Dirty south is usually made out of people who like to accept new genres and styles without caring that much about the approval of other people. They are innovative individuals who like to try new things out and see how they work. 5: Trap music. Trap music started first as a means to determine who is who in a community.This genre is more likely to appeal to people from the south of the United States. People who like power struggle games also like this genre of music. All people want to gain more power in their lives. A particular type of power is called social power. You can enjoy your social power when you are respected and feared by other people in your social circle. Humans, like animals, think in terms of social structures and hierarchies. So people who like a lot to play social games may also like this genre of music. Start with the above genres of music and go from there. You will likely find among them the right genre of music that you should listen to all the time. Listening to music can be a great vehicle to uncover your real personality. Listening to music helps you evolve, become better, gain more power and become more integrated as a person. Listen to your favorite genres of music when you are about to make big decisions in your life. It will help you tremendously."
9,South Park Returning For Another Season,arts-entertainment," The future of South Park has been up in the air for a little while. The show ending their mid season episode on a strange note that left many people wondering. Of course they have an additional few episodes left for the end of the season, but the future thereafter has been a matter of great speculation. What happened in the last episode? South Park Seasons 1-15 DVD Box Set The last episode aired to date features the main character Stan as he is getting older. He recently has a birthday and started to dislike many of the things he previously liked, such as music. In this episode everything he hears and eventually sees literally turns to excrement. In a classic gross-out, South Park fashion they come across a point. During this episode Stan's parents start to grow apart and disagree with each other more than they usually do. This leads to Stan's friends not wanting to hang out will him any more as they feel he is a buzz kill. This also leads to his friends Kyle and Eric playing and laughing with one another though they are typically enemies and bitter rivals. This cynical outlook on life leads Stan to visit a doctor. The doctor plays newer music for him that he feels sounds like excrement and then plays some older classic style music for him that has the same result. This leads the doctor to a diagnosis that he is stuck between liking what old and young people like in a disorder known as being a cynical A-hole. Deeper than normal reflections In this episode they reflected upon more deeply rooted feelings than other episodes. This is because the characters opinions seem to specifically reflect the views of the creators. You can tell that they are burnt out and want to be known for things that are more creative and less low brow. The creators of the show have since written a very successful Broadway musical about the Mormon religion. The program has undergone several changes over the years. There have been many revamps such as better animation styles and with that a more in depth writing. Undertones and lessons are featured seamlessly throughout the show and make it a very entertaining thing to watch. If you were not a fan of the show when it first aired to do its perceived intention to be merely for shock value you will be surprised by the contemporary episodes. They are over the top and feature some shock value, but focus more on having a good story with identifiable characters. You're getting old The episode entitled you're getting old ending with a dramatic twist. A sad montage shows Stan's family packing up and moving and his parents presumably getting divorced. The writers have stated that this does not mean the show is going to end. Much concern over whether or not the show would continue arose from the last aired episode. This was addressed on Comedy Central's daily show shortly thereafter. They stated that though it was clear to see that they were strained and tired of the show in some regards that it did not mean the show was going to end. In fact one might go so far as to speculate that this is the show's creators going one step further to ""mess with"" the general public. South Park has been known for doing things to get a rise out of their audience. Being one of the first shows to use the S word, and over 100 times in one episode is just one claim to fame of the show. Keep in mind that this is the same show that was popularized for a character by the name of Mr. Hanky who was a Christmas themed piece of poo. So, it is a good idea not to read too much into the underlying messages of the most recent show. What this means for the show is that they are definitely finishing the season and more than likely going to be renewed for another one. An important thing to take into consideration is that even though the creators of South Park have tired of being associated with the program this television show has not at all declined in quality. South Park continues to push the envelope and be a very watch able and quality show, unlike programs such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, which have both run out of relevant ideas due to having seemingly inferior writing staffs, which is very much not the case with South Park.Check More DVD Movies, please visit our web."
10,The Benefits Of Exclusive Beats,arts-entertainment," You may have heard the saying about you have to spend money in order to make money, well in this industry that is very true. So being a serious artist in this industry Exclusive Beats are a must have. Trying to climb up the charts with beats that have sold countless times to other artists isn't going to help your originality, people want something that is just theirs and Is original and worth more. This is why many artists buy Exclusive Beats. Now if you are just starting out as a artist buying Exclusive Beats isn't recommended (unless your can really afford it) Most prices online start from as low as $50 rates up to 1000+. So it isn't always a option for artists new to the industry. I recommend if you starting just work your way up with leases. Leasing Vs. Exclusive Beats With leasing rights you are limited to what you can do with the beat. Most producers only let you sell around 2000 – 2500 copies per lease and can sell this lease to a unlimited amount of artists. Don't let this put you off though because this is a great place to start for smaller budgets and doesn't mean you will be took less serious or considered amateur. Exclusive Beats basically give you unlimited rights but at the cost of a much higher price so check below for further details on what you usually get with these rights. What You Get With Exclusive Beats With Exclusive Beats you get unlimited rights basically, where you can record a song to the purchased beats & sell as many times as you want without paying the producer again. Often the producer will have in the contract that they must still be credited on the track which is only fair since credit should be given where its due. Often you will just have to put (Prod. By ""PRODUCER NAME"") in the song title on the internet or in the CD booklet or somewhere like that where it is visible and easy to find. Some producers accept shout outs on the track too which can be a great way to help promote them and takes a lot less work than making sure its visible everywhere you post the finished track. Negotiating Prices On Exclusive Beats Another thing a lot of artists don't know is that you can negotiate prices with producers when buying Exclusive Beats! Most contracts in this industry can be negotiated to suit both the producer & artist. All you have to do is contact the producer & talk, its as easy as that. Depending on the producer they will usually set themselves a price which they wont go lower than so just talk it over until you are happy with the deal. Make Sure You Discuss Everything Before Purchasing Exclusive Beats Another thing you should make sure is that you are really getting unlimited distributions rights and that the track won't ever be sold to another artist again. Again the best way to do this is talk it over with the producer you are purchasing the Exclusive Beat from and if you can ask them to show you a sample of the contract you will be agreeing to upon purchase of the beat. Contracts That Come With Exclusive Beats Every time you purchase a Exclusive Beat you MUST make sure you get a contract. This will mean you have a copy of the rights if you ever need to prove you own it or in the very rare case the producer trys to sell the beat again you could then take legal action since in the contract they agreed to never sell the beat again. This is a very important part of the purchase so never forget about this because you are not covered & have no rights without this contract. What To Do Once You Get Exclusive Beats Now that you have chosen, negotiated and purchased your Exclusive Beat with contract you have everything you need to make your #1 single and the rights to do so. I shouldn't need to tell you about equipment and everything to record since you should already know this information, so I wish you good luck and hope I provided you with all the information you need to purchase Exclusive Beats."
11,How to watch UK Sky satellite TV in Germany,arts-entertainment," Enjoy all your favourite UK TV in Deutschland As Europe’s biggest economy, Germany offers great opportunities for many people to make a success in life and work with an economy that is still strong, backed by solid manufacturing and service sectors. Many British citizens move abroad to Germany each year. Some by choice to try a new life abroad, others due to demands of a high profile job and some are deployed as servicemen and women. In each case, there is a huge cultural gap to bridge as Germany is very much a sovereign state that is proud of it’s own pastimes, language and idiosyncrasies. German television in particular is geared towards a very specific taste and many Brits find it greatly frustrating that many shows that were originally aired in UK and US English have been dubbed for the local audience.

16,The Benefits Of 24 Seasons 1-8 DVD Boxset,arts-entertainment," For a good number of people, watching movies or television is simply a way of passing time or finding a pass time activity to help forget the many complex problems that many people are facing in this increasingly challenging life. The 24 Seasons 1-8 DVD Boxset however is one series that revolves around the real; life possibilities that anyone living at the present can face without necessarily influencing the same. While the media has been increasingly criticized for the negative influence that it has on the youth and teens in particular, it is important to note that some movie houses still take their time to produce some good clips that have a direct bearing on the moral aspects of modern lifestyles. With the crime rates in some cities across the world soaring to alarming rates, it is important to note that some actionable measures should be put in place and implemented in an effort to educate the teens and youth in particular not to fall victims to the vice. They say what you see sticks more in your head more than what you hear. And what you do is even more lasting. When it comes to the aspect of crime and drug abuse, it is better to see or watch rather than try to experiment with dangerous things. When the youth have an opportunity to watch movies that touch on the things that are likely to affect them in their regular activities, they have the privilege of storing some of that information and as a result will most likely stand a chance of making the right decision whenever the need arises. Drug abuse is equally a bid problem mot only in America but the rest of the world as well and the most vulnerable age groups that can easily fall prey to the unscrupulous peddlers are the teens and adventurous youth. The situation is much worse if the youth do not have any gainful activities that occupy them since they are likely to start experimenting with different substances.

It is however important to always try to offer some parental advice to teens so that they do not misinterpret whatever they see or watches on television so that they do not go astray. This is because at times, an innocent child with a wild side may be watching an action packed movie without any criminal intent but the way the criminal ion the movie carries himself and behaves in the cast suddenly invokes some admiration in the teen and before you realize it as a parent, they are busy on a mission to do just like that negative character in the cast. Anyway it is always hoped that the parents will take the opportunity to explain things in a broader perspective to their kids. The children should at all times be made to understand that crime rarely thrives above the good and it is a good thing that in many of the seasons, the criminal hardly gets away completely. Such endings will act as a major deterrent to any of the adventurous kids who may harbor adventurous traits that may be invoked to the negative. In every one there is a certain thing that brings excitement. It is for this reason that every one has their dislikes and likes and even when it comes to the types of movies that people watch, these differences can be noticed. A number of people like investigative movies while others like action packed ones and others still prefer the comedies. If you are the investigative movie lover, this is a series that you should never miss. The way the actions unfold in the 24 Seasons 1-8 DVD Boxset, you will be kept in suspense and at the edge of your seat all through the twenty-four hour breakdown of the happenings."
17,The 3rd Rock From The Sun Phenomenon,arts-entertainment," 3rd Rock from the Sun was a hugely popular 90s sitcom. The show was broadcast on NBC between 1996 and 2001 and followed the life of four aliens. The aliens were sent to earth by their home planet to study humans and what they consider to be the most boring planet in the universe, Planet Earth. The aliens pretend to be a regular American family in order to study life at close quarters. The alien family make their home in the fictional town of Rutherford, Ohio. Living in a small apartment, they set about their mission by submerging themselves in human life. Towards the end of the show's run, the aliens almost forget about their mission, choosing instead to become embroiled in their human lives. The leader of the mission is Dick Solomon, played by movie star and respected actor, John Lithgow. Dick has a job as Professor of Physics at a local university. The information officer, Tommy Solomon, takes on the persona of a teenager and has to enroll in the local school. The role of Tommy is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt who would later become an acclaimed movie actor, starring in Christopher Nolan's, Inception. Completing the mission team are Sally and Harry who take the role of work-shy thirty somethings. Following the tradition of Mork and Mindy, the family have to make regular reports to their home planet. These reports are made directly to their boss, known as the 'big giant head.' Although often unseen, the 'head' is played by Star Trek legend, William Shatner. Much the appeal and humor of the show comes from the fact that the central characters' personalities are in direct contradiction of the human forms they have chosen to adopt. The mission leader, Dick, adopts a loving and paternal form, however in reality he is self centered, egotistical and selfish. The oldest member of the alien expedition is Tommy, who takes on the form of a nerdy teenager. The show's main theme of humor is derived from the team's struggle to adapt to the social cultures and traditions of their human neighbors. In trying to understand and copy those customs and social norms, the aliens make countless mistakes and gaffes. Part of the problem seems to be they are taking much of their information directly from TV shows and movies. There is also a huge disconnect between human life on earth and the life the aliens are used to. Although there aren't many references to their home planet, we do know there is minimal use of emotion. One reference is made to sexual reproduction involving a business like transaction where genetic material is posted from a father to a mother. This lack of interaction and emotion in their home life, makes their struggle on earth that more interesting and funny. The show's success saw it become America's third favorite sitcom for a while, closely behind Everybody Loves Raymond and The King of Queens. However, its popularity waned somewhat after the first three seasons, despite the show winning several Emmy awards. This may well have been down to the fact that once the initial joke of being an alien on earth was spent, there simply wasn't anywhere else to go."

19,The Top 5 Australian Rock Bands and their Humble Beginnings,arts-entertainment," You’ve sung their songs, put up their posters, gone to their concerts and worshipped them for being the music legends that they are, but have you ever wondered how some of your favourite Australian rock bands came to be? Great bands like AC/DC, INXS, Jet, Wolfmother and Silverchair didn’t get to their current rockstar statuses in an instant. Like all great artists, these rock legends started out as humble young musicians with nothing but their talent and their dreams to propel them forward. Through the years they played their hearts out to the world until they finally made their mark - and our list - as some of the best rock bands that not only Australia, but the world has ever seen. No certified hard rock fan can truly be a fan without knowing the awesome, hard-hitting and legendary band that is AC/DC. This Australian rock band is considered to be one of the pioneering heavy metal bands that transformed the sound of rock and roll in the 1970’s. They had crowds going wild to such unforgettable songs as ""Highway to Hell"", ""It’s a Long Way to the Top"" and ""Back in Black"", songs which continue to capture the admiration of rock fans everywhere. AC/DC first started with its most constant members, the Young brothers Malcolm and Angus moving to Sydney with their family in the 1960’s. Malcolm, along with another brother George, were the first to experience playing with some local bands before Angus and Malcolm decided to form what is now known as AC/DC. They first played in local nightclubs in special events like New Year’s and other holidays until eventually, after many appearances in a nationally-broadcast music television show, they became one of the most popular acts in Australia and in the world. Would you believe that this smoking hot band first got its bearings while its members were still in high school? Founding members Andrew Farriss and late, great vocalist Michael Hutchence were classmates in high school when they decided to form the band along with two other classmates Neil Sanders and Kent Kerny, and added Geoff Kennely and Garry Beers from a neighbouring high school. They were later joined by Farriss’ siblings Tim and Jon and had their first gig in 1977 at Whale Beach, north of Sydney. They played at several other local shows before they finally landed a five-album record deal with Deluxe Records in the 1980’s. One of the more recent Australian rock bands that have gone global, Jet first came to be in 2001 when brothers Nic and Chris Cester decided to form a band with a sound influenced by the great rock and roll bands of the seventies and eighties. They first played in local festivals until a more established Melbourne Punk rock band took them in as their opening act. This led them to getting seen by a representative of their eventual management firm, Majorbox. Grammy award-winning band Wolfmother is a Sydney-based band first established in 2000 by only three members: Andrew Stockdale, Chris Ross and Myles Heskett. The band toured and played in a number of events and venues before they moved to Los Angeles in 2005 and achieved some success with an album that went five times platinum. One of the most well-known modern rock bands from Australia, Silverchair first came together when founding members and schoolmates Ben Gillies and Daniel Johns decided to form a band while they were still in high school. They played in several local shows covering the songs of well-known rock bands before they eventually won a national competition and landed a three-album recording deal with Sony Music later on.

20,The Shot Gunning Drinking Game,arts-entertainment," Different techniques are used in different drinking games. With regard to the Shotgunning drinking game, cans of beer are the most appropriate alcohol sources. This is due to literal ""Shotgunning"" involving by piercing a hole on the side of the beer can, and then requiring a competitor to drink directly from the hole. A hole is most effective when pierced made near the bottom of a can. In competing, one is not allowed to spill the beer when making holes. This means that competitors should have knowledge in making holes in the cans. For instance, it is advised that competitors should make a hole while holding the can in a horizontal position. If the can is held vertically when making a hole, beer would spill out. Once the hole is made, the competitor should drink as quickly as possible to outdo fellow competitors. Competitors may be required to drink an entire six pack package of beer cans in this drinking game. However, rules may vary. For a competitor to completely finish participation, he or she should drink all the content from all cans. Speed is the most important factor for winning. This game is designed in such a way that a competitor should be fast in making holes and drinking. To make good holes with speed, a sharp object should be used such as a pen knife. This drinking game is most prevalent in parties for excitement purposes as well as bets. Thus, the game should involve at least two competitors. The more competitors the game has, the more exciting it will be. If a competitor does not have a sharp object for piercing, then he or she will end up wasting too much time. Depending on rules, competitors may all start at a go or one by one. In most cases, this drinking game requires one competitor drinking at a time. Duration a competitor takes to make a hole as well as drink is noted. The competitor who uses least time in both instances without breaching any rule becomes the ultimate winner. Other competitors should always observe time taken by fellow competitors and try to break that record. To ensure that beer comes out of the hole fast, the competitor should ensure to place the can with the hole against the mouth while lifting the head. As the competitor does this, he or she opens the can to allow air into the can for faster exit of beer from the can. Atmospheric pressure is necessary for fluid to come out of containers rapidly. It is advised to eat foods that are free from fluids before drinking. Dry foods would ensure that the stomach does not have lots of fluids for a competitor to drink more beer. This drinking game requires competitors who can endure competing in a venue full of people. Thus, a competitor should not give up as a result of pressure from audience since audience may take sides on competitors. Caution: when a hole is made in a can, there may be metallic edges that can cut one's mouth. Thus it is necessary to drink carefully to avoid being cut. To further this end, a participant should ensure he or she goes to the drinking games party with a sober person in case of any emergencies."

2,Deciphering Lens Categories. Lenslocker camera hire and lens hire.,arts-entertainment," Having the right lens can really help to improve your photography and give you a real sense of creative control over what you’re trying to achieve. But choosing the right lens can be a complicated task especially when terminology and categorisation of lenses between manufacturers isn’t always consistent. As a camera and camera lens hire company we get a lot of people asking for advice about what type of lens they should hire for a particular job and we endeavour to provide them with consistent and practical advice to help them make the right decision. To remove the mystery and help reduce confusion we adopt a relatively simple approach to the categorisation of lenses and we focus on focal length. The focal length of a lens determines its angle of view and therefore how much the subject will be magnified for a given photographic position. Wide-angle lenses have short focal lengths (e.g. 10-20mm) while telephoto lenses have longer focal lengths (e.g. 70-200mm). The details below provides an overview of lens categorisation according to their focal length and an idea of what you might use that lens for. Please note that the focal lengths listed are just rough ranges and actual uses may vary considerably as people will use a lens that feels comfortable for them and it doesn’t always fit into what is outlined below. Lens focal length: < 21mm Category: Ultra Wide Angle Photography style: Architecture & Landscape Lens focal length: 21-35mm. Category: Wide Angle. Photography style: Landscape. Lens focal length: 35-70mm. Category: Normal. Photography style: Landscape, Weddings & Documentary. Lens focal length: 70-130mm. Category: Medium Telephoto. Photography style: Portraiture. Lens focal length: >130mm. Category: Telephoto. Photography style: Sports & Wildlife. Of course there are always other factors to consider when choosing the right lens including cost, size, weight and lens speed, hopefully the information above will help reduce the confusion over what type of lens you might need."
3,Eye Eye LensLocker Lens Hire and Camera Hire,arts-entertainment," We’re photographers for a reason. We like or are interested in what we see in the world around us. We’d like to capture an image for ourselves or to show other people. However, we have a problem. We’ll never be able to store the representation of the image in our minds with all the complexity of the processing of our eyes and brain. Our eyes look at only a small area of the image and our brain fills in the rest of the surrounding detail. Our eyes have an iris, which adjusts to give us the exact exposure to the intensity of the light so that we can see the maximum detail in any part of the scene. The result of all of this is that we see everything around us as perfectly exposed (except when its too dark to see). When taking photographs, all areas of the image have the same exposure. We can adjust the exposure but areas, which are darker or lighter than others will be just that, light, or dark in the image. The aim of the photographer has always been to keep details in the darker and lighter areas. We use tricks like fill in flash, graduated filters, polarising filter etc. to keep important details but often we just accept that our photographs will just have a blow out sky or dark shadows. After a while, we start using shadows and high lights creatively as part of our photographs, creating an image that you would not be able to see directly using your eyes. We could start taking photos during the night using screen lights and we can go out at dusk to try to balance the intensity of the light left in the sky to the artificial lights in our towns and cities. As photographers we now have a wide range of additional tools in our tool box that allow us to adjust, enhance and even change the natural picture that we see through the lens. It enables our eyes to see what our brain creatively imagines. Tom."
4,The Importance of Dental Hygiene,arts-entertainment," Dental care is the process of keeping your teeth, gum line, and oral cavity as clean and healthy as you can. Regrettably, a lot of people today consider regular brushing and flossing to be the only things required to keep good dental hygiene. While clearly these are very essential, much more than simply brushing and flossing is actually required to have the best oral health you can. Dental hygiene is extremely important to stay healthy overall. Everything that you eat or drink results in some form of residue in your oral cavity. If not cleaned the proper way, this residue adds to the amount of germs and harmful bacteria in the oral cavity, increasing them to unhealthy quantities, and raising your risk for several various health problems. Not all these health complications even have to do with oral health. You can get many nasty colds along with other illnesses from having bad dental hygiene. Terrible oral hygiene leads to a variety of different difficulties. Terrible breath, or halitosis, is the most widespread effect of very poor oral hygiene. Another typical difficulty is discolored, missing, or decaying teeth. People tend to say their teeth are ""rotting out,"" but this is not actually the case; the harmful bacteria is eating away at them. These kinds of issues are usually incredibly off-putting to other people, impacting your social and professional life. More importantly, terrible dental hygiene can lead to much more severe health conditions, which can include oral cancer and gum disease. Many numerous studies have connected gum disease to an increased risk for cardiac arrest and strokes. This suggests that it is critical that you care for your oral cavity properly. Regular brushing of the teeth is the first step, but certainly not the only one. Teeth really should be brushed twice every day at a bare minimum to prevent plaque building up on them. Using fluoride toothpaste helps in strengthening the teeth and safe guarding them against decay and bacterial infections. It's vital that all areas of the teeth are brushed carefully to remove as much food as you can. There are specially made toothbrushes for that purpose, and you ought to attempt to find one if possible. Electric tooth brushes or battery powered ones can be really useful in adequately brushing your teeth. Flossing is also pretty important, and should be done at least once daily. People seem to really easily fall out of the practice of flossing, since it's ""difficult."" However, there are advances in floss just lately, like floss that is on plastic sticks, making it a lot less complicated to get into your oral cavity and in between teeth than just string floss. Whenever flossing, be sure that you thoroughly clean between all of the teeth, not only those in front. This might be time consuming, but it's essential. A frequently overlooked area of the jaws is the tongue. Cleaning the tongue every time you brush your teeth gets rid of decaying food and bacteria known to lead to bacterial infections and illnesses. Some toothbrushes actually come equipped with tongue cleaners, so make use of these when you can. Vital to any good oral hygiene program is routine professional tooth cleaning. At least two times per year is recommended. Make the appointments far in advance, and if your teeth hurt, see the dentist sooner than your planned twice yearly cleanings. Don't put it off till you're in terrible pain to see a dentist, go at the very first sign. Good dental hygiene extends beyond cleaning and upkeep, however. The foods which you eat, the drinks that you drink, and your habits all have a tremendous impact on your dental health. Remember that before you pick up that huge bag of sweets or chug down that three liter of pop. All of that sugar can really damage your teeth, not to mention your overall health."
5,Anime and How It's Evolved Online,arts-entertainment," When you mention Anime to anyone the first thing that they think of is usually Japan. The term Anime originated there as a term for ALL animation, not just Japanese animation, but the animation style was so specific to Japan that it became the term used to describe just Japanese animation. Anime began at the start of the 20th century but didn't become popular in Japan until after Word War 2. It was pioneered by some of the best artists in the country and indeed the style was incredibly beautiful even if the content usually steered much more towards sex and violence than animation made in America at the same time. As the Anime phenomenon grew in Japan the films and TV show began to make their way to other parts of the world and eventually landed here in the United States. While not exceptionally popular they did have their early hits, including Speed Racer, Marine Boy and Kimba the White Lion, all three of which were very popular here. Today some of the favorites are legend of korra, pokemon best wishes & aki sora. In the last 20 years the production of Anime has truly exploded and the quantity of new series and shows coming out of Japan has increased significantly, along with a huge increase in their popularity in the States. The reason is that, unlike many American cartoons that are drawn rather simply and have 'family' rated story lines, Anime is darker, edgier and more lavishly produced. With the advent of the Internet there is now a whole world of Anime that has opened up to folks over here in the United States. Series and shows that once were only able to be seen in Japan are now available for download and streaming, making a lot of Anime fans here very happy indeed. So if you're looking for something a little different, with intense story lines and extravagant animation, you may want to check out some Anime online. But watch out, because you just might find out what many have known for a long time; it's really good stuff. There are many anime websites online but one of the best I have come across is Anime Loves Me."

14,How to Care For Your Guitar,arts-entertainment," Caring for one's guitar is an important aspect of maintaining the proper functioning, aesthetic appeal, and value of one's instrument. Unfortunately this facet is often neglected by musicians, who tend to focus on other, less practical things. A guitar player who is interested in maintaining the value of his or her instrument, should consider these helpful tips: The first and perhaps most important aspect of caring for and properly maintaining one's instrument is to keep it well protected when it is not being used. This requires, at minimum, buying a guitar case, for those who do not already have one, and making sure one always puts his or her guitar away when it is not in use. Another important aspect of properly caring for one's instrument is to protect the instrument from the elements and, particularly, from changing temperatures and dry air. Dry air and changes in temperature are the quickest way to warp the delicate fragile wood that your guitar is made of. The effects of this warping can be subtle, but can affect the intonation of the fingerboard - sometimes in ways that cannot be undone. Therefore, guitar players should never leave their instrument in hot cars during the summer or out in the cold during the winter time. Best practices include having a humidifier in the room where your instrument is stored. Another thing one can do to keep the proper moisture in the air where one's guitar is stored is to put a damp sponge anywhere in the guitar case. Where appropriate, one can put the sponge in a container with small holes poked into the lid. This will help ensure the instrument always has proper moisture. A third important aspect of maintaining one's instrument is to change one's strings regularly. This will have the most noticeable effect on the actual sound of the guitar. People who play their instrument on a regular basis should change their strings at least every two to three months, depending on the regularity of use. Finally, one should always strive to keep the neck of one's instrument free of dirt buildup and grime by regularly cleaning one's guitar neck. Fingerboards need to be cleaned regularly in order to prevent excess dirt and bacteria, which can damage the surface of one's guitar. One should, in theory, clean the frets and fingerboard at least every time the strings are changed. If one plays his or her instrument very often and, therefore, changes his or her guitar strings often, this rule may be overreaching. If all of these rules of thumb are observed consistently, the functioning, aesthetic appeal, and value of one's instrument can be maintained for many years. Otherwise, the fate of one's guitar, like many musicians, will be 'blowing in the wind.' Fret Daddy is the world's leading manufacturer of removable fret stickers for guitar and bass.

15,How to Pick a Guitar,arts-entertainment," So you've decided you are going to learn to play guitar. If you don't already have a guitar, the first step will be to purchase one, which of course leads us to the next question: how do you pick a guitar that's right for you? There are three important factors to consider in picking your guitar: Budget Personal Taste Feature Includes Let's take a look at all of these factors in detail: Budget If money were no object, then we would all have the best guitars money could buy. And that would be an amazing world. But that, of course, is not the world we live in. The reality is, money is a limiting factor. And, indeed, it is often THE limiting factor in the guitar picking process. So what is the least amount of money you should spend? It depends on what your goals are. If, for example, you plan on doing some recording with your guitar, then you will want to buy a guitar that will not limit the quality of sound that is produced during your recordings. Recordings have a way of immortalizing every decision you make - especially gear purchase decisions. As a general rule of thumb, if you want to use the guitar you are going to buy for recording, you should probably plan on spending at least $250.00. This general rule of thumb applies for both acoustic and electric guitars. A $500 to $1000 budget should be able to get you a guitar that will never disappoint you, and anything above and beyond that is personal taste. Importantly, this is general advice, and there are exceptions to almost every rule. You may be able to find a real 'steal' from a friend or at a local pawn shop. But if you are walking into a Guitar Center, the chances are the rules of thumb above definitely apply. Now if you are a beginner and are NOT planning on doing any masterful recordings any time soon, it is ok to spend less than $250.00, but make sure you don't fall into the trap of buying the cheapest guitar you can find. The quality of your guitar will have a direct effect on how you feel about playing it. And if you spend $39.00 on a real cheapo guitar, the chances are you will never want to pick it up. Obviously, that is not going to have a positive impact on your learning process. As a beginner, plan on spending at least $100. But if you are a beginner, don't spend more than $1000.00, because you don't know enough yet to pick the right sound, and everything over $500.00 is about personal taste, in most cases - not quality - which leads us to the next important factor. Personal Taste The next factor in determining how to pick a guitar is fairly straight-forward: personal taste. Make sure you actually like any instrument you purchase. Ordering instruments from a catalog or online store is generally not ideal because the most important aspect of any instrument is how it actually sounds - something you can't determine from seeing a picture of it. Don't just listen to what other people are saying about a specific type of guitar, although this is good important feedback. Listen to the sound for yourself. The ideal guitar should match your expectations of what a good guitar should sound. Also, it should sound similar to guitars that you've heard played in the particular genre you are going to be focusing on (folk, country, rock, etc.) Consider what type of music you like and aspire to be able to play. If you like country music, for example, you should think about purchasing an acoustic guitar, as opposed to a classical or electric guitar. If, on the other hand, you wish to learn how to play classical guitar or flamenco guitar, you should purchase a classical guitar as your first guitar. If you like heavy metal and plan on learning how to 'rip', then electric guitar is for you, etc. Make sure you buy a guitar that has a look that you are comfortable with and will be happy with. Don't buy a black guitar if you've always wanted a standard wood finish. But don't sacrifice the sound quality for getting a guitar that looks good. Remember, you are trying to make beautiful music, which requires an instrument that produces beautiful sounds! Looks can be deceiving. Finally, if you plan on using your guitar for recording, make sure you purchase a guitar with a fairly balanced tone. If you purchase a guitar that has too much low-end or too much high-end, it will be difficult to get a clean mix. Feature Includes: The last step in picking a guitar that is right for you is to pick a guitar with the right features. Many guitars have some nice built-in features, that are important to think about when making a purchase, depending on your goals. If you are planning on playing live performances or open mics, you will want to buy an acoustic guitar that has a built-in microphone (sometimes called 'an electric acoustic guitar'). And for convenience, you may wish to consider buying a guitar with a built-in tuner as well. These can really come in handy when you are getting ready to go on stage. However, if you are on a tight budget, you may want to sacrifice the tuner for additional sound quality. In general, you should spend time taking a good look at the different guitars available on the market within your price range, then decide what features are important to you, given your goals. Sound quality should be your first priority, and your second priority should be playability. Guitars with 'low action' are easier to play because the strings naturally sit closer to the fingerboard. This can sometimes be adjusted, however, you'll want to MAKE SURE that the guitar is playable before you buy it. If you can afford it, make sure you buy a guitar that has decent tuners, which hold the guitar in tune. These will save you a lot of frustration by helping your guitar to stay in tune. And consider other features that may be important to you as well. In the end, pick a guitar that fits your budget, personal taste and musical style, with the best sound quality and most features you can find. And buy a guitar that you will be excited to play, even if it means forking over a little extra dough. Fret Daddy is the world's leading manufacturer of removable fret stickers for guitar and bass.

18,"What is the ""Kindie Rock"" movement?",arts-entertainment," You’ve probably heard of ""Indie Rock,"" but how about ""Kindie Rock""? It’s a lot more popular than you might imagine. The most popular new trend involves creating rock music for kids – it ""melds the sensibility of the singer-songwriter with themes aimed at kids under 10,"" according to Salon.com. Unlike the more ""bubble gum"" pop music you hear on radio channels designed for kids, Kindie Rock aims to combine classic, cool rock music with lyrics aimed towards being a kid. Think of it as family friendly rock music that everyone can enjoy. So what, exactly, is the Kindie Rock Movement? It all started with Dan Zanes, the singer for the alternative 80s and 90s band Del Fuegos. When Dan couldn’t find anything on the radio that was appropriate for his young daughter to listen to, he set out to make some on his own. The Kindie Rock movement was born. The most important element to Kindie Rock is that it’s not the ""cutesy,"" kind of watered-down pop music that so many companies throw together. Like the name suggest, it’s real rock music for kids. And some of the most popular bands of today have hopped on the bandwagon, including They Might Be Giants, The Shins and Weezer. Newer bands on the scene include Recess Monkey and Secret Agent 23 Skiddoo, Laurie Berkner and Gustafer Yellowgold. But here’s what’s really cool: you can hear this family friendly rock music almost anywhere. Kindie Rock bands tour all over the country, and put out CDs and DVDs. If you’re unsure about whether or not buying rock music for kids is a good idea, you can take a free ""test drive"" by watching an episode or two of the Nick Jr. show ""Yo Gabba Gabba,"" which is dedicated to showcasing some of the most popular – and fun! – family friendly rock music out there. There are also some really terrific podcasts available for free download from iTunes (as well as other places), including Zooglobble, Kindiecast, Goonie Bird Kids and Saturday Morning Cereal Bowl. They’re all wonderful resources for parents looking to explore the Kindie Rock movement a little more thoroughly before letting their kids listen to the music. Family Friendly Rock Music The best part of Kindie Rock has to be its adaptability. Studies have long shown the correlation between music and more advanced child development. Studying music – whether as a musician or as a music lover – leads to better concentration levels, better hand-eye coordination, and better self-esteem in children. But for years, it was believed that an introduction to classical music was the best (if not the only) route to take. Studying and playing rock music (for kids, tweens and adults) is just as beneficial – and in the interest of honesty, probably a whole lot more fun for more young learners. The surge in popularity for Kindie Rock has introduced scores of younger children to musical study, thus increasing the amount of kids who will become life-long music lovers. Thankfully, the Kindie Rock phenomenon isn’t proving to be a flash-in-the-pan kind of thing. This style of rock music for kids is popular with people of all ages, which helps to keep it alive. And with more and more music instructors offering classes that encourage children to ""rock out,"" it’s a pretty safe bet that Kindie Rock will be around for a long, long time."
19,The Benefits of Music for Children,arts-entertainment," As science fairs all over the world will attest, music is good for living things. Plants grow more quickly and more fully when their owners play music for them. But the benefits of music for children are even greater than a couple of inches in height. There is a direct correlation between music and child development – and the correlation is a terrific one. So if you really want to help your family be all that it can be, consider music classes for your kids. Coordination: One of the greatest benefits of music for children is that it helps kids’ coordination. Playing an instrument requires the use of fine motor skills. Most instruments require the use of both hands – and percussive instruments, like pianos and drums, require hands and feet to play correctly. That means that music and child development of hand-eye coordination and dexterity go hand-in-hand. Relaxation: Even little kids can get stressed out. Music classes for kids work as a sort of unofficial ""therapy"": children become engaged in a project that yields positive results, and that means lower blood pressure and lower stress levels. Just like adults who are soothed by music, children also experience the same reactions of happiness and peace. Keeping your child relaxed and open to the world around him/her is one of the great benefits of music for children. Self-Confidence: There’s a reason why rock stars act like gods. Another one of the benefits of music for children is that playing an instrument inspires a child to be confident in him/herself. Music classes for kids positively reinforce those children by showing them that hard work pays off. Self-esteem is bolstered by the joy felt in a nurturing social group. When kids participate in a group musical experience, and witness the fun of singing, dancing and playing music with each other, it has a tremendous impact on their confidence. Music for Young Children There are some unintended benefits of music for children, too – and they make perfect sense, when you think about them. Singing nursery rhymes to infants and toddlers encourages your children to speak, so music and a child’s development of language are linked in a positive way. The repetitive nature of nursery rhymes – much like commercial jingles – encourages memorization, which can help with classroom tests later. (There’s a reason why ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" and the ""Alphabet Song"" have the same tune.) Studies have also been done between music and child development in terms of mathematics: studying counting and music theory makes arithmetic and algebra easier to comprehend. Clearly, music keeps us cool, calm and collected. But there are other benefits of music for children beyond the basics. Studies are finding that specifically designed music for young children can help therapists who work with children with autism. In some cases, music has been the key to uniting families; parents can finally relate to their children through music, which lowers their stress levels, too. But the best part of combining music and child development is the bond it can create between you and your own kids. Families that share and play music together immediately have something in common. This is actually a bigger deal than you might first assume. A family that shares a common love has an easier time communicating its needs and desires. The benefits of music for children in larger families include a feeling of unity with the members, a desire to create things as a group, and the ability to share both successes and frustrations in a safe and productive way. In other words, by participating in music classes for your kids (either at a studio or in your own home), you show your children in an active and engaging way that you value what they value. This encourages them to pursue their goals – even non-musical ones – throughout their lives. It also guarantees that families spend quality time together, because as they say – ""the family that plays together, stays together."""

1,Different Types of Dance Floors Available for Rent from a Dance Floor Rental Phoenix Company,arts-entertainment," The idea of sectioning off a small area at an event location for a dance floor is a great idea. A dance floor can keep guests at any wedding reception, family reunion, or business party entertained for hours. While some event locations might offer a dance floor with the rental agreement, some do not. In the case that an event location does not provide a dance floor, you will need to consider using a dance floor rental Phoenix company. The following is a look at some of the options you will have when you rent a dance floor from a party supplier. The first available dance floor for rent is one that is made out of intricate wood paneling that is made out of wood parquet. These dance floors often have a very refined and elegant look to them, and are usually used for upscale corporate parties or weddings. While these types of floors are ideal for company parties and weddings, there is the chance that the warm Phoenix weather could warp or damage the flooring. If this is a type of flooring you are considering renting from a dance floor rental Phoenix company, you will want to check to see if the floor isn’t warped. The second available dance floor for rent is a wood laminate dance floor. Wood laminate floors look very similar to the wood parquet flooring, but have a slightly casual feel to them. Wood laminate floors are great for weddings, family get-togethers, or any other type of special occasion. Dance floor rental Phoenix companies will usually charge less for wood laminate flooring, which is why it is so extremely popular. The cheaper rental cost is due to the fact that the flooring is not as refined and sophisticated as the wood parquet paneling. The third available dance floor for rent is a specialty flooring that is used to fit the special occasion. Special dance floor material can be anything from granite, tile and carpet squares. These types of dance floors are rarely rented by people for a number of reasons. First, the cost of renting these floors from a dance floor rental Phoenix company can be fairly costly. These floors are expensive to rent due to their unique material. The second reason these floors are rarely rented is because they might not match the surrounding décor."

3,Grand Piano Measurements - Selecting The Best Dimension Of Piano,arts-entertainment," Grand Piano Measurements - Selecting The Best Dimension Of Piano Normally, grand pianos aren't just an incredible sound-producing musical instrument but a great décor also. They have got beauty that can cause a sophisticated kind of environment on where they are situated. Grand pianos possess a particular element and display a true fulfillment of the true meaning of elegance and grace in musical instruments. Grand pianos can be found in different sizes. Therefore it is crucial to understand how to pick the ideal dimensions of it. Considering that grand pianos can be bought in a number of colors, types, and sizes. However, the most significant attribute to check when choosing for grand pianos will be the sizes. These musical instruments are created a bit the same upright pianos are made. On the other hand, the major difference between the 2 is the size. Based on sizes, grand pianos also come in 3 different kinds that include the Concert Grand, Parlor Grand, as well as the popular Baby Grand. Concert Grand It is the biggest amongst grand pianos containing dimensions of about 9 feet long. With regards to power, the Concert Grand is regarded as the most powerful because of its size. The sound this grand piano generates is known to be full and heavy which makes it occupy a big concert hall. Its big soundboard and also longer strings at the same time contribute to the strength of its sound. Its huge size as well as excellent sound help it become great for serious pianists specifically for big concerts in much larger settings including concert halls. Parlor Grand Parlor grand pianos or the ‘living room grand pianos"" are definitely the middle-sized pianos and they usually measure around 5 to 7 ft long. In sound, this particular size of grand piano may also produce a tone well however, not as good as what concert grands could develop. Parlor grands are normal in households which have an ample space for this wonderful musical instrument. Additionally, the majority of churches schools and also conservatories make use of this grand piano type for its size which is not so large but not so small. Parlor grand pianos work extremely well in several areas due to size that is perfect. Baby Grand This third type of grand piano based on size is thought to be the smallest among the grand pianos and regarded also to be the most in-demand. With regards to tone, due to their dimension, baby grand pianos don't deliver a sound as affluent and full as what concert grands and parlor grands carry out. Simply because that the tone and sound is dependent upon the size of the soundboard along with length of the strings of a grand piano, baby grand pianos are generally regarded as substandard as compared to the various other sizes."
4,The canvas artwork is an exceptional method to improve the beauty of your home wall,arts-entertainment," People invest so much of their time and money in their house decor. They just leave no stone unturned to make their position gorgeous. However, if you call this as rich man hobby, then it won't be a wrong deal to some extent. However, people living with budget constraints have their own reasonably priced technique of decorating their house. Though you cannot expect to see them bringing a marble statue at their place, yet some way or the other they keep doing a couple of things. So what I am talking approximately these things can be called as a days of past, as now you have stunning and lucrative appearing choice in the form of canvas painting or canvas artwork. You have a wide range of online groups plus the oil painting reproductions which are famous to produce high quality canvas paintings at pretty reasonable costs. The fine thing about canvas painting is that you can use your memorable picture or image and convert them into good-looking paintings.

5,Comic Book Adaptions They Got Right,arts-entertainment," Comics are a unique medium in print. They take some characters and then tell their stories over years and sometimes decades. When comics fans invest in characters they invest big time which is why it's understandable when they get their fanboy hate on over film adaptations. There are comic book movie adaptions that have been done the right, way, wrong way and the wow I never thought of doing them that way. Here are my top picks. The Right Way. The Avengers introduction movies of Iron Man, Thor and Captain America were all good movies in their own right. For me Captain America suffered from a weak ending and some strange editing choices but it was a decent and entertaining movie. Marvel approached the movies the right way. They tool the source material that the comics have been running with and they turned them into movies. How hard was that? The characters were set in a realistic universe and the more ridiculous outfit choices like winged helmets were left out. Reasons were given for the choices the characters make that lead them on the path to the Avengers but the movies were self contained stories that could stand out with the upcoming film. Marvel realised that comics are a medium where the stories don't stop so why not have lots of characters in their own movies and then bring them together in some huge adventures. The Wrong Way. DC have had their problems when it comes to movies about their characters. Batman and Superman are always box office draws. People will always turn out for those films but what about their other characters like Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash. They're not too popular. This was proven when the Green Lantern film came out last year and failed to enjoy the same kind of success that Iron Man did. The character of Hal Jordan played by Ryan Reynolds was changed a little to be more like Tony Stark and to also reflect the personality of Reynolds. The Green Lantern wasn't a bad movie by any standard but it would be hard to call it great. I think the problem lies with the source material for that one. An intergalactic cop with a green lantern just doesn't get very excited. I could sat the same thing for Captain America but Marvel cleverly marketed it as the first of the Avengers. The story is an introduction to a larger world whereas Green Lantern was just a bunch of stuff that happened."
6,Considering Recording Arts?,arts-entertainment," So, you're a musician and would like to get into the recording arts? If you want to do this professionally, there are a few things that you need to really think about before you start seeking gigs or schools. You are going to need to understand your art deeply. Education is an important part of your career. You could be classically trained or self-trained, it doesn't matter. What matters is that you are talented and devoted to your art. You are also going to need to be able to handle criticism and seriously hard work. You are going to need to be a self starter and again, super devoted to your craft. What is your niche? In other words, where do your talents lie? What genre of music do you most thrive in? If you are into more mainstream music, that would be the most lucrative for those that are into music production. Luckily, there are many different genres that are in mainstream music.  There are plenty of bands out there that were once underground that are much appreciated. It doesn't matter as long as you have the work ethic to work hard and see benefits from it in the long run, too. Now that it has been decided where you talents lie, you need to look into what you need to put into yourself so that you can market to the preferred fan base. As with most media outlets, it is important to look good. Individuality is important, but so is beauty. This is not always the case, but it is good to think about. It is just necessary to draw the fan base in. Going Independent: If you are interested in keeping it real and sticking to the independent subculture, then props to you! There is no real reason to ""sell out"" the way that musicians used to. With the independent industry, there are a lot more artistic freedoms that are afforded to you. They don't dictate your every move, which is a fantastic break from the mainstream record companies. Recording and Producing: If you really just want to produce and record music, this is also fairly lucrative. Keeping it behind the scenes is not always a bad thing. There are plenty of famous producers out there. There is one thing to think about, however. There are many people out there that can make sick beats and have been trying to break into the industry for years. What is necessary is a true creative edge and some real originality. There are plenty of beat masters out there, but can you best them with what you create? In Conclusion: Depending on where your talents lie, there are many options. All of these options need music education to back up what talents you do have. I'd even go as far as to recommend background courses to understand how the business is run. The recording arts is a great industry, don't squander your talents."
7,Come to be among the first to discover just available motion pictures - go along with film premiers,arts-entertainment," The actual Cinematographe Industry has a lot of following all across the globe. Discuss about it film premiers and you will definitely obtain instant interest. The film sector particularly has been in existence for so long as I can remember. You may find movies going back to 1900's, entirely shot in the old technology that has a black and white colour. They're fantastic to see, right? You should agree with us. Typically the mention of Hollywood solely will improve enough rumours relating to many news inside the motion picture sector; including just about anything starting from the very best film ever done, the most recent motion picture, film premiers and even reviews concerning most of the motion pictures. Music news is a topic a lot of people really love to pay attention or maybe study. These are generally constantly looking for new music in music charts to maintain their selves entertained and simply up-to-date.Before we get straight into films and film premiers, let's check out the music industry. Arguably, there is rigid competition between the cinema and music industry. Lots of music charts are usually refreshed every day with different music on them. This in the long run signifies that considerably more songs then films is undoubtedly created in a day. This is certainly totally logical just because a melody doesn't need as much strategic planning as a cinema would need, not even a whole video. A single episode of a movie requires a lot more logistics to make compared with the six minute music. Music news throughout the world is stuffed with the hottest tracks, rumors, chit chat...everything. Nonetheless, it is good to end up being thankful for the music business. In a single way or another these two sectors actually need each other so as to deliver more appeal to the scene. We will need to enjoy the material and in addition quality added basically by most of the artists whose records topped music charts during quite long periods of time.The Liverpool Film Premiers have already listed numerous movies that were released along with those that are actually waiting completion to be released. Between videos that have been freshly presented - Elfie Hopkins, Dark Shadows as well as many others. A complete calendar of Hollywood event for this twelve months was already released and it's particular remarkable to see the amount of events on it, just as the music business featuring its truly latest music charts. To note some of the movies which are at agenda on the Hollywood calendar listing can needless to say produce a large list of occasions. It implies that a film premiere field becomes better day by day."
8,Can There Be a Pop Music Prodigy?,arts-entertainment," It is interesting to ponder how much technology has changed the nature and definition of what is a prodigy. Traditionally, child prodigies are identified in two main areas, music and math. Math genius is still math genius, and technology has not changed this much, but music has changed greatly. It is still easy to identify a prodigy in classic music such a piano playing and the violin, but what about pop music. Music made with synthesizers and other modern technological aids. To answer this question, we interviewed some traditional classical music experts, but also experts at music production schools. Unsurprisingly, the classical music gurus took a rather pessimistic view of the idea of pop music prodigies. One indignant Emeritus sarcastically suggested that we bring Mozart back to life so he could produce an album with Eminem. We asked the Emeritus to name one rapper who might be a prodigy. He almost snickered as he said that rap isn't music, and that few rappers are even musicians. Those at music production schools had a more inclusive view which considered synthesizers and electronic beats instruments as surely as a violin. Classical music aficionados laughed at this notion, pointing out that there is a timelessness to the violin and piano and other classical instruments. Over a multi thousand year window, synthesizers and other fads may come and go, but the classical instruments will remain. One staunch critic of the notion of rap ""music"" had us try to envision some concert in 400 years at which Eminem is played. The wealthiest and most educated members of the societal elite will assemble, and the greatest musicians of the age will play Eminem's guttural beats with violins, cellos, oboes, and flutes. One of the civilizations greatest singers will clear there throat and then sing, Two trailer park girls go round the outside, round the outside. . . Members of the elite assembled in the audience would offer dainty claps. Bravo, Sir. Bravo indeed my good man. I do say, well done. Indubitably. During the intermission, before they return to hear a 60 piece orchestra play ""Fuck the Police,"" a song by that renowned band of prodigies ""Nigger With Attitudes,"" the elite will surely consult academics also present. The prodigy Eminem is so brilliant that his lyrics defy comprehension. Whatever did he mean by two trailer park girls go round the outside? Historians who are honest will admit that extant historical records provide no answer, and the meaning of the lyrics is yet another one of those unsolvable mysteries of ancient history. The future civilization might ask themselves how depraved a culture must be to consider such lowbrow music entertainment. A historian in attendance expounds. All late stage empires decay morally as they decline and collapse. This happened to the Roman Empire before it faded into oblivion, and the American Empire before it went the same route. Romans gorged and vomited at massive orgies, Americans feasted on fast food and stapled their stomachs and revered Eminems and Niggers with Attitudes. That's the insight offered by experts at universities and music productions schools. Take it for what it's worth. In the final analysis, only time can provide conclusive answers."
9,A Look at How Dish TV Channels are Packaged,arts-entertainment," One of the benefits of deciding to go with a satellite cable provider is the ability to customize what channels you receive. Many traditional cable providers, such as Comcast and Time Warner, often pick and choose the channels for you, and force you to pick from a selection of packages that might not suit your needs. Satellite cable providers have come up with a new concept that allows people to pick and choose what they get in their package. To get a better idea of how channels are packaged, here is a look at how the Dish TV channels are packaged. There are several ways Dish TV channels are packaged. The first is a general grouping of channels. These grouping of channels will usually include the most popular channels from a wide variety of interests. These channels will include movie channels, reality TV channels, children’s programming, news programming, and sports programming. This is ideal for a family, as all of these channels will cover a wide variety of interests and no one is left out. These general channel packages can range from offering 100 channels to offering over 400 channels. The second way Dish TV channels are packaged is by interests and viewing audience. A customer can pick a general channel selection, and then add a whole group of channels that caters to their interest. For example, a sports fan will be able to subscribe to a group of sports channels that offers more than the basic sports channels. Channels can be grouped into interests such as crime shows, reality TV, music channels, movie channels, children’s shows, and sports. This option is great because it allows people to supplement the channels they receive, without having to pay for hundreds of channels they will never watch. The third way Dish TV channels are packaged is by individual channel. People have the option to pay a monthly fee to have access to one specific channel that might not be included in their general channel selection. For example, a person who wants to watch ESPN3 but not have access to the NHL Network might opt to just pay for ESPN3. This option is great as people can see the one specific channel they want to without having to resort to purchasing dozens of other channels they have no interest in. This option may also be cheaper, as you aren’t paying for an abundance of extra channels."
10,How to Clean a Guitar,arts-entertainment," The Guitar is a sensitive instrument which needs to be cleaned regularly. The accumulation of dirt and dust not only spoils its appearance but also affects its sound and playability. A well maintained guitar not only lasts longer but is more playable and sounds beautiful too. Most people think that cleaning a guitar is a cumbersome job and should be left to experts only; however in actual practice cleaning a guitar is very easy and anyone who owns and plays the instrument should know how to clean a guitar. Cleaning a guitar is simple and can be done at home. You do not need to purchase an expensive kit to keep your guitar nice and shiny. Many household items for instance olive oil, lemon oil and glass cleaners serve the same purpose and with equal efficiency as the expensive guitar cleaning stuff you can purchase from shops or online. If you are using guitar polish make sure that you do not use the one which contains silicone as it can damage the body. Most luthiers suggest that a guitar should be wiped with a soft flannel cloth every time it is played. Besides flannel old soft cotton cloth can also be used to wipe the surface of the guitar. These materials bring back the shine without putting any scratches on the surface. Buffing removes any stains or smudges on the surface making it smooth and shiny. The tiny cervices can be reached with a soft toothbrush; just remember to use few drops of glass cleaner to get rid of the dirt and grime trapped in them. Any stuff being used for cleaning should not be applied directly to the guitar surface rather it should be placed on the piece of cloth and then applied to the surface. Cleaning the Strings It is best recommended to wash your hands first before playing the guitar especially if you have eaten something greasy. The strings of the guitars are extremely sensitive; often the secretions from the fingers (sweat, body oils) get transferred on the strings while playing. Even dry skin can get deposited on the strings; to remove these residues, the strings must be wiped clean too. With a soft piece of cloth, start cleaning the strings from the bridge and go gently down to the nut. You should also pay some attention to the bridge and the nut when cleaning the strings. Cleaning the Fret Board The best time to clean the fret board is when the strings are being replaced. Before attaching the strings, you wipe the fret board with a dry piece of cloth. It takes care of most of the dirt while the stubborn dirt deposits can be removed with very fine grade steel wool. Again you will have to be very careful when using the steel wool as scrubbing hard can damage the fret board. Often luthiers suggest a coat of lemon oil as a protective layer especially if the fret board is made rosewood or ebony. Products containing silicone and waxes should never be applied on the fret boards. Conclusion Guitar is an expensive instrument and needs to be taken care of from time to time. Often the best time to clean guitars is said to be when the strings are being changed as it gives an easy access to the fret board. In order to keep the guitar clean, a regular wipe down with a soft piece of cloth is recommended. By following the above mentioned steps on how to clean a guitar one can easily take care of their guitar with minimal costs."

16,"Cold Chisel Plan New Album, Their First in 14 Years",arts-entertainment," Cold Chisel has been on again, off again, like a troubled serialized drama romance of the ""Will They Won’t They"" Caliber. But Cold Chisel’s musical quality has been superbly consistent. Though their soft rock sensibilities remain largely constrained to the New Zealand and Australian regions, their popularly in the area has hardly wavered. Fans should be ecstatic to hear Cold Chisel’s release No Plans, due April 6, 2012. The bulk of the album was recorded in 2010-2011 scattered about varying different sessions. Front man Jimmy Barnes, in interviewing on the album itself said ""The last two years have reminded all of us that sometimes life deals up things you don’t expect. You can’t take anything or anyone for granted. Sometimes it’s best to have no plans."" The record barely came to fruition.

17,Funny Short Stories,arts-entertainment," Telling funny short stories is an art in itself; just ask stand-up comedians who tell the same jokes over and over again and yet still elicit the loudest laughs from their audience each and every time. Indeed, it’s the delivery of the story from beginning to end that makes it hilarious, the building of anticipation until the climax, and the timing of the punch line that makes it a side-splitting tale. You may think that only those with natural comedic ability can tell funny news stories, jokes and punch lines like a pro. Well, we must say that even great comedians like Bing Crosby and Bob Hope have to practice their skills in telling funny short stories to small audiences before making it big in television and in theatres. Indeed, practice is the key to making your audience laugh over and over again. Here are a few tips from the pros that you can use to hone your own comedic talents. Keep in mind that you must learn to be flexible in telling funny jokes and short stories since each situation and each audience demands a different approach. • Get your audience’s attention first instead of competing with other distractions. We suggest changing your voice to suit the characters in your story as well as using hand gestures and facial cues to do so. Your main aim is to let your audience visualize the story as it happens, which is all-too-true with funny news stories where you act as the anchor man and story subjects at the same time. • Tell your funny short stories according to the mood of your audience. For example, if your audience is relaxed, say, sitting down while enjoying coffee, then your story can be told in a leisurely way. But if your audience is on the move, say, moving through a busy lobby, tell your story in a faster way. • Change the story to suit your audience. Yes, it can be the same story but told in a different manner, with different characters, or with different endings. This is how great comedians can elicit laughter out of old jokes – by revising old stories to fit the present audience. Of course, you must tell funny short stories with a straight face until the punch line and then laugh with your audience. Remember that the story is the funny thing here, not you per se."
18,Stainless Steel For Show; Folded Steel For Those In The Know,arts-entertainment," Samurai Swords can simply be an ornament and conversation piece to be displayed in your home or office. But for the aficionado of Japanese culture or for use in martial arts certain of these swords are authentic, lethal weapons.  Knowing what distinguishes one from the other as well as your intended use for the Samurai sword is important because the price of the sword will vary greatly based on the process and type of steel used in forging the blade. For the most part, the ornamental Samurai sword will be made from stainless steel and is much less expensive than its forged, folded steel relative. This is a version of the traditional sword that is a wonderful piece to hang on a wall or to prop-up on a table display but the blade is not nearly strong or hard enough to stand up to the rigors of cutting displays or to do combat with other Samurai swords. And while the blade might appear to be sharp and shiny, it will dull easily and the intense shine of the blade is an indication of a poorer quality blade due to the steel used in the forging process. Stainless steel has a very high level of chromium, which will enhance the grain and polish of the sword but essentially will also undermine the internal structure of the blade compared to high carbon steel blades and folded steel blades used in more traditional fighting blades. High carbon steel blades offer the user a much stronger sword but those forged from Tamahagane steel, or folded steel are truly the authentic Samurai swords most sought by collectors and martial arts experts. The folded steel blade and process of forging this blade uses two different steels; one is a harder outer jacket, which is wrapped around a soft inner core. The result is an extremely hard, durable blade that has a razor-sharp cutting edge that is also strong enough and flexible enough to absorb the blow of an attacking opponent. The steel used in making the outer layer of the sword, hadagane, is continually heated and then hammered to eliminate imperfections in the steel. This heating, hammering and folding of the steel will go on until the steel is perfectly hardened, the result being a blade constructed of steel that has been folded into many layers. The other benefit of the folded steel blade in the Samurai sword is that the hammering and folding of the steel evenly distributes the carbon in the steel throughout the blade and thereby ensures that the blade is universally strong at every point, reducing the possibility of fractures. The inner core of the folded steel blade follows a similar process as the harder outer shell but it uses a different steel, shingane, and it is not folded or hammered as much as the hadagne. The two pieces are then put together and the hammering is repeated to make sure that there is no air between the two sections of the blade or any other impurities that will affect the quality of the steel. Before tempering the blade in water clay is applied to parts of the blade so that it will cool more quickly along the thinner edge, which makes it much harder and more durable and able to stand up to being sharpened like a razor. The difference between a stainless steel Samurai sword and the folded steel sword is similar to that of display pistols versus and authentic Colt 45; one is made to be seen and the other is a skillfully handcrafted authentic piece requiring the utmost care and expertise in the materials, process, and design used to make these stunning pieces of functional art."

Talking about nudity we usually mean mostly woman’s body, so it would be true to say that the principal theme of the original paintings for sale created in this refined genre is femininity as well as sensuality and motherhood. Woman’s body is preferable for artists not because of their dislike for men’s but because the weaker gender has such a tremendous plasticity. To explain the reason of the enigmatic attraction that women have, one poetic figure – ""the mystery of nature"" – should be recalled. The art painting portraying a symbol of harmony will beautify any interior. It is assumed that the nude paintings appeared as a genre in the Renaissance period. The first art paintings imaging the nude body were merely restricted by the patterns of mythological, historical, allegorical and social subject areas. Giorgione, Titian, Correggio and other artist of that time embodied in their art paintings the ideal notions of female beauty and they often added some philosophical or poetic nuances. For the Baroque style portly and plump shapes were typically used at the nude paintings. The artists incarnated the charm of young blossoming beauty in their works, pointing up the sensual and sanguineous perception of the surrounding world. One of the most prominent artists representing the nude paintings in the Baroque style was Peter Paul Rubens. In the 18th century the rococo images were presented in the nude paintings genre. Graceful and coquettish lively forms as well as imbued with sensuality woman’s nature appeared at the art paintings of such artists as Francois Boucher. Later in the 19th century some artists tried to return these classical canons of beauty, but the nude paintings of that time were mostly created as sugary and eclectic original paintings for sale. Soon after that the genre of nude paintings lost its mythic associations, acquiring its modern character owing to the outstanding creativity of Edouard Manet. The development of the nude paintings continued up to the 20th century, when the artists faced the problem of morality. The discussions according to the existence of boundaries of the erotica in the original paintings for sale created in the genre of the nude paintings entrenched firmly in the European artistic consciousness. The study of art and aesthetics is still searching for the clear criteria for moral acceptability of the nude paintings by analyzing different samples of various art levels, but since the days of ancient Greece the beauty of the human body remains one of the most powerful inspirational sources for creators of the art paintings. The attrahent fascination of the nude body still occupies the primary place at the original paintings for sale created by modern artists."
2,Funny Christmas Stories to Share with Your Loved Ones,arts-entertainment," Christmas is a time of goodwill, good cheer and good times with family and friends. Christmas songs are sung, Christmas dishes and desserts are shared, and Christmas decorations are put up in advance of Christmas Day. Well, why stop there when you can also share funny Christmas stories with family and friends gathered in the family home? Think of these Christmas-themed funny short stories as your family’s new tradition for the holidays and, thus, add more fun, more laughter and more levity to the special occasion. While gathered around the dining table on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day, a few selected members of the group will tell humorous short stories about Santa Claus and his elves, angels and shepherds, and even about the experiences of family and friends during Christmas. With these funny Christmas stories, a few rules must be observed so that everybody can enjoy the tall tales. Keep in mind that Christmas is supposed to be a happy occasion so it is important to respect other people’s sensibilities especially about the beloved Christmas characters. For example, the funny short stories must not touch on sexual subjects since kids are around – perhaps, these kinds of jokes can be saved for when the kids are asleep. It is also important to remember that Christmas is also a special religious occasion for many Christians. You will want to avoid making fun of certain religious symbols and icons (i.e., crosses, saints and Christ) unless you are absolutely sure that everybody within earshot of your irreverent funny Christmas stories sees these tales as just that – jokes that are designed to elicit laughter, not raise hackles. Otherwise, just avoid telling these tales to preserve the peace and goodwill of the season. What are the benefits of sharing funny Christmas stories, you may ask? After all, there are already songs and dances, food and drinks, and other traditions that make Christmas fun so there seems to be no need to add more to the season. Well, shared laughter strengthens relationships among parents and their children, among friends and acquaintances, and among husbands and wives – and isn’t Christmas all about strengthening the family and the community? So, share your funny Christmas-themed stories at the dinner table and watch how love, peace and goodwill flow among family and friends."

4,Three ways to make a long commute fly by,arts-entertainment," Long commutes are just another fact of life for some people, but there is no reason why you should not enjoy yourself during this time. Whether it is just a continuous train ride from one city to another, or a journey that involves several changes, there are options open to you that will push away the boredom and take your mind off what is going on around you. Screaming kids and other annoyances should hopefully fade as your attention is grabbed by the task in hand… This the key to making a long trip go quickly: distraction. What you need is something entertaining enough to keep you interested and sane even when the bus driver announces a new delay to your journey home. Here are three categories that you can try... Ears Earphones are the saviour of many a disheartening commute, allowing you to close your eyes and listen to whatever takes your fancy. Do not stop at mp3s and local radio however - try out an audio book or look into podcasts covering your hobbies. There is a wealth of diversity at your fingertips, so go ahead and enjoy the fruits of the digital age. Hands From the height of technology, we revert back to classic crafts. Taking a craft project on to a train or bus generally requires that you have a seat, but aside from this issue, it can be a great way to spend your otherwise-lost time productively. Take your pick of anything from knitting and sewing to origami or drawing. Eyes The classic way to while away the hours on a train is to take a newspaper or book; both of which will provide plenty of entertainment for however long you are on the train or bus. What stops a lot of people from pursuing visual entertainment on their commute is that they will often have spent the whole day using a computer screen or generally reading, so the prospect of reading holds little appeal. If this is the case, try graphics novels or other picture-based literature such as art books."
5,Making the switch to download,arts-entertainment," Thanks to innovations in technology, finding things to do during travels or periods of rest is never hard. Audio books have long been a standard for owners of portable media players and parents looking to take the edge off a long car trip, but compact disc is often the format of choice. In the comfort of your own home the situation could be different, but the majority of people could do without the hassle that comes with playing physical media. Music has virtually made the switch over to download, with sales continuing to side with digital versions and, for someone on the move, digital audio books are the way forward. Putting a recording onto a few compact discs used to be the easiest way to listen to book readings due to the vast quantity of content and the portability of a CD over the cassette. However, for CD users, carrying around four disks has still never been a practical way of listening to audio. This is discounting the process of having to switch over every 50 minutes or so to listen to the next chapter; a task in itself during a walk or stand-up bus journey. However all of the cons that used to put those loyal to the hard copy off audio books are gone with the download. When going about acquiring an audio book, the process couldn't be easier. The days of having to trek down to the local book or record store to get a latest release or search for something that takes your fancy are long gone, largely down to the practicality of the download. With fingertip-browsing available on websites to scan through the latest releases, classics and genres, there's no need for you to get out of your seat. If you didn't find what you're looking for, you can check back on a later date. At least a trip hasn't been wasted. When you've selected what you want, take a couple of minutes to create an account and from then you'll be ready to start to downloading. With only a few details required for log in, shopping for downloads is almost like being in a record store when you want, loading your basket and enjoying the purchases at the same time as you please. In addition to this,  audio books download at near CD quality; adding to the convenience. As far as the technology that plays them goes, MP3 players couldn't be simpler to use. Changing batteries and taking strides at an even pace to avoid skipping on a non-shock proof player are a thing of the past. Portable players feature anti-skip as standard, more than enough room to build up a good collection of favourites and few buttons - ensuring easy playback for people of all ages. So, if it suits, make the switch over to download the easiest of your life."
6,Case / Hard Bound Book Quote Requests - What to look for !,arts-entertainment," Book Printing: Be Aware of Paper Substitution Saturday, March 24th, 2012 I recently solicited bids for 3,000 copies of a 600-page casebound print book. The estimates I received ranged widely from about $12,500 to $22,500. I had specified the text paper as Finch Opaque because I like the sheet’s whiteness, brightness, and opacity. Also, in prior years this hardcover print book had been produced on Finch, and I wanted to maintain the year-to-year consistency. The Paper Specifications for Finch These are the specific qualities I like about Finch: Opacity: 93 (This refers to the show-through from the front of a printed sheet to the back of the sheet. Higher numbers are better. Opacity is the light-stopping quality of paper. It keeps a photo on the back of a press sheet from being visible while you’re reading the text on the front of the sheet.) Brightness: 96 (Brightness is not the same as whiteness. It refers to the amount of light reflected back by the paper stock. Out of 100, 96 is quite good, particularly when you consider that a #5 groundwood sheet used for an automotive parts catalog would be about 72 bright.) Whiteness: blue-white shade (Blue-white actually appears brighter than its specification would suggest. Neutral white or yellow white are the two other options. A blue-white press sheet is also referred to as cool white, while a yellow-white paper is considered warm-white. Blue-white paper increases the perceived contrast between the paper and the images, and text, on the page.)PPI: 426 (PPI, or pages per inch, refers to the thickness of the custom printing paper. If a particular paper stock is 500 PPI, the individual sheets are thinner than paper with a 426 PPI. If you check Finch’s website, you will see that 60# Finch Opaque Smooth is 500 PPI, while Finch Opaque Vellum—a rougher sheet—is 426 PPI. For an annually produced book such as my client’s index, producing a book of comparable thickness from year to year is important. Subscribers might resist paying the same amount for a thinner print book.) The Custom Printing Vendors’ Prices One book printer provided an extremely attractive price, about $1,500 less than the vendor that had produced the prior year’s version of my client’s casebound book. To make sure the price was accurate, I carefully compared the book printer’s specifications to those I had submitted for the estimate. Everything matched except for the paper specification. This printer had substituted another press sheet without disclosing the name of the paper. However, the PPI specification (435 in this case) clearly indicated that the paper was not Finch (otherwise, it would have been 426 PPI). I asked the custom printing vendor about the paper and was told it was Husky (a Domtar product). I am familiar with Husky, Lynx, and Cougar (all made by Domtar) and know they are good uncoated printing sheets. Therefore, I was still excited about the price savings. But I didn’t stop there. I checked the specifications for Husky: The Paper Specifications for Husky Opacity: 93 Brightness: 94 Whiteness: blue-white shade PPI: 435 Comparing ""Apples to Apples"" In comparing the prices of one book printer to the other (I was down to two printers at this point), I could not make an ""apples to apples"" comparison due to the differences in the paper. As you can see by the numbers, Husky is very close to Finch, but Finch is a brighter sheet as well as a slightly thicker sheet. Since I thought my client (and my client’s subscribers) would see a difference in the final printed book, I asked the vendor with the lower price to bid the book on Finch. I was surprised when the pricing jumped more than $9,000. The book printer acknowledged that Finch is an exceptional sheet and yet not their house paper stock. Therefore, this custom printing vendor would need to buy the paper for my client, and there would be a minimum order, hence the $9,000+ upcharge. My next step was to approach the book printer that had produced the prior year’s version of my client’s casebound book. I asked if there would be a price savings if the print book were produced on Husky. (At this point I want to also make it clear that I had already vetted both book printers. The first had a proven track record from the prior two years. The second vendor came with a superior recommendation from an associate of mine.) When I received the updated pricing from the vendor that had produced the prior year’s book, I was surprised. The cost would be exactly the same if the book were printed on either Finch or Husky. The Final Analysis This is what I can infer from the information provided by both book printers. The prior year’s printer, which had initially bid the book on Finch, buys Finch paper as a house sheet. That is, the printer keeps a ready supply of this stock for the greater percentage of its jobs. Therefore with its economy of scale, the printer can negotiate superior pricing for Finch paper. The low-bid vendor, which had bid the book on Husky, buys Husky as a house sheet. It is of a slightly lower quality than Finch based on the specifications, and this explains the lower price. The prior year’s vendor came up with the same price for Husky as for Finch because it would have needed to buy the Husky paper stock for my client (individually, with a minimum order) just as the other printer would have done for the Finch stock. This actually raised the price of the custom-ordered Husky above that of the superior house sheet, Finch. How You Can Apply This Information Don’t assume all printers have bid on the same specifications. Read all bids carefully and ask questions if you find a discrepancy between your specs and their printer’s specs. If you do not need a specific press sheet, ask about the printer’s ""house sheet."" Or ask about paper substitutions if the final price seems high. Don’t assume that all printers use the same house sheet. When in doubt, request paper samples (both printed and unprinted) and a paper dummy (to show the overall look and thickness of the book)."
7,How Singing Can Help You Make Friends,arts-entertainment," A student came in after the holidays absolutely glowing. It turns out that she had gone to some year-end parties that she usually dreaded, but this year there was singing. Her voice was in a new place where she could really enjoy singing with others and having fun, and she spent hours singing and making new friends. She was still happy a week later, and was very motivated to take her voice to the next level. I believe that when it comes to connecting with our group of friends (our tribe), there's nothing better than singing.  Here's my theory about it. Before there was anything written down, all laws, stories, folklore and history were passed on in an oral tradition that were sung.  The Torah, the Iliad and the Odyssey, and all the great classics of ancient culture were long songs that were memorized, and passed on around the campfire to the tribe.  It's much easier to remember words that are associated with melody. Now that we have written language, computers and social media, there are much easier ways to get the message out.  Singing has lost its place as the repository of stories, folklore and history.  These days singing has become a profession, where we go to watch a singer and expect a good performance.  When we watch American Idol, we feel a thrill when a singer gets rejected from the group.  In ancient times, separation from the tribe meant death, and we still have the remnants of that fear of rejection within us when we sing. The songs were the glue that held the tribe together, and sound of the singer was the sign that they belonged in the group. When I work with a voice student, our goal is to reach ""The Balance Point"" (a state where everything works in harmony with their singing.)  Once this happens, I usually talk to them about tribe.  My talk goes something like this: ""You’ve now accomplished a great advancement with your singing and your voice sounds strong, clear and beautiful. Watch now what happens with your relationships. Notice the new people who come into your life.  Watch how old relationships are strengthened and renewed.  You won’t know the how or why of it, but when the opportunity arises, make yourself available. You may be surprised by what happens."" An example of this was my student Steve, who had some significant tension blocking him from the Balance Point.  We began applying principles of voice release to a song that he planned to sing for his wife’s anniversary. Just before the anniversary, his voice reached the Balance Point, and he experienced what he described as a new structure.  It was a complete surprise for him because his voice felt so light and yet so powerful. We both experienced the wonder of the moment and I told him to look for the new connections that were going to come as a result of his advancement with his singing. Two nights later, after a meal with his wife, they wandered by the piano bar and the pianist asked him if he wanted to sing a song. He said ""Yes!"", and he sang the song for his wife.  Everyone in the bar realized that there was something very significant and moving taking place, and he sang the song with complete confidence, strength and beauty.  It was a defining moment for he and his wife."
8,The Boat Race Drinking Game,arts-entertainment," Boat Race Drinking Game is more than a game of skill. The speed with which a participant drinks is important in this game. Also known as a beer on the table drinking game, the game is usually between two teams of equal numbers. The rules of the game are can be alternated depending on the people playing it. Nonetheless the rules will always involve a team drinking in succession and the objective is always to be the first team to finish. The Boat Race ""Drinking Game"" has certain rules which include determining the number of male or female players as well as drinkers, the container that is to be used in the drinking, and the kind of drink to be consumed during the game. There are also rules that must be followed as far as punishment is concerned especially when the alcohol is spilled. This is a game that is very common in many universities and college campuses. Basically in the Boat Race Drinking Game, two teams will race to complete a certain alcoholic drink and the team that consumes their alcohol the fastest wins. Each player will have a cup or mug that has to be equal for every player and team and each player will have one chair regardless of which team they are on. There will be beer or a mixed drink of choice and the players are divided into two even teams. Their chairs are then aligned in rows side by side. The first participants are sited in the front rows and the second participants are placed right behind them, the third behind the second and the fourth behind the third and so forth.  All the participants are given a full beer and they pour all the beer on their cups or mugs. The race begins when the first players on opposite sides drink their beers as fast as they can. When they finish, they turn their cups or mugs upside down and balance them on their heads. During the Boat Race Drinking Game, if the players do not finish the beer on their cups or mugs, they will be a spill on their heads and this will result in a fine. The next player in line can go when the first player has balanced the cup or mug on their head and so forth. This game ends when one team is the first to have all their players balance their empty mugs or cups on their heads. Two rules must be observed. The first is that your team mates cannot start drinking until the player ahead of you has balanced their cup on their heads. Secondly, the players must be sitting down when drinking their beer. The first team to place their last glass on the table emerges the winner. Boat Race Drinking Game is very popular with many university students and competitions are always held very intensely between different year levels, faculties as well as different universities. An alternative version of this drinking game can be played with each player having two glasses of beers. The race thus goes down the line and returns and the turn around players have to drink two beers in a row."
9,Frog Jumped Into the Pond Drinking Game,arts-entertainment," The frog jumped into the pond drinking game is a word game that involves a lot of repetition. It does not require any planning or any additional equipments and can be played in the bar, in the rooms, at a party or just about anywhere.  As long as there are alcoholic beverages of their choice, the players are good to go. This game needs two players or more and depends heavily on the player's ability to be alert enough to know when they turn to speak and what they are supposed to say. The frog jumped into the pond drinking game is a quick fire drinking game that involves the players spelling out the words in the title. The players in a circle go around repeating the statement ""one frog jumped into the pond, plop"" in turns in a clockwise manner. All the participants sit around in a circle facing each other and the first player starts by saying ""one frog"", to which the next player has to say ""jumped over"", the third person says ""the pond"" and the last person says ""plop"". The number of words said in any one game round depends on the number of players. If there are more than four players then each player can say one word from the statement instead of two. For example instead of a player saying ""jump over"", one player can say ""jump"" and the other say ""over"". The ""drinking game"" then starts again but in this round the first player says ""two frogs"" once and not ""one frog"" as were said initially. The next person says ""jumped over"" twice now. The third one also says the words ""the pond"" twice and the last person says ""plop, plop"". After the last two ""Plops"" have been said the game begins with the first player saying ""three frogs"" and the rest saying their words three times. In the frog jumped into the pond drinking game the other players repeat their words according to the number of frogs mentioned by the first player. So the key is to always listen to the number of frogs being said by the player who starts every round of the game. The first player will only say the number of frogs once so it is up to the other players to keep up and know where the game is at. The players are required to say their words immediately without hesitation, pausing for too long, mixing up their words or saying the wrong words that are not even in the given phrase or messing up in any way. Every time a player breaks any of these rules they are required to take drinks according to the number of frogs mentioned. For example if one player says their words eight times and there are nine frogs, they have to drink all nine drinks. After they have taken their drinks the game starts all over again with the first player starting with the words ""one frog""."
10,Sidestep Catapult Drives Me Wild,arts-entertainment," I woke this morning from a dream of wild animals carousing in the backyard – so I reached for the book beside my bed:  Sidestep Catapult, by Anne-Adele Wight. I found those same creatures described by my own unconscious lurking in her poems.  Some animals are hungry; some just curious; others are downright vicious. Wight embraces the moods of these animals in all their complexity. Wight’s poetry brings our primitive nature to consciousness. As I read, an insistent remembrance of my primal side erupts through the surface, illuminating everything. Neuropsychology has mapped this part of our brains. Sometimes it is referred to as the reptilian brain, and part of it sits at the base of the skull.   It lives within us and informs our behaviors, though many are eager to deny it. A mystic teacher, DC Vision, once said to me, ""People think the natural world is beautiful.  It’s not always so glorious.  When you look closer, you see nature is savage. It devours itself.""  He spent several years traveling by horse across the United States, so he should know. I have my own gut feelings about the reptilian brain.  Avoiding interactions with the natural world and denying we are part animal pushes our primal instincts deeper into the unconscious. Repression makes this part of human nature, which is linked to survival, more dangerous – or something to fear.  Wight chooses to confront our inherent animal instincts instead.  In What Led to the Hawk’s Nest, her wild creatures appear unbidden in the civilized landscape. ""Florida panther paces towards you out of garage."" Later, ""teeth close on your wrist.""  This theme is reiterated in Leopard Flower, ""did you order animals for the toolshed?/ they’ll split it open."" To our civilized minds, wild animals are unpredictable and cruel.  Yet there is a distinct memory of the human world being a part of this: Eons have passed since we lived in the sea still speechless in language heavy-forest our throats lack bone and cord. Wight points out the separation between humans and animals:  communication through language is what drives a rift between species.  Yet even with all their skill, humans lack the apparatus to speak to animals. Wight’s subjects are imbued with light and fired by crystal energies. Her book harbors the uncontainable: the elemental forces of nature and the mysteries that envelop them.  Earth, air, water, fire and spirit coalesce in many of her pieces.  Crystal communication, plant energies, expressions of water and bursts of air emanate energy and light through movement or even in stillness.  Though these elementals travel a slightly different frequency than humans and animals, they are no less powerful.  When activated, the elementals portend signs of supernatural importance.  Transatlantic Night Flight is a good example of this: From inside Ptolemy’s crystal gridlines divide the Atlantic humming traffic control. Emeralds fall around me sounding calliope brings them down in a windfall hooting carousel tunes. Is this the music of the spheres? I love the way Wight posits the final question, set apart from this stanza. She is adept at perceiving through multiple senses. Wight is also attuned to the experiences of the astral body. Christmas Shopping takes this holistic, sensual awareness even further: every letter an element each element its opposite each opposite a color every color on fire Solstice Eve recounts a magic ritual where those gathered fuse with the natural world and initiate a stream of energy that is set quickly into motion. Four people            five trees how force is number working here and now. Something pulls toward tree skin from the core of a ring of five music struggles in upper branches In magical rituals, intention guides outcomes.  The act of gathering creates a centrifugal force held onto by those in circle and perceived and expressed through feeling, sights and sounds in nature. Wight’s work is the product of a mind with acute sensitivities.  For those who see themselves as a part of the natural world – not just a banal observer -- Sidestep Catapult will provide a jolt of recognition and a renewed sense of unity with our wild animalistic core."

16,Do Tattoos Belong In The Workplace?,arts-entertainment," Tattooing has been practiced for centuries by numerous cultures throughout the world. Ancient Egyptian mummies have been excavated bearing tattoos and Julius Cesar actually described tattooed Germanic tribes in 54 BC. Some cultures believe that tattoos have magical qualities and adorn themselves for protection or good luck. In many societies, both ancient and modern, getting a tattoo represents a rite of passage. Today tattoos have become commonplace and are a prominent part of our mainstream culture. According to the American Academy of Dermatology over 35% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have one or more tattoos. One out of every eight adult Americans has a tattoo and the percentage is even greater in Britain and Australia. Popular shows such as LA Ink and Miami Ink have brought tattoo culture to a massive audience. Despite all these statistics, tattoos are still not commonly accepted in the workplace. Quite a few employers do not permit visible tattoos. This means that millions of people all over the world make an effort to conceal their body art on a daily basis. Employees working in such fields as health care, shipping, banking, retail and the service sector often have to maintain two personas in order to keep their jobs. One persona represents the professional image they must project and the other persona represents who they really are. A double identity wouldn't be necessary if tattoos were not prohibited in many corporate and institutional environments. Respected brands such as Starbucks, Office Depot, Panera Bread, The Body Shop and AMC Theatres all enforce a no visible tattoo policy in the workplace. Freedom of expression is protected in the US by the First Amendment but this does not apply in the workplace. According to Burleson Consulting employers have the right to discriminate against what are deemed ""optional"" appearance traits. However, not all major employers restrict or ban tattoos in the workplace. Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Subway and Wal-Mart all allow employees to display ""non-offensive"" tattoos while at work. This does allow for some interpretation as to exactly what a ""non-offensive"" tattoo is. While the overall trend may be shifting towards more relaxed tattoo policies, there are still pockets of conservatism that crop-up from time to time. Sky News reports that a large number of restaurants and hotels in Sydney, Australia are now banning patrons with tattoos. All visible body art is to be covered at all times in many popular Sydney restaurants and watering holes. One restaurant owner is even quoted as saying that the policy is designed to ""keep out the common riffraff."" Entire industries have come into existence because of the prejudice associated with tattoos. Tattoo cover-up sleeves, concealer makeup, skin toned body tape and laser tattoo removal are all businesses based on the need to cover or get rid of tattoos. Laser removal has a reputation for being expensive and painful. It can take up to ten treatments to remove darker tattoos with lasers. It is estimated that over 100 million people worldwide have one or more tattoos. Much of the prejudice associated with tattoos comes from a lack of understanding. Most people with body art are simply expressing themselves. The tattoo industry also employs some of the most talented artists working today and their canvas is the human body. As long as people judge others by their appearance there will be a need for some to maintain a double-identity in order to be accepted and function in mainstream society. Only time will tell if tattoos become commonly accepted in the workplace."
17,Radiohead Plans to Play a Series of Dates in Australia,arts-entertainment," The influential alternative rock band, Radiohead, plans to play a series of high profile concerts in Australia in November of 2012. The group has one show scheduled in Brisbane on November 9, and two shows in Sydney, on November 12 and 13. It will also perform at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne on November 16 and 17, where tickets are priced at $130, and each customer may only purchase four tickets apiece, which is a measure to help prevent scalping. It’s been a little while since Radiohead last toured Australia. The last time the group was slated to perform at Rod Laver Arena, in 2004, vocalist Thom Yorke lost his voice, which forced the act to cancel its visit. Rod Laver Arena is a tennis stadium, and part of the Melbourne Park complex. In fact, it has been the main location for the Australian Open in tennis since 1988, where it replaced Kooyong Stadium. With a capacity of only 14,820, these two particular Australian shows will be relatively intimate affairs for Radiohead fans. These concerts will be in support of the group’s most recent album, King of Limbs, which debuted at No. 2 in 2011. Radiohead has experienced consistent success in Australia, with six of its eight albums all making it to the Top 10 in the country. Radiohead has released full-length albums with regularity since its debut, Pablo Honey, came out in 1993. Since then, the group has put out an album about every two years or so. The group made its initial impact with a song called ""Creep,"" off the Pablo Honey album. Radiohead made international headlines in 2007 when it released the album In Rainbows. The album did not have a set price tag, but was instead offered for a ‘pay what you want’ price via the group’s website in 2007. One can hear a wide variety of influences on Radiohead music. Early impact artists include Elvis Costello and Queen, although ‘80s alternative bands, including R.E.M., The Smiths, Sonic Youth and Pixies, also influenced its overall sound. The group’s early recordings were primarily guitar-oriented, although electronic music found its way into the act's sound during the recordings of both Kid A and Amnesiac. In addition to vocalist Yorke, who also plays guitar and keyboards, the lineup includes bassist Colin Greenwood, his brother Jonnny Greenwood on guitar, guitarist Ed O’Brian and drummer Phil Selway. Radiohead has been rewarded over the years for its music. Although it has yet to win a Brit Award, after eight nominations, it has taken home three Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, three Q Awards and one NME Award. At the Grammy Awards, Radiohead has won Best Alternative Music Award three times. Radiohead will began its 2012 touring in Glendale, Arizona on March 15. This tour will take the band to many different countries before it finally makes its way to Australia. Radiohead has never been a good time, sing-along concert band. However, it has made some of the most important music in the last few decades. When the group hits stages in Australia in November, these shows may well prove to be some of the biggest rock concerts in the country all year."

Some of their first efforts did not do so well, but they had the good fortune of being signed by the very powerful David Geffen who found a way to get them some much-needed airtime, and it paid off in a big way. From 1994 to 1998 the band was pretty much in hiatus, doing only a little something here and there.  However, in 1999 they finally prepared another album titled Chinese Democracy.  In 2001, after nine years without a concert, they did shows in Brazil and Las Vegas, which like previous Guns N’ Roses concerts, went extremely well.  2002 saw the band performing all over the place, especially in Asia and Europe. This year the Guns N’ Roses world tour began in February with several gigs in the United States.

20,Practical Tips For Caring For Your Oil Paintings,arts-entertainment," Regardless of whether they are works of outstanding artistry by renown artists or a beloved work of art by the homeowner, a friend or relative, oil paintings need care to retain their aesthetic appeal. Such a painting could be an heirloom and the art lover needs to assume it to last a lifetime. Here are a few practical things a householder can do to make sure their oil painting lasts. Do not display your oil paintings in sunny rooms because the ultraviolet rays present in direct sunlight can damage your painting. This requires keeping the painting away from sun-lit rooms where windows do not have shades or drapery to prevent the sun from shining in on it. Your painting really should be displayed in in a low-lit room of your home. If this isn't possible, then your windows ought to be covered with draperies or curtains or screens that will filter out the harmful rays of the sun. Other elements that can destroy your oil paintings are dust, extreme changes in room temperature, heat from a radiator, smoke and humidity. It is a good idea for the art collector to switch around an oil painting's position now and then with other paintings or works of art in your home. There's absolutely nothing that says a painting or any work of art should stay in the same spot on the wall forever. It provides a new and refreshing look to any room having a new painting adorning its walls. Oil paintings shouldn't be displayed on the wall over a fireplace or any location in which they come into contact with soot or other dirt. Your oil painting will also require being displayed on a hook that is sturdy enough to hold the weight of the painting plus the frame, else it could slide down the wall and become damaged.

Surfaces such as canvas or wood can swell when they collect moisture from the atmosphere, then shrink when they dry out. This can cause the painting itself to warp and may even damage the image on the painting. An oil painting should be located in a room with constant temperature and humidity levels. In addition, damp rooms with poor insulation, such as those common in old houses can cause mold and mildew to grow on the painting's surface. The frame that an oil painting is adorned with needs special attention likewise. It should be kept clean using a dry, soft, lint free cloth to keep it free of dust particles in the room. Never spray chemicals of any kind whatsoever on the frame while it is still around the painting, if some gets on the surface of the painting it could damage it. Oil paintings should never be touched with bare hands. If the painting has to be moved to another spot, it should be firmly grasped by both sides of the frame. Don't ever grab it by the top of the frame and especially not by the wire hanger on the backside of the painting. For added precautions, the handler really should take off all jewelry or sharp objects to make sure the painting isn't scratched. They should also be very cautious not to knock against the painting. The surface of an old oil painting might possibly become cracked if it's bumped. If the painting needs to be cleaned, this should be done by a professional.

3,Dance: The Blending of Instinct and Intellect,arts-entertainment," Humanity is said to rise above animality by virtue of our faculties of speech, reason, and intellect. Art and spirituality further set humanity apart from animals, yet people tend to forget that art is derived from rituals and spiritual expressions meant to return humanity to nature. People sang to pay homage to the sun and rain; people danced to appeal to supernatural entities that personify the earth, sea, and sky. People painted and dressed themselves to look more like the animals that provide them with food, shelter, and clothing with their body parts. In nearly every culture, tribal dances mimic the movements of various animals and natural phenomena like thunderstorms or earthquakes. Even if modern music and dance are reduced to mere entertainment, their spiritually uplifting effects are undeniable. These two related art forms spring from the core and fullness of humanity, and by using the human body as an instrument of expression, a person returns to nature while keeping unique aspects of humanity intact. Dance is also considered a unique form of communication. Subtle facial expressions and bodily gestures are nonverbal forms of communication, and dance capitalizes on both by expanding bodily movements to express deeper aspects of human experience and social relationships. Basic dance lessons teach partners the value of trust and mutual respect, elements that allow two entities to move as one. In the case of modern and free-form dance taught at Indianapolis dance studios, the individual dancer is restored to the primal facets of humanity in a way that is almost spiritual. Love, perhaps the most complex human emotion, is considered commonplace yet so abstract that translating it into speech, scripture, or dance can be a challenging task indeed. That being said, music and dance remain the two best media in which to express love and the activities that develop from it. Indianapolis dance lessons teach partners that, like love, personal barriers can be taken down to let mutual respect take hold and enable a pair to feel safe with one another, especially when dancing something so intimate and passionate as the tango. The way partners give themselves over to one another in a routine transports spectators to the same experience of love, the interplay between turmoil and peace. Like love, dance is something to take seriously. While Indianapolis dance studios allow dancers to hark back to nature and instinct, their bodily movements are simultaneously refined with aesthetic standards and techniques crafted by human ingenuity. This takes a lot of mental stamina and strong mind-and-body coordination."
4,Dance as Intercourse of Different Cultures,arts-entertainment," Some of the world's most famous dances were developed in colonial regions where contrasting cultures lived side by side and occasionally clashed. For example, the rumba, tango, and salsa came from former European colonies in Latin America. People’s eye for beauty and natural sense of rhythm enabled them to incorporate European, African, and aboriginal dance styles, which is how the Brazilians and Cubans developed the tango and the cha-cha-cha. Latin American cultures are the result of centuries of mingling between European, Native American, and some African influences. In parts of what is now known as the Central and South Americas, the people lived in a highly urbanized society even before the arrival of European colonizers. These colonizers introduced their culture to the natives, who gradually adopted it as their own. Language, clothing, architecture, cuisine, and dance from the Old World became widespread among the natives and became assimilated among inhabitants in the New World. Dance is a distinct cultural imprint in this colorful, multiethnic part of the world. People danced to entertain themselves and pass the time; it was also their way of bonding with one another. Along the way, some European dances were performed using indigenous music, with the steps continuously modified until they became what are now known as ballroom dances. Some dances, like the cha-cha-cha, shows some influence of flamenco, which originates from the Spanish region of Andalusia. The cha-cha-cha was developed in Mexico and Cuba and accompanied with the music of the same name. It has a distinct rhythm—in four-four time signature (4/4) counted as ""four-and-one, two, three"" or ""two, three, cha-cha-cha,"" distinct flavorful variations from the conventional ""one, two, three, four"" count. The dance Indianapolis studios teach involves basic footwork and hip movement, while advanced techniques provide the dance with a little more sensuality that Latin American dances are known for When African slaves were brought to the Americas, they added their own flavor to the Latin dances. They brought the candombe ritual dances to America, primarily in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil, where it was sung and danced through the night with barrel-shaped drums called tamboriles. These same drums were later used in the dance that developed into the tango, taught in advanced dance lessons Indianapolis dance aficionados love. Tango is a complex and sensual dance. Professional dance competitions highlight tango as having many interesting variations and improvisation. Dance studios in Indianapolis allow some freedom with the tango while encouraging partners to exercise trust and mutual respect."

7,Main Features Of A New Auction House In Diablo 3,arts-entertainment," One of the coolest things in Diablo 3 is a new and unique dual-money Auction House where players can trade their items with each other for in-game gold and real world currency alike. This is definitely a novelty in gaming world and in this article we will look into the four main features of this system. Easy Trading: All items that payers find or win in Diablo 3 can be easily sold or exchanged in Auction House. Those can be various weapons, gear, potions, and even gold can be exchanged for real world money. If a player with a wizard character finds a two-hand great sword for example, he would not have any use of it in previous editions of Diablo except of selling it to game vendor for a cheap price. Now he can enlist this sword in Auction House and players with barbarian characters will appreciate its true value and pay a fair price. Smart Search: A Smart Search feature is also a novelty integrated into the game. When players come into the Auction House they will see items auto sorted by usability for their respective characters. The cool thing is that they would also be able to perform a search for their other characters without need to log off. Dual Money System: As I already mentioned, players can buy and sell items for in-game gold and for a real cash. This feature opens a whole new perspective to the game and a whole lot of different possibilities. Currency trading is used for both, Auction House trading and for direct player-to-player trading too. It is optional and also limited for certain items. Blizzard Entertainment spokesman said that they would not put any items for sale, all trading will be done between players exclusively, and they would only make money from monthly subscriptions. Safe And Secure Transactions: The good thing is that all transactions and currency exchanges will be handled by Blizzard itself eliminating all possible hacks and scams usually occurring when third party websites are involved. This is a great improvement from World Of Warcraft game where, in order to buy gold, players had to deal with some questionable sites and traders. This would often lead to disappointment and many people got banned from playing with their accounts permanently closed. On the negative side, many Diablo 3 fans have expressed the concern that real money trading would tag the game as gambling. So in some countries where online gambling is prohibited the game might even become against the law. All things considered, new Auction House trading with real money involved is definitely adding more excitement into Diablo 3 game and will attract lot of new players wanting to try this newest trend."

17,Music Production and Natural Talent,arts-entertainment," My son has a good ear for music and understands the intricacies of music production.  He most likely will never win American Idol, but he does wish to pursue a career in music.  Attendance at a good music production college can provide the direction needed to understand the types of jobs available in the music field.  He can also hone his creative skills. You no longer have to head off to New York or Los Angeles to pursue an education in the arts.  Where local colleges used to offer limited to course opportunities in music production, more and more are jumping on the music production bandwagon.  With a society highly steeped in technology, music production is involved in more areas than you would suspect. With the proper education, my son can gain the skills needed to get a day-time job that will supply his grocery needs, while also utilizing them for his creative efforts.  He presently produces beats for musicians using home-based technology.  His creative efforts provide satisfaction but they don't secure the roof over his head. You might wonder if it is absolutely required to obtain a degree if you desire to work in the music field.  It isn't as simple as you might think to answer that question.  In any artistic field, talent is obviously a consideration.  There have been numerous writers that have succeeded with pursuing a Creative Writing degree.  But with that said, the chances of securing a job in the music field can improve with education. What will you receive by attending a music production school?  You should receive knowledge of the latest technologies used in the field.  You should also receive hands on training with the equipment.  You may also receive internship opportunities with some programs.  These opportunities obviously increase the chance of securing a job once your education is completed. As with any college, the costs associated with this degree will vary.  If you attend an accredited school, you should be eligible for the same financial aid opportunities afforded those students pursuing more traditional educational paths.  Scholarships are also available in this field as well. I currently have my son investigating the various opportunities available in our area.  We have discovered that he can take introductory courses at our local community college.  With considerably lower tuition rates, this is a good start for anyone wishing to pursue this field.  You will, however, want to ensure that these courses will transfer to any other college or university that you plan to later transfer. I don't plan to squash the artistic efforts of my children, but it is necessary to have a frank discussion about plans to make a living with their talents and passions.  To obtain the skills needed to draw upon creativity, a music production college is one option.  The practical skills and knowledge can then be translated to the job market."
18,Audio Engineering School: A Few Pointers,arts-entertainment," Audio production has been revolutionized by new digital audio recording tools that were unimaginable only decades ago.  This revolution has made the business of sound much less mechanical and much more sophisticated, changing the dynamic of the industry.  Consequently, study at an audio engineering school is more important than ever for those interested in a career in audio production. The ears hear by picking up sound waves from the air, and because we have two years positioned on opposite sides of our head we process sound in stereo.  We compare the information from each ear and refine out errors in sensing to purify sound. We sense subtle differences in the relative volume between the ears to derive directionality. Early on, both recording and playback were mechanical processes.  The first recording technologies used physical changes in the grooves of a recording medium to capture sound waves.  Playback systems then used those physical changes to determine which frequency to replicate and the volume to play it at. Whether it was a recording of a sporting event, legal testimony, or a meeting, audio recordings created an absolute record of the event.  That record had widespread value, perhaps nowhere more than in the entertainment industry.  Music was among the first sound recorded, and the value of those recordings were quickly recognized and exploited, creating what has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Because audio recording has historically had such value, the development of new audio recording methods has been a profitable undertaking.  Consequently, audio recording media and methods have progressed rapidly, becoming more dynamic, more robust, more precise, and more sophisticated.  And as new technologies have proliferated, they have also become more accessible to the masses. With the advent of digital recording, sound moved from physical media and to the inside of a computer.  By applying computer technology to sound processing, sound editing tools advanced rapidly.  Now audio engineers can manipulate sound frequencies in the same way that graphic designers photoshop pictures.  They can change relative volume, pitch, even smooth out a warbling tone.  Whereas recording was once the theater of audio recording, now that theater has moved to the editing suite. The final product may be demonstrably different from the original because the quality of an original recording can now be manipulated and processed.  And where once technical recording skills were the most valued and critical part of creating a finished audio record, now engineering the sound has stepped into the foreground. It is possible for anybody to create an audio record because the tools to record and edit sound are widely available.  As a result, high level knowledge of the techniques and technologies that are used in the workplace today is essential for those who want to pursue a career in audio recording.  A good audio engineering school provides the best way to gain that critical knowledge."

5,Different Sound Engineering Colleges,arts-entertainment," There are different things that interest different people. With the different interests, there are different careers that will allow people to follow their interests. Some people are interested in finance, accounting nursing or a host of other traditional careers. There are some that are more interested in artistic careers. Schools that cater to those creative industries can be hard to find. The demands for qualified sound engineers have grown and sound engineering colleges have also grown to meet the demand. Although sound engineering college isn't the first thing people would think to attend to become a world famous music mixer, it is recommended. There are many aspects of sound engineering that can't be gained without an expert teaching them. It is also very hard to establish a career in sound engineering if there are no credentials to validate those claims. One of the more common options is to attend a traditional two or four year college that has a sound engineering college as part of their facilities. These colleges are normally accredited and have a substantial amount of resources to provide their students. They often give their students access to recording studios and the classes are taught by teachers and professors that ideally have experience in the industry. The biggest complaint against attending one of the more traditional sound engineering colleges is that the classes are taught by teachers and not professionals that are in the industry. With being taught by a teacher, some critics feel that there is limited knowledge that can be given about the modern on goings in the industry. The other complaint against traditional sound engineering colleges is the fact that there is limited exposure in an actual studio. In some careers, hands on practice goes a long way. Sound engineering is one of those careers. As students learn various things, they need to be able to go into the studio and practice those theories. There is a different, not traditional sound engineering college that is available. It is geared specifically for learning the art of sound engineering. Their curriculum is based on what it will take to become successful in the field of sound engineering. These schools normally have functional studios that students work in with professionals. With these sound engineering colleges, they believe that hands on experience is the best way to learn. They teachers of these classes are actually professionals within the industry and the class sizes are normally small. Combining the small class sizes with hands on experience will create a more personalized learning experience. Not only will the learning experience help but making the contacts within the studio will also enhance a graduate's career. There is really no way to say which type of sound engineering college is best. The advantages of going to a tradition school lie within the resources that those students have. For the students that attend a school based in a studio, the hands on experience is irreplaceable. The degrees or certificates that are earned the best way to build an outstanding sound career."

9,"Break open the popcorn, the world’s about to end, again!",arts-entertainment," The writing is on the wall.  The year is 2012 and that can only mean one thing (apart from the London Olympics, the US Presidential election, the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and numerous other anniversaries), namely the end of time itself. Are you ready?  Hardcore Christians and diehard survivalists are on their starting blocks, some waiting for the rapture, while others ready themselves for nuclear armageddon.  But for millions of others, who don‘t believe the world will end in 2012, we are just waiting for the next fictional fix of doom and gloom. It‘s addictive and moreish, but why do we love a good kicking?  Post or ""soft"" apocalyptic science-fiction is big business, both in print and on the silver screen.  We’ve been invaded by aliens and smashed by meteorites, while mother-nature has also given us a fright. For some, this fixation with mortal fiction is bolstered by events in the real world.  The events on 9/11 were spellbinding.  It never stopped as real events were chased by online and on-air rumour.  It was wrong and frightful and damning, but for some it was also an amazing buzz, though not one shared by those closer to events.  9/11 was too real and the human race and its demons made it happen.  Damn you Bin Laden. The year before and protestors in the UK managed to prevent fuel tankers reaching petrol (gas) stations.  Motorists were protesting about the hike in fuel prices.  As the days passed there was the real likelihood that essential supplies would run out.  This would mean that food would also become scarce.  There would be riots and the army would be brought in, but common sense prevailed.  But what a rush!  We were all taken out of our comfort zone, and for some this buzz wasn’t enough, but why? In a word: Escapism Some of us trudge through a mundane, nine-to-five existence.  We need to escape, and being destroyed by mother-nature or invading aliens gives us that adrenalin rush and imaginary means to exit the rat race. Thankfully for us doom addicts, Hollywood and publishers have satisfied our darker thoughts and desires.  Notable films include When Worlds Collide (1951), The War of the worlds (1953) and The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961).  More recent thrills have included Independence Day (1996), Deep Impact (1998), 28 Days Later (2002), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Knowing (2008) and 2012 (2009). As for the printed word, I’d like to add my own creation, namely ""The Lost Diaries of John Smith"", which is available from Amazon. Imagine the world ending as told 20 years after the event. ""The Lost Diaries of John Smith"" was written by Amy Cooper on an old, manual typewriter in 2035. She was born in 2010 and survived a devastating firestorm that killed countless millions in 2014. My book is her story. Her prose is first hand and accompanies the lost diaries of the man who saved her life. The Lost Diaries of John Smith is acknowledged to be the best written account of survival in a post-apocalyptic Scotland. It also highlights the secretive mining operations by both man and alien. But who is John Smith?  He saved the life of a three-year-old girl (the aforementioned Amy Cooper).  Beyond that he’s an enigma.  I created him but have no idea who he really is.  He’s not me.  I knew that before writing my book.  That said, much of what happened or will happen to Mr Smith is shaped by my own experiences and phobias.  ""The Lost Diaries of John Smith"" is about running away from reality and commitment and responsibility and hard work. But will reality ever catch up with fiction?  Will 2012 end with something terminal and more devastating than any tsunami or act of terrorism?  Such a ending has been predicted by numerous soothsayers including Nostradamus, but predictions are often reassuringly inaccurate, so don’t worry - just carry on as normal and read a good book, even if it does give you nightmares."
10,Citizen Kane:  The film that William Randolph Hearst despised the most.,arts-entertainment," Citizen Kane is accepted by most film critics today, as the greatest film of all times. The film was also ranked 1st in AFI's edition: ""100 movies list"", and became an inspiration for director Steven Spielberg. The latter not only bough Kane's ""rosebud"" sled in 1982, but also paid homage to Welles' film (government warehouse where full of artifacts placed in boxes) in 2 Indiana Jones movies. Citizen Kane is a basically a drama film, having as a key figure Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles)- a tycoon living his last years in his vast estate called Xanadu in Florida. Kane is portrayed as a bitter old man, living alone and unhappy, despite being surrounded by immense wealth. He dies while holding a snow globe and whispering a mystery word: ""Rosebud"". News reporter Jerry Thompson decides to find out what is ""Rosebud"", thus he starts interviewing all Kane's associates, family and friends, and by doing so, the story plot starts to unfold. One the key points of the film is the ending scene, where we can see Thompson fails to solve the riddle of Rosebud, and admitting that : "" Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost"". However, it is revealed to the public that Rosebud was the name of Kane's sled (from his childhood), that is portrayed as thrown by Kane's battler to a fireplace in order to be burned. The symbolism of the scene is very powerful: Charles Foster Kane, a  tycoon &  dominant public figure-with his dying breath-is revealing to the public his desire for his lost childhood; the only actual time that he was truly and utterly happy. It is no secret, that script writers Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles used W.R. Hearst as a principal source for the character of Charles Foster Kane. According to film historian Don Kilbourne: ""Much of the information for Citizen Kane came from already published material about Hearst... some of Kane's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst"". Both script writers publicly denied any connection between Kane and Hearst, however it seemed that the more they denied any relation to Hearst, the more public came to believe that is an actual biography of Hearst and a severe criticism to his life and actions. Perhaps the most characteristic scene that reveals the inner connection between Kane's character and Hearst, is when Kane is portrayed as a profligate collector of world artifacts: -Bernstein: ""There's a lot of statues in Europe you haven't bought yet"" -Kane: ""You cant blame me. They've been building statues for some 2000 years and  I've only been collecting for 5"" Afterwards, Welles had to admit that this specific characteristic (of Kane) was directly taken by Hearst. ""And it is very curious that a man who spends his entire life paying cash for objects he never looked at"" Welles said ""he just acquired things, most of which he never opened, remained in boxes"". William  Randolph Hearst, was enraged with the released of the film, because he was certain that it was basically a parody of his character. As a consequence he banned any advertising, reviewing or mentioning of it in his papers. He also tried (through Louis Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) to purchase the movie rights and destroy all movie copies, RKO (Kane's production company) denied steadfastly. Hearst, also tried other ways: He paid major movie theatres in order to ban the film, and started a series of defamation articles (from various papers owned by Hearst) against Welles. The film despite these setbacks managed to be released at the cinemas and managed to rank 6th in sales tickets for 1941. Last Monday, Jeebboo (www.jeebboo.com) the well known trivia/quiz online game, posed the following question to its members: ""How many Oscar nominations Orson Welles's film ""Citizen Kane"" got awarded for? A. 4, B. 7 or C. 9"" ? The correct answer is C.9 and are the following: •	Best Motion Picture •	Best Director •	Best Actor •	Best Writer (won) •	Best Art Direction •	Best Film Editing •	Best Cinematography •	Best Music •	Best Sound Recording"
11,Chapter 11-- Summer of '70,arts-entertainment," The Summer of 1970. Wow. What a great summer! It will always go down as one of the best. No, no, it was the best; it was just one of those summers that I never forgot. I turned eleven. Between fourth and fifth grade. The first girl I fell in love with, as much as an eleven year old can be in love: Debbie LaBonte. She blew me away. We had a song, or at least I had song for us. I’m pretty sure she knew nothing of it. I can actually guarantee it. ""My Sweet Lord"" by George Harrison, I still think of her every time I hear that song. I even bought an ID bracelet for $6, which was the way it was done back then: find a girl, fall in love, give her your ID bracelet and live happily ever after. My dad told me I was too young to be going steady and forbid me to give her my ID. Love is a powerful thing, even as an eleven year old.  You couldn’t tell me not to pursue the woman I’m going to marry. So I had my song, my ID and the nerve to go get her. Off I go. It may have been the most nervous I’d ever been – I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend. This was still back in the day when you called a girl and she answered, you hung up in sheer terror. I’m not sure why I thought I could talk to her in person when I couldn’t do it on the phone. I was scared to death, my heart was racing, my stomach was doing flip flops, I was sweating and in a panic. I’d practiced my lines, my moves, my thoughts, my actions. I’m prepared, I’m shaking, but I’m prepared. I’m about to embark on an adventure of a lifetime, an adventure in love. Let’s go. I got shot down out of the sky and was devastated.  So I did the only thing I could do in that situation.  I picked up the pieces of my shattered heart and went home.  My heart was broken the way only an eleven year old heart can be broken. Well, that was a waste of $6. My first experience with heartbreak, little did I know, was just the start. There was plenty more where that came from. Just keep stepping up to the plate, boy, and the girls will continue to bombard you with bean balls.  And we do, we just keep stepping up to the plate, because we LOVE you, don’t you understand? I LOVE you; you have to go steady with me. Apparently she didn’t.  A note: In seventh grade she had a crush on me, but it was too late.  I’d moved on.  My trek as a lone wolf had started. So Debbie LaBonte wouldn’t go steady with me. I guess this means we’re not getting married. I guess I’ll just hang with my friends this summer, which prophetically enough, is pretty much the way it goes for your entire life. Find a girl, hang with her, break up, go back to your friends, find a girl, hang with her, break up, go back to the friends. I still have my whole summer. I’m going to have fun with or without my sweet Debbie. The 4th of July is coming, the greatest of all holidays for a kid. It’s the middle of the summer, no school in sight, it’s hot so you don’t have to wear shirts or shoes, and you get to play with explosives. It doesn’t get much better than that for a young buck. We used to stock up on some fireworks. We had mostly Black Cat firecrackers, because nothing was cooler than Black Cat firecrackers. We would also get a hold of M-80’s and bottle rockets.  We didn’t have much use for ones that go in the air and spew colors, we wanted something that exploded. We also had these things called ""buzz bombs"" which were pretty cool. They would fly up spewing sparks and such. We landed many of those things on various neighborhood roofs. That’s a heart stopper when a buzz bomb lands on a dry, hot roof and it’s still spinning and spewing. ""Holy crap, grab the bag and run!""  We did a lot of running on the 4th.  It may have been the most runningest of all the Holidays. Mainly on the 4th we wanted to blow things up, and we did. During the year, my brothers and I would build model cars and airplanes and blow them up on the 4th of July. One of our delights was tying some fishing line to an airplane model, soak it in gas, light it on fire and then spin it around a leg on the swing set. The swing set turned out to be a launching point for many things that were on fire or about to explode. We had some cinder blocks next to the garage and we would sometimes put the airplane model on the block, fill it with cotton balls that were soaked with gasoline and throw bottle rockets and firecrackers at it until it was destroyed. Sometimes it would blow up and spray gas everywhere - you quickly found out it’s best not to stand too close to the cinder block. Just ask Ricky Nelson, not the Ricky Nelson, the one from our neighborhood, it took almost six months for his eyebrows and hair to grow back. He smelled like burnt hair for a week. Ricky had a little brother who was mentally retarded.  I don’t mean he was an idiot, he was actually retarded. Now they call it ""mentally challenged,"" but back then it was OK to say ""retarded.""  We always had to watch what we were doing around Ronny because he would mimic everything we did, and sometimes it was dangerous. My dad used to have these big rubber weights we could attach to our fishing rods, so we could practice our casting.  One day we were practicing our casting in the street in front of their house and Ronny saw us doing that and went into the garage to get his own fishing rod. But Ronny, God love him, didn’t use rubber weights, he grabbed a rod that had actual treble hooks attached. Treble hooks are three pronged hooks that do their job very well. So Ronny comes out with his fishing rod and his brother Ricky was unfortunate enough to be standing behind him on one of Ronny’s monster casts, and Ricky caught a treble hook right in the nostril, ouch.  Ronny, of course, doesn’t know this and thinks he’s snagged, so he keeps yanking on this sumbitch until that hook has been buried deep up his brother’s nose. Ronny had no idea what was happening because he wouldn’t even turn around, he has no idea why he can’t get his cast off and he doesn’t seem to care, and he’s just going to keep yanking on this thing until it launches. Now, all hell is breaking loose, Ricky is screaming at the top of his lungs, and we’re running into the yard to help. Ricky has blood flying everywhere, and Ronny is still trying to get his cast off. Mrs. Nelson comes running out and sees what’s going on and flips out. Nothing freaks a mom out like seeing streams of blood flying off one of her children’s faces while the other one is yanking a three-barbed fishing hook deeper into his face. She finally gets the fishing rod out of Ronny’s hand and wants to know where he got the idea of casting in the yard. Unfortunately, it’s hard for us to say ""not us"" when we’re standing there with fishing rods in our hands. Ronny stayed with us while his mom took Ricky to the hospital. They had to cut his nose all the way open to retrieve the hook.  His nose was wrapped up for most of the summer. I don’t think Ronny even knew what he did.  We just sat on the porch eating Popsicles, and he seemed as content as could be. I say ""popsicles"" but they weren’t actually ""popsicles.""  They were ice cubes made out of Kool-Aid with toothpicks sticking out of them, and sometimes the toothpicks were crooked because my mom put them in too soon and they would fall over and stick out sideways - hard to hold is my point. We never got to buy popsicles; my mom ""made"" popsicles. We didn’t really get in trouble or anything about the casting thing.  My dad just told us to be careful what we do around Ronny because he didn’t always know right from wrong.  Like we did. Ronny was almost like the mascot of our neighborhood.  We would include him in most of our activities unless we had to go somewhere.  Ronny’s mom didn’t like him wandering far from the house. He did participate in all the sports games though, which was a huge pain in the ass. Ronny always wanted the ball and when he would get it, he’d take off running.  Every time.  I don’t mean he’d run down the field.  No, he’d take off down the street with the ball. It didn’t matter if we we’re playing football, basketball or baseball; every single time he got a hold of the ball, he’d take off. I’m not sure we ever finished a game that Ronny was playing in because we would spend half our time chasing his ass down. I’m not sure what anyone else thought when they saw 8 or 9 kids chasing a retarded kid down the street.  Ronny always laughed the entire time we were chasing him too.  He just thought the whole thing was a delight. He was also deceptively fast; the only one who could really catch him was Tim.  Timmy would catch him and grab hold and then we’d have to pry the ball away from him, because not only was he fast, he was strong as hell.  It usually took a couple of us to get it away from him.  We’d head back to continue play and Ronny would come with us and want the ball again.  You’d eventually have to give it to him just to appease him and get him to settle down, but once he had it, boom, he was gone. Back to the 4th. Here’s something else to be careful about when gassing and exploding models. Keep them far away from the house. As we found out, wood burns, and so does paint. We scorched the side of the garage one day but good. It scared the hell out of us. As we’re standing there, we can see the house actually starting to burn. We stood there for at least a minute, wondering what the hell to do. Go tell Mom or run. If we run, we’ll have to come back, and then there will be hell to pay. Then my brother gets an idea, the hose! Get the hose! Good thinking.  We can put the fire out and mom will never know. Well, she won’t know if we cut out the burned wood, replace it, treat it and then paint it the right color.  We got caught, no way around it really, a big, three-foot round black scorch mark on the side of the house, no real way to hide that. Inside if you broke something, sometimes you could just throw it away and hope that nobody ever noticed. You can’t throw away a burn mark. But since we knew we were in trouble, we started blowing up everything we could get our hands on. We figured if we were going down, we might as well have fun. Dad won’t be home for another four hours, and we can do some serious damage in four hours. Let’s find some jars and coffee cans. Coffee cans we found out, can be treacherous, but the glass jars were fun, especially with the M-80’s. We went over to Chris and Todd’s house to get some peanut butter jars; their mom had plenty. We’d put them upside down on the driveway, slip an M-80 under it and watch the fun. We were a bit more careful with the glass, we stood behind a tree, all six of us, standing behind the same tree. When that M-80 went off, it sent shards of glass off in a huge circle of cutting, slicing, maiming death. But hey, nobody got cut, let’s do another. We blew up about four or five jars when Chris and Todd’s mom comes storming out of the house. Apparently, the glass was bombarding the house as well, and she couldn’t figure out what it was. The problem is, she’s coming out just as one is going off and it peppers the front of the house with glass. It seemed to scare the hell out of her. Chris and Todd weren’t allowed to play with us anymore. So it’s off to the Sweeney’s back yard and the coffee can. Our group is up to about eight, we lost Chris and Todd, but gained the Murray boys and two kids from one block over. I guess they came for the finale. I take this coffee can and drop two lit M-80’s into it, cover it up and roll it out into the backyard, and we can’t be more than twenty feet from this thing when it goes off. There are two incredible explosions and I feel crap hitting me in the face and arms.  I look around and everyone is bleeding, the can blew up and sprayed us with shrapnel, no real deep cuts, but head wounds bleed a lot, so it looks pretty bad. Kids are crying and freaking, the kids from the other block take off screaming, I don’t ever remember seeing those boys again. Everyone’s crying, and my mom runs out and there are eight kids standing in her back yard with blood streaming down our faces.  It looked like some kind of war zone.  If we would’ve been naked we could have made the cover of Time magazine. Jane kept her cool though, it was a little freaky at first, but she held it together, wasn’t really new to it, she’d seen this kind of thing before, nobody needed stitches, so she got everyone cleaned up and sent home. I went to my room. I spent a lot of time in that room during those turbulent years of ‘68-‘70. But that, unfortunately, was the end of the 4th of July 1970 for us. Those years of ages 9-12 were good ones. Much mischief. Good years in Kansas City. I attended Katherine Carpenter grade school. We rode the bus to school, and most of the time I walked home. I set some kind of record for the most minutes spent after school in a three-year stretch. Every time you screwed off in class, you’d get five minutes after school, cleaning erasers or some other chore. That’s good for the kiddies, breathing chalk dust in the afternoon, nice way to catch some black lung disease, or in this case white lung. When you ""misbehaved,"" your name went up on the board. Your name on board equals five minutes you would have to stay after school. Each time after that, if you misbehaved, you got a slash mark, each slash mark was another five. I figured out I could get up to four slashes after my name and still run home before the bus got there. That way no one would be the wiser. I was a trouble maker, but I covered my ass. On one of my ""hall sessions,"" I found a storage locker unsecured; I slipped in and found an endless supply of inks and paints and other articles of artistry. Seeing as I had no place to carry such a load, I used a ladder to put my supply of trouble on top of a storage cabinet nearby. After class, a friend boosted me up and we get away with our supply of inks and paints and other things that make a mess in the hands of children. We had hours of fun hiding in the bushes, throwing those tubes of ink into the street and waiting for cars to drive over them. Oh, it would give a squirt and we giggled like school girls. I don’t know what it is about young boys and breaking things, but we just love destruction. We went so far as to roll up pieces of bread and watched cars roll over them. Cars rolling over stuff, now that’s good clean fun.  I don't know why bread being squashed by a car is entertaining, but damned if it isn’t."
12,Chapter 4 --1st grade,arts-entertainment," For First grade I had Mrs. Enke, I have no idea who she was or what she looked like. I do know she thought my handwriting needed a lot of improvement. She also thought I had a problem with respecting authority, following directions, listening effectively, completing assigned work and effectively using my work and free time. Let’s peruse her comments about this particular first grader. ""Mark is overcoming his shyness.  He seldom contributes at Share and Tell time or in Science or Social Studies.  He seems to know his reading words quite well, but often refuses to share them."" I’m overcoming my shyness am I? Maybe that’s why I don’t participate, hmm? Did you ever think of that Mrs. Enke? Did ya, huh, did ya? I’m too shy to contribute my thoughts? I wonder why this wasn’t a problem in kindergarten?  What’s up with the reading thing? Maybe I felt that reading was a personal matter not to be shared with classmates. Trust me lady, I’ll be sharing enough in the upcoming years. If you’re still around, you’ll get yours. You’ll be praying for me to shut up. ""I feel that Mark is getting lazy.  He has not been finishing his homework assignments.  He has not been learning his reading words.  He has the skills to be at the top of his class, but he’s just not using them.  He often fails to hand in his papers.  I hope this will improve next semester."" I don’t think I like this lady. I think she’s coming down pretty hard on the ole’ sweenzster. I’m ""lazy?"" What the hell does that mean? If I don’t do ""homework"" I’m lazy? Hey Mrs. Enke, that’s why I go to school. I do my learning at school, not at home. You’ve got me all day long, teach me what you want but I’m not taking it home with me. I’ve got a full plate as soon as that bell rings, and doing ""homework"" isn’t one of the things on that plate.  Let’s see if anything improved in the third semester. ""Mark’s reading comprehension is improving but he can still improve.  My main concern is Mark’s attitude of being so defensive in most areas.  He doesn’t take interest in many things. He wastes so much time instead of doing constructive things. I marked him on respecting authority since he is defiant and disobedient most of the time. This hopefully will be changed the next quarter."" Well guess what sister? Nothing did change. As a matter of fact, not much of this has changed in the last forty years. Why should I feign interest in something that doesn’t interest me? Have you an answer? I thought not. I love the way so many teachers ""hoped for a change by next quarter.""  It’s a phrase we’ll see again and again. She also thought ""I wasted time instead of doing constructive things?"" Isn’t that what I’m in school for? For you, my teacher, to give me constructive things to do? You want me to come up with constructive things to do during free time? Why are we even having free time?  Aren’t we supposed to be learning? If you’re concerned about me doing something constructive, quit giving me free time. If my free time isn’t mine to spend freely, then it’s not really ""free time"" is it? This isn’t the school for the arts, it’s first grade.  Give me something to do, if it doesn’t interest me I won’t do it, but at least make the effort. Defiant and disobedient? What the hell? How does a 1st grader get to be defiant and disobedient? Was no one in control? What else happened? ""Mark will be ready for second grade next year. He should continue reading for his enjoyment and practice number facts through ten. He has been more cooperative this quarter. I hope Mark has a happy summer."" Whew!  I’m glad I’m done with Mrs. Enke. She seemed glad to be rid of me. Curious."
13,DUB Turbo Beat Maker Software Review,arts-entertainment," A single of my favorite things concerning the music marketplace is there is constantly new cutting edge technological innovation getting released.  Some considerably far better than other folks!  This really is exactly why I am writing this today. I was just lately looking the web for a beat maker software and happened to stumble upon a product referred to as DUB Turbo.  Soon after reading by way of all of the promo materials on the official Dub Turbo site, it sounded fantastic no doubt, but I did have some skepticism. After all, can you seriously count on all of this performance inside a personal computer program priced under $100 bucks? I indicate all of us know it is possible to virtually expend 1000's and thousands of dollars investing in high-priced music equipment to construct a broadcast top quality studio. But nonetheless, I was certainly intrigued and dependant on the reduced cost tag it was a no brainer for me to at the least give it a try.  Primarily looking at it includes a full 60 day income back assure. Just before I share my shocking experience, please be sure you check out my unique DUB Turbo Assessment Video.  I place it collectively to help dispel any myths you may, or might not, have heard about this beat maker software. Make sure you TURN YOUR SPEAKERS ON when viewing the video beneath! The background sound & beat is an example of what it is possible to produce with the Dub Turbo Beat Maker Software. Please note the video I made was compressed and converted to a file format for ""fast"" and ""convenient"" viewing for visitors on my website.  You will probably notice the BPM was a bit compromised (too quick) in the file compression process for my video assessment. The Raw Broadcast High quality Output from Dub Turbo is certainly better than what you are hearing here - but I did want to give everyone an idea of what this application can do. Just after I downloaded and installed the program I went by means of each of the training videos that are included.  The videos are set up to help introduce you to the software program as well as guide you step by step on making your first beat.  I followed along and within the first hour of using Dub Turbo I had produced my first beat in broadcast excellent.  I'll admit, I was pretty impressed at this point! Okay, so here's how I'd summarize my encounter with using the Dub Turbo beat production application: What I Seriously Liked..... It's Fully Functional It comes complete having a 16-Track Sequencer to construct, organize, and produce your sound, a drum machine that is preloaded with 1000's of effects, and a keyboard set to allow you to tap into melodies, chords, horns, and more. It's Completely Flexible You have total control over your beats-per-minute (BPM) which is very important as every beat you produce needs to be unique, individual volume control for each of your 16-Tracks, and for more advanced users it allows importing of your own sounds and sound kits. It's Very User Friendly This was apparent to me immediately.  As soon as I installed and opened the plan I was able to fire up the training videos and follow along making my first beat within an hour. It's Broadcast High quality Output DUB Turbo exports all of your beats to a 44.1 stereo 16 bit .WAV file format.  Every beat is produced in broadcast quality and sounds exceptional.  Your friends will love it, and if you are a serious producer, you can even sell your beats. It's Lower, Reduced Cost I still find it hard to believe that it is possible to find a beat production software that offers this substantially functionality, options, and quality at such a bargain cost!  There seriously is no risk at all in taking this plan for any test drive and pushing it to the limit. It delivered on what it promised As I mentioned earlier in my Dub Turbo Evaluation, I was a bit skeptical at first, but just after installing and running the system, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it seriously did deliver everything I was expecting... and more. Other Items to Consider..... Will Require Some Personal computer Memory You want to be aware that with all of this sophisticated performance, it will require some memory on your computer system to process the data.  If you're using an old laptop or a single with very limited memory, you could need to adjust some settings to greater tune your computer for audio production. Can Become Addictive This plan can become very addictive!  Not necessarily a bad thing, just something it's possible you'll working experience once you dig in and start cranking out serious beats! I hope I've been able to share some valuable information from my working experience with the Dub Turbo beat maker software to help you decide if it is right for you? Thanks for reading my post and best wishes to your music success! Check out the link beneath to see if Dub Turbo is still getting offered at a special promotional value?"
14,The Accents of Music,arts-entertainment," Have you ever thought about getting rid of your accent in a foreign language? And, do you have any idea how? Getting rid of your accent takes patience and effort. Learning a foreign language may be fun; however, reducing your original accent is not always easy. Although, when it comes to singing, people usually wonder why singers don’t have the accents from their mother tongues. I've heard different thick accents from all over the world, and I've listened to different songs performed by foreign singers. However, it seems that they have a uniform accent, which is mostly understandable and clear. Let’s take Bono as an example, the vocalist of U2. We often heard his thick Irish accent during television interviews, however, he sound very American when he sings. How does that happen? When it comes to singing, singers tends to pronounce the vowels more properly. The English vowels are the same, no matter what language you are speaking; speaking employs gliding vowels, and a transition from one to another. Singing is phrased such that vowels are held longer, which more or less eliminates regional accents. In addition, in singing, vowels tend to sound more properly or like monophthongs, rather than like diphthongs. Usually, English native speakers, such as British people, often have a really strong and thick accent speaking English. Thus, foreign people are most likely to struggle to understand their accent. There are two main ways in order to eliminate or reduce your accent in a foreign language. Working with someone will help you improve you grammatical structure, intonation, pronunciation and thus, your accent. Strictly training yourself to reduce your accent requires a precise coordination between your brain, vocal chords, and tongue; thus, proper training is helpful. Accents are the natural aura of every language, and eliminating your original accents would be complicated without proper and extensive training. On the other hand, singing is different from just ordinary talking. In singing, accents are very much reduced; this is because music eliminates the native accent to a large extent. Accent has a lot to do with the rhythm of the sentence, and when we sing we are forced to follow the music’s rhythm rather than our natural accent. Thus, interestingly some of the British and non-native English singers don’t have accents in singing. There may be a difference between eliminating and reducing accents of foreigners; thus, singing may actually help reduce original accents of an individual, however, it will take time to eliminate his or her accents. Singing may be one of the easiest ways for accent reduction; however, proper training such as learning the language properly can definitely help an individual to speak a foreign language properly, and thus, eliminating his or her accent when speaking a foreign language, like English."
15,I believe in the transformative power of dance,arts-entertainment," I have seen it with my own eyes, women who could barely look me in the eye when they first come through the door of the dance studio, shyly inquiring about the dance classes offered in the brochures and website asking questions such as:  ""Do you think I could dance like I did when I was a child?"" ""Do you think I am too old to start again?"" ""I always wanted to dance, do you think it is too late for me?"" ""I have never tried dance, will others laugh at me?"" I have seen people going through life changes, children leaving home, divorce, death of loved ones, moves from far across the country, and loneliness. I believe in dance and its healing powers, I believe in dance to fulfill the need for human connection, and I believe in dance to achieve the need for self expression. I lived for many years without dance in my life, after I got married my dancing stopped and I missed it. I remember one night in 1986 at the drive-in movie with my husband and children looking across at another screen as our movie was ending and seeing Patrick Swayze leaping from a stage to the dance floor below, (if you have seen the movie, you know which scene) and being mesmerized. Who was that? I had to see that movie, and the next day, with my 2 year old daughter in my lap, saw Dirty Dancing for the very first time. For several years after that, every night when I could not sleep, I got up and watched all or part of Dirty Dancing and dreamed of being one of the dancers. I had such a deep longing inside me that I sometimes felt an ache inside that I could not make go away. When the Walkman stereo became popular, like so many, I used music during my walking and/or running sessions. Eventually, I began to racewalk because it fit with the Latin beats and 70’s disco beats that were my favorites. Now I had my dance outlet. My racewalking partners could always tell during training and races when I had on ""my music"" because my gait and my steps changed, I was dancing through those workouts and races. I still love racewalking to Latin music, and I love dancing to Latin and R&B beats. Abby Bella was born out of my deep desire to dance. The idea for and adult dance studio just popped into my head one night and it stuck. When I first opened, I took all of the classes and realized that dance technique classes are really hard and I am not a very good student, as my instructors will tell you, but classes like Zumba were easy and still made me feel like a dancer. It was around this time that I also discovered that there are clubs for people my age who want to dance. Who knew? I certainly didn’t and was thrilled to go with my girl friends and dance the night away. Nothing hurts when I dance, I have no worries when I dance, and I am free when I dance. I have gotten away from dancing in the studio because the studio is where I work. I am going to get back to dancing this week, because my life has gotten away from me again, my fault this time, and I need to dance."

17,The Importance of Literary Translations,arts-entertainment," Books are a man's best friend. Books are the ultimate source of wisdom and knowledge. Can you imagine a world without books? It would feel as if we have gone back to the dark ages. As once Mark Twain rightly said, ""The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them."" Books are the windows that allow you to get a peek into different country's cultures and people. No wonder then that translations of books from one language to another have always been an important business.  Translations of literary works play a critical role in helping exchange ideas across different languages and cultures and enhance intercultural understanding. Most people feel comfortable reading in their own primary language. Translations of literary works, be it novels, poems, short stories and plays, open up completely new worlds to explore. It is not only novels which are translated in large numbers. Academic books, for example, are translated for students who wish to study and get an understanding of different cultures. Literary translations are regarded as a creative pursuit in its own right. And several writers have carved a niche for themselves for their literary translation works such as Vladimir Nabokov, Jorge Luis Borges, Sheila Fischman, Robert Stiller, Vasily Zhukovsky, Robert Dickson and more. History of Literary Translations The tradition of translating literary works is very old. Throughout history, innumerable literary translations were commissioned by the emperors and the governments. During the Middle Ages, Arabs translated various Greek philosophical and scientific works into the Arabic language. Similarly in India, various books in Sanskrit on poetry, medicine, astronomy, chemistry and others were translated into Persian and Arabic on a large scale by Arabs to gain a better understanding of the rich Indian culture and learn about achievements in the field of religion, science, literature and culture. Likewise millions of books have been translated from English to French, French to English, Spanish to Italian and so on. Demand for Literary Translations is Always High In today's global age, literary translations have become even more important as countries depend on translations to facilitate communication in the field of education, literature and cultural relations. Literary translations help preserve cultural traditions and have made it possible for people to transcend borders and learn about other faiths and cultures. It doesn't matter if you don't speak French. You can read French writer Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time (""A la recherche du temps perdu"" in French), thanks to literary translators. Seek experts for literary translations Literary translations are not just about translating one language into another word for word. A good literary translation must keep the meaning of the original text intact and use stylistics that are appropriate for the target language.

18,It happens almost every day at Abby Bella Dance Studio,arts-entertainment," It happens almost every day at Abby Bella Dance Studio; a woman walks into the studio and shyly asks about the classes offered at the studio. They may have heard about the studio from a friend, driven by, heard the music coming from the open door or simply found us online, and they are curious if they might fit in at the studio. Often, with a dreamy look in their eyes, they begin to reminisce about dance classes they took as a child or teenager, and wonder if they will still be able to dance. We tell them about the classes and assure them that they will fit in to our adult drop in classes. We have technique classes in ballet, modern, jazz, contemporary, hip hop, African and tap dance. Then they ask in a whisper ""How about Cardio Striptease or Burlesque?"" Women come to the studio at various times in their lives. Many come after a life change such as a divorce, loss of a loved one or children leaving home. I have had women tear up when they tell me that sometimes the only thing that gets them out of bed in the morning or keeps them going through the day is coming to a dance class at Abby Bella. I have been touched by so many stories, women who feel lost and/or sad and need something to make them feel better about themselves. They are able to connect with other women who come together in community to dance, laugh, talk, share ideas and hope. What started as an idea to give women a place to dance has become so much more. Women from all walks of life, all ages, sizes and abilities come to dance and forget the stresses of the day. Whether they come to work out in a Zumba or Bella Barre class or they come to learn to dance in a technique class, they all leave the dance studio smiling, walking just a little bit taller and feeling just a little better about themselves."
19,How To Play The Accordion: A Must Have Guide For Every Beginner.,arts-entertainment," Playing the accordion for the first time can be a daunting challenge but with the proper help and dedication to succeed it is very doable. The first thing you should consider is what type of music you would like to play. This instrument can be played in many music genres such as Irish, Italian, French, Cajun and jazz. I play a lot of Irish traditional music myself and also have a keen interest in French musette and jazz and discovered the best way to find my favourite music was to buy a few CDs. If you are interested in French musette or want to know what this kind of music sounds like there are a few CDs available online such as Café de Paris and Bal Musette 1927-42. My favourite Irish accordion albums have to come from the master himself, Joe Burke, from county Galway, Ireland with Galway’s Own and Morning Mist amongst my favourite recordings. Once you have decided on the kind of music you like it would be worthwhile to book beginner accordion lessons with a local tutor if possible. The alternative would be to purchase an instructional book accompanied with a DVD and there are a few great tutor books available on sites such as amazon.com. It is very important that you get the instructional DVD with such books as they will demonstrate clearly on how to get started. But if I was to choose between the two I would definitely go for lessons as your accordion teacher can give you valuable feedback on your good and bad points. However, I would like to stress that accordion lessons alone will not help you become a great musician. You will need hours upon hours of practise and the willingness to succeed. Becoming a good accordion player is not impossible but it takes time as well as practise and lessons do help to speed up the learning process. When practising try to focus on a particular piece of music and keep playing this piece until you know it off by heart. Don’t stumble through the parts you find difficult to play. Instead try to play them slowly. If you do this for all your accordion practise sessions you are guaranteed to master any kind of music. When I started to focus during my sessions I notice an improvement in my playing and it was definitely beneficial to my whole learning experience. I think in my opinion why most people give up learning music in general or not become outstanding musicians is because they don’t enjoy the music that they are learning and also lack a bit of persistence. The same can be said for anything that you want to achieve in life, whether it is obtaining good grades in college, learning music or getting better at a particular sport, you will have to work hard for it and in most cases really hard. It all takes time and the same principle applies when learning accordion music."
20,Nicolas Cage Denies Vampire Rumors,arts-entertainment," The internet was shook by the crazy news about vampires, but not about vampire movies, but real life vampires. Loud rumors were spread about actor Nicolas Cage and his dark past, saying that the actor is a vampire time traveler back from the civil war era. The rumor started spreading because of the appearance of an 1870 photo showing a Tennessee gentleman who shockingly resembles the actor greatly. The actor showed up in the ""late night show with David Letterman"" to put an end to the crazy rumor. The ‘Sorcerer’s Apprentice"" star admitted that the image sure looks like a ""slow downed version of him"" but denied the fact that he is a blood sucker. It would really be a huge groundbreaker if things like being immortal and time travelling are really possible. But one does not really need a thousand years to be contented with life; one life time could definitely make one really satisfied, especially if you would be able to use this wisely. The key to be able to live happily is to first, of course, take care of one’s self. One cannot fully appreciate life if he is too weak to enjoy every day, so the first step is to develop a healthy and fit body. It’s almost cliché to hear that diet and exercise are the best steps for a healthy living, but despite the fact that we hear this every day, there are some people who still neglect the wonderful benefits that living a healthy lifestyle could give. People tend to shake their heads on exercise just for the reason that it is boring, but there are actually exercise activities that they could actually enjoy, like attending a kickboxing class. Kickboxing is originally a form of martial arts, but it is also proven to be a very effective exercise routine. Attending Johnston kick boxing classes can actually do a lot of wonderful things to your body and overall health status. The activities that are involved in kickboxing uses every part of the body, helping them gain more strength and endurance. Carle place kickboxing is one of the most effective exercise routine for a person who wants to make the most of their lives. You would not be only entitled to gain the wonderful health benefits that come with exercising, but you would also train yourself on an awesome combat sport that could come in handy during unexpected times. So even if, this time travelling vampires are true, you would at least stand a chance to defend yourself."

2,Medieval Warfare Weapons- Powerful and difficult to be used,arts-entertainment," In medieval time there were various types of weapons which were used by the fighters. These weapons were sharp enough and required a lot of force and training to be used. Swords were an important weapon of the medieval period. It was a symbolic representation of courage and fearlessness. It was also known as one of the most reliable weapons. The style and pattern of the Medieval Warfare Weapons kept on changing significantly every time. Sometimes the changes occurred due to the improvements in metalwork or sometimes improvements in weapon design. There were different types of swords used at that time. The double edged sword was typically used by the fighters during the beginning of the middle ages. Later, these swords gained huge importance by the warriors during the wars. Gradually with the time, the evolution of the sturdy iron swords also took place. These were known as the long swords. Again, due to the changes in armor and warfare patterns a diamond shaped medieval sword was also evolved.  There was plated armor also which were designed by the weapon makers in later stages. This new type of armor caused many changes in the standard of various weapons. There were also certain types of sharp and pointed weapons used at that time. Slicing and bladed weapons were replaced by such weapons that could pierce or apply a hammer-like blow. In the medieval time the weapons were made and designed by the labors who were experts in making weapons. This development of hand made weapons continued and kept changing for centuries. The weapons used at that era were further classified into two categories. These were single-handed and two-handed weapons. Sword is one of the best examples of single-handed weapons. There were also weapons which were single handed and were similar to swords but they were not swords. With the beneficiary technological improvements these single-handed weapons were later modified. Gradually, they were made longer, sharper, lighter, and stronger by the weapon makers. Another common one-handed weapon was known as mace. It was a short handled striking weapon with a ball at the other end. The ball often had spikes on it. It was a powerful weapon and was used to penetrate the other armor. There was another standard weapon known as flail. It was short handled weapon with a length of chain with a flail head. This ball on a chain, when swung could generate enormous force. It was easy for a warrior to hit his enemy bad with this weapon. However, the two-handed weapons were such weapons which were used by a warrior against his enemy before he could get close enough to use his own weapon. They came in many variations and the most common type of two-handed weapon was a lance. The use of various weapons by the fighters over the course of the middle ages changed and evolved continuously.  There were many factors behind these changes such as blacksmithing skills and engineering skills etc. However, there were many variations of weapons that came and went. The Medieval warfare weapons were powerful and difficult to be used. They were only used by the trained warriors.Visit http://www.armorvenue.com/ for more information."
3,Did Hitler have a nuclear weapon?,arts-entertainment," Did Hitler have a Nuclear Weapon? There is no doubt that Nazi Germany spent a lot of time, effort and money on creating technologically superior weapons to that of the Allies, during World War 2. In fact, they started this process well before the war began, as is evident of the initial superiority of the Tiger Tank and the Messerschmitt Me109 fighter. But what super secrets were Nazi scientists working on? It became clear after Germany surrendered that plans for the Jet engine Frank Whittle created had been stolen by Germany as these plans were found in research labs all over Germany. So what else where they up to? Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States of America on August 2nd 1939, outlining his fears that the Nazi's were developing a nuclear weapon. He pointed out that Germany had recently taken control of Uranium mines in Czechoslovakia and stopped the sale of the ore. A clear indication that the Nazis wanted the ore for themselves. Uranium is five hundred times more common in the Earth's crust than gold. It can be found almost everywhere in rock, rivers, oceans and soil. But the trick is to find enough of it and to find U235 which is the only Uranium that is fissile, i.e., it can sustain a fission chain reaction, which is what you need if you want an Atomic Bomb to go off and destroy a large number of people, buildings and infrastructure. Ironically, some of the best minds of the day were actually German Jews who had escaped Nazi Germany before the war started. These men and women contributed significantly to the Allied effort, The Manhattan Project, to create the first Nuclear Bomb. But did Hitler actually get there first? German historian Rainer Karlsch wrote a book in 2005 suggesting that the Nazis actually tested a Nuclear weapon near the small town of Ohrdruf in Germany. This is disputed by some historians but others have pointed to limited evidence. However, what is not in dispute is the fact that the Nazi's were developing experimental aircraft and one of them had stealth capabilities. The Horten 229, or Ho 229, was developed by the Nazis, but Germany surrendered before it could go into mass production. The Americans, during Operation Paperclip, found the site where the Ho 229 was being developed. Parts and Blueprints were shipped to America after the war for analysis. Recently the same company that makes the USAF B2 stealth bomber built a replica of the Ho 229. Amazingly, during tests, they discovered that flying at a few dozen feet above the English Channel the Radar stations of the time would not have detected the aircraft. It could have slipped past the RAF and dropped a Nuclear Bomb on London. So, if the war had continued for another year or so, would the outcome have been very different. According to many historians it would. The Nazi's may have beaten the Allies to create the first Atomic Bomb as fictional books such as Operation Werewolf tell and they may have won the war with it. If so, the world would have been a very different place. Copyright © Tom Kane 2011"

5,Final Fantasy XIII-2 Video Game Review!,arts-entertainment," A fair amount of people that write review articles were really excited when Final Fantasy XIII-2 came out. Unlike the original game, this video game takes a close look at the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythos and crafts a story that surrounds the Etro Goddess. The Cocoon and Gran Pulse areas return in this game, and there are various changes in appearance throughout the time periods that the game depicts. Augusta Tower, for example, is particularly high tech and features a rather complicated maze for an interior. The Vile Peaks are now covered in snow, which makes them slightly more attractive than in the last game. Previously they were nothing more than mounds of garbage. Another interesting point about locations in Final Fantasy XIII-2 involves Valhalla. The realm of death that lies at the edge of time in some far off future is known as an unseen world that no one can usually venture to. However more than one review of the game has noted that this is actually a playable area. Gamers that get disappointed when the impression of a game gives lip service to areas that they never deliver on should rejoice when they hear that. Along with providing expandedareas, Final Fantasy XIII-2 expands on other previous storylines. Serah Farron was an NPC in the earlier game, but she goes on a playable adventure in this edition of the series. In fact, she travels with Noel and a Moogle counterpart to find her sister. Giving narratives to previous NPC characters is something that resonates pretty well with the majority of gamers. Most reviews written will note that the game really is not all that old. It was released in December 2011 for Japanese customers, and in early 2012 for gamers in North America, Australia and Europe. This means that many people have yet to find out that there are different theme songs for different regions. Japanese gamers can rock out to Mai Fukui's Yakusoku no Basho, but some western fans might be a bit disappointed that the music was switched out with Charice's New World. That said, the new song shouldn't make any gamer grab for his or her buster sword. Afew reviews have noted that much of the game involves various time travel missions. Many of those review's have made a few correlations to Chrono Trigger. In fact, Final Fantasy XIII-2 might be looked at as a version of Chrono Trigger without Akira Toriyama's manga art. While it might not resemble Dragon Ball at all, the Historia Crux System certainly does mirror the nonlinear game play module that the other RPG was based around. In fact, players that enjoy both games might notice the Square (now Square Enix) connections. At least one review mentioned the fact that a member of the female idol group AKB48 was chose to head a group of 13 test gamers. This was obviously a way to get a positive review out of fans and the Japanese gaming media. It might be worth mentioning that AKB48 hails from Tokyo's Akihabara district, which has long been associated with anime and video games. Maybe it was the perfect place to find someone to promote Final Fantasy XIII-2. Nonetheless, players of Final Fantasy XIII-2 shouldn't have to be concerned that the game is loaded with unnecessary gimmicks. Most gamers should probably be happy with the vast open world that they have the ability to explore. The characterization and storyline in Final Fantasy XIII-2 are just as good as any other game in the series."

The game is quite easy to follow and depends on the skills of the players. This game is best played by a small number of people - preferably between three and six. Some of the requirements of the game are a table or another flat, sturdy surface, a quarter, a glass and of course some beer. One person chooses to go first and this individual pours as much beer as they can take once in a glass. He or she is then required to spin the quarter. The climax of this drinking game is when the player tries to drink the beer and at the same time pick up the quarter before it stops spinning using the index and the middle finger. Failing to complete this procedure, the person has to repeat the whole process again until it is done right. This makes landmine very enjoyable. Some people are very skilled at this drinking game and can successfully do the procedure quite easily. Participants who complete this step successfully are given an option of using the beer can as a landmine.

In most cases, this leads to the player not succeeding and there is a fine in which the person has to do it again until the procedure is done right. The can stays at the same position on the table as the process goes round through all the people on the table. This game is very enjoyable and exciting as it gives you an opportunity to beat people at their own game by ensuring that at the end of the game they are completely messed up. Most bars will not entertain people playing the game inside their premises due to the slamming of cans. The game has gained popularity due to its ability to challenge one's ability to consume beer but also because of the dexterity of the players. The landmine drinking game can also be played using a coin instead of a quarter. In this case the player has to spin the coin and capture it under his or her beer can. He or she must then guess the outcome of the coin and if the guess is wrong the player has to take another drink and try again. A correct guess allows the passing of the coin to the next player on the table. The player who spins the coin is referred to as the spinner. In this game a player who successfully guesses the outcome of the coin can place the empty beer can at any position on the table. This is designed to make it even harder for the next players to spin and cover the coin correctly.

10,The Future Music Festival 2012 is Coming,arts-entertainment," The Future Music Festival is a multi-stage, nationwide touring music festival held in late February to early March each year in Australia. It is organized by Future Entertainment, a Melbourne-based, youth-focused entertainment company founded in 1993. From its humble beginnings as a single day, 6000 person event at Sydney’s Randwick Racecourse in 2006, the Future Music Festival has experienced a dramatic increase in popularity, often pulling in an excess of 40-50,000 people per city. However, the Future Music Festival’s popularity has also been a main source of problems for both its organisers and participants, and in the past the festival has been marred with issues like overcrowding, inadequate sound and complaints from neighbours. For instance, in 2008, local officials in Sydney threatened to reduce the size of the event there and move its finish time to 6 PM in response to complaints by residents about things like public fornication and vomiting on private property. Since then, the Future Music Festival has increased its police and security presence and urged its patrons to be mindful of their behaviour, taking a strict policy against anti-social behaviour, excessive alcohol use and the use and sale of illegal drugs. The Future Music Festival has also moved to bigger venues and increased spending on its productions; over the years, the festival has been witness to more complex and elaborate musical acts which are now often accompanied by live visual shows. Despite its past problems, the Future Music Festival continues to grow and be successful, mainly because of the unusually strong line-ups that its organisers manage to book each year. Though it started as a festival which brought artists who appealed mainly to the rave and dance music crowd, the festival has gone on to offer a more diverse line-up catering to a more general audience. This year, the Future Music Festival is set to bring such international hits as New Order, Swedish House Mafia, Fatboy Slim, Aphex Twin, Gym Class Heroes, LCD Soundsystem, Jessie J, Skrillex and the Wombats, and many more lesser-known, up-and-coming artists as well. For many of these artists, the Future Music Festival may be the only chance to see them in Australia this year. With over forty artists set to perform on several different stages, the Future Music Festival often forces tough decisions for festival-goers who wish to see as many acts as they possibly can. Tickets for the 2012 Future Music Festival are available via Ticketmaster, and ticket prices are currently around $150 for general admission tickets and $200 or more for VIP tickets. VIP tickets offer special privileges like exclusive access to several designated VIP areas, express entry into the event and separate bar and toilet facilities. Future Entertainment and Ticketmaster also offer a ""book now, pay later"" option, which allows patrons to reserve ticket with an initial deposit, with the remaining balance paid off via credit card on a fortnightly cycle. The Future Music Festival is poised to become 2012's biggest music festival in every city that it visits this year. Always seemingly dedicated to topping its previous year, 2012 is also the Future Music Festival's global debut, with a Future Music Festival in Asia set to occur in March of this year."

15,Everything Regarding The Jig,arts-entertainment," When people hear the term 'jig', they don't necessarily associate it with dancing. For those people that don't know, a 'jig' is actually a form of folk dance which is lively in nature. The name itself, 'jig', is really derived from 'giguer', which is a French term which means 'to jump', hence, the lively nature of the dance. This form of dance is usually associated with Scottish and Irish dance music, but it actually originated from England in the sixteenth century. The dance was actually performed in 2/4 times. Subsequently, it has taken different forms and adaptation in a variety of time signatures. The 'jig' is actually split into different forms, all of which would be discussed on this page. Light Jig Among all the various types of jigs, the light jig is considered to be the fastest as it is performed in 6/8 times. In this form of jig, your feet are hardly ever off the ground for a long period of time. That is so because the steps in this dance are relatively fast, at substantially more than 116 speeds at feiseanna. Each light jig step can vary with each dance school and with each teacher, but a number of standard steps or movements which you can use in almost all forms of light jigs, and that step is referred to as the rise and grind, or rising step. Everything you do to perform this step is essentially place your weight on your first foot, then raise the second foot off the floor, when you have done this, you simply perform two hops on the first foot, or for the foot that is still on the floor. As soon as you take your second hop, you then drop your second foot and provide it at the back of your first foot, or the foot that did both the hops. Once you have done this, you just need to shift your weight from your first foot to your second foot while letting the first foot remain in the air after the second hop. There is often a small delay during the hop and also the hop back. Single Jigs In the fastest form of jig, supermarket proceed to the least common one. The single jigs considered to be the least common among the jig dances because it uses a not too common time signature, that is 12/8 at times, while normally it uses 6/8. That is so because this type of jig follows a musical pattern of an eighth note following a quarter note. Slip Jig The slip jigs is recognized as a bit longer than the light jig since it uses a longer time signature compared to light jig. The time signature how the slip jig uses is in fact 9/8 time, although the dance is carried out with a music that has basically similar number of bars to a light jig. This form of jig is considered by some as 'the ballet of jigs' as the dancers often perform this dance when they're high up on their toes. Treble Jigs Treble jigs will be the only form of jigs which might be performed wherein the performer is wearing hard shoes, allowing the performer to perform certain moves and steps, such as clicks, stomps, and trebles. Beginners usually do that dance in a traditional speed, while higher performers perform the slow, non-traditional treble jig. Hop Jigs Hop jigs is most likely one of the more problematic forms of jigs to spell it out, as a lot of people often confuse it with forms of jigs, such as slip jig, or single jig. Some basically identify this kind of jig through it's once again time signature, which is 9/8 time."

1,The Essence of Spiderman,arts-entertainment," Spiderman is a character that is simple in nature and yet has a bit more going on in the background to keep him continually interesting for over 40 years. Spidey is a teenager called Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and ends up being turned into a superhero. He develops amazing abilities which allow him to crawl up walls and stand upside down on ceilings. He also develops super human strength and a spidey sense which warns him of oncoming danger. He's apparently a great inventor so he also develops devices that shoot web from his wrists. That's awfully convenient. In theory anyone could have invented them and through the use of them developed the ability to swing through New York. At its heart the Spiderman story revolves around Peter dealing with the responsibility of having these powers. Should he have fun with them or use them for good. His mantra is that 'With great power comes great responsibility'. So Spiderman is about a teenage kid trying to deal with getting through life like everyone else all the while having to live a double life and stop bad guys doing what they do. The comics and the movies in my humble opinion don't seem to capture what should be a fun adventure filled superhero. One that also has to fight his teenage urges to do what's right. What the movies have showed us is an angsty teenager who is always troubled by his own personal gain and not so much in figuring out what's right. The new movie looks like it's also going for the angsty route but it's too early to tell for sure. The comics used to be fun filled and full of action. Then they got complicated. Really complicated. In the 1990's comics had to have mind boggling stories with multiple characters otherwise they weren't doing their job properly. The infamous Clone series of Spiderman stories turned fans off in their droves. I still don't know who the real Spiderman was and neither do I care to find out. Spiderman has been relaunched in the Ultimates universe time and again but that just adds to the confusion for me. This is one character that I would be quite happy seeing rebooted all the way.  These days he shows up in Amazing Spiderman, The Scarlet Spider,  Ultimate Spiderman,  and the Avengers. There will probably be a return for future Spiderman too. How about one Spiderman comic featuring Peter Parker as Spiderman that could be bought every week to keep up with his antics? It'll never happen."
2,Alchemy Guide - How to Start the Game With Four Base Elements,arts-entertainment," Alchemy is a game specially designed for Android platform. The game is simple but requiring lots of creativity; not to mention very fun and highly addictive. In Alchemy, your objective is to combine two particular elements in order to create more combos. Some players reckon that this game is similar to PC game Doodle God. When the first generation of Alchemy was released, you could only create 154 elements at the max. However, latest installment of this game allows you to get total of 380 possible combinations of new elements. In Alchemy, you will be given four base elements (water, earth, fire, and air) to start with. Double tap the game workspace screen to create these elements. For creating more elements in the game, drag and drop one element on top of the other. However, only certain combinations can be used for getting a new one. If your combination is right, you will get a new element on your workspace. Combining the four base elements correctly will lead you to more various and fun combos. Here are some combinations you can do to create new elements from 'water', 'earth', 'fire', and 'air': Air + air = wind Air + earth = dust Air + fire = energy Air + water = steam Earth + earth = pressure Earth + fire = lava Earth + water = swamp Fire + water = alcohol From the combinations, you can create more elements by yourself. For instance, you will get 'vodka' if you combine 'alcohol' and 'water' and so forth. As the game progresses, you will notice that your workspace will be cluttered by new elements you have successfully combined. You can clear them from the workspace by dragging the icons to the trash can at the bottom of the screen. You can also remove them all at once by tapping a button in the menu. You don't need to worry as clearing these elements won't undo the progress you have made. Although erased, you can put the elements you have at least combined once instantly on the workspace screen without having to recreate them. One of the cool things about Alchemy is that the more you play the more surprise you will get. Not only can you get nature's elements such as 'planet', 'wood', 'wine', 'life', 'tree', 'bacteria', 'fish', 'sand', or 'shells', but you will also be able to create popular and commercial ones such as 'McDonald's', 'The Beatles', 'Sex in the City', 'Jedi', 'Sith', 'Lance Armstrong', 'Ghostbusters', or 'Robin Hood'."
3,"The gaming history of Super Mario, from Donkey Kong to the Super Mario Land",arts-entertainment," Mario hit the ground running in 1981 with the release of Donkey Kong. However, back then he went by the name of Jumpman and his goal in life was rescuing his girlfriend Pauline from the clutches of the barrel-hurling gorilla. He returned in 1982, changing his name to Mario in the process, but this time he was the villain of the game. Holding the imprisoned Donkey Kong in a close fitting cage, Mario is hunted down by Donkey Kong Jr., who's out to rescue his dear old dad. Luigi got his first appearance in 1983 in the arcade game, Mario Bros. Mario's Bombs Away and Mario's Cement Factory also hit the shelves on the Nintendo Game and Watch. 1984 was all about the cameo for Mario. He was the referee in Tennis on the NES as well as playing in the bonus round of Pinball, where he ran about with a big tray on his head. He also featured in Donkey Kong Hockey Game & Watch. Mario suddenly became ""super"" in 1985 with the release of Super Mario Bros. on the NES. It was a game of genius proportions, which is still as addictive today as it was when it was first released. He also appeared in Wrecking Crew for then NES, but it was Super Mario Bros. that put him on the computer games map permanently. 1986 was a re-port year for Mario with the old arcade classics Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. making their way onto the Nintendo Entertainment System. The same year also saw Vs. Super Mario Bros. hitting the arcades. In 1987 Mario got into boxing in a big way as he was taken on as the referee in Punch Out (NES), helping Kid Joe make it big in a dog eat dog world. The arcade game Mario Bros. also made the transfer to the NES in 1987, but it's definitely a year that will be remembered for Mazza's TKO count. Although '88 is the year that Mario bundled up with Duck Hunt, the biggest release was Super Mario Bros. 2 on the NES. Made because the original Japanese sequel wasn't thought to be good enough to wow the US market, Nintendo combined M to the izo with Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic, another Japanese game released around that time, which took Mario in a new Wart filled, surreal adventure. Mario went all monochrome and hand-held in 1989 with the advent of the Game Boy. His first release was Super Mario Land - which would much later be remembered in Super Mario 3D Land on the 3DS - as well as cameos in Dr. Mario (Game Boy and NES) and F1 Race on the Game Boy, in which he could be seen waving the chequered flag of victory. The first 10 year history of Super Mario was pretty epic, lending itself to the fact that Mario owned the gaming landscape of the 80s. The 90s lay ahead and what another 10 years they would prove to be."
4,How to Replace Fender Guitar Strings,arts-entertainment," Changing the strings on the Fender guitar is virtually identical as other guitars, except for two slight differences. On pretty much all Fender guitars with the ordinary vibrato tailpiece, strings are loaded and attached on the base of the body of your guitar. The classic style Fender machine heads use the slots on the string post, known as the ""slotted tuners,"" instead of the usual string post-holes. The strings ought to only be replaced one at the time to avoid disturbing the neck tension as well as to retain the balance of vibrato tailpiece springs for convenient adjusting. Put your guitar in your lap or on the padded counter, uplifting the neck by way of the petite box or anything that can help hold it up without scratching it. Position the peg winder on the sixth ""E"" string-tuning peg, then rotate clockwise until the string is undoubtedly loosened. Remove the string from post by unwrapping your windings and pulling straight up. Eliminate the string from a bridge by means of pushing the top of bridge. The end of the string's ball will come into view at the bottom of the guitar, allowing you to easily pull it out totally. In case your string windings show challenging to get through top of bridge, you can clip them off with the wire cutters. Unpack your new string, and then place in its tip into the unfilled bridge hole on bottom of the guitar. String will peak through the tip of bridge, allowing you to pull it. Pull out your string across your guitar nut, then trim it with the wire cutters more or less 6 in. past a machine head post. Put your trimmed edge into hole in the tuner post, setted up on the top of post, amid the slots, then bend it about 90-degree angle, so it is placed in the slot to the one side. In case the standard post-holes are utilized, place in your string into hole and then bend to side at roughly 90-degree angle before you wind. Place your peg winder next rotate counter-clockwise, at the same time as placing the soft tension on your string. Allow the windings to cautiously form and also seat upon one another when they move downward with the turns of machine head key. Fine-tune the string to tone, and then repeat steps 2 - 8 for the next strings. The strings do not have to be changed in the sequence, nonetheless starting on 6th string and changing in succession develops the good habit, and also enables simpler tracking of the replacement strings as you go through set. Caution Use the pitch pipe to help out the tune strings to tone. The digital tuners are not good unless your string is near to being in a tune. Take the advantage of the string replacing operations to do cleaning as well as any additional repairs on your guitar. Take your time and be certain that the windings are well-ordered and even. The sloppy string installment is the main reason for adjusting the problems."
5,"The Vital ""Role"" Hired Air Conditioning Plays on Film Sets",arts-entertainment," According to numerous celebrity gossip websites, in 2006 American actress Lindsay Lohan collapsed on the set of her movie Georgia Rule, after a gruelling 12-hour shoot in 105 degree temperatures and was hospitalised. She is not the first actor to suffer such a fate through simply being too hot at work. There have been countless similar instances over the years: on film sets, in TV studios, on music video production sets and sound stages, during the indoor and outdoor shooting of adverts, and even in the creation of animated sequences and feature-length animated films. Each of these different businesses are worth billions of pounds, and producers are always keen to keep expenses down. That is why filming often takes place around the clock – to minimise costs and maximise profit. The downside of all this is that essential equipment such as heat-producing lighting, cameras and sound gear will be almost constantly operational on set. Sometimes lighting is used not to light a specific scene, but for Health & Safety reasons; to ensure actors do not trip, fall and injure themselves on set when filming or waiting to be ""called"" to scene."" These extra lights add to the overall heat created. Also, depending on the period or style of the production being made, actors may be wearing a variety of costumes (some classical dramas can involve cast members having to wear several layers of clothing, beneath blisteringly hot lighting). Production support staff working in remote and hot locations (usually in tents) can also ‘feel the heat’, so their well-being also needs to be considered. The good news is that suitable air conditioners can be hired from an air con hire specialist to help combat the sometimes sweltering heat on film sets. Hiring air con makes perfect sense To ensure that filming can continue in the best possible conditions, it makes sense for producers to rent portable air conditioning units, to maintain comfortable surroundings for all (and also to help keep equipment cool as far as possible). A key advantage of leasing air con units for film sets from an expert, rather than buying, is that the most appropriate units can be supplied to best suit each individual film location. An established air conditioning rental specialist with experience in providing solutions to the film industry will have the equipment, personnel and expertise to ensure the most appropriate air con units are made available each time (even for the most unusual of locations). When air conditioning in hot weather is a must on set, but the production team just want it to arrive and be installed with minimum disruption, it is vital that the rental specialist is experienced in working in this particular field. Every film set will be different and have differing air con requirements. This is something a good hire team will see as a great challenge. They will pull out all the stops to ensure that the right solution is provided, in an affordable and hassle-free way. About Producers’ on-set responsibilities Although there are no specific rules and regulations in place to ensure actors work in a comfortable temperature on a film set (or other) – as these would be impossible to devise and enforce. By law, producers do have a responsibility to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that persons (and animals) working on set are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. As part of their production team, a producer should have at least one experienced crew member who is aware of possible Health & Safety issues. Time is money If film production ceases due to excessive conditions, tens if not hundreds of people will all be wasting time on set waiting for production to restart. This can have huge budgetary implications. To a producer, a good air conditioning rental specialist can, therefore, be worth their weight in gold. Throughout the filming process, in fact, any area where financial savings can be made is seen by a producer as a godsend. Hiring (rather than buying) air con is a perfect example of this. Even on sets and in locations where space is at a premium (and/or where noise needs to be kept to a minimum), an experienced specialist will be able to advise on the best portable air conditioning  solution – the most suitable units can be quickly delivered, positioned and made operational, often without a single minute’s filming being lost."
6,Important Facts About Writing Mystery/Suspense Novels,arts-entertainment," Grabbing the interest of your reader on the first page is essential. You don’t want your reader to put the book down. Using action words in the first paragraph, rather than description, helps to stir interest in the story right away. Here is an example of what I mean from my mystery novel, Anasazi Intrigue: The Adventures of John and Julia Evans: ""A thunderous crash could be heard in the distance as a home collapsed and crumbled into the rushing waters below. Several people were standing at the edge of a hilltop in Santa Clara, Utah, watching their valley being destroyed before their very eyes."" You have now captured the interest of your reader. The next thing to do is to describe the situation and bring in the main characters as they watch this disaster. What are their feelings about it? How has it affected them? The next two paragraphs explain: ""When Julia saw the home fall into the depths of the water, she gasped. She put her hand lightly against her mouth with sorrow. John instantly wrapped his arm around his wife's waist and pulled her close. ""Standing on the hill and watching the destruction below was an emotional experience for Julia as she nestled into her husband's arm. She was a reporter and was supposed to write about the tragedy, but this was personal. Her valley and her friends' homes were being ripped apart. The destruction below wrenched at Julia's heart. Her home was safe and she had lost nothing, but her heart went out to the family who had just lost their home and property."" In this example, I began developing my characters and allowed my reader to feel their sorrow as they watched their community being destroyed by the flood. Development of characters is important. It helps the reader to become part of the story, to be able to feel what the character feels. There are many ways to bring your character to life. One is an adequate description of the person and another is emotion. We need to see the character with our mind’s eye. If you choose to be more descriptive about your character’s physical attributes, there is much to consider. The build of a farmer will definitely be different from a banker’s. If your character has muscles, why does he have this build? Here is an example of John Evans: ""At the age of forty-two, John was a master knife and sword maker. Tempering steel into creative shapes and styles brought him great joy. He was unusually tall with broad shoulders and a strong jaw. His bulging biceps came from lifting and working with large pieces of steel. His mother often told him that he had inherited his dark brown eyes, olive complexion, and rugged build from her side of the family."" Were you able to imagine what kind of person John is? After describing your character, you can work on softening him, giving him brief descriptions and emotions throughout the chapter. That’s not all. Add a little suspense to chapter one, something that will keep the reader’s interest. I decided to introduce my villain in chapter one. With a description of the villain this early in the book, it creates even more interest, making the reader wonder who the mysterious man really is and what is he up to. Then, towards the end of chapter one, Julia finds a bunch of dead fish and wonders what had caused so many to die. Her curiosity is peaked. Julia must solve the mystery. And who is the mystery man, the villain of the story? Now the reader knows where this mystery is heading and can’t put down the book. Don’t forget cliffhangers. They’re very important to add a little suspense. What is a cliffhanger? The dictionary says: ""A suspenseful situation occurring at the end of a chapter, scene, or episode."" This makes the reader want to read the next chapter to find out what is going to happen next. A well-written synopsis will help to create even more interest, also. So make sure that you put enough in the synopsis to grab the attention of your reader. Here is an example below. Synopsis of Anasazi Intrigue: Stolen artifacts, a nosy newspaper reporter, and mysterious events begin to unfold in this mystery adventure novel. When a devastating flood takes out several homes in a small town, they are shocked by the news of also a possible poison spill that kills many of the fish and neighbor's pets. Julia, the town's newest reporter, begins her investigation but realizes the story is much bigger and more dangerous than she thought! Julia and her husband find themselves on the run trying to save their lives while finishing the story of a lifetime! She never realized that being a reporter could be so dangerous. With artifacts, dead fish, a devastating flood, and miscreants, John and Julia have their hands full.

11,How is Art Affected by Advances in Technology?,arts-entertainment," With the  many advances in technology, some people may worry that what we know as art, in  its true form, is suffering as a result. However, others may argue that art can  benefit from so many different mediums on which it can be produced. One example  of modern technology helping and pushing art along is what is often referred to  as art on canvas which is essentially your images from digital cameras or computers  being printed directly onto sheets of canvas to be framed traditionally or on  gallery wrap. The printing of your pictures on canvas can be done for several  purposes, which include private individuals wanting family portraits or local  scenery photographs to look like oil and canvas paintings, plus a growing  number of artists making Giclee prints of their original paintings so they can  sell them over and over again. And also by businesses wanting to advertise  something by having what is often referred to as a bus scroll or tram scroll  printed with information. These bus  scrolls are usually printed with names of tourist attractions or special  offers. Their simplicity is key to the attention that they receive. The fact  that many retro objects and images are currently in vogue would go some way to  explaining why these look similar to billboards from the middle of the  twentieth century. For those  who want to have a favourite family portrait printed on to some kind of canvas  either in the style of an oil painting or Andy Warhol pop art style, there are  dozens of shops, printers and businesses offering such a service. And for  people who feel that they have taken a wonderful scenery or view photograph and  want to have this form of art on canvas to either fool onlookers or just look  nice, they have lots of options with regards to size, canvas type and even the  design of a frame. The chosen image may not even be something as personal as a  loved one or nearby location. People also make every effort to get shots  similar to or better than those of famous landmarks seen on postcards. Buying a  postcard and having the photographer do all the work is ever-so easy, but the  pride of snapping the shot one's self is unquantifiable. Of all the famous  landmarks made into prints Australia has its natural Uluru (Ayers Rock) and  man-made Harbour Bridge and Opera House. The USA has the Grand Canyon and  Statue of Liberty, and most other nations have similar. It would be  generally accepted that when you actually create an image painting with a brush  or  pallet knife, drawing with a pencil,  or using a carving instrument is more 'real art' when compared to composing a  wonderful photograph, but photography is art, too. One could even argue that there  is skill and a keen eye needed to print images and your photos on  canvas, but it will be a long time before the art of canvas printing is  recognized by the public!"

14,Tinga Tinga Art- The Heart of African Painting,arts-entertainment," The history of Tinga Tinga art goes back to 1960s when a well renowned painter Edward S. Tinga Tinga, established an art form that became connected with his new homeland, Tanzania. Today, Tinga Tinga is the Tanzanian expression for this form of art, acknowledged mostly in Tanzania, Kenya, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Over the years, acquaintance about Tinga Tinga has extended to other parts of Africa and Europe, along with other English-speaking parts of the world. Tinga Tinga is a notion that development support workers and African tourists alike have been drawn to, but which, over time, has lost its individuality. In the past, Tinga Tinga art could be advertised on its name alone, but increasingly other works of art are being accessible as Tinga Tinga as well. From a solely technical standpoint, Tinga Tinga art can be described as painting on masonite using bicycle paint. The paintings can be as minute as ceramic tiles, while the largest paintings are no doubt hanging above thousands of family room sofas. Market restrictions have prevented artists from working in larger formats. A mainstream of the buyers have been foreigners wanting to convey the images out of the country by airplane. From that viewpoint, Tinga Tinga is an authentic form of airport art - cultural art from developing nations that has been modified to the special requirements of long-distance travelers, including size. The choice of motives in the Tinga Tinga art has often been tailored to the purchaser’s expectations of what should be included in the African painting. The heart of Tinga Tinga art is centered on coastal east African design, where the attractive vines and patterns of the Swahili culture cover defined spaces that are never permitted to remain completely unfilled. But there is a clash in Tinga Tinga art, especially when one looks at how it has been developed by the followers of the artist who gave it his name. There is a conflict or an encounter of two or three of the world's leading art expressions. It was Tingatinga's successors, who developed the decorative vein of Tinga Tinga painting, while the artist himself painted ""the big five"" and other motifs that were not at all based on the decorative art idiom. ""The big five"" was a central idea of art and handicrafts from southern and eastern Africa, signifying the usual, large animals on the continent: elephant, lion, giraffe, hippopotamus and antelope (or ox). By filling surfaces as completely as possible, the Tinga Tinga artists often use motifs as if they were a part of Swahili tradition anyway. Animal figures are drawn so that they in their entirety fit into the frame of masonite, or two animals are decoratively placed next to each other, as if they were entangled calligraphy letters from an old Nordic textile design - or, rather, a collection out of an artistically turned into, beautiful Arabic Koran verse. Many Tinga Tinga paintings exemplify both the origins of and the meeting between east and west in eastern Africa. The term Tinga Tinga has been enlarged and is now used to portray many different types of colorful paintings. The term is used to offer artistic legitimacy, even if the genesis of the artwork is something other than from Tinga Tinga and his immediate circle."
