1,POSITIVE IMPACT OF AVIATION ON MANKIND (UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES) - UAVs,social-issues," Aviation is the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry. The revolution of Aviation in the life of mankind starting from the earliest forms of aviation such as  kites flying in China, which is thought to be the earliest form of man-made flight dates back to several hundred years ago, the invention of the hydrogen balloon in the 18th Century as a result of the discovery of hydrogen gas amplified the great work done by the Montgolfier brothers who rediscovered the hot-air balloon and began manned flights. Now the invention of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has indeed brought a huge development in the society. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Introduction: What are UAVs? UAVs stand for the abbreviation  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. They are Aircrafts that do not require the presence of a Pilot on board before they can fly. Over the years the use of UAVs has been for military purpose. Early use was recorded in the war fight that occurred in July 1849 which served as a balloon carrier, also was recorded the first pilotless aircraft made during the World War 1 by the British invented by a man called Archibald Montgomery Low and was first tested in March 1917 .It was made to attack the  Zeppelins. The discovery of this kind of pilotless aircraft got many Commercial, Agricultural and Individuals in shock and thought about it that it will be of great advantage to them if they could apply them to do major tasks which will make their work less stressful and save them cost, going to pilot schools or employing pilots of manned aerial vehicles. This is why we can see them around in our society today and not just during the time of war. BODY: UAVs include both autonomous (capable of operating without human input) Drones and Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPVs). There is no exact standard when it comes to classification of UAVs but we can give them general classification based on their configuration. They are divided into Fixed-Wings to allow fast speed and long endurance, Rotary-Wing in which is characterized to having a rotor to allow vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), Flapping-Wing which is basically designed to allow perching and landing on small surfaces and Hybrids of fixed- and rotary-wing configurations which is based on the fixed-wing and rotor structures. We can also classify them according to their size. we have the very small UAVs (Micro or Nano class) which have their dimensions ranging from the size of a large insect to 30-50 cm long. The insect-like UAVs are extremely small in size and have very light weight. Small UAVs class (which are also called sometimes Mini-UAVs) apply to UAVs that have at least one dimension greater than 50 cm and no larger than 2 meters. Medium UAVs class -  These apply to UAVs that are too heavy to be carried by one person but are still smaller than a light aircraft. They usually have a wingspan of about 5-10 m and can carry payloads of 100 to 200 kg. Large UAVs class are mainly for combat operations by the military. We can also classify them based on their Range and Endurance. We have Close Range UAVs - These classes include UAVs that have a range of 50 km and endurance time of 1 to 6 hours. Short range UAVs - These classes include UAVs that have a range of 150 km or longer and endurance time of 8 to 12 hours. Mid-range Class UAVs include UAVs that have super high speed and a working radius of 650 km, they typically have a similar flight time as short-range UAVs. The endurance class include UAVs that have an endurance of 36 hours and a working radius of 300 km. This class of UAVs can operate at altitudes of 30,000 feet. Overview Every Country has its own UAVs which are made according to their choice of design. For example, we have in U.S.A, a UAVs called RQ-11B Raven, in Russia we have a drone called ТБ-29В,In Israel we a UAVs called Mosquito, in China we have cargo drone AT200. Positive impact to present day society Unmanned Aerials Vehicles (UAVs) are used nowadays in real-world applications such as military operations, disaster relief, and exploration of hazardous remote areas. We equip UAVs with designed camera for taking photographs, and for recreational purposes to capture under water and mountains. We use them for videography to film wildlife keeping man out of danger of becoming a prey to wild animals. Currently UAVs are being used for the surveillance of environmental factors related to the transmission of infectious diseases. In medical application, It can be implemented for the use of sanitization, patient identification through capturing their faces in epidemical places. They have also being used for delivering drugs, foods and life-saving supplies to patients or isolated persons in extreme conditions. Farmers use drones to spray pesticides, fertilizers and other chemicals. UAVs equipped with scientific equipment are used to observe storms and other natural disasters. In military applications, UAVs have been used widely in attack and combat, also law enforcement agencies use UAVs to fight Crime. A camera-equipped UAVs is used to map an area. Used by real estate developers to take photos and videos to advertise their building projects and also used to survey the landscape. Conclusion: UAVs  are indeed very important in the society because it saves us a lot of stress and makes our world a better place for us to live generally, but more UAVs should be created all over the world and the usage should be applied also, in the educational sector, such that schools and universities, add a subject which teaches about the need of UAVs in our present society and add sports like drone racing to their Sporting activities. Furthermore, post office can use UAVs to send mails or deliver items to their customers, to enhance fast delivery. Also, more drones should be placed on roads to control traffic and capture cars which fail to keep traffic rules, making it easier for law enforcement agencies to detect the violators."
2,Present Yourself as a ‘No Brainer’ to Hire,social-issues," A few jobs back, HR had scheduled four interviews, throughout my day, for a position I had open. The first interview went “okay.” The second candidate, however, impressed me so much I hired him on the spot. I instructed HR to cancel the remaining two interviews. The second candidate did something I rarely see—they presented themselves as a ‘no brainer’ to hire. How? Their resume was result-oriented (Not a list of opinions — “I’m a team player,” “detail-oriented,” “hard-working,” etc.). They dressed as if they were already employed with my company. (In this case, a global multi-brand tour operator.) They clearly articulated their value. They told me several STAR (Situation. Task. Action. Results.) stories I could envision and relate to. If your resume (skills and experience) impressed the employer, and after reading your LinkedIn profile to determine if you’re interview-worthy, you’ll be invited to an interview—the first most likely being via Zoom or Skype. Impressing someone on paper and via your LinkedIn profile has its challenges, especially since you’re competing against many other candidates just as qualified as you. However, where the rubber meets the road is when you’re sitting face-to-face with the hiring manager. Presenting yourself in a way your interviewer can envision you fitting with the company’s culture and the current team, as well as giving them confidence you’ll hit the ground running, will substantially increase your odds of receiving a nod of approval. Regardless of whether you’re interviewing via video, sitting in a boardroom, a coffee shop or the interviewer’s office, focus on the following: Your attire Your body language Articulating how you meet the employer’s needs and will solve the problems the position exists to solve Being mindful of your interviewer’s time. As I’ve mentioned in a previous column, being deemed “a fit” supersedes your experience and qualifications. Your image is paramount in giving the impression you’re “one of them.” Make sure your attire is in line with the company culture. Obviously, this will differ from company to company, as well as between industries. If you’re interviewing for a position in a bank or insurance company, formal attire, even in 2022, is appropriate, such as a business suit, shirt, and tie. On the opposite end of the spectrum, casual clothing, even jeans and sneakers, can be acceptable if you’re interviewing with a design studio or tech start-up. The key is to dress as if you already work for the employer. Body language. Your body language, along with your words, greatly influences the first impressions someone has about you. If you’re seated, say in the reception area, stand to greet your interviewer. Firmly shake your interviewer’s hand, or each member of your interview panel, while maintaining a broad smile and steady eye contact. Say something along the lines of, “Nice to meet you, Alice.” Remember your interviewer’s name and use it naturally throughout your interview. Maintain eye contact during the interview. This shows your interviewer(s) you’re engaged in the conversation. Speak in a clear and audible voice. Your posture can portray you as arrogant, so be conscious of the way you sit or stand. During the interview, display a natural body language with relaxed shoulders and open arms by your side. Articulate how you meet the employer’s needs. This is where you solidify, you’re a ‘no brainer’ to hire. If you’re interviewing with the person you’d be reporting to, keep this piece of human psychology in mind: A person is more likely to want to build a relationship with you if you understand their situation, problems, and goals. Start with the job description. Now that you’ve landed an interview, refer to the job description, paying close attention to job qualifications and duties. Have STAR stories ready regarding specific situations in which you used each of these skills. Try to keep your STARs short and vivid. The best STAR ever said to me: “I sold Corvettes in Las Vegas.” (Yes, I hired the person.) Be mindful of the time. Always be punctual for your scheduled interview time! Being punctual is a sign of being a professional, as well as respect for the other person. Stick within the time frame your interview was scheduled for. (usually 45 minutes to 1 hour) In 2022 employers are looking for candidates who’ll mesh with their workplace culture. Showing you belong will go a long way in making yourself a ‘no brainer’ to hire"
3,You Believing Hiring Should Be Fair is the Problem,social-issues," Unless you’re getting job offers, you probably perceive how employers hire to be unfair. Every job seeker has a list of why they’re the most deserving over all the other job seekers—they’re: qualified, skilled, educated… beautiful, charismatic, authentic… a cum laude graduate. You’d benefit greatly by changing what you tell yourself when your application to the “perfect job” doesn’t get a response or you weren’t hired after multiple interviews. Reframing your concept of “fairness” will prevent you from playing the most unproductive game there is: “I’m a victim!” Accepting the following two hiring realities is key to stacking the odds of getting hired in your favour, which is really all you can control. You’ll also be creating some semblance of hiring fairness for your psyche, which is a mental state that’ll give you a competitive advantage. First hiring reality: Employers own their hiring process. Employers design their hiring process to serve their self-interest, not the job seeker’s. This is why those with a sense of entitlement, when not hired, feel employers hiring processes to be unfair—their self-interest wasn’t served. (The person hired serves the employer’s self-interest.) On the other hand, when our self-interest is served, then we feel we’ve been treated fairly. TIP: Through every step of the hiring process, clearly communicate how you can serve the employer’s self-interests. Second hiring reality: Applying online is the equivalent of playing the lottery. (You’re hoping a stranger will hire you.) I hear this all the time: “I applied to 100 jobs online and haven’t heard back from one employer.” When you purchase a lottery ticket, you accept the fact lottery odds favour the ticket seller. The same principle applies to when you apply to an online job posting. This is why those who network land the plumb jobs. Those connected have access to the hidden job market, which has much less competition and thus better odds of landing a job. Say 350 people answer an online job posting. (In today’s job market, this is on the low side.) Only one person will be hired. To soothe themselves why they weren’t chosen, the 349 rejected candidates will lean on an ‘ism’ (e.g., ageism, racism, nepotism), or my favourite; they were “overqualified.” Okay, maybe 217 rejected candidates will lean on a false narrative; the other 132 will quickly move on. Your odds were 1 in 350! (0.28%) Was the hiring process unfair to the 349 applicants not selected? Would you bet on a horse with 1 to 350 odds? Why would you expect the outcome to be fair when you choose to play a game where the odds are stacked against you? Now suppose you view rejection (READ: not winning) as altering your path but not blocking it. With such an outlook, you’ll eventually realize you arrive at most of your endpoints by sheer luck. I believe luck (for the most part) can be created. Believing you can create “job search luck” is a huge step to achieving the frame of mind you need to succeed in your job search. Four ways (there are many more) you can create job search luck: Make networking a priority. Go out and meet with people who can help you in your job search. Have a results-oriented resume and LinkedIn profile. The majority of resumes and LinkedIn profiles are a list of opinions. For your resume and LinkedIn profile to be competitive, you need to clearly communicate how you created value for your employers, not that you just put in time. Be in constant professional development mode. Know what skills are in demand within your industry/field and learn them. Be flexible. Be open-minded to all opportunities which come on your radar, not just those that fit your wish list. You can surprise yourself by taking a less than ideal job, making the best of it, and finding you enjoy your new employment. Of course, life being what it is, you can do all the above and more and still get rejected. Move on! Don’t dwell on “Why nots.” Instead, focus on creating luck throughout your job search by stacking the odds of getting a “Yes!” in your favour. Such focus will create job search luck, and you’ll feel how employers hire to be a bit fairer."
4,As a Job Seeker There Are 3 Job Search Truisms You Need to Accept,social-issues," A job search has many moving parts; your mindset is the most critical part. Tackling challenges, such as a job search, is easier if you have the right mindset. Job search success isn’t achieved through wishful thinking — how you wish things to be. Success is achieved by adapting to, better yet embracing, realities, not beating your head against walls that won’t crumble down. The following are three “job search truisms” every job seeker needs to accept if they want to minimize their job search frustrations and mitigate the time it takes to find their next job. With a sense of entitlement being so prevalent these days, I often see bitterness amongst job seekers [“I’m not getting what I deserve.”, “I’m not getting what I want.”]. Anger hinders a job seeker, along with increasing false pride, which becomes an insurmountable obstacle. The easiest way to be disappointed, unhappy, frustrated, angry, or become depressed is to have an expectation you’re owed. You, and only you, are responsible for your job search. The upside of assuming no one owes you: You energetically help yourself. For many people, this is a massive mind shift! Approaching your job search with an “I’m helping myself” mindset gives you a considerable mental boost, which is to your advantage. As well, such a perspective will carry you through the roller coaster of emotions you’ll be dealing with throughout your job hunt. You may recall my column back in April, There’s No Universal Hiring Methodology. I brought up the fact, never mentioned by career experts, that no two hiring managers access candidates the same way. This also applies to companies — no two companies hire the same way. As a job seeker, you need to accept that employers own their hiring process, which is their prerogative. A sense of entitlement has made it common today for job seekers to complain about how employers hire. What a waste of energy! Complaining won’t change how employers decide to hire. Many candidates try to circumvent the employer’s hiring process or skip steps. By following the employer’s application instructions, as frustrating as they sometimes are, you’re setting yourself apart from your competition. Being able to follow instructions is a prerequisite for any job. Thus, employers look for this “willingness to follow instructions” in candidates. The most decisive route to job search success is to do what others are afraid to do, which is to network. Networking is creating a fabric of personal contacts that can provide support, feedback, insight, resources, and information. In 2021, and for the foreseeable future, it’ll be raining resumes. Ask yourself: Who’s more likely to be hired, a stranger the hiring manager doesn’t know, or someone they’re somewhat acquainted with, or a referral? Your answer should convince you of the power of networking. It’s common knowledge most jobs are unadvertised. Undeniably, those who build and nurture a professional network land the plumb jobs. However, many job seekers create excuses [e.g., they’re an introvert, networking feels sleazy, everyone’s too busy to listen to them] to avoid networking, even though networking has proven to be the most efficient way to finding a job. Whatever your hang-ups [READ: limiting beliefs] are about networking, get over it! As a job seeker, your primary goal is to connect with people who can assist in your job search. Nothing will get you into an organization faster than having an inside person vouching for you. Here are a few tips to get you started networking: Reconnect with old colleagues and alumni you’ve lost touch with. Leverage social media — connect with people online [LinkedIn, Facebook]. Become comfortable talking to strangers. Read: ""Coffee Lunch Coffee: A Practical Field Guide for Master Networking,"" by Alana Muller Read: 'Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time,"" by Keith Ferrazzi A job search is a huge undertaking. Having a mindset aligned with today’s job market’s realities is key to achieving job search success in the least amount of time. Mindset is everything!"
5,The Pandemic Has Given Each of Us Chance to Reset Our Lives,social-issues," I’m not a “plant person.” I have a few houseplants in my condo, but they’re working plants that inhabit my domain to purify the air. Only the most hearty and tolerant plants (e.g., aloe, snake plant, succulents) have a long-term relationship with me. My father loved plants. He had a deep understanding of their needs. Several times he tried to pass along to me what gave him enormous pleasure, but I just did not connect with it. I did learn the obvious: plants must be watered, get enough sunlight and be re-potted once they’ve grown. I also learned plants need to be pruned, which seems counter-intuitive. It doesn’t strike me as logical to cut off a plant’s branches to make it grow bigger and stronger. My father explained pruning involves cutting off certain branches so the plant can use its limited resources to make stronger branches. For example, a healthy rose bush will produce too many buds. This leads to overgrowth and creates a drain on the plant’s resources. Left unchecked, most of the flowers will survive, but not thrive. Therefore, the gardener must make the difficult decision to prune the good buds to redirect the flow of nutrients to the best buds. Just as a rose bush needs to be pruned, we too should occasionally prune our respective lives. Envision your life as a fruit tree. Each branch is an interest, activity, relationship, an accumulation for your future. Each branch requires energy to bear fruit. Some branches may be dying, diseased, broken beyond repair, or tangled with other branches. Airflow and spaciousness between branches is essential. Think about it. Habits. Relationships. Jobs. Commitments. Health. Goals. If you pruned the bad and sometimes the good for the sake of the best, what would happen? We all have a finite amount of time and energy. Considering who and where you are now, are you spending the right amount of your resources where needed? Or are you holding onto situations or relationships that are broken or frustrating? Tough questions, I know. Everyone has dead branches taking up space. When you have an overfull life or often feel overwhelmed, it’s usually a sign you have too many branches. Your energy is too diffuse to sustain everything. If you prune back non-essential things, you provide more energy to the remaining activity branches. As a result, overwhelm decreases and happiness grows. Early into the pandemic, (actually government restrictions) pruned branches from my life, as I’m sure it did from yours. At the time I didn’t realize some of the branches being pruned were unhealthy. For instance, I have this need to compare myself to others. As a result of lockdowns, social distancing, working from home, and staying within my “bubble,” there were fewer people around me to compare myself, thus envy and negative self-talk quickly dissipated. Then there’s COVID-19’s most crucial lesson; it taught me more about getting unbusy than any seminars could. Things I thought I “had to do” turned out I was just convincing myself I enjoyed. “Life pruning” can be painful, which is why we rarely or deliberately do it. For the most part we let life prune for us (e.g. death, divorce, job termination, nature destroying our home). Only when someone or something is gone do we finally realize how much it meant to us, how much energy it was taking from us or how harmful it was to our well-being. Often, when we look back after “life’s pruning” we may realize we benefited by the loss. There’s truism in the adage, “everything happens for a reason.” COVID-19 happened for a reason, if for none other than to slow us down and prune our lives. The stoic philosopher Seneca said it best: “Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s end.” Over the past two years, COVID-19 has pruned many things from our lives. Relationships, mindless consumerism, pruning of jobs, re-evaluating career choice and perhaps losing loved ones to the virus. Initially, you may only feel pruning pain. Sometimes it takes time before you perhaps see the branches cut off were unhealthy. When non-essential retailers and restaurants were ordered to close, I quickly realized how much money I was spending frivolously. There were some friends I missed, but as time passed, I realized how much easier it was without them. COVID-19 gave me the gift of “letting go.” It gave each of us a once-in-a-lifetime chance to start over. Prior to the pandemic, I was a religious Saturday morning golfer. But I feel thankful for pruning golf from my life and instead giving me time to write — which I get more enjoyment from and find to be therapeutic. As the pandemic (hopefully) winds down and we begin returning back to something resembling normality returns, you might want to ask yourself: “What do I want my ‘normal’ to look like?”"
6,Will Social Media Companies Ever Make Fighting Online Abuse a Priority?,social-issues," Is it just me who believes we’ve lost our ability to have civil discourse? Every day, we rely on social media platforms to engage with like-minded people, promote ourselves, our work, and/or business. Unfortunately, the downside of increasing your visibility, especially when you wade into an online discussion with an unpopular opinion, is you become a lightning rod for online abuse. Online abuse can be especially relentless if you are a woman, identified as a member of a race, religion, ethnicity, or part of the LGBTQ+ community. I believe social media companies can reduce, even come close to, eliminating, online abuse. The first step: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, et al. becoming more serious and urgent about addressing the toxicity they’re permitting on their respective platform. The second step: Give users more control over their privacy, identity, and account history. Here are five features social media companies could introduce to mitigate online abuse. Educate users on how to protect themselves online: I’ll admit social media companies have been improving their anti-harassment features. However, many of these features are hard to find and not user-friendly. Platforms should have a section within their help center that deals specifically with online abuse, showing how to access internal features along with links to external tools and resources. Make it easy to tighten privacy and security settings: Platforms need to make it easier for users to fine-tune their privacy and security settings and inform how these adjustments impact visibility and reach. Users should be able to save configurations of settings into personalized “safety modes,” which they can toggle between. When they alternate between safety modes, a “visibility snapshot” should show them in real-time who’ll see their content. Distinguishing between the personal and professional: Currently, social media accounts are all-encompassing of your professional life and personal life. If you want to distinguish between your professional and personal life, you must create two accounts. Why not be able to make one social media account that toggles between your personal and professional identities as well as migrate or share audiences between them? Managing account histories: It’s common for people to switch jobs and careers and their views over time. Being able to pull up a user’s social media history, which can date back more than a decade, is a goldmine for abuse. Platforms should make it easy for users to easily search old posts and make them private, archive, or delete. Credit cards and/or phone number authentication: All social media platforms allow the creation of anonymous accounts. Ironically, much of the toxicity permeating social media stems from people hiding cowardly behind anonymous accounts. Anonymity enables toxic behavior by facilitating and backhandedly encouraging “uncivil discourse.” Eliminating the ability to create an anonymous account would literally end online abuse. Anonymity allows people to act out their anger, frustrations, and their need to make others feel bad, so they feel good. (I’m unhappy, so I want everyone else to be unhappy). Being anonymous allows someone to say things they wouldn’t even think of, or have the courage to, speak publicly, let alone face- to-face. All credit cards and telephone numbers are associated with a billing address. Social media platforms could prevent anonymous accounts by asking new joiners to input their credit card information, to be verified but not charged, or a telephone number to which a link, or code, can be sent to authenticate. (Email authentication is useless since email addresses can be created without identity verification.) Undeniable fact: When people know they can easily be traced they’re unlikely to exhibit uncivil behaviour. Yeah, I know—for many, handing over more data to social media giants isn’t appetizing, even if it eliminates the toxic behavior hurting our collective psyche. Having to go through a credit card or telephone authentication will be pause for many to ask themselves why the feel they must be on social media. Such reflection is not a bad exercise. Online attacks have a negative impact on mental and physical health, stops free expression, and silences voices already underrepresented in the creative and media sectors and in public discourse. Respective platform user guidelines (aka. Community Standards) are open to interpretation and therefore not enforced equitably. Content moderators (human eyes) and AI crawling (searching for offensive words and content) aren’t cutting it. Social media companies can’t deny they could be doing a much better job creating a safer online environment. Unfortunately, a safer online environment will only evolve when social media companies begin taking online abuse seriously."
7,Happiness Catch-22: Wanting More Makes Us Unhappy,social-issues," From 2001 to 2004, I worked/lived in India. I saw firsthand heartbreaking poverty. My takeaway from my experience in India is that North Americans have no real problems, just 1st world problems. Our financial stress, feeling unsuccessful, constantly seeking fulfillment is caused by marketing propaganda's influences and overabundance. It's no secret that marketers and advertisers keep us wanting more and more. This manufactured insatiable appetite to consume has eroded our ability to have any gratitude for all we have compared to most of the world. Canadians' lack of gratitude for living a 1st world lifestyle is truly appalling! In 2018 almost half the world lived on less than $5.50 a day. According to the World Bank, 3.4 billion people struggle to meet basic needs. Western society, especially North America, measures happiness and success by comparing oneself with others. For the most part, how we feel about our income, car, and house are moulded by our family, friends, colleagues, neighbours' income, car, and house. It's a national pastime to worry about relative status, which is why much of our consumerism revolves around trying to ""look rich."" Marketing propaganda has made us believe we're entitled to a certain lifestyle. If you're not living the lifestyle you're supposedly entitled to, we're a failure. Not long ago, when I'd see somebody wearing a $5,000 watch, for example, I'd look at my $200 watch and think, ""Maybe I'm doing something wrong."" Buying a Breitling® watch, an Audi S6 Sedan or a Lardini single-breasted blazer may make you feel happier. Like with my aforementioned watch example, it has a keeping-up-with-the-Joneses status effect. However, the happiness doesn't last long, since eventually ""the Jones"" will either buy what you bought, or something regarded as ""better."" This makes us want to buy more stuff to one-up ""the Jones."" Let's be honest; we all want to be ""the Jones."" When the latest iPhone comes out, the lineup at Apple stores are people who have a functioning iPhone in their pocket, wanting to be ""the Jones."" (FYI, we're on iPhone13, the first iPhone came out on June 29, 2007.) Moreover, we tend to compare ourselves to those who appear wealthier than us, an illusion easy to create, given the ease with which credit can be acquired today, coupled with social media. Thorstein Veblen, the 20th-century economist who coined ""conspicuous consumption"" and ""invidious comparisons,"" highlighted how people use luxury goods to display their social status, which in 2022 social media amplifies. As early as 1899, Veblen observed that people lived on treadmills of wealth accumulation, incessantly competing with others but not increasing their own well-being. Sounds familiar? Wanting, and therefore constantly seeking, recognition (READ: validation) is the biggest driver of human behaviour, which explains social media's addictive quality. (Social Media = ""Look at me!"") You giving a $2,000 cheque to your favourite charity receives no social applause. However, post a selfie of yourself wearing a $1,500 COBB leather jacket on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter—you'll receive likes, comments, and ego-stroking. You'll temporarily be happy, but once the euphoria wears off, you'll want to buy more recognition. When it comes to ever-changing fashion, marketing propaganda tells you that your clothes will give you the recognition you crave more than your character or actions. Unfortunately, our society has gotten to the point where we feel recognition, respect, and love are more likely to come from owning a 65-inch flat-screen TV or driving a Tesla Model S than from doing good deeds or just being a good person. As social animals, status is naturally important to us. We're anxious to stand out from the crowd—to tower over our peers, gain their respect, and ""hopefully"" their love, which we believe will make us happy and fulfilled. For hundreds of years, we've inherently known that consumption doesn't lead to happiness. Every religion and philosophical tradition evangelizes this concept. Karl Marx's most important insight was his theory of alienation, which he defined as the sense of estrangement from the self that comes from being part of a materialistic society, in which we are cogs in a vast market-based machine. You don't need to be religious (or a Marxist) to see how absurd some of the claims our hyper-consumerist society makes. We're promised happiness with the next pay raise, the next new gadget—even the next sip of soda. In his book The Happiness Fantasy, Carl Cederström, a Swedish business professor, argues that companies and advertisers have promised satisfaction. Instead, they have led people into a joyless production and consumption rat race. As a result, though the material comforts of life have undeniably increased for Canadians, these ""things"" don't give our life meaning. We give our life meaning when we: •    give more than we take •    help someone in distress •    share •    empathize •    develop meaningful relationships we can count on •    are a good son, daughter, or friend •    serve others You could easily interpret this article as a lamentation against modern life and capitalism. For the record, I'm a very public proponent of democratic capitalism with a modern welfare state. My attempt here is to appeal to everyone to remember that material prosperity has both benefits and costs. The costs come when we allow our hunger for the trappings of prosperity to blind us from the timeless sources of true human happiness: faith, family, friendship, and work in which we earn our respective definition of success and serving others. These have always been, and will always be, the things that deliver the happiness I see so many trying to obtain through their consumerism."
8,The Perils of Trying to Impress on Social Media,social-issues," Many jobs ago, before social media had yet to become the disrupter it is today, I had dinner with an advertising executive at a downtown Toronto steak house. Between the porterhouse steaks, a bottle of Château Canon-la-Gaffelière Merlot, and chocolate moose, my host said to me something I’ve never forgotten, “Nick, image is everything!” Social media has many addictive qualities. The primary one: Social media is an excellent vehicle for trying to impress people through imagery projection. Admittedly impressing someone is often the key to being accepted, getting a date, being welcomed into a group, landing a job, or being respected. We gravitate to those who impress us, which is why we try to impress people — in the hope they’ll gravitate to us. To impress people, we often change ourselves to make others like us or carefully select what we share to not go against the image we’re trying to portray. Here’s how social media stickiness works. You get up in the morning, and like a Pavlovian dog, reach for your smartphone and start scrolling through your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, et al. feed. Not long ago, I was guilty of this morning ritual. Your feeds will be populated with posts by people you’ve chosen to be connected to — posts and images of how happy and successful everyone is. Since you never have real-life interaction with your “social media friends,” these people are the equivalent of cartoon cut outs of happiness. You only see vacations, weddings, promotions, fancy dinners, etc., without knowing the person’s background story. In the back of your mind, you know most of the postings you see are performative, with an agenda of trying to impress, yet these postings trigger self-comparison. Living in a first-world country, you have more than most of the world’s population. Odds are you have a roof over your head, food in the fridge, your health is good, you’re employed, have family and friends. However, your social media feed makes you unhappy. Compared to your digital friend’s (strangers) posts, you’re not doing as many fun activities, vacationing in foreign countries, eating in fine dining establishments, shopping, or being professionally successful; thus, you want more. Wanting more is the cause of most of your problems and angst. The constant attempt to make yourself happy motivates you to do things you can document with the intent (your agenda) of impressing others. The ‘like’ button is the biggest Svengali-like mind wrecker invented since the television. The ‘like’ button feeds our need for recognition. It gives strangers the ability to vote on our life as if they’re Roman emperors pointing their respective thumb up or down. Like Pavlov conditioned his dogs, the ‘like’ button is conditioning us to create posts that’ll garner likes — and ‘likes’ requires impressing people. There’s this expression, “Do it for the Gram!” The phrase is a colloquial phrase that Instagram users say to encourage someone to take a picture of them doing something unique and posting it on Instagram. (e.g., giving a homeless person some change, you walking on the edge of a building’s roof) This “peer pressure encouragement,” whether direct or encouraged by our ego, which the ‘like’ button does a first-rate job of scratching, exists on all platforms. “Do it for the Gram!” isn’t a profound, meaningful act of seizing the moment of capturing the perfect picture; it’s the modern-day version of keeping up with the Joneses. There’s a reason why your friends and family have stuck around: you already impress them! If your friends are really your friends, the social media presence you maintain won’t impact their opinions of you. Your family and friends accept you for who you are, not the amount of ’likes’ you receive or your Facebook-worthy achievements. They’re still going to love you whether you get two ’likes’ or two thousand. These are the people worth caring about, not the practically invisible strangers represented by a small heart symbol. I don’t tend to take much of my life guidance from Hollywood; however, there’s a line in the 1985 film “The Breakfast Club” that’s stuck with me: “You ought to spend a little more time trying to make something of yourself and a little less time trying to impress people.” (Richard Vernon to John Bender) Though said in anger, Vernon gives Bender sage life advice. Imagine what you can achieve by focusing the energy you’re using attempting to impress others via social media to impress the only person worth impressing, yourself."
9,Is the multiverse real?,social-issues," Many people question the reality we live in. There would be no question you’ve probably asked yourself if there are other universes out there. If you haven’t found a real answer, that’s because there really isn’t one. We know space is large, far larger than our brains can really comprehend. In fact, space is so big that we have to start measuring it in time. Considering space is always expanding, space can’t ever officially be defined in measurement. It is, however, speculated to be around 92 billion light years large. With this all being said, we have to come up with theories. Based on science, let’s look at what we already know. Have you ever experienced deja vu? Deja vu is where people feel as if something has already happened in the exact same way. 2 out of 3 people have claimed to experience this, some more than once, too. What about having a dream involving someone you have never seen before? Chances are… you have. Well, we know our brains cannot create faces. Have you ever ran, read, told time, saw yourself in a mirror, sang, or even played an instrument in a dream? According to psychology, these are actually scientifically proven to be impossible. Maybe you have felt like you’ve done these before, lots of people claim to even though it is factually not possible. What about having a dream and it coming to a reality after seeing it? How can that be? These are all questions that can be answered in a theory involving the multiverse. Let’s get even more scientific. We know that thoughts are energies that can travel. Making scenarios in your head about anything is something everyone does. What if these scenarios are actually events from other universes coming to our reality? Technically, all thoughts exist. Manifestation, shifting, laws of attraction, and many other energetic tricks involve the multiverse. How is it possible to think of something for it to come to a reality? How can one speak things into reality? Again, the answer is the multiverse. We also know everything is an energy. Although we are in the physical world, we are still energy. Everyone has their own aura or energy. Since thoughts are also energies, can we travel through the multiverse? So many questions that can only be theorized. Many scientists believe we have an infinite amount of universes, some say an oddly specific number, some don’t even think we have one! Depending on your own experiences, opinions, and other factors, all answers vary. Personally, I believe we have an infinite amount. Not only due to theories mentioned above, but also because of conscious thinking. For example, we make decisions daily. We can “what if” forever. What if you had an option to eat pizza or eat chicken, and you chose the chicken. Let’s say that chicken got you extremely sick, you ended in the hospital and were in critical condition from food poisoning. Because you chose to eat the chicken, you had to miss multiple days of work. Because you missed multiple days of work, you lost out on lots of money. And because you lost out on all that money, you couldn’t afford to pay for rent. And because you couldn’t pay for rent, you lost your apartment. And because you lost your apartment, you became homeless. Although that is a stretch and silly circumstance, it represents our conscious decision making. In that example, because you made the choice to eat some chicken instead of pizza, you became homeless. What if you chose to eat the pizza? Well, that proves how every little decision making can lead to large outcomes. Maybe there’s a universe out there where you chose the chicken. In conclusion: deja vu, decision making, energetic tricks, dreams, and much more lead me to believe the multiverse is in fact real. If we can’t see it, who knows."
10,What are the responsibilities of a pastor?,social-issues," PART 7 THE CHURCH OF GOD OR CHURCH OF MAN 6 WHAT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A PASTOR? So, when looking for a pastor, is there anything else that we should know about them? Yes, there’s one more thing. And that’s what their duties are. Do they line up with Scripture? Let’s find out what they are. We’ll begin in the book of Ephesians. Suggested Reading: Ephesians 4:11-16 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; Before we begin, I’d like you to take a look at the words pastors and teachers. Some believe that these indicate two separate offices, one of a pastor and the other being that of a teacher. However, these actually refer to one leadership position of pastor-teacher. Why is this the case? Well, this has to do with how certain parts of the text relate to each other. According to Koine Greek, there’s a rule called Granville Sharps. What this tells us is that if two nouns are in the same case, i.e., either nominative (subject), genitive (of possession), dative (indirect object), or accusative (direct object), whereby in this instance, they’re both in the accusative and are connected by a particle (conjunction) along with the initial noun being preceded by a definite article (the) while the second noun doesn’t have one, then they’re considered synonymous, i.e., are the same. In this verse, the word pastor is preceded by the word some, which in Greek is a definite article (the – tous). And the word teachers are preceded by the particle and with no definite article. Therefore, both nouns pertain to the same office. I know that this was a lot of minutiae, but sometimes that’s the way it has to be.  With that said, let’s study to find out what some of the functions of a pastor-teacher are? And by the way, if different sections of Scripture talk about the same characteristics, then I’ll only include one of the passages in the study. Please begin by turning your Bible to the book of Acts. Acts 13:1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. What we know about this church is that the disciples of Jesus were first called Christians at this location called Antioch in Acts 11:26. Mentioned here are the various leadership titles held by certain of the assembly. Some of them were called prophets, and others were called teachers. The word teachers (didaskaloi) refer to believers who, with the special assistance of the Holy Spirit, had the responsibility of introducing the Christian converts to the beliefs and duties of the Christian faith.45 And by the way, this is the same Greek word for teachers that was found in Ephesians 4:11, except that these nouns are in different cases. What we’ll take a look at next is what the pastor should be especially mindful of both for themselves and the congregation. We’ll also be introduced to something else that might be brought in from those both outside and inside the church that will try to bring about disunity and division along with the spiritual medicine that should be digested by the faithful saints in order to protect themselves from this poison. Please stay in the same book but go to chapter 20.  Suggested Reading: Acts 20:3-21:4 17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. The Apostle Paul was conversing with the elders from the church at Ephesus in a place called Miletus. He reminded them that the Holy Spirit had made them overseers (one who examines, looks after, or inspects not only their own but also another’s spiritual state). And as such, they were described as those who feed the church of God. The word feed means to tend or lead others to some condition. It can also mean protecting, guiding, and guarding it46 (the church). 29-30 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them And then he conveys to them that after he departs from their company, there will arise grievous wolves (false teachers who feed themselves) that will come in from the outside, not sparing (whose intent was to kill and destroy) the flock along with those from within their own selves (from within the church), men (under the influence of ambition, or from the love of power or popularity47) speaking perverse things (doctrines of immorality and asceticism - that a person can attain a high spiritual and moral state by practicing self-denial48; doctrines that interrupt internal prosperity; doctrines teaching for truth what is erroneous in itself, and perversive of the genuine doctrine of Christ crucified49) in order to cause disciples to follow after them and join their heresy. 31-32 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. He further instructed them to watch (be alert) and keep these instructions constantly in their mind as a model that they should do well to imitate, in that over a period of three years, he warned them (to put sense before the mind) night and day (continuously). And that it would be through preaching and the ministry of the Holy Spirit that they would be built up (applied to a house which is raised and completed by slow degrees, and by toil; to establish in doctrine and in hope). The Word of God which was delivered would be able to confirm and establish them amidst the dangers to which they would be exposed in order to make them heirs [or joint] partakers with the saints of the blessings in reserve for the children of God.50 What we’ll find out next is another responsibility of a pastor. This one has to do with what they should proclaim to those who don’t know the Lord. We’ll find out what this is all about in the book of Romans. Suggesting Reading: Romans 10:13-14 14bc …and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? These verses claim that in order for an unbeliever to be saved (redemption or deliverance from sin and misery, and the enjoyment of peace and happiness), initially, there must be someone who announces [to them] the gospel message.51 This person can be any believer. However, when the local assembly gathers together, this proclamation is usually made by one of the church leaders. Acts 17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: The Scriptures indicate that in the proclamation of the gospel message, a pronouncement should be made to the hearers that are unsaved to acknowledge themselves as being a sinner and expressing a desire to turn from their sinful ways. This is referred to as repentance. In this regard, a pastor might declare before the assembly the following words. If anyone would like to begin anew and have a relationship with the one true God, then repeat these words. I acknowledge that I’ve sinned in many areas such as slandering others; having sexual relations outside of marriage; being jealous; having participated in alcohol or drug abuse; having sex with others of the same gender; having committed adultery; having taken money from others in a deceitful manner; having committed rape; having engaged in pedophilia; etc. I don’t want to continue in these mental, verbal, and overt sins. I need a new nature. Romans 10:14a How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?... The second condition is to believe in Jesus Christ as to who He is and what He has accomplished. This has nothing to do with what you can do for God, but this is simply believing in His Son. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. This belief is expressed by calling upon the name of the Lord in prayer. The words of the prayer which follows can either be spoken silently or out loud. I believe in you Jesus Christ, as one of the members of the Trinity, being deity (having a divine nature), who as God pre-existed time; came to the earth and took on the form of a man, being born of a virgin (no sin nature); lived a sinless life; listened to and obeyed the directives of his Father; went to the cross and paid for the penalty of and forgave the sins of the whole world; rose from the dead after three days, never to die again, walked the earth in His resurrection body for forty days witnessing to over five hundred people, and ascended into heaven to be seated at the right hand of God the Father. 1 Corinthians 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 2 Corinthians 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. The result of this prayer is that this person will receive another member of the Trinity, known as the Holy Spirit, who will come into their physical body to indwell, thus imparting to them a new nature along with many other spiritual benefits. If the gospel isn’t preached, then there will be no receiving of divine life, no personal relationship with God, no experience of divine power, no understanding of spiritual truth, and no guidance and leading from the Holy Spirit. What else we can find out about a pastor’s performance is found in the book of 1 Corinthians. We looked at this earlier in this study as one of the qualifications of someone seeking the office of a pastor, but on this occasion, we’ll take a more in-depth look at it. Suggested Reading: 1 Corinthians 12:1-13:1 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 28-29 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? The Apostle Paul was giving instructions to the believers at the church in Corinth concerning the non-leadership spiritual gifts of knowledge, wisdom, etc., at least one of which was given to each believer. He goes on to mention a different kind of gift known as leadership office gifts, one of which in particular is teachers. And by the way, not every believer is called to an appointment to church authority. What the word teachers conveys to us is that some of their engagements are that they’ll emphasize [the] accuracy of words and a love to study. They’ll delight in research to validate truth.52 And they’ll give instruction in the Christian faith of truths already revealed and written down. What we’ll learn next about the duties of pastors is what it means for them to be over the assembly and admonish it. These truths are found in the book of 1 Thessalonians.  1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 12a And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you,… Paul was instructing the believers at Thessalonica to know (respect and obey; not to be ignorant of their needs or to be indifferent to53) those, who are in the leadership positions of the church that labour (wearisome toil) among them unless it’s obvious that they were out of God’s will. These were believers who worked hard to provide pastoral care for the flock, probably in their spare time [since,] in the early church, local church leaders often carried full-time jobs outside the church.54 Even though the words elders or pastors aren’t used in these verses, it’s believed that this was the title being referred to here. 12b …and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; These leaders were also mentioned as being over (presiding over) them under the direction of the Lord, and admonishing (put the assembly in mind of the truth; to warn them of danger; to exhort them to perform their duty; to admonish if they go astray55) them. 13 And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. Likewise, the assembly of believers are implored to esteem (honor) them very highly in love for their work’s sake so long as they gave God the glory. A pastor’s obligations aren’t easy. Putting the assembly in mind of the truth can offend many, especially when conviction comes because some don’t want to hear about sin and restoration. For certain pastors, the easy way to get around this is to ignore any teaching on it, which allows the members to live the same way as they did before they were saved. While they claim to be born again, and they very well could be, there’s no evidence of the new life they profess to have received. In the next verse, from the book of 1 Timothy, we’ll find out what the pastor should give attendance to.  1 Timothy 4:13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Timothy was instructed by the Apostle Paul to give attendance (to keep putting his mind on; to devote himself): To reading - the public reading of Scripture. To exhortation - the explanation of the [Scripture] passages that are read, making their meaning and relevance clear to the gathered congregation.56 To doctrine - the act of teaching a systematized body of teaching. What else pastors should be known for is that they should rule well and labour. We can find out what these words are all about by staying in the same book and proceeding to the next chapter. 1 Timothy 5:17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. In some churches, there were many pastors. However, it’s possible that not every one of them could devote themselves to the local assembly, as some of the others, because of the obligations of work and family. Those who were able to rule well (manage the spiritual interests of the church) should be counted worthy (deserving) of double honor (deserving of recognition), especially those who labour (with wearisome effort) in the word (of proclaiming the message) and doctrine (directed at believers, making clear to them what Christians should believe and the implications of their faith for their lives57; [categorical (topical) instruction and explanatory (verse by verse) teaching58]). By the way, I’ve heard some suggest that the words double honor mean getting paid double the money, or as we could say, getting paid adequately on the basis of their ministries.59 If this were a possible rendering, I’d agree with the latter idea that those in leadership should receive the appropriate financial compensation based on their involvement. What we’ll take a look at next is an area of the ministry that pastors need to be on active alert about.  1 Timothy 1:18-19 18 This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; At this time, in the Ephesian church, the Apostle Paul was aware that false teachers had crept in that were teaching doctrines contrary to the gospel itself.60 Having brought Timothy there to address this issue, he reminded him of the prophecies that were unveiled concerning him beforehand, which proclaimed that his ministry was approved by God. And, in this regard, there were two things that he needed to hold onto in order to persevere in this endeavor. 19a Holding faith, and a good conscience;… The first one was holding faith (sound doctrine). This is another way of saying that as to the truth, he was to live according to its dictates, that a good conscience may be ever preserved.61 Likewise, if a pastor applies pertinent truth to his life in all circumstances, then the second thing, a good conscience (honestly following what is right), would be developed. 19b …which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: However, if decisions are made by any spiritual leader or believer that accepts false teachings which promote the leadings of passions and indulging in carnal propensities, then the faith they had chosen to rely on initially would be destroyed. If this were the case, then the following statement holds true. Bad doctrine usually starts with bad conduct, and usually with secret sin.62 Another aspect of the ministry of a pastor is they should know how to deal with believers that have aligned themselves with false teachers or false teachings. Please go to the book of 2 Timothy.  2 Timothy 2:24-26 24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, Timothy was instructed by Paul not to strive (not to be harsh or cruel) but be gentle (in demeanor), apt (ready and skilled) to teach, and patient (to endure any difficulty without complaining). 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And if there were those that oppose themselves (who’ve placed themselves in opposition to the servant of the Lord and true doctrine by aligning themselves with false teachers) that he, Timothy, In meekness (humility) should instruct them (by reproof (rebuke) and admonition (a warning or mild criticism to correct some fault63)64 with the hope that God would give them such a view of the error which they have embraced, and such regret for having embraced it,65 that they would repent to the acknowledging (embracing) of the precise and correct knowledge of the truth. 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. So that they may recover themselves (come to a right mind; to no longer think wrong thoughts) out of the snare (of false teachings; of the allurements to sin) of the devil, who has held them captive (bound to do his will). The next charge of a pastor that we’ll take a look at is described in words that, for many of us, when we hear them, it might cause us to have a different connotation (secondary meaning). A book of the Bible that, for some reason, I haven’t done much research from, i.e., the book of Titus, is where we’ll proceed next.  Titus 2:7-8 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. The Apostle Paul instructed Titus to show a pattern of good works in his life. When I read this, the first thing that came to mind was that a pastor should be someone that does good things for people. Buy food for a family in need. Council them, when needed. Help pay a bill that they’re delinquent on. But to my surprise, these words mean something entirely different. The words good works in this context have to do with the many facets of doctrine (one’s manner of teaching) that should be comprised of godly integrity. The first feature in one’s manner of teachings is uncorruptness. This means that the elements of his teaching should include honesty, sincerity, and purity of motivation.66 Something else is that it [shouldn’t] corrupt or vitiate (to impair the quality of67) the morals of others. Everything in his teaching was to be such as to make men purer and better.68 The next component is gravity. This has to do with having an acquaintance with the subject (biblical topic) at hand. It also implies that in the manner [in] which a message is delivered insures respect, in character, opinions, [and] deportment69 (conduct). The next ingredient is sincerity. This has to do with the reality that his life is a representation of his doctrine in morals.70 It also means that a pastor is someone whose character [isn’t], and cannot be, corrupted.71 The final detail is sound speech that cannot be condemned. This teaching is one that’s accurate and spiritually helpful. It’s also such that nothing said is [rash] or reprehensible, or that can give [offense] or cause the ministry to be blamed.72 I don’t know about you, but that was extremely informative. The next few verses will be taken from the book of 1 Peter and they’ll inform us as to what a pastor’s duties and attitude should be concerning certain aspects of the ministry.  1 Peter 5:1-3 1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; The Apostle Peter was addressing the many pastors who were overseeing various churches scattered throughout different countries. The first thing he asked them to be engaged in was to feed the flock. The word feed means to implement all duties and responsibilities a shepherd has for his flock.73 He goes on to say that their oversight (a spiritual and physical guardianship74 (care); to see their needs and provide what they require) shouldn’t be by constraint (the idea of doing something by force, necessity, or compulsion)75 but rather willingly (gladly; as a work which you love). And then, he mentions another characteristic that shouldn’t be prevalent in a pastor, which is a hot topic today. He shouldn’t discharge his ministry for filthy lucre (in accepting a job purely for monetary considerations;76 for disgraceful gain, becoming such if [it’s] made the motive of the minister’s service) but of a ready mind (from the promptings of love).77 3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And finally, a pastor should neither be as being lords over God’s heritage (those who are put in their care). The word lords mean someone who exercises an unreasonable use of power with bad intention. They are those, who like little kings or dictators, constantly shout orders over the body of believers. But rather, they should be ensamples to the flock. The word ensamples means that they’re those who imitate the character of Christ in their lives. Their authority is expressed from the influence of reason, persuasion, and example.78 They lead others by their examples of mature Christian character.79 There are a few other things to know about a pastor that they should exemplify in their duties and character, as the Apostle Paul reminded Timothy. Please turn in your Bible to the book of 1 Timothy. 1 Timothy 4:12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Paul encouraged Timothy to keep on becoming an example (model) to the assembly of believers, which hopefully would be imitated or followed by them in these various aspects of his life. In word - teach nothing but the truth of [God] because nothing but that will save souls.80 This also includes speech that’s honest and loving. In conversation – in his walk, behavior, or manner of life (actions) that were to be controlled by the Word of God. In charity - the motivation of his life should emanate from God’s love. It’s a love [that] impels the one loving to sacrifice himself for the benefit of the person loved.81 In spirit - inner enthusiasm and excitement in whatever is done. In faith - in all [trials,] show to believers by your [example] how they ought to maintain unshaken confidence in God.82 Along with this, be faithful to thy trust, to thy flock, to thy domestics, to the public, to thy God. … [Honestly] keeping, preserving, and delivering up when required, [whatever] is [entrusted] to [your] care; as also in improving whatever is delivered in trust for that purpose.83 In purity - an upright and morally blameless life, and specifically as referring to being free from any immoral acts, especially acts related to sex.84 Well, we’ve covered quite a few sections of Scripture that have helped us get a clearer view as to the responsibilities as a pastor. I have one final group of verses for us to look at. I think that these spells out what should be considered the most important outcomes for any church. Please turn to the book of Ephesians. Ephesians 4:11-13 11-12 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Ultimately, what godly leadership should strive for are seven things. Are you ready to find out what these are all about? The first is the perfecting of the saints. The word perfecting means equipping someone or something so that it might serve the purpose or do the work for which it was brought into being.85 The word equipping means to furnish or provide with whatever is needed for use.86 So, what do we need to be provided with? We need to be provided with instruction that will be useful in correcting all [that’s] deficient87 in our lives. The second thing is the work of the ministry. This is another way of saying for the work of Christian service. In what manner? Those in leadership should train the believers, given in their care, in the art of winning souls and of teaching and preaching the Word.88 Thirdly, for the edifying of the body of Christ. The church is edified through the instruction of divine things for the purpose of promoting their spiritual lives. 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: Fourth, until all are brought into the unity of the faith. This is a state in which faith in the Son of God shall characterize all.89 Fifth, until all are brought into the knowledge of the Son of God. This refers to the church not only having the correct and precise knowledge of Christ but also experiencing His power. Sixth, so that every believer becomes a perfect man, i.e., a spiritually mature man. Seventh, until all are brought into the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, i.e., where everyone becomes fully mature with the sum of the qualities which make Christ what He is.90 Wow! What a way to end this chapter. That was enlightening and comprehensive. As I’m sure, you’re aware that we’ve been presented with a lot of information about the leadership office of a pastor when choosing the right church to attend and remain in both in this chapter and the preceding ones. I’ll admit, what we’ve gathered can be overwhelming. So, what should we do with all this data so that it can be used in a somewhat simplistic manner? You might be thinking, how do I begin sorting out all that has been presented in this study? This is where I come in. Leave that to me. What I’ll try and do is compile a checklist that contains verifiable godly indicators for ordination and verifiable ungodly indicators that would disqualify someone for ordination. This same concept can be applied when your deciding whether to remain in the church you are attending or might attend. But, before I present what I’ll call a checklist or the Bible rating for choosing a pastor to co-labor with, we have one more study to undertake. And this has to do with this question. What are the indicators that would disqualify someone for an appointment to the church hierarchy? While we’ve already accumulated quite a bit of information that would support such, subsequently, this will help us in determining what is contrary or unacceptable for acceptance. Sometimes what is contradictory isn’t always easy to disseminate. So, in the next chapter, we’ll take a look at what constitutes ungodly teachings and character.

11,Climate Change and Its Effect on Health in India,social-issues," CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECT ON HEALTH IN INDIA As of now, the impression of climate change can be found in every corner of the planet. Erratic weather conditions, rising ocean levels, and melting ice sheets because of climate change are reshaping societies across the globe. In India, climate change is now influencing human health, wildlife, food production, clean water access, and the economy. However, on account of India, these weaknesses accompany a remarkable potential for change. The effects of climate on human health won't be equitably conveyed all over the planet. Proof shows that environmental change presents developing dangers to public health security. It is finding a progressively primary position on the international agenda. Climate change occurs over longer time scales. As of not long ago, changes in the global climate have happened naturally, across centuries or millennia, due to continental drift, different galactic cycles, variations in solar energy output, and volcanic activities. Over the last decades, it has become progressively evident that human activities change atmospheric composition, causing global climate change. Humankind's activities alter the world's climate by expanding the atmospheric concentration of energy-trapping gases like ozone-depleting substances, subsequently intensifying the natural ""greenhouse effect"" that makes the Earth habitable. These GHGs include chiefly carbon dioxide, generally from fossil fuel combustion and forest burning, and other heat-trapping gases like methane (irrigated agriculture, animal husbandry, and oil extraction), nitrous oxide, and different human-made halocarbons. Our health might appear to relate generally to a reasonable way of behaving, heredity, occupation, local environment, and medical care access, but sustained population health requires the life-supporting services of the biosphere. Populations of all animal species rely upon food and water provisions, independence, freedom from excess infectious disease, and the physical safety and comfort conferred by climatic stability. The world's climate system is essential to this life support. A changing climate will probably affect all these conditions and hence have a powerful impact on human health and well-being. Climate change can directly influence human health, e.g., thermal stress, death/injury in overflows and hurricanes, and indirectly via shifts in disease vectors, e.g., mosquitoes, water-borne pathogens, air quality, and water and food availability and quality. Therefore, global climate change is a new challenge to the ongoing efforts to protect human health. India ought to be concerned because climate change is a component of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. India is an enormous emerging nation, with the Great Himalayas, the world's third-biggest ice mass in the north, and a thickly populated shoreline in the south. Almost 700 million of her one billion population living in rural areas directly rely upon climate-sensitive sectors like farming, forests, and fisheries and typical assets like water, biodiversity, mangroves, coastal zones, and grasslands for their means and livelihoods. Further, the adjustable limit of dryland farmers, forest dwellers, fisher people, and nomadic shepherds is meager. Climate change is probably going to affect all-natural ecosystems as well as socio-economic systems. Climate change, as of now, already contributes to the global burden of disease, and this contribution is supposed to grow in the future. Around 600,000 deaths occurred overall because of climate-related catastrophic events during the 1990s, some 95% of which occurred in developing countries. The impacts of climate on human health will not be equally distributed worldwide. Developing country populations, especially in small island states, arid and high mountain zones, and thickly populated coastal regions, are viewed as particularly vulnerable. The effect to which human health is impacted relies upon the population's exposure to climate change and its natural outcomes, the sensitivity of the people to the exposure, and the ability of affected systems and populations to adapt. Adaptation can lessen sensitivity to climate change, while mitigation can diminish the vulnerability to climate change, including its rate and extent. Adaptation and mitigation can complete one another and fundamentally reduce the risk of climate change. Although adaptation to climate impacts has attracted considerable attention recently, the effectiveness of specific strategies concerning greater flexibility of public health systems stays investigated. Adapting to climate change will be essential and occur at behavioral, physiological, social, institutional, and organizational scales. To take benefit of already persistent adaptations for creating more effectual public health responses to climate change impacts, especially for poor rural communities whose access to health care is extremely limited even in the current policy environment, developing a baseline understanding of the region-specific demographic, social, and ecological determinants of health will be requisite. In creating public health responses, characteristics that must be considered include the population's age structure, socioeconomic profile, baseline ubiquity of climate-sensitive diseases, public awareness of risk, the built environment, existing infrastructure, available public health services, and uncontrolled responses to climate impacts on health that households and communities might undertake by themselves. Climate irregularity and human health indicate a great deal of assortment in the reported associations. It is essential to develop an extensive categorization of climate change and associated health consequences across the spectrum of environments and residents likely to be affected. A better knowledge of the influences of climate change on health in India will be best achieved through studies determined on climates and people in India. Countries like India have an immense opportunity to guide the future approach regarding sustainable development and adaptation to climate change. Still, it will take the combined effort of policymakers and scientists worldwide to manage the intricate challenges pertinent to climate change and human health."
12,Disposing of Oil,social-issues," Did you know that each year, close to 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold in Australia? Lubricating oil is the oil used in engines, and while some engines (such as two-stroke lawnmower engines) burn oil completely, others like machinery and motor vehicle engines produce large volumes of used oil that can be reclaimed and reused. At CopperRock Recycling centre, we accept this used oil for recycling for a small fee. Similarly, cooking oil needs to be disposed of correctly. Unfortunately, we cannot accept cooking oil for recycling at CopperRock. However, there are many local companies that can collect your cooking oil waste - such as Your Oil Man, and Cookers. If disposed of incorrectly, used oil has the potential to pollute land, water and infrastructure. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate one million litres of water and a single automotive oil change produces 4 to 5 litres of used oil. There are at least 250 million litres of used oil generated in Australia every year. But it’s not just oil waste that’s a landfill hazard, it’s also the packaging that oil comes in - particularly lubricating oils due to residual oil contamination. Hence, why we cannot accept your empty oil container at Copper Rock. There are approximately 3,050 tonnes of contaminated small volume motor vehicle oil containers sent to landfill each year. Though this number is actually thought to be higher than that when you take into account the full range of petroleum-based oil lubricants available. To tackle this issue, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO), under the Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Plastics Pact (ANZPAC), has received funding to develop a national product stewardship scheme for the recovery and reprocessing of used oil containers.  APCO has completed stage one of the project which includes understanding the current landscape for oil containers and developing preliminary scheme design options. They’re working to have the scheme design finalised and an implementation plan by March 2023. The high-level scope of the project includes investigation of: • The collection and recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) motor oil containers sold in Australia up to 20 litres in capacity. • Labelling and public education. • The potential for packaging re-use models. • End-markets and use of recycled content. Once the project is implemented a whole supply chain approach will be adopted to ensure industry engagement in the design of an efficient and effective scheme which aims to: • Increase the recovery of oil containers up to 20 litres. • Reduce the impact of oil bottles on the environment and human health. • Investigate innovative advanced recycling technology and alternative reuse models for oil bottles. • Establish recovery targets in line with the ANZPAC Plastics Pact. To learn more about the project or stay up to date on its progress visit the ANZPAC website under ‘delivering product stewardship’."
13,When Job Hunting Make Finding a Great Boss Your Priority,social-issues," Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Over the course of my career, I learned the “hard way” that it’s better to report to a good boss at a bad company than a bad boss at a good one. The typical job seeker reads through job descriptions hoping to find one that reads like them. The thinking: “The closer I fit the job description, the more likely I’ll get hired.” That kind of thinking is counterproductive to your career and enjoying your employment. Yes, to be invited for an interview, your skills and experiences must be aligned with the job description. What about being aligned with your future boss? Shouldn’t finding a stellar boss be your priority? Job seekers tend to focus on the company, salary, paid time off, benefits, etc., and not on the person they’ll be reporting to. Reverse your priorities, focus on the person to whom you’ll report, then the company, salary, etc. A great boss isn’t just someone who knows the business, makes decisions, and intuitively delegates. A great boss is a teacher, a mentor, and above all someone you can count on. They’re someone who shows you your opportunities to enhance your skillset and who believes in you. When you have a great boss, you learn not only what you need to know to do your job, but also what you need to know to move forward. For these reasons and many more, you should focus on choosing a great boss first. Don’t just focus on the company or industry. A great boss is critical to your success. My career today exists because of three great bosses I was privileged to have worked for. Undoubtedly, you’ve heard of the “Great Resignation” and how employers have difficulty filling their open positions. This has resulted in recruiting efforts, especially for candidates with in-demand skills, becoming aggressive in luring (READ: deceiving, duping, misleading) candidates. I often hear from new hires who are disheartened to discover that the position, workplace, and management are entirely different from what they were told during the hiring process. Before accepting a job, get to know your future boss. Without good leadership—leadership that supports you—your dream job isn’t a dream job. When employees are asked to describe a great boss, they say: Puts people first. Leads by example. Shares information. Is committed to excellence. Shows appreciation and gives recognition. Delegates effectively, then gets out of the way. Has your back and wants to see you succeed in your position and career. A great boss is hard to find, difficult to part from, and impossible to forget—they make your work life significantly better. No one does or tries to do, their best work without a supportive boss and a healthy work environment. In contrast, a bad boss micromanages you, blames you, and holds you back in an attempt to not lose you, all of which will make you miserable. Never accept a job offer unless the person you’ll report to as part of your hiring process and you had the opportunity to ask them questions such as: How do you acknowledge achievements? What irritates you? What’s your communication style? Over the next 12 months, what would be my highest priorities? How do you measure and track success? How do you address performance issues? How would you describe your management style? How will you manage me? Please tell me a story that illustrates your management style. What characteristics should a person have to be successful in this role? What challenge(s) is the company currently facing? How are they being addressed? What’s your philosophy on performance reviews? How often is performance evaluated? What would you add or subtract from the current team to strengthen performance and productivity? What constitutes a workday? What are the working hours? What are your expectations regarding taking work home, staying late, or being reachable after hours? Can I get a copy of the employee handbook to read at home? What’s in a job description does matter. However, in our hyper-changing world, it’s also temporary. Accepting a job shouldn’t solely be based on a job description, which will for the most part be irrelevant in a few years. In terms of having an envy-worthy career, leadership is much more important since it focuses on the long-term. Your time spent doing your due diligence determining whether you and your potential new boss can have a great working relationship will be time you won’t regret having spent."
14,Soulmate Sketch - Psychic Drawings - Social Media Famous,social-issues," Images of psychic art are recorded in our earliest visual records covering centuries. In an examination of prehistoric man, ancient sages, and shaman's, to the modern day psychic artist we find an intuitive acceptance of pictures. Psychic art is one of our greatest tools of communication and intuitive comprehension of space that expands our physical reality and pleases the eye as well as the logic of the mind. The term psychic art is a form of automatism representing a person whose writing, drawing, painting, or musical performance occurs without conscious control or knowledge. Premonitions of future events, messages from beyond the grave, and scenes from the distant past are available to review in vivid color, shapes, and lines in sharp contrast to physical reality. The term psychic art is somewhat of a deliberate umbrella used to include almost everything in the field including forms of tribal art, folk art, and today's suggestion of spirit drawing. It is safe and valid but a very general term for automatism. Some of the most competent and promising contributions of psychic art on public record have been utilized in a criminal investigations such as zeroing in on a rapist or other hideous crimes such as the hillside strangler of Los Angeles in which the psychic artist produced renderings of the suspect and other clues related to the crime during the investigation. Such records are rare given the onslaught of mail and phone calls that law enforcement agencies receive following media coverage of these gruesome crimes. The cultural phenomena of the early Victorian fascination with spiritualism and other pseudo-sciences championed the terrain of paranormal research in the nineteenth century. Observations at that time separated paranormal phenomena from the psychology of the mind. Reports by leading researchers such as Sir William Crooks and William James presented evidence of automatic writing and drawing. Carl Jung's concept of the collective unconscious; examined automatism and consequently propelled the variedness of both psychology and parapsychology studies. Psychic art-automatism was presented repeatedly and conclusively by a respondent in Remote Viewing experiments conducted at the Mobius Group headed up by Stephen Schwartz in the 1980s. The term remote viewing is the ability to perceive places, persons, and actions that are not within the range of the five senses. There is a large market for spirit guide drawings or renderings illustrating messages from deceased relatives listed under the umbrella term of Psychic Art through various channeling sources. The practitioner sometimes referred to as a Medium mentally connects with the spirit world to produce the artwork for the customer. Authentic oil paintings created in genuine psychic automatism, documented in the 1970s through news and broadcast are now being released for publication in prints. An extraordinary illustration supporting psychic art- automatism was the 1979 CBS documentary Psychic Phenomena; which filmed the psychic artists painting with their eyes closed. Another example was a BBC Nova in ""Horizons in ESP"" Those titles considered for reproduction are ""Earth Mother"", ""Alpha Theta Omega"", ""Ohm 1"" and ""Earth Father"". Images and colors from the deepest realms of the paranormal onto the canvas and then out to the public are sure to open up new dimensions of profound thought for the public at large. Psychic Art Automatism is often associated with Surrealism. The mechanics of Surrealism is divided into two groups of expression, Automatism or ""Absolute"" and ""Veristic"". The Veristic form transforms objects from the physical world into their paintings. The Absolute form derives their imagery purely from spontaneous thought. The 1920s and 1930s were a significant era for Surrealism in the United States. Leading the great surrealist movement of the times was Salvador Dali who is considered the greatest surrealist master of the art of the twentieth century. In a critical appreciation of the historical principles of art, Surrealism was not a social action, yet it remains a symbol of cultural liberation of the times. Psychic Art Automatism, on the other hand, is entirely the scope of the unconscious mind attributed to phenomena that cannot be explained by natural laws. It is often predictive but remains one of the less investigated psychic skills in parapsychology. Perhaps a presence in a museum would create an active market for Psychic Art Automatism but most likely for only the elite group of paranormal societies."
15,Benefits of Treadmills,social-issues," Treadmills  are one of the most popular pieces of exercise equipment currently on the market, and with good reason. Treadmills provide a wide range of benefits, both from a health and practicality standpoint. They are highly beneficial for achieving a variety of fitness goals and a great piece of equipment for individuals just beginning their health journey. Below are just a few of the many health benefits of treadmills and the ways they can help individuals of any skill level. Weight loss Perhaps the most widely known health benefit of treadmills is their ability to help individuals lose weight quickly and efficiently. Treadmills can help you burn calories more quickly than some other forms of aerobic exercise. The faster and longer a person runs on the treadmill, the faster they will burn calories, and the easier it will be to lose weight. Exercising on a treadmill through HIIT workouts is one of the best ways to reduce body fat quickly and safely. However, lower-intensity treadmill exercises can also help reduce body fat, though the results may not be as immediate. Walking or jogging at an incline or alternating between sprints and jogging is also a great way to lose weight while exercising on a treadmill. Heart health Treadmill exercises provide exceptional cardiovascular exercise that can significantly improve heart health. In fact, treadmill workouts are a popular form of cardio exercise due to the ability to maintain a steady heart rate throughout the entire exercise. This can be particularly beneficial to individuals with cardiovascular issues or those with high cholesterol. Treadmill exercises are effective at increasing heart rate to a healthy level, so they are also very beneficial as a warm-up exercise. Elevating your heart rate to a healthy level will enable you to perform other exercises, such as weight training or other cardio exercises, with increased safety and success. Muscle tone Like many cardio workouts, one of the main benefits of treadmills is that they engage multiple muscle groups to provide a full-body workout. The leg muscles bear the brunt of the work during a treadmill workout but the abdomen, back, buttocks, and arm muscles are also engaged. Maintaining proper posture while running on the treadmill will engage core muscles even further and provide a more well-rounded workout. Additionally, pairing the treadmill exercise with light strength training will help engage arm muscles during the workout. Many people choose to hold weights while exercising on the treadmill to further increase the intensity of the workout. To find a treadmill that works best with your exercise plan and workout goals, stop by an American Home Fitness Store today. Our exercise stores in Sylvania, Toledo, and the surrounding areas are open daily and always available to help you reach your fitness goals. https://souqalif.com"
16,Assessing Socioeconomic Disadvantage in College Admissions,social-issues," Intelligent recently reported that 34 percent of whites who applied to college falsified their applications by wrongly claiming that they were racial minorities. According to the research, white males lied 48 percent of the time. White females only lied 16 percent of the time.[1] In a follow-up tweet, Professor Ibram X. Kendi asserted that the research proved that white students maintained their privilege by gaming the admissions process. Critics retorted that the research undermines the belief that white privilege is laced into every aspect of shared existence. If white privilege is pervasive, why do applicants to elite schools gain a benefit when they pretend to be colored?[2] According to discovery in recent discrimination lawsuits at Ivy League schools, when admission officials must pick between two applicants with similar applications, the minority (excluding Asians) will be selected. Because of this, identifying as a minority when applying to Ivy League universities improves an applicant’s chances for acceptance.[3] For these reasons, white applicants gain an advantage when applying if they identify as a racial minority. School officials defend racially biased admissions policies (affirmative action) on four grounds. First, minorities are disadvantaged. Second, the composition of the student body should mirror the demographic make-up of the country. Third, grades, test scores, internships, special abilities, notable achievements, awards, references, and the quality of the application must be supplemented by the “whole person” test. The whole person criterion allows admission officials to select students who are less meritorious because they possess intangible qualities that the university values. Fourth, racial diversity improves the academic learning environment. The above points can be nuanced and debated. For example, how does one objectively measure the racial disadvantage of a college applicant? Why does racial diversity improve the overall learning environment? More importantly, should universities that receive federal money be exempted from civil rights law that forbids discrimination based on race, color, or national origin? Case law allows a little wiggle room when universities are attempting to balance the racial composition of their schools. However, when applying admission policies that consider race, schools cannot use quotas. Instead, they strive for percentile representations. For instance, at Harvard, 28 percent of the student body comes from Black, Latino, and other non-Asian minority categories. Around 42 percent are white Americans.[4] A consortium of Asian Students has claimed that Harvard’s admissions policies discriminate against them. In 2022, the Supreme Court will consider their lawsuit. In the meantime, the president of Harvard reiterated why its admissions policy is necessary. ""Considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions produces a more diverse student body which strengthens the learning environment for all."" Students for Fair Admissions countered by saying, ""In a multi-racial, multi-ethnic nation like ours, the college admissions bar cannot be raised for some races and ethnic groups but lowered for others. Our nation cannot remedy past discrimination and racial preferences with new discrimination and different racial preferences""[5] In the current debate, no one is saying that universities cannot consider student disadvantage or seek for a diverse student body. Rather, a prima fascia reading of the law says that schools cannot consider race when accepting new students. The use of race is problematic for another reason. Even though the Ivy schools argue that their admission policies balance the racial composition of the student body, universities select between individuals for whom race is only a part of their social identity. It should be noted that races do not apply to school. Individuals do. As such, the rightness of the admission policy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, when two equally qualified applicants are being considered, it’s possible that the rejected white student attended subpar public schools in a desperately impoverished community and the accepted minority student came from a rich family and attended a prestigious college prep school. In this example, the race-based policy favored the one with the greater socioeconomic advantage. In light of the above scenario, assumptions about Caucasians need to be reevaluated. In fact, there are many white populations in America. Since some are economically privileged and others are not, Ivy League schools should distinguish between the various white groupings. It’s helpful to remember that white includes orphans, Gypsies, the rural poor, day laborers, children from single-parent homes, and a vast assortment of people from grossly dysfunctional homes. Case in point, even though the entire region of Appalachia is economically depressed, has low rates of achievement, and suffers from chronic unemployment, elite schools do not create admission policies to balance that population. [6] If they did, one in twelve students would come from Appalachia? Instead, a white applicant from Appalachia falls into a uber competitive category. This is the point; some white people don’t enjoy privilege, and some minorities don’t suffer from socioeconomic disadvantage. A person is more than her race. As such, the university application process should measure tangible indicators of disadvantage. Pointedly, why should an Ivy League school use race as the main criterion by which it measures disadvantage and social diversity since it is not a socioeconomic term? Furthermore, from a legal perspective, race is a blurry concept that is hard to define and nearly impossible to operationalize. The conclusions of the Intelligent research article missed four additional points. One, since race is a social construct, the federal government allows Americans to self-identify as they please on official documents. As such, one does not have to lie or take a DNA test to identify with a social category of her choice when applying to a school. In fact, America does not have a test to determine race. This highlights the problematic nature of Kendi's ""gaming the system"" tweet. What percentage of African DNA must an American have to qualify as an African American? Can a white-appearing person who comes from mixed parentage call herself Black? After how many generations of assimilation into the American melting pot does a Latino person cease to qualify as Latino? Second, race favoring admissions policies have greatly demoralized meritorious high school students and disincentivized academic achievement. Exceptional students who graduate from elite universities create new technologies, solve complex problems, and cure vexing diseases. Their success is America’s success! America’s collective progress depends on the cultivation of its most gifted students. For the sake of the world, meritorious achievement should drive admission policies in Ivy League schools. Third, reports show that growing percentages of young whites are internalizing rhetoric that identifies white as an oppressor term. This is causing social anxiety.[7] Desperately, some whites want to escape from the stigma of that term. Many do this by imagining that they are a racial minority. Others do this by claiming to be a sexual minority. For example, Newsweek reported that 40 percent of Gen-Zs identify as LGBTQ.[8] Society should tell these guilt-ridden students that white is not bad. They can monitor privilege and practice cultural humility without feeling guilt or shame about their skin color, heritage, or life opportunities. How one acknowledges inequality and strives for justice is more important than one’s social location. Fourth, objective ways to measure socioeconomic disadvantage have been developed. A report by de Castro, Gee, and Takeuchi shows that socioeconomic measurements vary by ethnicity and location. For example, all Asian Americans are not rich and a person living in Los Angeles needs more income than a person in rural Ohio.[9] Professor John Jerrim’s nine-part process to measure disadvantage among those applying to college should be considered because it compensates for localized deviation and does not appeal to race.[10] In his approach, qualification for free lunches and area-level markers are the best indicators of disadvantage. Mental and physical disabilities should also be considered. In short, racism is a legacy problem that vexes America. It is a social fact that can be measured. Moreover, it is a daily reality for many people. Often it is associated with disadvantage. This problem must not be minimized or ignored. Yet, by itself, race does not equate to disadvantage. Furthermore, how America talks about social inequality is as important as how it seeks to eliminate it. For these reasons, Ivy League schools should create and employ racially neutral admission standards that objectively measure disadvantage. Furthermore, the schools should prioritize achievement.

17,Mother's Day was intended for a Day of International Peace,social-issues," As I look at my hand, I am reminded of my mother. She had the same short, stumped, freckled fingers I do. Mother's Day will soon be here, and I am among the many who no longer have the opportunity to spend time with my mother, or to call her. While researching the origins of Mother's Day I came across a whole section of women's history I was not aware of. It got me thinking about all of the strong, women I have personally been exposed to in my life. There are so many in my family that not only sheltered me, educated me, fed me, clothed me, and gave me bits and parts of themselves that will always shape my destiny no matter how little or large that may be; I can not begin to express the depth of my gratitude for all of them. I would like to take this time to share with you a piece written by Julia Ward Howe, she wrote the Battle Hymn of the Republic, a song we once sang in the one-room school house I attended in Ledger, Montana. Here are a few lines from that Hymn, ""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord: He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword: His truth is marching on."" But the piece I want to introduce you too is below. As I look at my hand and remember my mother, and think of all the mother's in Ukraine, I ask that you take this writing and make it your mantra for the year. MOTHER’S DAY PROCLAMATION Boston, 1870 “Arise, then… women of this day! Arise, all women who have hearts, whether our baptism be that of water or of tears! Say firmly: We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies. Our husbands shall not come to us, reeking with carnage, for caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, women of one country, will be too tender of those of another country to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs. From the bosom of the devastated earth a voice goes up with our own. It says:  Disarm, Disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice. Blood does not wipe out dishonor, nor violence vindicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil at the summons of war, let women now leave all that may be left of home for a great and earnest day of council. Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them then solemnly take council with each other as to the means whereby the great human family can live in peace, each bearing after his own kind the sacred impress, not of Caesar, but of God. In the name of womanhood and of humanity, I earnestly ask that a general congress of women, without limit of nationality, may be appointed and held at some place deemed most convenient, and at the earliest period consistent with its objects, to promote the alliance of the different nationalities, the amicable settlement of international questions, the great and general interests of peace.“ ~ Julia Ward Howe Mother's Day started after the Civil war as a way to bring on reconciliation between the north and south. Over the years it transitioned into a community of women helping each other take care of their families through education, lobbying and bucking a system that today still hold's women in an unjust perspective. In 1914, Ann Marie Jarvis had managed to lobby all the way to Washington DC where former President Woodrow Willison signed a proclamation establishing Mother's Day as a National Holiday and asking every American to fly the flag in honor of those mother's who lost sons in war. I would like to ask all those who read this, to fly a flag up to and on Mother's Day for all the mother's who are loosing sons in the war in Ukraine and those mother's who have lost sons from preceding wars. I would also like to ask everyone to wear a white carnation in memory of the mother's who are no longer with us. This was the symbol the Miss Ann Maria Jarvis presented on the first mother's day celebration on May 12, 1907. On this mother's day, let us all take a good long look at the Mother's Day Proclamation and ask ourselves is there anything I can do personally to bring this change about? Since Quotes Totez+ is a woman owned and operated business we would like to take this opportunity to shed some light on Women's history that isn't so well known. Mother's Day is the perfect time to honor all the women who came before us, fight along side us today and those who will continue to carry the torch long after we have gone. Yes without Mothers none of us would be here so we do at least have a debt of gratitude for our very existence."
18,AN OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES OF NIGERIA IN RECENT TIMES,social-issues," AN OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES OF NIGERIA IN RECENT TIMES By Baklit Mukang (B.Sc Geography, M.Sc Environmental Resource Planning) Nigeria is believed to be the most populous black Nation and seen as the giant of the African continent with an estimated population of over 200 million people with about 250 different ethnic groups. The country is divided into six geo-political zones which are; South-South, South-East, South-West, North-West, North-East and North-Central. The South-South is made up of 6 states which are; Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo and Cross River. The South-West comprises of 6 states; Lagos, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Oyo and Ekiti. The South-East comprises of 5 states; Anambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia, and Ebonyi. The North-West have 7 states which are; Kebbi, Katsina, Zamfara, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kano and Jigawa. The North-East have 6 states which are; Gombe, Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Maiduguri and Taraba. The North-Central which is being referred to as the Middle Belt in some quarters is made up of 6 states including the FCT, they are; Plateau, Benue, Nassarawa, Kogi, Kwara and Niger. The country thus has 36 states including the FCT which is the administrative headquarters of the country, and can be divided into two major political divisions of North and South. Nigeria as a country has been plagued with a series of challenges in the past before gaining its independence from British rule in 1960 and embracing democratic system of government in 1999. Worthy of mention of these happenings in the history of Nigeria that have contributed in shaping the country to what it is today are the Military coups d’état of 1966, 1967 (Civil War), 1975, 1976, 1983, 1990 and 1993. The unity and stability of the nation during these periods were threatened through series of military coups, some of which successfully overthrew the sitting government (1966, 1975, 1983, 1985 and 1993), while others failed to overthrow the government and seize power (1967, 1976 and 1990). National Unity and Stability can be hinged to the concept of sustainability. Sustainability as a concept refers to meeting of our basic needs without compromising or destroying the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs. As a concept, sustainability is anchored on three pillars which are; economic, social and environmental sustainability. The challenges confronting Nigeria in recent times have great consequences on these three pillars of sustainability, without which it becomes almost impossible for the nation to enjoy national unity and stability. This paper would however, focus on some happenings in the country that have threatened the economic, social and environmental sustainability aspects of the people of Nigeria. The issues to be examined briefly are; the agitations for secession by IPOB, banditry/Kidnappings in the North, ASUU strikes and crisis in the oil sector. To begin with, there is a saying that “development can only thrive in an atmosphere of peace”. It can therefore be concluded that peace is a panacea for development. The multiplicity of ethnic groups in the country has made it easy for one group or the other to feel marginalized. For instance, the Indigenous People of Biafara (IPOB) is a separatist group in the south-east and parts of the south-south of Nigeria which was founded around 2014 by Nnamdi Kanu a British-Nigerian whose desire is to restore the separatist state of Biafara which existed in the eastern region of Nigeria during the civil war of 1967 to 1970. The Biafara struggle in Nigeria started shortly after independence in 1967 under the command of Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu. The Biafara republic however failed due to the surrender of the Biafaran forces to the Federal Military Government (FMG) under the command of General Yakubu Gowon in 1970. The activities of this group has no doubt led to the destabilization of the region (south-east and parts of south-south) as there has been series of confrontations between the armed faction of IPOB known as Eastern Security Network (ESN) which was formed and announced by its leader in 2020 with security forces. He justified the reason for the establishment of ESN as a measure to protect the Igbo people from Fulani herders who have been attacking the Igbo people on their land and destroying their farm lands. This pronouncement by Nnamdi Kanu of course did not go down well with the government of Nigeria as every right thinking government would react. This led to an offensive launched on the group (ESN) by the Nigerian Military in 2021. The leader of IPOB had been arrested earlier in 2015 by the Department of state Services (DSS) in Lagos and was released on bail after a trial in a magistrate court in Abuja. He fled the country however in 2017 after the invasion of his compound in Abia State, Nigeria. He was rearrested in 2021 outside the shores of the country in where it was believed to be Kenya, a claim which was refuted by the Kenyan High Commissioner (Wilfred Machage). His arrest sparked waves of different reactions in the south-east which also led to an imposition of a sit-at-home order by IPOB. The order was expected to commence from the 9th of August 2021 in order to press for the release of its leader who was held in DSS custody. Every Monday from 6:00am to 6:00pm was declared as a sit at home order in the south-east. This meant that no form of business, commercial, educational or any other activity took place on Monday’s as the streets were deserted; people who attempted to flaunt the order incurred the wrath of IPOB as they were beaten mercilessly and their properties destroyed. The next contemporary issue which is the activities of bandits in the north-west and parts of north-central Nigeria poses a great threat as the activities of IPOB to the security of lives and property by implication national unity and stability also. Bandits have been having a filled day in the north-west of the country and some parts of the north-central in recent times as they go about kidnapping people for ransom, ransacking villages and displacing people from their ancestral lands. They have destroyed the means of rural livelihood which happens to be farming in this case as villagers are attacked and killed on their farmlands and their crops burnt on the farm and in their reserves. There are also reports that villagers sometimes have to pay bandits in order to make them stay away from attacking their communities and each time people try to go against the demands made by the bandits, the result is destruction of properties, killing and maiming of people in these communities. Ibrahim Adeyemi in his report in Premium Times dated April 4th 2022, reported that there are about 100 different group of bandits with over 30,000 foot soldiers (militias) operating in the northwest and are engaged in killing, maiming and kidnapping of innocent citizens in the region. The center of Democracy and Development for West Africa (CDD) has attributed the activities of bandits in the northwest and some parts of the north-central to factors which include; political, economic and social problems. The ineffectiveness of Nigerian criminal justice system has made people lose confidence and trust in the judiciary. The people do not feel satisfied with judgments coming from the courts and each time this happens there is tendency for the defendants to take laws into their hands by devising ways of getting back at people whom they believe have done them wrong or decide to go into a life of crime themselves as a result of frustration occasioned by the disappointing judgment, this was the confession of a repentant bandit to CDD. Kaduna state in the last one year (2021 to 2022) has always been on the news with the activities of bandits ranging from kidnappings and killings. The Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) was attacked on the 24th of August 2021, it was reported that two officers were killed and another abducted.  Another recent attack in Kaduna is the bombing of the rail track along the Kaduna-Abuja rail line on the 28th of March 2022, with about 8 people reported dead and about 41 persons injured while other passengers are still missing with others in the hands of bandits who have reached out to their families already to confirm they are in their custody and to negotiate on the ransom to be paid in order to have their loved ones released. One would ask, if the security agents themselves are targets to whom do they people run to for safety? Protection of lives and property is the sole prerogative of any government. When the people do not feel that sense of security any longer, there is that tendency for the nation to drift into a state of anarchy. There is no gainsaying that education is the bedrock for the development of any nation. While peace is an environment that allows development to thrive, education is the basic tool needed to bring about development. No nation in the world can attain economic development without heavy investments in education. It is however sad to note with dismay the governments handling and response to issues of education especially at the tertiary level. Tertiary education in the country has been plagued with strikes and threats of strikes by lectures of universities, colleges of education as well as polytechnics. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been involved in a series of face-off with the federal government over issues relating to the 2009 FGN-ASUU agreement and the issue of Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS). The universities lecturers have kicked against the adoption of IPPIS as a payment platform for its members as the system have been adjudged to be ineffective in suiting the needs of a university system. The union also went ahead to develop the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) which they believe suits the university system. This however doesn’t seem to go down well with the federal government of Nigeria as they reported UTAS to have failed the integrity test conducted by National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) in February 2022. The 2009 FGN-ASUU agreement borders on issues pertaining to conditions of service, funding, university autonomy and academic freedom amongst others. It is sad to note that 13 years down the line there are still grievances by ASUU towards the federal government of Nigeria who has failed to honor certain aspects of the agreement it entered into with the union. The nation’s federal universities have experienced series of strikes that have become more like a reoccurring decimal. The future of so many youths have been left hanging in the balance as their dream of acquiring a university degree to enable them pursue their career and professional calling lies in a plethora of ASUU strikes. This certainly does not augur well for the development of our dear country. Ground-breaking researches and innovations are capital intensive activities that require heavy funding. Funding of the nation’s universities and other tertiary institutions to enable them engage in researches and innovations in science and technology is critical if at all we are to compete with other countries of the world and be a force to be reckoned with. Without access to research grants and proper funding for the equipping of our laboratories to a global standard to allow experiments to be conducted and discoveries in the field of science possible, our universities would not be considered worthy of recognition in the committee of universities in the world. Finally, we move to our last issue which is the oil sector of our economy. Nigeria is an oil blessed nation. The natural resource was discovered in commercial quantity in 1956 at Oloibiri, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. The discovery of oil would have meant a turn-around in the economic fortunes of the country but regrettably that isn’t the case. Despite having four refineries in the country, it is embarrassing to say that none of these four refineries or the four collectively can produce fuel to service the nation’s growing population who require the product for various activities of which their livelihood depends on. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) estimates a daily consumption rate of premium motor spirit (PMS) to a tune of 65.7 million liters a day in January, 2022. The concept of subsidy is being brought about as a result of the failure of our government to ensure that our refineries function optimally to suit the needs of the people in order to avoiding shipping crude outside the shores of the country to be refined and only to be imported back into the country again. The concept of subsidy has continued to be a debated issue by development experts and many others. This is because many believe that the figures being put forward by the NNPC as daily consumption rates sound outrageous and is only but a ploy by the agency to swindle resources. The organization had in January 2022 requested the sum of 3 trillion naira for subsidy payments due to the price of crude oil in the global market being pegged at $80 per barrel. Although the government has announced its intention to remove subsidy on a couple of occasions and recently in 2021 effective from February 2022, this decision if allowed to come into effect will lead to hardship on the masses as well as the collapse of most MSME’s in the country who rely on fuel for its production and other services. Others as well as the government have maintained that removal of subsidy is the best way f addressing the crisis in the oil sector. In January of 2022, there was a fuel scarcity that hit the nation which was blamed on the importation of adulterated fuel by oil marketers as was reported by the regulatory body (NNPC), and lasted all through to almost the 4th week of the month of March, 2022. During the period of the scarcity long queues were observed in all the states of the nation as people spent hours queuing for fuel and some had to sleep in their cars before getting fuel the next day. This has led to hours of unproductive labor wasted in fuel queues as well as rising cost of transportation and the prices of goods and services almost doubled due to the high price of fuel which sold at between 400 and above in different parts of the country. It is also important to point out that the exploration of oil in Niger delta by oil companies like Shell has led to the destruction of the ecosystem. Through these exploration activities, issues of oil spillage have been recorded in the region which has led to destruction of agricultural land and water for domestic and industrial purposes as well as the destruction of various species of flora and fauna. It is in the light of these happenings the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) was commissioned in 2011 by the federal government to embark on an Environmental assessment of the region. In its Environmental Report, a clean-up programme was recommended in the region (Ogoni land) and a total of 1 billion dollars was appropriated for the clean-up and restoration programme of Ogoni land on the 7th of August, 2017. In conclusion, the issues raised in the paper threaten sustainability in diverse ways. The agitations by IPOB in the south and the activities of bandits in the north, threaten economic, social and environmental sustainability of the country. Human relations have been reduced due to the fear of kidnappings on our roads and in recent time’s rail ways (Kaduna-Abuja) by bandits while travelling. The means of earning a living have been threatened also by the activities of IPOB during the sit at home order as businesses and other commercial activities came to a halt every Monday of the week thereby leading to loss of capital by both government and private individuals and organizations. Some parts of the forest have also been bombed by the military in an offensive against the bandits who run to their hideouts in the forest thereby destroying habitats of certain species of flora and fauna. The FGN-ASUU face-off also has its own threat on economic sustainability as innovations in science and technology and knowledge sharing and acquisition have been greatly affected due to the incessant strike actions. The activities of oil exploration companies also pose a threat to economic as well as environmental sustainability. Farmers can no longer plough the land for both subsistence and commercial purposes as the land has been rendered agriculturally unproductive. Fisher men can no longer find fishes to catch as the fishes and other aquatic animals have been killed by the oil spillage. It is therefore in view of this that a clarion call on the federal government and well meaning Nigerians is made by this paper in order to prevent what the famous author Prof. Chinua Achebe posited in his book “Things Fall Apart”. Neglecting the issues discussed in this paper and other issues are capable of derailing the nation from the attainment of national unity and stability.

19,How to Implement an Agile RPO Strategy?,social-issues," Are you facing challenges in managing your employee onboarding processes effectively? Do you often end up with a higher number of bad recruits who are hampering the overall productivity of your organization? Try outsourcing your recruitment processes for higher efficiency and getting the right talent pool onboard. Managing employee journeys right from recruitment to retirement can be hectic! Besides, it’s difficult for HR professionals to handle bad hires, especially when it affects the morale and self-confidence of other employees. This is why you need to have an agile RPO strategy to boost your employee hiring and management processes, while saving time, money, and effort. Recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) is a business model in which an organization transfers its recruitment processes to an outside provider, either partially or completely. Using more efficient and resourceful external recruitment processes, companies can optimize their recruitment strategies and bring agility to their employee management operations. However, before implementing an agile RPO strategy, you need to follow certain steps for enhancing your outcomes. Before discussing the 5 key steps of executing an agile RPO strategy, let’s check out why you should outsource your recruitment processes in the first place. Importance of Agile RPO Implementation An agile RPO provider understands the company’s values and missions, and instills them amongst the employees to help them work towards a common goal. By agile RPO, we mean a more dynamic, adaptable, and flexible recruitment process by using core principles and unified communication approaches. Here are some reasons you need an agile RPO implementation strategy. •	Hire the Right People: RPO implementation ensures a higher quality of recruits by identifying the right people and expertise. Besides, you can access a wider talent pool from across the globe, thus increasing your chances of meeting more skilled and experienced people, thus opening up your options. Eliminate frequent inefficiencies in the employment process by removing repetitive tasks, wrong hires, and human errors. •	Reduce Costs: Implementing an agile RPO strategy is way more cost-effective compared to traditional in-house recruitment processes. That’s because you are able to cut down on the costs associated with office spaces, direct advertising, employee allowances, and fixed monthly payroll. You simply pay for the services you avail from an RPO provider. •	Save Time: You can save time and effort in finding the right hires since professional RPO solution providers would dedicate their time and people resources to help you find the talent you need. •	Utilize Your Resources Efficiently: Instead of wasting your valuable resources like time, money, and manpower, in recruitment inefficiencies, use them more economically to manage your core business operations, like sales, manufacturing, finances, customer relationships, and so on. •	Higher Scalability and Flexibility: Using versatile recruitment processes, the RPO provider can assure you with greater flexibility in project management. You can adopt a more scalable business model that lets you track your teams’ performances through real-time data and analytical insights. What’s more, agile RPO solution providers can adapt to any situation, thus ensuring more flexibility in your hiring operations. •	Boost Transparency in Your Recruitment Processes: An agile RPO solution increases transparency by providing complete visibility and effective two-way communication about the progress, goals, achievements, and methods utilized to employ new applicants. It enables your teams to prioritize their tasks, allowing them to work on just the methods and strategies that deliver the intended outcomes. •	Get Instant Feedback: The best thing about agile RPO processes is that your provider would give you instant feedback in real-time on the individual profiles of potential candidates. This is crucial to help an organization’s management to work on upskilling the candidate’s expertise and knowledge and to boost your company’s reputation. 4 Step Formula to Implement an Agile RPO Strategy Once you have found the right RPO provider, it’s time to plan out your agile RPO implementation strategies. Here are the top 5 steps that would help you strategize and implement your RPO processes efficiently. First things first, assemble a dedicated team of talented and knowledgeable candidates with professional guidance from your RPO manager. But before selecting your team members, choose a professional and experienced project owner and project leader. They are the people responsible for carrying out the project and keeping track of its progress on a regular basis. Next, employ your project leader to form an effective team that will carry out the project. Here, you can use the scrum methodology to assemble smaller teams first, since small-sized groups tend to work more collaboratively and productively. Scrum, in agile recruitment strategy, is a framework that enables teams to work together towards a common mission. The ideal size of an agile team should be around 3-9 members. Smaller groups work best due to better communication and interaction. Besides, managing larger teams may be difficult for the leaders, as it would be harder to bring so many people with varied perspectives under one roof. Once you have formed your team and established your recruitment strategy, you should host a formal project launch meeting with the entire team to discuss the aim, expectations, task allocations, and workflows. This will guarantee that everyone is on the same page and will serve as a point of reference for analyzing incremental results. Implementing an agile RPO strategy is more like slicing up your tasks and processes into smaller chunks of a more manageable process pie. An agile team will be able to organize these slices into intensive, short-term work cycles known as ""sprints. Sprints, being the foundation of agile, refer to brief amounts of time allotted to a team to achieve particular, quantifiable goals. After the sprint, the team meets to review what went well and what went wrong, how the procedures may be improved, and where the present plan falls short or succeeds. The sprint's purpose isn't to finish the task or fill the position, but rather to identify and eliminate any barriers and misconceptions, as well as to fine-tune your deliverables. Teams should begin by breaking down larger projects into individual tasks and prioritizing them. Then comes the process of grouping together a series of tiny tasks to form sprints. The goal is to fit a certain amount of productivity into a given length of time and come as near to fulfilling your sprint goals as possible well before the deadline. For example, let’s say the ""Executive Director"" is the recruitment project, and the first week-long sprint's duties include sourcing, feedback, and remarketing. Sprint two could include outreach, preliminary screening, and feedback to ensure the project is completed and delivered on time, thus dividing the tasks into groups and accomplishing them faster. Agile project management is built on communication, which is why it allows faster iteration. Standups are short and rapid-fire daily standing meetings (although after COVID, they have transitioned to virtual groups). You move around the room, one by one, outlining your priorities, blockages, and worries, wherein each person thinks and shares a few words. While just sparing 10-15 minutes from your day, these standups keep information flowing and the group engaged. After building a team, it’s time to audit the right RPO strategy through real-time metrics and business intelligence tools. Then you may commit to making changes at the team or RPO level, as well as at the corporate or client level. Shorten job titles to reduce applicant discomfort, conduct job title audits, and make titles and job descriptions ""short and sweet"" to match the phrases job seekers search for (usually three words or fewer) on job boards to increase application rates. Adopt more agile project management tools that are available in abundance today. Many applications claim to make team communication and collaboration easier and more efficient, but not all of them will work for your team. It is critical to test multiple solutions to determine what works best and is most cost-effective for managing your agile recruitment efforts. HR professionals find it tough to keep up with industry innovation. With budgets tightening, even the most ambitious businesses may be hesitant to invest hundreds of thousands or even millions of pounds or dollars on talent acquisition technology. RPO firms engage in cutting-edge technology on a regular basis to guarantee that their clients have the talent they need to thrive, from high-tech VMS systems to data analysis tools. Final Thoughts All the aforementioned processes would be accomplished utilizing a sprint structure in an agile recruitment setting. Each would be treated as a small, incremental project with kickoff, execution, and reflection via stand-ups and post-mortems. Agile recruitment delivers a wide range of benefits for hiring teams as a consequence of this dedication to feedback and incremental improvement. As previously said, agile recruitment may and will be used in a variety of ways, based on your organization's goals and resources. If you're looking for methods to apply the agile recruitment technique to your organization, there are a number of online courses and tools that might help. An agile RPO is the key to boosting the productivity and effectiveness of your recruitment team. Surely it will take some trial and error to figure out which strategy will take your recruitment game to the next level, but agile is an excellent place to start. Take some time with your team to try out some of these ideas and see where you flourish!

20,The Three Managerial Types that Will Make You Want to Walk Out the Door—and What to Do About It,social-issues," We’ve all had a manager who made us feel like we wanted to walk out the door. For example: your manager assigned you a project that—if she would have taken one sip from the cup of reality—there would have been no way you could have completed the project by the deadline. Or: your manager talked about improving company culture all the time, but yet clearly demonstrated that he didn’t have the slightest clue how to do that himself. If this rings true for you, then this is your read today! Over my career, I have had some horrible managers. Now that I know what I know, I realize that those bad managers just simply did not have the tools they needed to be effective. As I write this, I can hear my mother say, “Bless their little hearts.”  But I would venture to say—because you are still reading—you have had some similar experiences. Either that, or your refresh button is not working properly. In any case, I’d like to share what I’ve learned. Simply put, the workforce today is full of occupiers. What is an occupier? Occupiers are people who exist in a certain position, but they don't know--or have true purpose in--why they are there. They are really just sitting ducks. And what happens when you don't feel like you have a strong purpose? You simply assign yourself one. And that purpose can look a lot more like an agenda. The interesting thing about assigning yourself an agenda is that we generally assign ourselves something that we can easily meet—or control—because a challenge would put us to a real test. And that can be scary. Just ask the person who sets a New Year's resolution to not eat sweets and then purchases Oreos on January 2nd, as a symbol of never going back to chocolate. Somehow, this person devours a whole row of Oreos while binge watching episodes of Little House on the Prairie. Darn you, Mrs. Olsen! Laura did not steal candy from your store! I’m writing from personal experience here. But I digress. Here’s another example. What about the person who purchases a gym membership, and then, while watching TV (instead of working out), gets angry at the gym membership commercials, as if they are passive aggressive subliminal messages directed towards him, because he hasn’t set foot in the gym all month? Ouch. That’s me again. But the point is: many people don't see their personal challenges all the way through. And becoming a good manager means that you’ll see the process of development to the very end. Bad managers often seek to control what is on the surface, which manifests as nit picking and micromanaging of minuscule tasks. These bad managers most often fall into three categories: Clock Watchers, Error Finders, and “I already showed you how to do that one time-ers.” Let’s start with the Clock Watchers. Clock Watchers manage what they think is easiest to control. They focus on when you get to work, how long you stay on break, and when you leave. Of course time management is important, but if this is the only focus of employee performance—with no emphasis on productivity—there is a problem. When it comes to supervision objectives, Clock Watchers don’t seem to have a good depth of understanding about employee productivity. Clock Watchers focus on time because it is easy—and yes, it is evaluative—but it ignores product creation, which is central to the purpose of the organization. Clock watching as a management style disrupts employees’ ability to participate in a creative process that would produce the overall organizational output objectives. The question that should be asked of Clock Watchers is: Do you have the capacity to manage the production that is happening each work day, as well as the employees’ life cycle? Next, there are the Error Finders. These managers are quite interesting, because what Error Finders see in their employees is themselves. The employee is a mirror to the Error Finder. The only way Error Finders would ever feel managerial worth is to find flaws in every little detail, in order to build their own importance to a point of relevance—almost like a medicine—to make them feel better. Generally, you see this play out in Error Finders bringing unnecessary or displaced critique when not warranted. For example, an Error Finder will call attention to things such as an “an” in a DRAFT document in front of a vowel, instead of an “a.” Clearly, they have completely overlooked the content to see the flaw, and their critique is a feeble attempt to express power. In this situation, I can hear my mother say, “Child, please.” Another Error Finder example would go like this: Perhaps you stumbled over a word in a presentation, and all your manager could focus on was that one stumble--even though the rest of your content was delivered very well. A classic hallmark of the Error Finder comes forth at staff meetings, when other people have signed on to the agenda to discuss important points. Throughout the meeting, the Error Finder will dominate—and end up being the only one talking. These managers want to be in control of errors, so they can put the superhero cape on and fly to rescue, as if they are not responsible for the whole operation. If it is not clear at this point, Error Finders have some serious problems. And in my opinion, out of the three, this managerial type can give a devastating blow to an organization’s turnover metric. Even worse, employees working under the Error Finder suffer some real post-traumatic effects. Finally, we get to the “I already showed you how to do that one time-ers.” These managers lack patience and empathy with training information. In their minds, having to repeat processes indicates a lack of intelligence, and they use subtle fear and intimidation tactics to deter additional inquires. Thus, that is the reason they want to bully you by saying, “I showed you how to do that already.” These managers are known to say, “I learned it on my own, and nobody really showed me how to do it.” So they think you should magically know what to do. It’s basically the “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” mentality—but on steroids. These managers are culture killers. The reason they are so negative and safeguarded with the information they give is that they don't understand the process—or how to execute it—themselves. The sad part is that they would show you how to do it, gladly, if they knew how to do it! Instead, they rely on the protection of their title as “manager” to keep them safe. As Bruce Coville wrote, “Withholding information is the essence of tyranny. Control of the flow of information is the tool of dictatorships.” So that wrath—or that urge to walk out the door—that you are feeling is actually your incapable manager’s own inability to demonstrate competency in the area he is training you in. Most people—and good managers, especially—understand that there are multiple learning styles, and that someone might not comprehend all information by being shown something once. However, when the person training you has minimum depth herself, you can almost guarantee that what she has to give you will be what she can control. More often than not, what she can control is her attitude. So attitude is what she gives you. All three poor management scenarios above have one thing in common: a lack of capacity. Webster’s Dictionary defines capacity as the “ability to contain or deal with something; mental or physical power.” And it takes capacity to lead. A leader who has demonstrated capacity understands that it is important to properly train, evaluate, and monitor information for productivity. If there are employee deficiencies, a manager with capacity will monitor said deficiencies and develop a growth plan for the employee, to foster professional development. Remember, the bottom line in the workplace is respect—employees for managers and managers for employees. When people don’t feel respected in the workplace, especially by their managers, low productivity will inevitably follow. Managers who aren’t leading with their employees’ creativity, individual learning style, and sense of personal agency in mind are doomed to create a toxic work environment in which employees cannot thrive. And employees who do not feel respected should probably reconsider whether that job is the right place for them. Whether you do decide to stay or leave, hopefully you can find the courage to talk to someone in upper management about your difficulties. Many times, the managers described above have polished their facades so well that upper management is unaware of their deficiencies. Take a moment ask for help, know your chain of command, and understand how to use it. Even if it is your first day."

1,Win the War in Ukraine Using Hybrid All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs),social-issues," The Problem Initially, Russia thought they could invade Ukraine with superior manpower and equipment and take control of the country in a few days.  Instead, they encountered a trained Ukrainian army equipped with advanced weapons such as Stinger missiles to defend their airspace and Javelin missiles to defend their ground.  Furthermore, the Ukrainian people exhibited a strong will to fight.  As a result, Russia’s initial thrust was impeded, and they suffered heavy casualties. Due to these high initial casualties, Russia quickly changed its strategy to the one used for thousands of years: surround a city, bombard it, and prevent critical food, water, energy, and rearmament supplies from entering.  That is what Russia is doing today.  They bomb and shell a Ukrainian city from afar with airstrikes and ground artillery.  They stop critical supplies from reaching a besieged Ukrainian city.  Once a city surrenders, Russian military forces move to the next city and repeat the process.  Russia plans to have fewer casualties and effectively utilize its superior troop and equipment strengths with this strategy. Given Putin’s mindset to win at all costs, Russia’s new strategy of surrounding cities, cutting supplies, and bombing and shelling cities into submission will probably and eventually lead to Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.  Due to the fierce resistance by the Ukrainians to the Russian invasion, the cities are expected to be severely damaged, and considerable civilian and military casualties are expected as well. Even though Russia may shortly occupy Ukraine, many people believe that Putin will eventually lose the war due to a long-term insurgency by the Ukrainians and stiff sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its European allies.  Unfortunately, the reinstatement of Ukraine as an independent state may take years to happen under this scenario. This forecast outcome is expected to come at a high cost to Ukraine, with bombed-out cities and significant civilian and military casualties.  However, it does not have to be this way. A New Strategy to Fight the Russians Ukraine needs to go on the offensive to break Russia’s stranglehold on its encircled cities.  The following is a suggested strategy for the defense of Ukraine. The U.S. and its European allies would supply the Ukrainians with All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs), initially gas-powered ATVs but with hybrid gas/electric ATVs, as soon as possible.  The hybrid ATVs would have the advantage of being quiet in electric mode for sneak attacks.  The hybrid ATVs would also emit no heat to reduce potential Russian heat-seeking missile attacks.  Furthermore, they could be charged with solar panels when gasoline is in short supply or when hiding in the country.  In addition, some ATVs would have racks installed for holding either Stinger, Javelin, or Guided missiles. In addition, the U.S. and its European allies would supply the Ukrainians with the Stinger, Javelin, and Guided missiles to load onto their ATVs, night vision goggles, AK-47 assault rifles with plenty of ammunition, GPS locators, and Starlink for communication as well as solar panels for remote charging of the hybrid ATVs and Starlinks. Surveillance drones could also be supplied to locate Russian forces for a future attack.  In this way, the Ukrainians would be prepared to take the offensive with their fully equipped ATVs. Some of the Ukrainian forces would leave the cities and hide in the country in small patrols, numbering about five per patrol.  An ATV in each patrol would carry either a Javelin, Stinger, or Guided missile launcher as well as their respective missiles.  Another ATV would have Starlink and GPS guidance systems.  The remaining three ATVs would be riding shotgun with AK-47 assault rifles. Consider the following example of an operation targeting a Russian artillery installation.  First, U.S. satellites would pinpoint Russian artillery exact GPS coordinate locations.  Next, a Ukrainian patrol would be given the GPS coordinates over their Starlink communication devices.  Alternatively, the Russian target could be found by using the patrol's surveillance drone.  Then using the patrol’s GPS locator or knowing its location from drone operations, the patrol would sneak up within a mile of the Russian artillery position.  Finally, when the artillery is firing and producing heat, the patrol would take it out with a heat-seeking Javelin missile.  The patrol would then quickly sneak away and hide.  With night vision goggles, this operation could be done day or night.  The rest of the patrol could defend with their AK-47 assault rifles in the case of a possible Russian small arms fire. The same tactic discussed above could be employed for Russian tanks and vehicles moving troops and supplies when a heat signature is available for Javelin missile guidance.  For troop encampments with no heat for missile guidance, guided ground-to-ground missiles using U.S. satellite-provided GPS coordinates could be used to sneak up, fire, and sneak away, day or night.  Whenever Russian aircraft are in the area, Stinger missiles could be fired to bring them down. In addition, ATVs could be used with trailers to supply hidden ATV patrols in the country with new missiles, fuel, food, and water. Separate Javelin, Stinger, and Guided missile patrols could be employed in the proximate area to each other.  Together they would form an ATV battalion, quick to move from hiding to attack and back into hiding.  They would never take a Russian force head-on; they would only make fast, devasting hit-and-run attacks. Suppose the Russians have not surrounded a Ukrainian city.  The city’s military could be supplied directly by the U.S. and NATO with ATVs, Javelin, Stinger, Guided missiles, night goggles, GPS locators, AK-47s, drones, solar panels, and Starlinks.  On the other hand, if a city has already been surrounded, the Ukrainian military fully equipped ATV battalions from a non-surrounded city could open a supply channel to the besieged city to provide critical supplies. By taking the offensive, Ukraine's cities could be spared from being destroyed and a vast number of military and civilian lives saved.  The winning strategy is to create a hard-hitting, fast-moving, hidden mobile military force using hit-and-run tactics with equipped ATVs with excellent communication and lethal firepower.  This new strategy could win the war for Ukraine in short order if employed quickly and in large numbers. The author wishes for this information to get into the hands of the U.S. government or military officials who can take immediate action.  If the reader knows someone who can help, pass this post.  If not, post it to people you know.  Maybe some of them may know someone who can help.  Time is of the essence; Ukrainian lives depend on it."
2,"The Church, The State and The Ukraine",social-issues," The Church, The State, and The Ukraine By Karl Keranen 3/11/2001 'Fanaticism is a drug. Let loose on society, it’s like crack cocaine or alcohol, only worse. Fanatics drive through life like alcoholics driving under the influence. They think they're perfectly fine driving. They kill innocent bystanders, sometimes by the thousands or millions. A religious war is justified because of religious differences;. Philosophical or religious differences may instigate a conflict, although not the only cause of all religious war. Wars are promoted by leaders who are driven to interfere with other cultures, destroy humanity's progress, and retard the development of their own civilization to maintain control. They gather power to themselves and convince their followers their visions of manifest destiny, which is ordained by God, are justified in the name of religious righteousness. The Crusades were a series of military campaigns organized by Christian powers to retake Jerusalem and the Holy Land back from Muslim control. There would be eight officially sanctioned crusades between 1095 CE and 1270 CE and many more unofficial ones. In the city of Jerusalem, which was ruled over by the Muslims, all religions, including Christianity, had dwelled in the city for hundred of years, and all we're accepted and all lived in peace. Yes, the last sentence sounds like the starting of a Monty Python and the Holy Grail skit, but they were all doing quite well until the knights arrived, unfortunately. Eight hundred years later in America, in the land of the free and the brave and the marginalized, due to religious conflicts, on August 6. 1838, about 200 people attempted to forcibly prevent Latter-day Saints from voting in the newly created county's first election. Due to a series of subsequent skirmishes between the county and the state militia, on October 27, 1838, the Governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs, issued the Missouri Executive Order 44, commonly known as the Mormon Extermination Order. This order led to the massacre of men, women, and children at Haun's mill in 1838. As a result of the massacre, 17 Mormon men women and children died, and 70 families left the settlement under a warrant of death. In our modern time, issues regarding religious plaints can still be an issue in the midst of a war between religious and ethnic groups. Below I have same simplistically stated currently occurring in our time. Israel is the world’s only Jewish state, located just east of the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians, the Arab population that hails from the land Israel now controls, refer to the territory as Palestine; Both believe that Jerusalem is there a holy city, and both feel they have been unrighteously intruded upon by the other. Nigeria, Since the restoration of democracy in 1999, Christian governments have dominated the country at the federal level, while the Muslim-dominated Northern Nigerian states have implemented strict Sharia law. Religious conflict between Muslims and Christians has erupted several times since 2000. Sudan's conflict began in 2003 when rebels launched an insurrection to protest what they contended was the Sudanese government's disregard for the western region and its non-Arab population. In response, the government equipped and supported Arab militia. The militias, however, also terrorized the civilians in the region and prevented international aid organizations from delivering much-needed food and medical supplies. I have read multiple articles researching this article, and there are consistent themes that are repeat regarding the Russian Orthodox Church. They were Authoritarianism, anti-ecumenicalism, intolerance, antisemitism, religious territory, duplicity, manipulation, and desire for money and power. The Russian Orthodox Church's history is one of self-preservation, which has shaped a culture of mistrust. The goal of the church is to hold onto power and promote cultural identity. Power is considered by the ROC a tool of survival that must be skillfully used for the sake of self-preservation. The most famous ROC practitioner was Rasputin. Rasputin was a Siberian-born muzhik, or peasant, who as a teenager converted to the ROC, and then proclaimed himself a healer with the ability to predict the future. He gained the favor of Czar Nicholas II and Czarina Alexandra by stopping the bleeding of their hemophiliac son, Alexei, in 1908. Before Rasputin's murder, he was dubbed the silent ruler. His power over Tsar Nicholas was evident when he convinced Tsar Nicholas to take personal control over his armies on Aug. 23, 1915, under his advice; Nicholas became the target of blame for Russia's battlefield defeats. After the red revolution, the Russian Orthodox Church was persecuted and marginalized until a deal was struck with Joseph Stalin. In 1943, Patriarch Sergius struck a deal with Joseph Stalin to change the policies of the state towards the church and the position of the church towards the state. The church became a supporter of the Kremlin and all the policies and policymakers. After Sergio's death in 1944, Elections were held to elected a new Patriarch, Alexius I,. After the election of Alexius I, theological monasteries were allowed to teach, and thousand of new churches we able to flourish. Alexius I died in 1970, and Alexius II was elected and continued to guide the expansion of the church through the resolving of the Soviet Union. In 2007 Patriarch Alexey II efforted a reuniting of the Russian Eastern Orthodox Church and Constantinople. Alexey II was successful in reuniting the churches, and canonical communion was restored between the Russian Orthodox Church and the church outside Russia. The current Russian Orthodox Church’s Patriarch Krill, was elected in 2009. Patriarch Krill shared a common vision with Aleksey II (reigned 1990–2008) and believes that the church should play a dynamic role in Russian life. Aleksey II work reuniting with Constantinople that was undon when October 11th., 2018 the synod meeting in Constantinople formally recognized the new Ukraine Kiev Metropolitan Orthodox Church. The UKMOC was now a separate autonomous church no longer under the Russian Orthodox Church. This Infuriated Patriarch Krill. Patriarch Krill called Kiev Metropolitan Church fake, a false church, and it should not exist. In October 2018 the Russian Orthodox Church severed its ties with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the honorary primacy of Eastern Orthodoxy, after the latter approved the independence of an autocephalous church of Ukraine; Bartholomew I, formally recognized the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine from the Russian Orthodox Church in January 2019. To understand Russia’s, the ROC, and the war in Ukraine, you must accept through the decades the ROC blended with the militaristic nationalism of the Soviet Union. Putin believes that the greatest catastrophic event of the 20th century was the devolving of the Soviet Union. 2020, on full display, Krill, Putin, and the Military Elite dedication the Church of the Russian Armed Forces Cathedral. The massive, khaki-colored cathedral, which is in a military theme park, celebrates Russian might. Conceived by the Russian defense minister after the country’s illegal annexation of the Crimea in 2014. The cathedral embodies the powerful ideology espoused by President Vladimir Putin, with strong support from the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Krill, as reported by the media, is aligned with the state's vision, which becomes a powerful pairing to encourage the population to give their lives for a cause. Since the invasion of Russia into Ukraine, Patriarch Kirill described the conflict as part of a struggle against sin and pressure from liberal foreigners to hold “gay parades” as the price of admission to their ranks. This last Sunday, March 6th., Russian Orthodox Patriarch Krill endorsed Putin’s narrative on Ukraine in a sermon. According to him, the West essentially organizes a genocide campaigns against countries that refuse to stage gay parades. I believe the State, Primer Putin is following the lead of Patriarch Krill just as most of the religious followers of Russia do. Patriarch Krill is in control of hundreds of millions of Russians. Patriarch Krill’s social and political power runs deep in his culture. Marx said that 'Religion is the opiate of the masses’, although I don’t think he thought the most powerful man in Russia to wheeled such control would be a religious man. Cultures that have advocated their self-will to religion and the state, become the harbinger of potential energy, which can be directed towards destroying perceived rivals at the direction of the leader. The Russian culture is so intertwined with the Orthodox Church that a curious new church has been dedicated on the outskirts of Moscow on June 2020; The Main Church of the Russian Armed Forces. The massive cathedral located in a military theme park celebrates Russian might. It was originally planned to open on the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in May 2020. Unfortunately, it was delayed due to the pandemic. The Kremlin's vision of Russia connects the state, military, and the Russian Orthodox Church in a holy trinity. I believe militant religious nationalism is one of the elements in Krills and Putin's motivation for the invasion of Ukraine. It also goes a long way in explaining Moscow's behavior toward the collective ""West"" and the post-Cold War world order. Putin still blames the west with a dissolving of the Soviet Union. According to the official website, ""the church was designed in a monumental Russian style, organically incorporating modern architectural approaches, and innovations unique to the Russian Orthodox church creation."" The façades of the building are finished with metal; the arches are glazed. The walls of the church, decorated with murals, include battle scenes from Russian military history, and Bible scripture texts. Stained glass mosaics in the cathedral's vault feature various Red Army orders, accompanied by their respected ribbons that denote their class. Many of these orders display the faces of prominent military leaders from the ‘Imperial Russian Army’. The decision to include some of the most revered Orthodox Christian saints, who had served in the historical armies of Russia, coincides with the Soviet Union's brief wave of nationalism during the Great Patriotic War. Included is the September 5th, 1943, historic meeting in the Moscow Kremlin took place between Metropolitan Alexius and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. After the meeting, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union allowed the Orthodox Church to legally function and operate after experiencing nearly two decades of severe oppression. Many churches began to reopen across the Soviet Union. The floors of the cathedral are metal. The metal has come from the melting down of Nazi trophies, weapons, and tanks that were seized from Wehrmacht forces. As visitors walk across the floors of the cathedral, it is intended to symbolize ""delivering a blow to the fascist enemy."" The war at Hand: What type of war is this? Could the type determine how it will end? I am proposing the war has been caused by hurt feeling. The unjustly perceived demotion of Patriarch Krill by Bartholomew I. Patriarch Krill and Premier Putin (Putin being Patriarch Krills Paladin) truly believe they are justified because their beliefs agree with their actions. If the ends justify the means, then this war will not end well for all involved. All and any actions are justified, and all through the war any weapon used is lawful. I am reminded by a quote from CS Lewis' ""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated, but those who torment us for our good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their conscience."" This quote examines the depth the mind can justify the righteousness of its actions, blind to the great suffering cast on others. This is the dark side of philosophy that agrees only with itself to the exclusion of foreign thought. For us to determine if there could be a softening of Krill and Putin's position, we need to better understand the basic goal of the conflict. The label Genocide has been bantered around, so we will look at this word to see if it is the end to a means. Genocide is trained, and it is something ordinary people do with proper ""training"" via cognitive restructuring and social conditioning. The act of killing for genocidal purposes is not a distinct category of human behavior. Instead, genocidal killing demonstrates the potential of ordinary people manipulated by proper exposure to the right teachings until they escalate into violence, but only under certain conditions. One of the major mysteries in studying both the occurrence of and prevention is understanding what makes ""normal"" cognitive processes, both on the individual and collective levels, vulnerable to manipulation by outsiders. Social and political conditions provide a breeding ground for that manipulation to turn violent. Patriarch Krill on Sunday the 6th. Of march 2022 seemed to know that mentioning gay pride parades and tying it with the west liberal ideals would rally his congregants to support the invasion of Ukraine. Using archetypes in the Bible, we can deduce that this is a fight between good and evil since there has been a correlation now presented to the congregants. It may turn out to be like many of the stories in the Bible, where genocide does occur. So religious ideology may be an element of this war, but will it lead to genocide? By all definitions it possibly could. If nothing is done to persuade Russia from this thinking process, we could see something such as the Circassian genocide but much quicker. Circassia is an area along the coast of the Black Sea in Russia that the Tsarist Empire visited and saw as a strategic necessity. Russia waged war against the Circassians for a century, with more than 90% of the nation being annihilated or deported. According to some historians, this was the largest genocide of the 19th century. With up to 1.5 million Circassians being killed and exiled. Ivan Drozdov, a Russian officer who witnessed the scene at Qbaada in May 1864 as the other Russians were celebrating their victory, remarked: ""On the road, our eyes were met with a staggering image: corpses of women, children, elderly persons, torn to pieces and half-eaten by dogs; deportees emaciated by hunger and disease, almost too weak to move their legs, collapsing from exhaustion and becoming prey to dogs while still alive."" — Drozdov, Ivan. ""Posledniaia Bor’ba s Gortsami na Zapadnom Kavkaze"". Pages 456-457. So what we have explored should give us pause to think. We walked through the idea that this is more of a religious war, than a grab for territory, or political differences, or cultural differences. I have concluded the events we are seeing transpire in Europe are caused by the pride of a few men, whom only see other men as tools to satisfy their feelings of inadequacy; Set up by almost 70 years of Soviet influence, and the morphing of the Russian Orthodoxy to fit the Soviet mold. Unfortunately, there is only one way I see this ending unless Krill and Putin come to their senses. I think history will repeat itself. Dr. Jeremy Sherman stated 'Fanaticism is a drug. Let loose on society. It's like crack cocaine or alcohol, only worse. Fanatics drive through life like alcoholics driving under the influence. They think they're perfectly fine driving. They kill innocent bystanders, sometimes by the thousands or millions.” So how does the was peeder out. According to Genocidewatch.com, there are ten identifiers of Genocide. These identifiers have been studied, talked about, officially made part of the United Nations studies, although never acted upon upstream to prevent any genocide from occurring since their adoption in the 1980s. Politicians have always been apprehensive of stating that something is a genocide during a military action. If the United Nations did by their charter that what Russia is doing was a genocide, then they would have to intervene and risk U.N. Peace Keepers. The fear of acting and risking people's lives to help the disadvantaged has always been a stumbling block because all nations see their soldiers, or citizens, as more valuable than those who are being persecuted. During the Genocide in Rwanda, a whole regamond of Marines off the coast could’ve gone in and stopped the Genocide when it started. Still, it was deemed not a valid conflict by the United Nations and by the United States government to interfere with. To risk armies and resources for someone else is not something governments do, even for the smallest genocides, because no one has the stomach for trying to be valiant, although the concept is fun to think about. So is this war a genocide? Unfortunately, we will probably only know after it’s over; and after the Ukrainians weaken Russia to NATOs liking. The world will start to turn over rocks and decide it should go to the courts. Then the courts and the lawyers will argue intent, and Genocide, and was Genocide the intent for the war, or did it just occur by chance. Unfortunately, it’s going to be rendered down to being a legal definition. It doesn’t matter how many people are murdered; the world will keep clutching its pearls, saying how horrible this is! Everyone will keep giving the Ukrainians bullets, grenades, and hand held missiles, so they can die for their country, because it is the right easy thing to do. So see you in court."
3,Antivid-22: The Ultimate Rebellion,social-issues," 'Everything that you are about to read is going to happen.' -A single sonic sound Canadian truckers and their buddies brought down the nightmare that had taken over their country.  Every lawless restriction was dropped: no more masks or lockdowns, no more vaccine passports and, especially, no more vaccine mandates; the violation of human rights ended.  All the elected officials who had committed war crimes, including their leader Fidel Castro’s son Big Trudy (Justin Trudeau) were exposed to the world and prosecuted and dealt with accordingly, Torquemada reversed without passion and without mercy.  Then the dominoes were stopped from falling and turned back the other way, to fall against the New Axis of Evil. American truck drivers and all the blue collar men and women and children, patriots them all, rose up against their own tyrannical government and dispatched with extreme prejudice the terrorist groups in Antifa and Black Lives Matter.  The police and military stepped aside appearing neutral, by the law, as the soy boys and bedwetters and keyboard warriors were hammered into the earth.  The government was overthrown and thus it was discovered that Donald Trump had, indeed, won the 2020 election.  Righteously did the trumpets blare his return to the White House.  And China tucked its tail between its legs. All over the world, similar events took place, with the 99% waking up and revolting against the 1% who, it turns out, were not as smart as they thought they were.  All the supposedly elected regimes, puppets for China and the Global Elite, were replaced with Maxime “Mad Max” Bernier in Canada, Don “The Donald” Trump in the United States, and similar people placed in power in other nations returned to liberty.  Even Russia teamed up with our heroes. Meanwhile, in places like the WHO and the banks and Big Tech and the corporations, with all the mainstream media shills indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions, time had run out.  For all those in power who had abused it, time had run out.  The Nuremberg Code and the Geneva Convention and karma came calling. And the Antichrist, without the steps in place for Rapture, just simply went away without consequence, which kept the Middle East from unifying, kept the sands from burning.  There was no need for alien annihilation. The entire planet was awakened like Sleeping Beauty and her kingdom from the black charm of fear that had allowed the New Perfectibilists to write into existence their own Amorality Play.  In that light, final stage their dreams were victory and, waking up, vanquished was the pain and the anxiety.  No more tears only merciful sleep and the people, the common folk got their freedoms back along with all the doctors and scientists, awakening themselves and recoiling violently at what they had done, quickly figured out a cure for the virus vaccines and the word vaccine was again defined by what it was.  Gaia and her animals joined these people in a grand celebration.  The 99% were mostly unaware that they had changed the alignment of the stars. The world no longer danced to the strings of the richest and most powerful puppetmasters in the world. Globalism, that New Axis of Evil, the people behind the curtains at Bohemian Grove, the 1% of the 1%: George Soros, Klaus Schwab, the Five Families like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and still others like Bill Gates and the Obamas; what of them?  What happened to the Neo Sun Cult?  And of their shadowy, pre-human superiors, what of their fate?  Well, remember when we told you that the Antichrist came and went without consequence. . .that wasn’t entirely true.  At their next blasphemous Sabbath, in some dark corner of the earth, they held their greatest ceremony.  Opening doors they could not shut, summoning beings they could not control into circles that, in the anxiety that had been turned back upon them, they did not accurately trace.  They were found clawed and bitten to shreds, burned as though touched by Vulcan, frozen as if blessed by Asgard, gassed unto a bloated corpulence and injected with endless venoms that took their time.  The instability of ever-shifting winds and changing molecules was theirs as was the empty mockery of enough.  With feces and urine in their eyes and mouth they were found twisted and contorted, not from their perverse, unspeakable rites but because they had had their souls blasted from them.  And those with no soul knew the torment of Limbo’s Eclipse while those that had not attended were chased down like prey by cosmic hounds, and found in a similar manner all over the world. The humans had all learned sooner that those in charge must be mocked eternal.  They had, as it will be done and with unknown demon assistance, made life on earth Abaddon for the Globalists who got no break, not even in death did the sweetness of oblivion come to them, only the endless torture of the 9th Layer of Hell. The Lord of Light had come calling and he left these words for the people: “You must always give hell to the damned.”"
4,"To: The Brookings Institute, Subject: Eliminating Poverty, Racism, & War",social-issues," CC: Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, Economic Policy Institute, American Enterprise Institute, Aspen Institute, Center for American Progress, RAND Corporation, as well as any and all other DC based Economic Think Tanks who are interested in this subject Dear Brookings Institute, I’m a Board Member of an Arlington, VA based not for profit group called the Center for Economic and Social Justice (WWW.CESJ.ORG). The main purpose of CESJ is to advocate on behalf of an ownership based, free market orientation to the economy known either as the Economic Democracy Act (EDA) or Universal Basic Ownership (UBO). The members of our group contend that the USA could solve a myriad of problems, starting with poverty and structural racism, by making every American (regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or political persuasion) an owner of wealth producing capital assets. Furthermore, we contend that these goals could be achieved without creating a dime of governmental or consumer debt. Implementing the EDA strategy would actually allow us to start paying down our exponentially growing (now over $30 trillion-dollar) national debt. The Conventional Scenario… More specifically, the Federal Reserve makes an annual assessment of how much money will be required to fund the following year’s economic growth. For example, in 2018 they estimated that our economic growth would require approximately $4 trillion dollars-worth of funding in 2019. So, where does all that money come from? Conventionally it comes from the wealthy class – those who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, and technologies that represent this annual growth. 2019 was no exception. Most of that projected growth was funded (purchased, owned, and controlled) by fewer than 10% of Americans. Thus wealth/ power became increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few (10%) at the expense of the many (90%). Now Let’s Reshuffle the Cards With those thoughts in mind, let’s look at this scenario through a different lens. If you divide $4 trillion dollars by 330 million (people in the US), you’ll find that about $12,000 per individual was going to be required to fund America’s economic growth of 2019. Now what if the Federal Reserve (as authorized by the Federal Reserve Act, section 13, paragraph 2), through local banks, had made an ANNUAL $10,000 (round numbers are easier to work with) line of credit at 0% interest, accessible to every citizen, regardless of age, gender, race, or political persuasion? Furthermore, what if these lines of credit COULD ONLY BE USED to buy stocks in qualified business ventures (meaning the odds of these investments paying off the annual loans with pre-tax dividends – FUTURE EARNINGS not past savings - in 3 to 7 years are excellent)? And what if, as these annual, self-liquidating loans continue to PAY THEMSELVES OFF, the dividends continue to flow and they become investment income for their new capital owners? Instantly Collateralized As you can see, all these transactions would be collateralized the moment a purchase was made. They’d also be 100% capital credit insured. In other words, nobody – not the government or the individual investor is on the hook - even if a supposedly sound investment failed to live up to expectations. A proverbial win/win for everyone concerned. And since in this strategy production always precedes consumption, inflation is systematically abolished. The Democratizing Potential… The democratizing potential inherent in making every American citizen an owner of wealth producing capital assets is what allows CESJ members to contend that we can eliminate the economic roots of poverty, structural racism, and war without creating any debt, while simultaneously paying down the national debt in the process. That said, if you see flaws in our logic, we’d appreciate you pointing them out so we can make the appropriate adjustments. On the other hand, if you see no flaws, we like to suggest a meeting in order to explore how to best go about implementing the EDA/UBO strategy ASAP! Respectfully, Rick Osbourne Board Member Center for Social and Economic Justice (CESJ.ORG) 630-857-3502 Osbourne.rick@gmail.com"
5,Do the Government’s climate objectives really matter? Yes! But not to them.,social-issues," Do the Government’s climate objectives really matter? Yes! But not to them. Before I start this article I would like to foreshadow for you its following contents much like Shakespeare at the beginning of Romeo and Juliet. Although I don't foreshadow two star crossed lovers taking their lives, I do say the Government's distant relationship with the climate emergency could spell an unfortunate Romeo and Juliet type ending. Trees. Those things we walk past every now and again. Quite pleasant I hope you agree. There is not much debate as to whether they are good for the environment either. Don't just take my word for it. The woodland trust called trees ``Our biggest weapon in the fight against climate change”. They would say that but relevant nonetheless. In fact a flight from London to Paris would require 0.4 of a tree to offset the carbon emissions released by the plane according to the best known C02 emissions calculator. In addition 400+ tonnes carbon per hectare, is how much a young wood with mixed native species can lock up in trees, roots and soil. Effective If you ask me. So what is the Government doing about this? Well last year the Government planted 4.2million trees, something Boris Johnson if asked about would call a fantastic achievement. However, as ambitious and great as this sounds, the Government’s target is to plant 30 million trees every year ( 4.2 million is less than 14% of their target). However we really shouldn't be surprised. Especially with the Conservatives track record. In their 2019 manifesto they outlined their ambitions which included insulating all homes to level C by 2030. To do this the government will have to insulate One million homes a year however only 110,000 homes had been insulated last year. Hence sparking the ‘Insulate Britain’ protests. Not only would Insulating One million homes a year help in our fight against climate change, It would also have helped people pay their bills due to the insulation reducing the cost of bills. Don't just take my word for it, listen to Chris Stark, head of the UK's Climate Change Committee telling the BBC that he rates government policy on insulation as ""very poor"". Having said all this I am not blind to the fact that the world has faced a global pandemic. I appreciate many things have been put on hold. Nevertheless climate change unfortunately won't stop for us, and the lack of action whether the government has ignored their climate change goals or prioritised their mess of a pandemic response may and probably will contribute to the staying below 1.5 degrees as a distant memory, a thing of the past, a missed opportunity. Are we entirely surprised though at the lack of urgency? It is Boris leading the Conservatives after all. Why shouldn't this surprise us? Although I believe strongly that a person can change, I believe the individual has to prove it by showing how they have changed. I say this because in 2013 writing for the Telegraph the PM said “As a species, we human beings have become so blind with conceit and self-love that we genuinely believe that the fate of the planet is in our hands — when the reality is that everything, or almost everything, depends on the behaviour and caprice of the gigantic thermonuclear fireball around which we revolve.” On top of this Boris Johnson found himself agreeing with conspiracy theorist Piers Corbyn, brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In 2013 Johnson said in his Telegraph column “Don't write him off”. Yes I know what you're thinking, Boris Johnson our Prime Minister told us not to write off a man who not only believes climate change is a hoax and that vaccines are harmful but also a man who wrote one of the worst songs of our generation comparing wearing a mask to keeping a fart in your trousers. I could riddle this article with multiple Boris Johnson quotes on climate change but I won't bore you. What I can tell you whilst planning for this article is that I could see a lot of the word “but” when he talked about climate change. The now PM would talk about the threat of climate change then constantly downplay the severity of climate change by saying the dreaded word “but”. It's like when your parents would tell you to apologise and you do, before saying “but” and going on to proclaim your innocence. As you can probably guess, my use of the word “but” delegitimised my apology and got me in trouble with my parents. Although the PM isn't apologising it still doesn't fill me with confidence that his self proclaiming of being a strong believer in climate change is true. To reiterate I do believe people can change but Boris Johnson hasn't and I fear he will not. His history of misinformation, his history of caring about no one but himself, his party's lack of ambition will lead to a Romeo and Juliet type ending for our livelihoods and the generations to come."
6,Protect the young ones from sex abuse,social-issues," Protect the young ones from sex abuse A recent debate in social media involving an Ahmadi alleged sex abuse victim and the leadership of Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at (AMJ) has reminded me of my own experiences and observations of sexual abuse in my hometown, Rabwah.  I have personally gone through child sex abuse on several occasions in my childhood in Rabwah.  I have been living with these very disturbing memories for over 40 years.  The sole purpose of sharing these experiences is to create awareness in general public and those authorities who have created an environment that allows such abuse to thrive with impunity.  Furthermore, I would like to discuss the reasons that contribute to child sex abuse in Rabwah. I was only about four years old when I used to go to one of our neighbours home to read Qaida.  Their son who was probably 10 years older than me used to play with my genitals.  I never told any of my elders about any of this.  I can’t remember why. With the fog of time it’s hard for me to remember what was going through my mind back then. It happened again when I was about 7 years old.  This time, it was my own home-a place where I thought I was safe. Alas, that was not true. The perpetrator was my cousin who was 15 years older than me. I was put in bed with him for the night by my own parents-people who I thought would protect me. Why did my parents think that this was a good idea is something I never asked them. As a parent, it’s hard for me to imagine doing anything close to that to my own kids. Sadly, this was not the only time I was asked to sleep with older male relatives. It happened again a few short months later.  My parents never seemed to suspect anything and I never had the courage to tell them, or anyone else, about it. Besides my family, I also observed many other people in positions of authority over young vulnerable children also acting obliviously to their safety.  I have always wondered as to why?  I believe the reasons go beyond individuals like my parents and that there are social structural reasons for the cavalier disregard for the safety of children. Ahmadiyya Muslims Jama’at is a hierarchical organization headed by the Khalifa-who is believed by Ahmadis to be infallible.  Jama’at promotes a culture of full obedience to the Khalifa.  Allegiance to Khalifa is engraved in every child's brain by the parents and by AMJ’s clerics and other intellectuals in religious programs. AMJ’s doctrine clearly states that every office bearer is a Khalifa’s respected representative.  Therefore, compliance to every office bearer’s authority is interpreted as allegiance to the Khalifa himself.  Parents entrust their children to office bearers of the Jama’at who organize many religious-educational and sports events in various neighbourhoods of the town. I am not painting all office bearers with the same brush but some of them happen to be pedophiles just as it happens in other societies.  However, unlike other societies, there are no safety measures for preventing sex abuse at any of the events.  The vulnerable children become easy prey for these pedophiles.  During my stay in Rabwah, I saw firsthand many cases of pedophilia involving Jama’at leaders and minors. This type of hierarchical culture promotes complete obedience by children for all elders especially Jama’at officials. Being reasonably respectful is very different from being servile. This way of grooming completely enfeebles children’s personalities and shatters their confidence.  It was really this culture that encouraged those who sexually abused me when I was young. On all occasions, I was unable to assess the situation and resist the evil approach made by the elders whom I was supposed to obey. Like other orthodox societies, sex is a taboo in AMJ, hence, there is absolutely no education provided on this topic.  Neither parents nor children are aware of the precautions they are supposed to take with respect to an adult and a child contact. Most children are left on their own to learn everything about their sexuality and safety.  In Rabwah, there are many private schools that are operated by the AMJ.  There is no material found in their curriculum in relation with the child sexual safety and training.  Moreover, I have attended AJ’s religious educational events for more than forty years but I have never seen any content regarding sex abuse in their programs.  Children have not even been given a very simple but extremely important lesson of 'good touch' and 'bad touch'.  Not just children but most parents are also ignorant about protecting their children from sex abuse.  On two occasions I mentioned above, I was put in bed with someone 10 to 15 years older than me by my parents.  My parents never gave it a single thought before giving my custody to these family guests for those nights in which I was sexually abused.  How ignorant is this behaviour of my parents? I cannot explain it.  This is not just my story but this practice of putting children in bed with guests was very common there. Ahmadiyya leadership claims to be the only one in the world that is on the right path defined by the divine.  Its followers also believe that and would always be compelled to glorify their affiliation with AMJ.  Any shortcoming such as child sex abuse is overlooked by the leadership as well as the followers.  These people ignore the fact that the little innocent children pay the price for their organization’s deceitful honour.  They continue to hide every sex abuse case and mute the victims.  Very few such cases are reported to the authorities. The community leadership takes no initiatives to hamper this evil practice.  They must understand that the acknowledgment of this issue and solving it would dignify their reputation rather than jeopardize it. Although I could discuss only few factors behind child sex abuse in my community but the fact remains that it is real and it is around us.   It is probably happening in our home or in the family living next door.  It takes little courage to ponder over this very serious issue in our community and address it for the betterment of the little children. However, since the word ‘sex’ has been overly stigmatized in the AMJ, people are so terrified of the consequences they might encounter down the road.  Therefore, they choose to be quiet. I believe we must act now to educate our people and hold the authorities accountable and convince them to adopt children’s safety and security policy at every organizational level. To ensure children’s healthy self-esteem and confidence that is essential for their brain development, we must awaken each and every soul. Just look around and have a glimpse at the innocent faces and feel the pain that their body and soul both might have gone through!"
7,Does God give those in church leadership new revelation?,social-issues," PART 15 CHURCH TEACHINGS 15 TO LEARN ABOUT TEACHINGS THAT EXERCISE AN UNREASONABLE USE OF POWER AUTHORITARIAN DOCTRINES THERE IS NEW REVELATION I believe that this is another topic that is used by leadership to control the assembly. Occasionally, I’ve heard about it from the pulpit, but it’s not something that was frequently talked about. While we briefly looked at this subject briefly earlier, there is so much more to say about it. We’ll begin by asking the following question. What is revelation? I could give you a quick definition of such, but why not rather take a look at it in context and derive the meaning from there? Please go to the book of 1 Corinthians.  1 Corinthians 14:1-12 Apparently, in the Corinthian church, the exercising of the gift of tongues had become a pressing issue. Some were exercising it at various times, whether during prayer, while singing, or when the assembly of believers gathered during worship, without there being an interpreter present. 12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. It was clearly stated by the Apostle Paul that without an interpreter, the church assembly would not receive edification (building up). Therefore, if no interpreter was available, then it was recommended that they prophesy. What is prophesy? Prophesy is proclaiming God’s message. 3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. The purpose of which was to provide edification (to speak what contains doctrine fitted to edify), exhortation (strengthening; encouragement, which can include reproof), and comfort (to remove sadness; to provide comfort and hope). 4 He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. Furthermore, he declared that without an interpreter, whosoever speaks forth the gift of tongues will only edify themselves. 6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? So, if this were to be the case and Paul was to show up in their assembly and bring forth a tongue without an interpreter, then he would rather speak that which would edify, i.e., either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine. The first thing that he mentioned that would edify the church would be a declaration by revelation. What is revelation? The word revelation means the supernatural unveiling of divine truths206 that were previously concealed, unknown, or hidden to the mind. Another way to define revelation is to say that [it’s] the receiving … of truth [particular knowledge and information] from the heart of God [by means of the Holy Spirit] to the heart of the believer,207 which could not be found by means of scientific investigation or human reason. What else would edify the congregation was called knowledge. Knowledge is the supernatural communication of truth that conveys particular knowledge and information to individuals or humanity.208 As for another means of edification, i.e., of prophecy, some commentators believe that this would be comprised of a spoken word proclaimed by a prophet who would interpret it and declare a given revelation. Others would say that this referred to the foretelling of a future event. And finally, doctrine could be classified as Christian instruction, including teaching and learning. Something else to consider about revelation is that some believe there are two types, i.e., natural and supernatural. Natural (general) revelation has to do with God revealing His power and divinity through the course of nature to all men. The other is called supernatural revelation, which has to do with God making known salvation to rescue broken and deformed sinners from their sin and its consequences.209 And by the way, when whatever revealed truths are communicated to others, this is called inspiration. Inspiration secures the teacher or writer infallibility in communicating that truth to others. It renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of God in such a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true.210 Now that we have a better understanding as to what the word revelation means, what would it mean if a leader of a church said that God had given him/her a new revelation; this would be referred to as adding or taking away from Scripture? Let’s find out. What would a new revelation be all about? To get a better idea of what this means, let’s take a look at some Scripture sections. Let’s begin by going to the book of Matthew.  Suggested Reading: Matthew 15:1-9 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. Jesus is in the land of Gennesaret, where the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Him disclosing their displeasure about His disciples. They alleged that they had transgressed the tradition of the elders because they washed not their hands before they ate bread. What they were really saying was, they were accusing Jesus of not teaching His disciples scriptural truth. However, this was not the case. The words tradition of the elders does not refer to a requirement from the Old Testament writings of the Torah. But rather, it refers to the Oral Torah, which was a written collection of Jewish oral traditions. In other words, these were practices that were added by those in positions of authority that had no basis in Scripture, but yet they considered them just as important. 4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. Jesus responded to them by stating what was one of the actual requirements according to the Jewish writings of the Torah, which was to honor thy father and mother. The word Honour not only meant respect and submission but also to take care of a person, to nourish and support him, to enrich.211 If a son had the means to help his destitute parent or parents and chose not to, this was punishable by death according to the Mosaic Law. 5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; Here we ascertain that the religious leaders figured out a way to circumvent this command. They did this by proclaiming the word “corban.” What in the world does this mean? This word denotes a gift. It refers to something dedicated to God. Once a thing such as property of any sort was secured by making a vow in this manner, it could not be used for any other purposes. Deuteronomy 23:21 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. Even though this type of giving something in this manner to God was scriptural according to the Torah, it was not meant to be used to supersede the mandate to honor one’s father and mother. What these Jewish teachers said in effect was that it was more important for a man to dedicate his property to God than to provide for the needs of his [parents].212 Once this property was given in this manner, it could not be taken back to help one’s parents even if financial assistance was requested by them. Another thing that I found interesting was another take-off on this scheme. This referred to the chiefs and priests of a place called the Sandwich Islands. These are located in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Leadership had the power of devoting anything to the service of the gods by saying that it was ""taboo,"" or ""tabooed;"" that is, it became consecrated to the service of religion; and, no matter who had been the owner, it could then be appropriated for no other use. In this way, they had complete power over all the possessions of the people and could appropriate them for their own use under the PRETENCE of devoting them to religion. Thus, they DEPRIVED the people of their property under the plea that it was CONSECRATED to the gods.213 So, Jesus was not saying that no one should give financially to God, but not to use it inappropriately when it interfered with our duty to provide for our parents and family relations; when it was done to get rid of the duty of aiding them; and when it was done out of a malignant and rebellious spirit, with the semblance of piety, to get clear of doing to earthly parents what God required.214 There are a couple of things that we could deduce about what would be considered new revelation. The first would be to say that a new revelation is saying that something needs to be observed or obeyed that is not found in Scripture. It appears to have a godly slant to it but is based on man-made traditions and is imposed on others in the name of God. Second, a new revelation is taking the Word of God and using it inappropriately for personal reasons, i.e., not helping others who need financial assistance; to get back at others; for personal gain) while giving the appearance that what was done was for God’s glory. What else could it mean when someone in leadership says, God has given me a new revelation? Please go to the book of Galatians.  Suggested Reading: Galatians 1:6-8 6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: What constituted the gospel of Christ had become a significant issue at the church of Galatia. The Apostle Paul, when writing to the church there, expressed his surprise at the short duration between the conversion of some by means of the grace of Christ (to participation in the salvation procured by His Son on the [cross], it was on a basis, not of works, but of [salvation] unmerited by them and freely bestowed215) to another gospel (a gospel of legalism which adds work to faith216). 7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. Romans 11:6 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. And then Paul constituted this false gospel as an opposition [gospel,] which was really not an alternative one217 at all. He then identified those who were teaching these untruths. And believe it or not, they were Christians, fellow Jewish Christians, otherwise known as Judaizers, who were disturbing their fellow believers’ mental perception of such by changing the gospel of grace which Paul preached, to the reverse of what it was, a message of salvation by good works. The end of this declaration concluded with what it was that was being perverted, i.e., the gospel of Christ, which [was] otherwise described as the Good News with Christ as the content.218 I hope you caught that. The gospel of Christ was described as that which is with Christ as the content. Nothing is to be added to it or taken from it. This is another example of adding to or taking away from the teachings of God. In this case, we could say that a new revelation is adding information from one dispensation to a scriptural declaration made from another dispensation. This was adding to the gospel of grace for salvation under the Church Age from the gospel of works under the Age of the Jews. Stay in the same book and go to chapter 3. Galatians 3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Not only did the Apostle Paul have an issue with the Galatians concerning salvation but also another important issue that needed to be addressed, and that had to do with their spiritual growth. He questioned them, Are ye so foolish (irrational)? having begun in the Spirit (of the initial entrance of the Holy Spirit into the hearts of the Galatian Christians when they put their trust in the Lord Jesus219), are you now made perfect (the state of spiritual maturity) by the flesh? (by means of self-effort) in an attempt to obey an outward legalistic system of works. The Galatians were turning away from the teaching and the reality of the ministry of the Spirit and were attempting to adhere to a religious system, the Mosaic Law, that kept them busy with ceremonial performances, observance of days and festivals, [the] distinction of meats, and other matters of ceremonial prescription.220 Unfortunately, in many Christian churches today, there are tenets of the Mosaic Law, some of which born-again believers are asked to obey (e.g., tithing; the giving of firstfruits; observing the Seventh Day Sabbath as the weekly day for worship; obedience to the Ten Commandments, etc.) not only for their spiritual growth but also to secure their salvation. This is what would otherwise be termed as walking in the flesh, being religious, instead of learning about the new person we have become at salvation, appropriating these truths and reflecting upon them throughout the day, confessing known sin (mental, verbal, and overt) to God the Father, and operating under the rule (guidance, leading, and power) of the Holy Spirit. This is a similar example of what would be described as adding to or taking away from the teachings of God. Likewise, this is another illustration of a new revelation that involved adding information from one dispensation to a scriptural declaration made from another dispensation. This new revelation was different in that it was actually replacing the protocols for a believer’s sanctification under the Church Age with a gospel of works under the Age of the Jews. Another passage of Scripture that pertains to adding or taking away from God-given revelation is found in the book of Colossians.  Colossians 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. What the Apostle Paul was conveying to the Colossian believers was what could happen and what has happened to many believers of the Christian faith. He warned them to be aware of those teachers who bring them back into slavery through philosophy (human wisdom, as contrasted with the divine wisdom in the Christian message221) and vain deceit (intellectualism or high-sounding nonsense222), which is centered on the rudiments of the world (""elementary teachings"" either of a Jewish or pagan origin, with various beliefs and ritual … which were in sharp contrast to the Christian way of life223 and not after Christ. As for adding to or taking away from divine revelation, I think that this verse reflects both. A new revelation takes away in that it offers human wisdom apart from divine wisdom. Second, it adds to the revelation of Christian teachings with various beliefs and rituals from Jewish or pagan origin. Let’s summarize what we have found out about what new revelation actually is about. A new revelation is: Saying that something needs to be observed or obeyed from church tradition that is not found in Scripture. Matthew 15:1-9 Taking the Word of God and using it inappropriately for nefarious reasons (e.g., not helping others who need financial assistance; for getting back at others; for dishonest gain) while giving the appearance that what was being done was for God’s glory. Matthew 15:1-9 Adding information from one dispensation to another, thus not allowing the direct revelation conveyed by God and written in Scripture for the next dispensation to implement accurately whether pertaining to salvation, sanctification, or any other biblical topic. Galatians 3:3 Replacing divine wisdom with human wisdom. Colossians 2:8 Adding to the divine revelation of Christian teachings with various beliefs and rituals from Jewish or pagan origin and other faiths. Colossians 2:8 With that said, how would real direct revelation from God be described? As stated earlier, we’ll repeat this again. Real direct revelation from God is the transmission of truth [particular knowledge and information] from the heart of God [by means of the Holy Spirit] to the heart of the believer,224 which could not be found by means of scientific investigation or human reason. To further expound upon this definition, please go to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 2:9-10 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. God, the Holy Spirit, has revealed hidden truths of which Eye hath not (ever) seen, nor the ear has ever heard about before, and which has never been entered into the heart (mind) of man at any time. When did the eye see these truths and the ear hear these hidden truths, and to who were these truths revealed? The words hath revealed in Greek is a verb in what is called the Aorist Tense, which denotes action as occurring at a point in time. I believe that what this referred to is the time when the New Testament church began, that being on the Day of Pentecost when the truths about the promise of receiving the indwelling Spirit was fulfilled in the lives of the one hundred twenty disciples of Christ that waited in the upper room for this to take place. Ephesians 3:5 Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; This verse tells us that these truths that were not made known to the sons of men in other ages were now unveiled to the apostles and prophets. Hebrews 1:1-2 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; And what about the duration of these truths (revelations)? I would like to add a quote from an interesting article on such. The Greek scholar Robertson comments on [the words] “[hath] spoken,” saying that it means “[did speak] in a final and full revelation.” There is a powerful contrast set up between these two avenues of revelation. In the Old Testament times, revelation from God was continuous, whereas, in stark contrast, the revelation in Jesus Christ is full, complete, and final.225What this is essentially saying is that divine revelation is not continuing to be unveiled but is finished with the completion of the New Testament writings or canon. With these thoughts in mind, we can deduce that there is no longer inspiration, the communication of revelation to others. No longer is a teacher or writer infallible in communicating truth to others. Likewise, not everything that a teacher or writer declares is true. That was enlightening. What I would like to leave you with is an article on revelation, in which instead of using this word, the writer uses a common phrase “God told me”. Enjoy. “THE DANGER OF SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF GOD” 1 Kings 13:18-19 (CSB): “He said to him, ‘I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD: “Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat food and drink water.” “The old prophet deceived him, and the man of God went back with him, ate food in his house, and drank water.”  Reflections [on] Today’s Bible [Verses]: Can I step up onto a soapbox and share one of the things that really gets under my skin? Thank you. Red flags and red flares go up in my mind whenever someone says: “God told me …” or “God wants you to know that …” Some people use such phrases so flippantly. They act as if it’s [normal,] and they leave every other believer wondering why God hasn’t ever talked to them like that. My wife once had a lady tell her something that was extremely tactless, hurtful, completely inappropriate, and not based upon truth. [But] the lady began her words to Kim by saying: “God told me to tell you …” Let me give a few reasons why such phrases should raise red flags in all of us: [It’s] typically used by people who rarely cite Scripture in their comments (Scripture: the place where God actually speaks). [It’s] typically used to shut down debate. [It’s] used by someone who is living their life as a maverick and not as someone who is open to correction and guidance by a pastor or a church body (as Jesus intended). Essentially, they see themselves as God’s gift to the world. [It’s] typically used by people who don’t have it all together, even though they want you to think they have it all together. Essentially, they are wearing a mask. A word Jesus often used of people who presented themselves to be something they aren’t is “hypocrite.” Those are people you don’t want to take too seriously. I’ve observed many other instances where people have taken it upon themselves to speak for God. I’ve heard them speak on His behalf to express their disapproval with a church budget, or to get their agenda pushed through without debate, or to say something harsh and hurtful to someone for which they claim no responsibility. Friend, I’m sick and tired of people who claim to speak on behalf of God but don’t have their finger on a passage of Scripture where God has actually spoken. Such spiritual arrogance is dangerous and destructive. It has more in common with the self-righteous Pharisees than a true follower of Jesus. Which brings us to the verses that [I’ve] chosen as [today’s] Bible [verses]. The story is told in 1 Kings 13 of an Old Testament prophet who was actually given instruction by God. He went to King Jeroboam and [prophesied] that God would bring judgment upon the northern tribes of Israel for rebelling against Him. Then, the prophet left as he made it clear that God had revealed that he was not to eat, drink, or go back the way he came. As he left Jeroboam’s presence, another prophet in Bethel heard what had happened. He got on his donkey and went in search of the prophet and found him. Listen to what he told him… 1 Kings 13:18-19 (CSB): “He said to him, ‘I am also a prophet like you. An angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD: “Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat food and drink water.” “The old prophet deceived him, and the man of God went back with him, ate food in his house, and drank water.” The second prophet claimed that he had a word from the Lord. Essentially, he said: “God told me to tell you that He changed His mind. You are supposed to come back to Bethel to get some food and drink. You can trust me because God told me this.” The previous verses state that the second prophet had said these things to deceive the original prophet. As you read the rest of the story in 1 King 13, you realize that God brought judgment on the original [prophet,] and he was killed by a lion on his way back home. Friend, if you insist on using the phrase, “God told me,” I would encourage you to only do so with the following stipulations: You had better have a clear sense that God actually told you something (and you are absolutely clear on what He told you) before you make that claim. You had better be careful in using the phrase, “God told me,” in public because it is often used by people who are spiritually arrogant and want to impress others. You had better document what you publicly claim that God said to you to see if it actually happens. If you find out you were not correct, then you can learn that God is not speaking to you as you think. So, keep quiet. Why? Because publicly speaking on behalf of God, when God hadn’t spoken, was a capital offense in the Old Testament (read Deuteronomy 13:1-5). [It’s] also one of the reasons for a stricter judgment on Judgment Day (James 3:1). You had better search the Scriptures to make sure that what you think God told you actually aligns with a passage, or precept, or the spirit of the biblical text. God doesn’t [change,] and He won’t reveal something to you that is contrary to His Word. You had better be humble enough to receive correction or guidance on what you think God has told you. Jesus left us the church because we’re to live out our faith in [the] community. [It’s] the maverick American culture that has infiltrated Christianity that makes us think we don’t need others to correct and help guide us. Friend, the only time that we can absolutely say that “God told me” is when we have our finger on a Bible passage. If you ever want to actually hear God speak, just read your Bible out loud. In fact, as others claim that God has spoken to them, or you make that claim, or your preacher claims to speak on behalf of God, I would heartily encourage you to be like the Jews in Berea. Even if the [Apostle] Paul and Silas were to show up and claim to give a message from the Lord, be like the Jews in Berea. There is a way that you can determine if God has actually spoken and the Jews in Berea engaged in it. Be like them! Acts 17:10-11 (CSB): “As soon as it was night, the brothers and sisters sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. Upon arrival, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. The people here were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, since they received the word with eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.”226 What a blessing this article was. Don’t just take everything you hear from the pulpit for granted. And remember, if someone says they have received a new revelation from God, tell them that God has also given you a revelation that is found in his Word. Romans 16:17 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. We have one more classification of doctrine to look at beginning in the next chapter that I will call Corruptible Doctrines (License to Sin Doctrines).

8,Freedom and The Economic Democracy Act,social-issues," George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and Donald J. Trump (among others, i.e. the 1%) are “independently wealthy.” That is to say, they never DEPEND on an employer or the government for their financial wherewithal. They own so much wealth producing capital that they can live off their dividends without ever having to consider taking a job, going to work, or punching a time-clock. Instead, they are effectively FREE to do what they want to do with their days, weeks, months, years, and their lives. That includes running for President of the United States if and when they simply choose to do so. But most Americans (95%) are NOT INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. Most Americans were not born with silver spoons in their mouths. Most have to figure out how to make a living, how to feed, clothe, and house themselves and their family members. Most have to take jobs and depend on employers for their financial wherewithal. In other words, most Americans ARE NOT FREE in the way that Bush, Romney and Trump are free because they don’t own the dividend producing capital assets that allow the wealthy to be independent and free. But in this age of unprecedented technological advancement, in a moment when mankind could actually destroy the entire human race with the push of a button, what would you say to an economic advancement that would significantly loosen the economic chains on everyone and give everyone a taste of freedom that only the wealthy enjoy today? And what if in the process we could systematically eliminate the economic roots of poverty, racism, and war? If you’d like to significantly increase your own odds, not to mention the odds of future generations, of avoiding the chains of wage slavery, economic sharecropping, being owned instead of owning, check out the following scenario and seriously consider the possibilities. Let’s Start With These Facts The US Federal Reserve makes an annual assessment with regard to how much money will be required to fund the following year’s economic growth. In 2018 they concluded that 2019’s economic growth would require approximately $4 trillion dollars-worth of funding. If you divide $4 trillion dollars by 330 million people (US population in 2018) you’ll find that approximately $12,000 per individual citizen was going to be required to fund America’s projected economic growth in 2019. But the beneficiaries of this annual projected growth opportunity are inevitably limited to those people who can afford to fund/buy - thus own the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the means to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course was to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus began. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that back in 2019 America’s economic growth was going to require $4 trillion dollars of funding. Once again, that translated into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This excludes over 90% of we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where ALL THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Made an annual, 100% insured, $10,000 LINE OF CREDIT accessible •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or political persuasion) •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed these annual loans to be repaid with FUTURE, PRE-TAX DIVIDENDS – NOT PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves in a predictable amount of time (3 to 7 years) and create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. Since every transaction would be instantly collateralized by private sector assets and 100% insured, it creates no long-term consumer debt and no long-term government debt either. And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario, production systematically precedes consumption. Thus, there’s a systematic balance built into this strategy which eliminates any possibility of inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Provide every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where all of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it systematically democratizes the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually still pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And yes, PAY DOWN OUR NATIONAL DEBT, reducing taxes even further. That $4 trillion of growth (or more today due to inflation) is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these economic conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible in a way that it is not today! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although their goals are similar, the ways they achieve those goals are dramatically different. Check it out. Since 0% interest, 100% insured lines of credit are repaid via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates no long-term consumer debt and no long-term government debt. UBI creates government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated (FREE) through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent (FREE) of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Universal Basic Ownership/UBO)."
9,What Does It Mean When We Say That the End Justifies the Means?,social-issues," PART 14 CHURCH TEACHINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TEACHINGS THAT EXERCISE AN UNREASONABLE USE OF POWER AUTHORITARIAN DOCTRINES THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS This is a very interesting doctrine that I became aware of in my younger years in ministry; however, I was not fully aware of its actual meaning and destructiveness in the lives of believers. What does it mean when it’s said that the end justifies the means? From what I’ve learned, what this essentially means is that at times certain decisions can be emphasized by leadership that the assembly of believers should support unequivocally even if the avenue for implementing such is sinful as long as the end result promotes the advancement of the Kingdom of God. What is meant concerning the sentiment of promoting the Kingdom of God could mean many different things depending on the faith at hand. It could refer to increasing the capacity to reach more souls for Christ. It could mean enhancing the financial status of those in leadership. It could mean the allowance of the leadership hierarchy to have many wives. However, what we could infer as to what it’s really all about is simply to have the ability to exert control over the assembly of believers by means of Scripture for power, money, and sex. When certain Scriptures are used in this manner, they might appear to support God’s kingdom. If you are going to follow God, then you will be told to follow Him with no reservations. Probably one of the main scriptural sections that are used to support this perspective is found in the book of Joshua. Let’s go there and see what this was all about. Suggested Reading: Joshua 2:1-24 The Lord has chosen Joshua to lead the Jews out from the wilderness wanderings by crossing over the Jordan River into the land of Canaan, the land that God promised them for an inheritance. This land would be theirs by means of conquest. The first place that Joshua sets out to conquer is a place called Jericho. He sent out two spies into the city, who eventually lodged at the dwelling place of a prostitute named Rahab. While there, it was their mission to obtain information about this fortress - its gates, fortified towers, military [forces,] and the morale of its people.201 In the meantime, somehow, the king of Jericho was made aware that there were two spies sent from the children of Israel who could be residing at Rahab’s house. So, he sent messengers there in order to apprehend them. She, finding out about this before they arrived, being aware that all of them were in danger for their lives, asked the spies to hide on the rooftop under the flax fibers which were attached to the stalks of a plant that were placed there. In those days, flax fibers were laid out in heaps where the sun would dry them so that they could be used for weaving them into linen cloth. 5 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. When the king’s messengers arrived at her house, they asked her where the spies were. And here is where the end justifies the means. She told them that they had already left. In other words, she lied. Some would say that the situation was such that lying or committing sin was the appropriate response. And because the result was beneficial, that being of the saving of the spies’ lives, therefore, this story is about a type of sin that could be accepted by those in the leadership of the New Testament church as warranted by the situation at hand as long as it promoted the Kingdom of God. Let’s take a look at another Scripture that could be used to convince God’s people that the end justifies the means. Please go to the book of Matthew. Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. This is a powerful Scripture, especially when presented over and over again. All of us want to do God’s will. For many believers, they don’t know what God’s will is, so this verse sounds like what this could be all about. If we deny ourselves for God’s sake and take up our cross, then we’re told that He will be pleased with us. Deny in what way? There could be many ways that believers could be told to do such and such for the benefit of the kingdom. One of them, which we’ll take a look at next, is in the area of financial giving that is also found in the book of Matthew. Matthew 19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. It’s true that churches need money to pay staff, building expenses, outreaches, etc. They should let the assembly know when they need money and what it is to be used for. What this verse seems to be saying is that if we forsake (give up) real estate property or even our family who are not serving God for Christ’s sake, then we’ll receive a hundredfold and inherit everlasting life. Some might even interpret this verse as saying that God would give us more real estate holdings and a new godly family if we forsake this or that for Christ’s sake. The story of Rahab and the spies, along with the two verses just mentioned about forsaking this or that, is quite compelling. They appear to convey to us that God will excuse sin as long as it promotes His kingdom. Furthermore, they seem to stress that in this life, we should deny ourselves of whatever it is for Christ’s sake or for those who operate in His stead, i.e., leadership when they request from us whatever it is. And if what we own or if our family is inhibiting us in our walk with God with respect to obeying leadership, then we should sell all that we have and give it to the church and/or divorce our wife, and find a new one who will support us unequivocally. Has anything I’ve mentioned sound right to you? You might say it kind of sounds right, but. Believe me, there are many believers who are under church leaders that espouse one or more of these perspectives. Are they correct in their perception of the Word of God? Well, there is another way to look at this view of the end justifying the means, which is what we’ll undertake next. The end result of furthering the kingdom of God does not justify the means of promoting sinful words and actions for the assembly to agree with and implement. In this respect, we’ll begin by taking a look at an Old Testament saint that most of us are familiar with in respect to an animal called a lion. Does this animal recall to you the name of this person? There is a book of the Bible named after him. I think you know now who I’m talking about. Please go to the book of Daniel. Suggested Reading: Daniel 6:1-28 3 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. In 538 BC, Cyrus of Persia, the subordinate prince under King Darius of the Medes, conquered Babylon. He decided to appoint one hundred twenty governors over the kingdom, along with three administrators, one of whom was a believer in Yahweh called Daniel. Over time, he outshone (showed himself prominent) over the two other administrators. With this consideration in mind, King Darius is now considering consolidating the number of administrators and making Daniel the sole one. Somehow, word of this got back to the other two presidents along with the administrative officials, i.e., the governors, princes, counselors, and captains. So, they banded together in order to prevent this from happening. They tried to find out something about Daniel’s behavior that they could present before the king that would disqualify him, but they found nothing. What they did come up with, however, was a clever plan to not only have him removed from his position altogether but also to have him killed. 7 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. They came before the king and asked him to approve of and establish a royal statute for thirty days that in effect said if anyone prayed a prayer to anyone for thirty days other than the king, then they would be cast into a den of lions. The king signed the decree being unaware of the deception involved. 10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. When Daniel found out about this decree and that it was signed by the king, we would assume that he was aware of what was going on behind the scenes. He could have simply stopped praying for thirty days and waited until the time was up, and then resumed his daily routine. To the natural mind, this sounds like the right thing to do, doesn’t it? However, as a man of God, he continued on in his daily routine, praying three times a day. We could look at this and say he was reckless. I would respond by saying that he probably brought this situation up to the Lord and asked for guidance. If God wanted him to stop praying or even leave the geographical location for his safety, He would have communicated so to him. Another thing to contemplate was his testimony before God and the people, most of whom were unbelievers. What would have been the message to those that knew he was someone that followed Jehovah. Would his decision to stop praying send a clear signal to them that His God couldn’t protect him from not obeying the king’s decree? The governmental hierarchy could now carry out its nefarious plans to the fullest. They arrived at Daniel’s house at one of the times of prayer and found him praying as they knew he would. This was reported back to the king, who begrudgingly cast him into a den of lions overnight. All appeared lost. Daniel would be torn apart by these hungry lions. 19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? In the morning, the king quickly arrived at the den and cried out to Daniel, asking him if his God was able to deliver him. And David replied back, responding that an angel of the Lord had shut the mouths of the lions, thus preserving his life. What happened next is quite astonishing. 24 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. Not only was the king glad for Daniels’ sake, but he was well aware of this insidious plot. He commanded that all those men who were complicit in this scheme, along with everyone in their family, be cast into the den of lions. And so, they were no more. What this story tells me is that Daniel didn’t use any sinful means to try to get out of this situation. As one of the administrators of the kingdom, he probably could have tried to hire some hitmen to get back at those whose intent was to kill him. As I’ve already stated, he could have stopped praying for thirty days. The final thought was that a man or woman of God should not use sinful words or actions to promote the Kingdom of God. With that said, let’s take another look at some of the verses from the book of Joshua and draw a different conclusion as to why Rahab might have responded the way she did to the messengers of the king.  Suggested Reading: Joshua 2:1-24 3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country. 4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 5 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. When the king’s messengers asked her to bring the spies before them, she responded by saying that they had already left her dwelling earlier that night. And that if they were to go after them immediately, they could possibly catch up to them. It’s true that the spies’ lives were saved in this regard, but it’s also true that she probably was not a believer in Jehovah. She did what her natural mind told her to do. However, but for the sake of argument, what if she was a believer? Would she have acted any differently? I don’t know. It depends on her walk with God. She might still have lied. On the other hand, she might have gone to prayer and asked God for guidance. It’s possible that she might not have hidden them at all based on what God’s response to her might have been. But to use what happened here to condone sin is in itself sinful. Don’t allow someone in leadership to convince you that committing a sin of any kind will promote God’s kingdom. This should show you right away where their faith is centered. It’s certainly not on the Word of God and reliance of the Holy Spirit. Now, let’s go back and take another look at the verse from the book of Matthew that talked about self-denial and realize that there is another way to translate it. Matthew 16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. It’s true that Jesus said that if anyone would come after Him, let him deny himself, and take up his cross. But how else could this verse be translated? We know from comparing Scriptures that Jesus wasn’t saying that if you deny yourself of this or that means you are taking up His cross. In this sense, if this verse was interpreted in that way, then what we would be talking about is religion, i.e., doing this or that to please God. What this is actually talking about is a person’s eternal standing. It’s about no longer relying upon our self, our good works, but repenting to God the Father and believing in His Son as to who He is and what He has accomplished for salvation (the bundle of benefits received, one of which is the indwelling Spirit). When Jesus said follow me, this referred to what should be taking place following salvation. What should be taking place is learning how to walk in the Spirit, which is another way of saying learning how to rely on or be in subjection to Him, which is not accomplished by sinful means or coercion. This brings us to one of the most egregious abuses of power in the church today. And that is using Scripture to take advantage of believers financially in order to benefit the kingdom of God. As I’ve previously mentioned, believers should give support to missions, for leaders’ salary, for church building obligations but not in an unscriptural manner and oppressive approach. Let’s take another look at this verse from the book of Matthew concerning this approach. Matthew 19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. One thing that resonated with me after I read this verse was the idea that if someone forsakes thus and such, they will inherit everlasting life. What this conveyed to me is that this was talking about salvation. Before any of us were saved, we had areas of our life that we considered prominent, i.e., riches, family, sinful desires, addictions, etc. As for myself, I had many things that I thought were of paramount importance. I took drugs, I drank too much, I had affairs with different women, I spent my money on foolish things, I hung out with the wrong crowd, and I had very little respect for others. Then, there came a time when I didn’t like myself anymore. I no longer praised who I had become. I needed a complete overhaul. At this time in my life, I had just finished taking an elective course in college, which was on the life of King Saul. What resonated with me was all the different ways in which God (Jehovah) interacted with him. I wondered if this kind of relationship with God could occur in my own life. I was not unfamiliar with religion as I had been an altar boy in one particular mainstream faith in my younger years, but for some reason, I never had a personal relationship with the God that I thought I was serving. However, what I did determine was that if God truly existed, then I would hopefully find Him in church or in at least one of them. Where that church was located, I had no idea. So, I began to attend many different faiths. They all seemed to have the same things in common. Do this or that, as spoken in the writings of the faith, obey the leadership so that God would be pleased, and you will probably go to a better place at physical death. This didn’t appease my longing for God at all. I had been involved in this type of religion before. Then one day, something occurred that set me on the right road to finding this one true God who would change my life forever. I was working for my dad at a spa and grille that he owned. It was a holiday Sunday, and I was getting out of work at noon. As I was about to leave, a local parade was passing by. So, I decided to follow it to the center of town, where at which location it dispersed. When I arrived at this place, I heard a loud voice in the distance. When I turned around in a three hundred sixty degree manner, I saw a large gathering of people standing before a staging platform, where it appeared that someone was speaking. So, I decided to walk over and find out what was going on. As I approached, I heard a young man talking about God. He said that God wants to become personal with us. He wants to give us a new nature. This got my attention. He presented the gospel of repentance and faith, to which I didn’t respond. However, I did get the address and time of the next meeting. This gathering was to be held at one of the church member’s houses. When the day and time arrived, I showed up. There was a barbecue taking place, and I was offered free food and drink, to which I would never say no. After everyone was finished, one of the pastors was introduced. He proceeded to give a message, which was followed up with an invitation to respond to the gospel message. He asked if anyone was interested in walking up to where he was standing. So, I did. He said that if I confessed the words that he proclaimed, God would come into my life and fill me with His presence. I repeated the words he said, but nothing happened. He, in turn, paused and then said something remarkable to me. He said that God showed him that I was dating a married woman, and I needed to confess this as sin to Him and break off this relationship. I proceeded to confess this sin in front of all who were present and acknowledged that I would no longer date her. Right after this pronouncement, I was saturated with God’s presence. I found God, or instead, He found me. To me, this was an example of forsaking something, in this case, an illicit relationship with someone, that was hindering me from being saved. As far as the scriptural declaration that if we forsake all, we’ll receive back one-hundredfold. If you want to say this means material possessions, that is your prerogative. If this were the case, we would be playing the game, Let’s Make a Deal with God. To me, what I believe this refers to are incomparable spiritual riches. I have one more thought for you to consider in respect to forsaking real estate or family, as some leaders might command. While it’s true when Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell all that he had and give it to the poor, and he would receive eternal life. But I believe that this stumbling block was that which was the predominant issue that was preventing him from becoming saved. This obstruction of an ever-present sinful desire is different for each unbeliever. Before we close our discussion on this topic, I just thought of another section of Scriptures that some churches could use to provide additional support for their teachings that a believer has the right to forsake his wife and possessions for the Kingdom of God’s sake. Please go to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 7:26, 29-30 26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be. A lot of what Paul was talking about here in respect to marriage and owning property seemingly had to do with the words that he mentioned in this verse, i.e., for the present distress. Some commentators believe that these words convey to us the political conditions of the time in that Nero was the current Caesar who had begun to persecute Christians. 29 But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; He goes on to declare that the time is short or was made short by their impending persecutions and trials.202 And when he said, they that have wives be as though they had none, some leaders could take this to mean that if your wife is inhibiting you from serving the Lord faithfully, then you should divorce her. This is not what he was saying. Based on the historical context, what he was saying was that if trials or the situation might become so difficult that even those already married will have to live as though they were not married …. perhaps Paul was referring to husbands and wives being separated from each other because of economic distress or persecution.203 30 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; Due to trials and persecutions, grief will come, but don’t let it gain uncontrolled mastery over you. Stand [readily] prepared to escape for [your] life, or meet death, as the providence of God may permit.204 And if you own property, consider it as though it doesn’t belong to you in the sense that it can be taken away at any time. These verses appear to have nothing to do with giving our earthly possessions to the church or divorcing our wives for the furtherance of the kingdom. Be careful when there is a continual mention of giving all that you own to the church for the furtherance of the kingdom. Be careful when you are told that sexual sins are considered acceptable if they further the kingdom. Be careful if you are instructed that all types of sin are approved by God as long as they promote His kingdom. I would like to leave you with this verse, which I believe exemplifies the perspective that the end does not justify the means. James 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. Do what we know is right according to God’s Word, and if we don’t do what it says, then it’s sin. Do you know that there is something else that authoritarian leaders will use to justify their control over their followers? We looked at this, albeit briefly, in an earlier chapter. Let’s take a look at it more in-depth in the chapter that follows. It’s composed of two words -- one word beginning with the letter n and the second word with the letter r. I’m sure you’ve got this. But before you do, I would like to leave you with an article that talks about what should be the focus for each person, each institution, each country, i.e., the outcome or the means. THE MINDSET OF MAN: [“THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS!”] WHY THIS MINDSET? AUGUST 26, 2020 All of history reveals a mindset which promotes the END as a justification of the MEANS. America has used this mindset since its founding. All nations use this mindset (to a degree) to advance their self-interest. This mindset is what creates our wars, contention, hatred, and destruction of property. Politicians think of their END vision and then implement a MEANS for accomplishing this END. It [doesn’t] work for mankind because this thinking is [backward] and diabolical. Will America’s leaders (we vote in November) develop new thinking? I doubt it! America’s leaders will likely use this belief that the ‘end justifies the means’ to further their political agenda. The Donald will think in this manner. Joe Biden will think in this manner. This mindset goes all the way back to Niccolo Machiavelli. Lying is justified. Corruption is justified. Refusing to balance our monetary affairs is justified. Blaming another country (like China) for the Covid-19 virus is justified. Our leaders are steeped in this mindset that the [end] justifies the MEANS. What is their END? This mindset [doesn’t work,] and yet our leaders continue with this mindset. God’s logic (within [Scripture]) says that the MEANS is the key to the END. Justice starts with the MEANS. The Commandments of Yahweh are based upon the MEANS. [Problem-solving] must start with the MEANS. Yet, our world system operates with the opposite mindset. Destruction is guaranteed with this mindset of the END as justification of the MEANS. I can guarantee more war, contention, and destruction when I witness this mindset within our leaders. America is the Super-Power on planet Earth as I write. China wants to be the next Super-Power. Russia would also like this [role,] as would Europe. We live in a world where select leaders conceive their goals and plans with this mindset of ‘the END justifies the [MEANS.’] [It’s] a mindset which leads to war, contention, and destruction. Yet our political leaders have no interest in changing their thinking. This diabolical mindset is why our world system is collapsing from within. It’s our thinking which creates our END result. Today, [it’s] our Central Bankers who devise and conceive new policies for promoting an END (prosperity) via a MEANS of corruption and fakery. Money units are created out-of-nothing (the mind of banksters) and then circulated to select clients for the purpose of promoting a conceived END. The end is control (over the marketplace) and [fake] prosperity which never advances human happiness and progress. The END is a misguided mental image [that] produces more strive, contention, and destruction. [Yet,] these thinkers [don’t] change their thinking. Justice and real progress must be based upon the logic of the MEANS as key and the END as a Result of the MEANS. With a valid MEANS that is based upon truth, liberty, and justice, the END can emerge as a RESULT. Today, [it’s] our THINKING which produces false [results,] and the results which emerge create more destruction for mankind as a whole. Our world system is [collapsing,] and yet our leaders continue with this mantra that the END justifies the MEANS. Will American leaders change their thinking? My sense is NO! A favorable END never arrives as our THINKING is diabolical and corrupt. Thinking must change. The [mindset] of our leaders must be based upon God’s logic of the MEANS coming before the RESULT. Justice, peace, stability, freedom, and progress must be based on sound logic and thinking (at the start). Today, our leaders [don’t] THINK with a logic that produces these needed results. Watch as America elects another administration this fall and watch what happens as they implement their THINKING. Will real peace, happiness, progress emerge? I would suggest that this is impossible given their THINKING. As a man thinketh so is he! Proverbs 23:7.  The MEANS is key to the END. Justice in the NOW is needed. Freedom in the NOW is needed. Equality in the NOW is needed. The NOW demands a new mindset based upon the MEANS (coming first). This [isn’t] happening. I will suggest that our THINKING produces our RESULTS. If our thinking [doesn’t] change, then more of the same will result (unhappiness). We need new [leadership,] which thinks with a mindset of the MEANS coming before the END. That is my viewpoint and perspective!

10,The hard truth behind this world people see as: “a dream.” (Women),social-issues," Don’t we all love the people who think that the world is a dream? Well don’t be shocked, but that’s not how it works fellow believers. On the basis of stats and explanation I will share my vision of the world with you. Of course I’m not here to tell you what to do, I just want to make people realize that not everything in this world is just pink and purple. Here and there, you can see goodness that shines through the darkness, but that doesn’t mean that the darkness has faded away. The way Women and children  are treated makes me feel deeply sad. Let’s discuss those two things first. This world doesn’t only know shocking truths. There are worst things yet to discover. But the things that shock even me the writer of the article are women. Women rights were first heard of in the 19th century and 100 years later, even then not respected.  When I watched the news from nowadays, the only thing that hit my heart right in the middle is raping. Don’t feel bad because you said the word. It’s the hard truth of today. When you think of how crazy someone can be just by thinking and organizing a raping. That’s one of the moments when I ask myself: “Where are we going?!” I honestly think that women should get a medal these days. When you live as one you have to be careful everywhere. knowing what can happen to you, I think you are very brave coming outside and living your life like any other. I’m not a woman and still…I’m the one to realize it! Did you know that 2/5 women ever had to deal with physical and sexual violence and that 1/6 women once dealt with raping which is 16%. 16%!! In my country at least 8 women have got this issue once a day!  By hearing this I’m sure I ruined your day, but isn’t a ruined day nothing compared to a ruined female life? I remind you that I’m not an expert but why don’t you go ask a woman in a neighbourhood what raping must feel like. I’m very sure you want to know it! Did you know a woman is human, for those who haven’t realized that they are not an object! You don’t need to be female to support them! You don’t need to be happy when u hurt them! But with that being said I just can’t be done yet. I guess we all have imagination. Well why don’t you try to use it and imagine what I wrote about women but then with children. I’d say that dream of yours should be a nightmare by now. And what do you think of the punishment? Just a bit of jailtime… Do you think that dirtying women and children is forgotten because you had a little fun jailtime?? People deserve more than this sometimes. I go by: “An eye for an eye”, Maybe it’s just an opinion, but still… This world isn’t good for everyone! Here you have My vision of things. I deeply hope you will understand the hardness of this world and that people who have been through this don’t have to be alone anymore."
11,Psychopathy of seduction,social-issues," Picking up woman is nothing but mind games. Sure, being rich and good looking helps but when you see average looking men with beautiful woman, it does beg the question, how do they do that? Supreme clothing, and Hermes handbags, once were or still are highly looked upon items of fashion that many are begging to get their hands on. With limited releases that mean it is difficult to obtain and high prices which cannot be justified even if the quality is three times better than something one one-hundredth of the price. So why do people love them so much? Why are people trying so hard, waiting for the release and trying to have the fastest fingers, or purchasing thousands to even be considered for a handbag, just to give a company their money? Yet the companies are making millions, from doing this on purpose. Why are you actively convincing a woman that you are a good enough option when in reality, you should be the one getting pursued? The approach Keep it casual and confident, walk up to the woman you would like to pursue, small introduction and then just start talking about something completely random, point out the awkward couple trying to hit it off with each other and laugh with her, make little jokes about the décor of the room your in. Do it all with the tone of voice you speak to your mates in, friendly body language and taking the conversation completely off yourselves at first will psychologically make her feel like you’re someone she’s known for years and is completely comfortable with, thereby removing any first encounter awkwardness. Furthermore, this gives off the impression that you’re not nervous, you don’t care about what she thinks, you’re not trying to brag or take a fake interest in her life, and it either works or it doesn’t.  You are not trying to win her because in your mind you don’t care at all about her opinion. This completely removes the power from her side of the court that she’s used to holding. So, you must be different, you must be special. Making her yours. Ever wonder why some woman are always in relationships? Some woman just goes from long term to long term boyfriends, and as soon as its over it seem like they are with someone new straight away? Talking to these woman is usually a mixture of your first thoughts that she isn’t that special to you falling in love. These woman aren’t any different to any other woman you meet and yet you and all the men around her seem to fall in love. Just like the limited releases of clothing previously mentioned, it’s almost like these woman are limited release, and when you see someone else with the thing that you know you can’t have then for some reason it just seems better and better. I mean everyone knows you want what you can’t have and that is completely it. You can’t have the woman, so you want her, then as soon as more men want her, she seems even more desirable and this example also works for woman looking at men. If you aren’t always available for this woman then she’s going to want you even more. Practical application of this can be incredibly simple. Not being there whenever the woman, you’re trying to pursue wants you, will just make her want you even more. Just doing things like rebooking a date you were meant to go on or ending her call but calling her back later on just means you aren’t always there when she wants you to be. However, failure to be available at all will just mean she may lose interest so don’t overuse this technique. Sometimes if you feel like you are being played by a woman and she’s just stringing you along, finding someone new short term can show that you aren’t always available, as well as creating a sense of urgency and when you are actually available."
12,"""AFTER HOURS"" by The Weeknd",social-issues," Abel Tesfaye finally delivers on his long-running vision, leveraging a self-loathing villain into an irresistible cinematic narrative with his most satisfying collision of synth, new wave, ‘80s dream pop, and, most and foremost, R&B/Soul. “After Hours” explores promiscuity, over-indulgence, and self-loathing. “After Hours” continues Abel's conflicting dichotomy and has him continue to live up to his pseudonym: “the weekend” with its promise of pleasure, romance, and nightclub antics, but also “the weakened” regarding the emotional toll his actions seem to have on him. The persona The Weeknd has created in his music dwells in a perpetual circle of love and loss so it should come as no surprise when we discover him… alone again. The end of another romantic relationship has taken its toll on Abel and that heartbreak has him fleeing to Sin City, Las Vegas. (“in Vegas, I feel so at home” – Alone Again) It is where the king of the fall plans to divert his attention away from grief and venture back into his former self but from what we have seen in the past, being romantically unattached seems to do more harm than good for Abel. (“I don’t know if I can be alone again” – Alone Again) So, it is not long before his playboy personality comes alive again and has him over-indulging in detrimental behaviors. He is nearly overdosing and while in his near-death state, (“I took too much, I don’t wanna die” – Alone Again) the following tracks play out like a flashback, reciting the events that led him to Las Vegas in the first place. “Too Late” serves as a bit of a prelude to how Abel ended up solo. (“I let you down, I led you on” – Too Late) He was filled with regret over some unfaithful actions he committed and it seems like this time it might be too late to mend what has been broken. He blamed some of it on his surroundings and living in Los Angeles (“I can’t trust where I live anymore” – Too Late) but by the next track, he admits that the blame for his romantic fallout rests on his shoulders. (“I’ve been the hardest to love, you tryna let me go” – Hardest To Love) He was no longer fully invested in the relationship and it would not be the first time Abel has felt like a woman has overstayed her welcome. (“This house is not a home to you” – Twenty Eight) He felt the relationship's end was already near but his lover was having a tough time letting him go and he selfishly held on to her knowing the right path forward, thinking he was guarding her by keeping her close. (“When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go but I kept you beside me” – Scared To Live) Unfortunately, it only poisoned her view of the love she truly deserved as she was only staying out of fear of being alone. Abel, then, begins to show remorse by encouraging this woman to get out there and not be afraid of finding someone new. (“So don’t be scared to live again” – Scared To Live) The chapter closes with Abel feeling like the relationship was never going to work out anyway. (“We fell apart, right from the start” – Scared To Live) “Snowchild” has Abel musing over his path to success, former struggles, and previous intentions of self-harm. (“If I didn’t make it then I’d probably make my wrist bleed” - Snowchild) Ultimately, this appears to be the turning point in his thinking; he reminds himself of how far he has come, everything he has accomplished, and finally shows some gratitude for this lost relationship. In 2011, Abel dreamed of heading to California to pursue his music (“order plane tickets, Cali is the mission” – The Morning) but by 2015, he was reminiscing over his hometown of Toronto (“I miss my city, man, it’s been a minute. M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission” – Tell Your Friends) and it is at this point on “After Hours” when he decides it is time to escape from LA. (“Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving” – Snowchild) He reasons that The City Of Angels was deteriorating him and his lover's souls. His stardom and fortune came with plenty of attention and temptation from the opposite sex (“but this world is such a, such an evil place, man these hoes will always find a way” – Escape From LA) but after all these years, Abel is recognizing that this lifestyle has been damaging not only his health but the well-being of his emotional relationships and for once, he genuinely seems to not want to lose that. (“This place will be the end of me” – Escape From LA) However, it would not be a The Weeknd album without seeing his character's inclination towards corruption: Abel risks it all for a night with someone he does not even find significant. (“She pulled up to the studio, nobody’s watching” – Escape From LA) This must have been the provocative incident that, eventually, left him alone and the same incident that raises the question: Is LA really the cause of his hardships or is it just Abel himself? Now in Las Vegas, the delicate ethos he held in “Snowchild” has shifted completely. (“Never need a bitch, I’m what a bitch need” – Heartless) Without his real lover, he is left with only fame and wealth, fast cars, hard drugs, and meaningless sex. (“and I’m back to my ways ‘cause I’m heartless” - Heartless) It is a lifestyle he has shown regret for in the past. (“it’s safe to say this ain’t ordinary life” – Ordinary Life) He continually states that he is trying to be a better man but every time he is alone and faced with temptation, he succumbs to instant sexual gratification but even now, it seems that his lover from earlier tracks refuses to give up on him; (“You never gave up on me” – Heartless) maybe they rekindle some form of communication but Abel begins losing faith perhaps in himself or over the idea of finding happiness and love. That lack of faith has him trying to numb his senses and fill the void that has left him heartless but when his drug-induced highs begin to fade, he is reminded of the heartache, (“when I’m coming down is the most I feel alone” – Faith) once again proving that he is continually replicating his past. (“I always want you when I’m coming down” – Coming Down) Every time Abel seems to be presented with a good path forward, he instead chooses Sin City. (“I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven’s gate” – Faith) Eventually, we get, quite possibly, the album's most deeply personal line, (“I pray when I look inside the mirror and see someone I love” – Faith) meaning that maybe Abel cannot love someone correctly because he has not learned to fully value and respect himself. He is constantly abusing his body and his emotions when he acts irrationally; his weak response inhibition leaves him doing whatever pops into his head at the moment and then having to deal with the fallout later. It is this spiral that lands him in either a police car or an ambulance by the end of the track. (“I ended up in the back of a flashing car” - Faith) By showing the world his heartless playboy persona, he has been able to protect his inner emotions and because he has perpetually done this throughout his career, his feelings have been numbed to be emotionally indestructible. However, this time alone in Las Vegas continues to leave him pining for his past love. The Las Vegas nightlife has left him cold-empty and further blinded by the fame but at the same time, it has also offered him the clarity he needed, and now he is ready to take this woman back. (“No, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch” – Blinding Lights) However, in “In Your Eyes”, he is finding out that she has been having a hot girl summer. (“I can tell what you’ve done, yeah, when I look at you in your eyes” – In Your Eyes) It seems like the cards have turned and now Abel is the one trying to make it work so that his love does not turn into a loss. He has tried finding love in others but has come to acknowledge that he just cannot get over this woman. Abel has no problem looking past her infidelities because he is just as guilty himself but every time he looks at her, it is a constant reminder of his frequent betrayals. (“I’m ashamed of what I’ve done, when I look at you in your eyes” – In Your Eyes) It seems the two go their separate ways for some time but they cross paths at a party in “Save Your Tears”. (“I saw you dancing in a crowded room” – Save Your Tears) Abel still feels awful about what he initially put her through and had hoped that she had stayed in touch, although he realizes that she wants nothing to do with him anymore. (“but you walk past me like I wasn’t there” – Save Your Tears) He accepts he is too late now, he admits that she does deserve better (“I realize that I’m much too late and you deserve someone better” – Save Your Tears) or so he wants us to think that. In his mind, he is trying to convince himself that he does not care about his lover moving on but in the next track, jealousy and paranoia are getting the best of him. He is having a challenging time coping with the idea that she is moving on. That is why he resorts to an effort to brainwash his lover and persuade her that she is in love with him and only him. (“You don’t love him, you don’t love him, you don’t love him if you’re thinking of me” / “but ain’t right if you fuck him out of spite” – Repeat After Me) He is desperate for her love and in denial of the relationship's end. (“my heart belongs to you, I’ll risk it all for you” – After Hours) Whether it is heartbreak or withdrawal, Abel is unable to rest and finds that his attempts to be a better man have been futile and by the sounds of it, he is contemplating suicide; an eternal sleep where he can continue to dream of only her, (“Put myself to sleep, just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams” – After Hours) where he can beg for her presence and forgiveness. (“this time I won’t break your heart, your heart” – After Hours) This is what I consider to be the tragedy of Abel Tesfaye. Throughout his discography, he has hurt women and has been on the receiving end of that hurt as well but has always found a way forward. “After Hours” initially seems to be a repetition of his old ways but this time they are not enough to mend this heartbreak because as it appears, he is not as emotionally indestructible as he had thought. He truly found something special but realized it far too late. By the album's conclusion, Abel is paralyzed by the weight of his own emotions. (“I’m so paralyzed, I’m so paralyzed” – Until I Bleed Out) He is tired of hurting the one he loves; he had hoped he would grow stronger and more integral with time but he has only sunk deeper into the black hole of hedonism, fame, and fortune. He, at some time, needs to be a better man and break this unending cycle. He is finally looking inside the mirror or rather himself, hoping that he can still see some semblance of good reflecting at him, something he can say he loves about himself. Abel has always tapped into the darkest and most shaded part of his mind for our entertainment but it is finally bleeding him dry and he is trying to convince himself that he does not need drugs or love to be genuinely happy. (“I keep telling myself I don’t need it anymore” / “just want it out of my life, out” – Until I Bleed Out) So, it should come as no surprise when we discover him… alone again. My first interaction with The Weeknd was through “After Hours”, my favorite album ever, since then. I cannot remember if it just appeared on my Spotify homepage or I looked it up. All I know is that this album came into my life when I was going through a tough time in my life and I needed something to push me forward; something to hold on to. While Abel was facing his endless circle of self-torturing and overthinking, I was doing the same thing, as well. I cannot imagine a better way of bonding with someone other than that. The thing I do not fully understand is how it kept me going. The theme of the album is not positivity, it is not self-improving; it is not even close to that. So, the question arises: How can an album about self-loathing give me courage? I guess I will never comprehend it because... this is the beautiful blur of the “After Hours”"
13,Uses and types of Islamic talismans-taweez in the folklore of arabic people,social-issues," The Islamic talismans-taweez has been used for centuries in the muslim world. Banned in some countries, they are used secretly and freely in others. With the time, their fame grew up and in modern times, due to the flourish of instant communication methods, the talismans got more and more fans and followers even in the non-muslim communities around the world. But why is that? What is the difference between the Islamic talismans and any other type of talismans so that the taweez influence around the world grows? The main difference is that the Islamic talismans are mainly made on the foundation of mathematics , which is by itself an exact science. In their preparation are used highly complex equations following exact numerological and logical rules, found and established hundreds of years ago. Some of them came from pre-islamic times. On the other side there is some kind of pseudo-seals-sigil talismans, with strange unknown figures , look like drawn by an abstinent junkie. Yes, we are talking about Goetia and other Grimoires. Which signs has no logical explanation and can be drawn by 5-year-old kid. Even in the empowerment - when doing the taweez - certain name or phrase has to be recited certain amount of times following exact logic, so to evoke certain powers or spirits by using trance-like state of mind. In the western talismans, the empowering is just wishful thinking and hope something to happen...which usually don't...Or using 'enns' - 'sacred words' - nobody knows from where came that word. We believe that someone got drunk and decide to make a joke with the people and no one can tell what is the idea behind these monkey sounds. And last but not least - thousands of muslim occultists were involved in researching the secrets of the unseen for centuries. They even influenced the invention of the Kabbalah in mauritanic Spain, while the religious institutions in Europe put a dark veil on any kind of research for centuries. Only single occultists from time to time dare to appear in the history. But what is the idea of using all the talismans? From the beginning of human history, they are used for different purposes in everyday life. The Islamic talismans don't make exception. In now days they are used for protection against evil, diseases and accidents, for gaining higher salary, for improving of health, for success in every field of life and for luck. Of course - for finding suitable partner, for return of lost love or for hate, separation between two lovers and for revenge. We all are used to imagine something that we put on the neck or in wallet when we hear the word talisman. But a lot of these items used for solving everyday problems may not be worn by people. For example - the muslim taweez for protection can be put in your car, so to be in safe from accidents and car crashes. Other type of every day taweez is one for protection of home - usually this type of amulets are put near the entrance door of home so to stop the bad energies from coming inside. There is one interesting fact connected to the front doors. Some love binding and separation taweez are also putted around the front door, typically under the threshold so the targeted person can walk on them and activate the items. It is believed that the home protection taweez are used not only against evil spiritual forces, like djinns and spirits, but also against physical manifestations of evil - robbers and calamities. Other very interesting type of everyday taweez is the one used for attraction of clients in shop. On a noticeable place in the center of the shop a talisman is hanged on a cord from the roof or the lamp, so any movement of the air can swing and move it. Talking about such air taweez - we must note one type of love back talismans, which has to be tied with a thread to hang on a living sweet tree like cherry, so to be swing by the wind and attract the wanted person. The problem of that kind of item is the big possibility of the item getting wet from rain. Other interesting type is the love back taweez with fire. A metal plate is engraved with the symbols and then everyday put on fire, so the plate get hot like the heart of the beloved one. But another metal plate taweez is not so harmless - if special talisman is engraved on a lead plate and then thrown on the roof of the enemy house - the possibility he to left his home or the home get in ruins is very big. As you may find - there are also water taweez - usually to dissolve in water and gave to a person to drink or sprinkle around. Mainly these items are connected with love and health matters. But there are also another type of water taweez, which has to be thrown in a river daily for 40 days to accomplish their purpose. This is very hard work to do, especially if you don't live around river."
14,QUESTIONING LEADERSHIP,social-issues," 13 TO LEARN ABOUT TEACHINGS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CONTROL US AUTHORITARIAN DOCTRINES THE TEACHINGS AND DECISIONS FROM LEADERSHIP CANNOT BE QUESTIONED I can’t begin to tell you how dangerous this teaching is not only concerning our spiritual growth but our very physical welfare. There are some teachers of the Word of God who claim that every word they say is anointed (received directly from the person of the Holy Spirit) such that whatever is commanded is to be obeyed without question. Where do they derive this kind of perspective from? Believe it or not, it does have a biblical basis in the Old Testament. However, does it have the same relevance for the New Testament saint? In my younger years, following my conversion to the Christian faith, I became involved in a non-denominational church that I was and still am thankful for. I learned that I’m a new creature in Christ. I learned that Christ finished the Father’s work for all mankind on the cross. I learned to rely on the ministry of the Holy Spirit. And I learned that God wants to be ever-present in my life. However, there were times when I would hear certain teachings that just didn’t seem right. In some cases, the assembly was asked to sell their real estate holdings and give all of the proceeds to the church. There were stories of certain church members, some of whom were in leadership, that held a different perspective on certain non-foundational biblical topics other than the doctrinal platform of the church and were approached and asked to change their view or leave. Questioning leadership about areas of sinful public actions that some in leadership were engaged in were usually responded to by rebuking those who brought them up. For me, this was very confusing and troubling. As a young Christian, I didn’t have enough of a solid foundation in doctrine in order to be able to discern biblically what was scriptural and what was not. And the last thing I wanted to do was make the leadership mad at me. I enjoyed what I perceived as God’s working in the ministry (e.g., Bible studies, children’s ministry, street witnessing, Bible school, Christian radio, etc.). However, the day arrived when all of this came to a head. Many of the leaders whom I had become acquainted with from when I got involved in this church had left the ministry. Attempts to rewrite unscriptural-based church theology were thwarted. Accusations from the church hierarchy were made against those who tried to express their concerns and see changes come about that they were not supportive or faithful to the ministry anymore. How could a church that was so fruitful on the one hand become so oppressive on the other? This is what we’re about to take a look at in this study. Unless a believer is solidly grounded in Scripture, it might be difficult to understand what were the factors that were behind what I would call an unreasonable use of power. In the book of 1 Peter, there are some verses that exemplify this sentiment. Please go to chapter 5. 1 Peter 5:1-3 1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: The Apostle Peter was addressing the elders (the pastors) of those churches made up of Christian Jews, who were living in foreign countries, thus being strangers to their native land. In his address, he contrasted those qualities of leadership that are God-centered and those qualities of leadership that are self-centered. Let’s begin with those qualities that are God-centered. 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. An elder is to care for the church over which they are called to preside, i.e., as a shepherd cares for his flock. A shepherd should protect his sheep from thieves and marauders; go before the herd and search out the land for grazing, making sure that there was nothing there to harm them (e.g., poisonous plants; dangerous animals; snakes; pits; etc.); seek out a wayward sheep and give it personal attention; discipline a sheep that was too rebellious; carry a sheep if [it] got [injured,] and at the close of each day would examine each sheep and anoint their bruises with healing oil and remove briars from their wool.177 They would be characterized in their care for the well-being of the flock by being willingly (according to God’s will), of a ready mind (cheerfully; from the promptings of divine love), and as being ensamples to the flock. What are ensamples? Ensamples are those believers who imitate the character of Christ in their life. They live in such a way to be emulated by others. They are those whose authority is by [the] influence of reason, persuasion, and example.178 And they are also those who feed them with knowledge and understanding?179 Jeremiah 3:15. Then Peter conveyed to them what should not characterize the care for the spiritual well-being of the flock. The spiritual care for the congregation should be not by constraint (not by compulsion) and not for filthy lucre (to not take care of the believers merely for the sake of a salary, but from a real desire to serve). Then he made this final comment as to what we’re talking about here. And that pastors should not be lords over God’s heritage (God’s possession; the church). The words lords over have a few meanings. This refers to someone who exercises unreasonable power over others. Someone who is continually shouting orders. Someone who exercises dominion. Someone who exerts strict control, is oppressive, and unjustly severe. This doesn’t mean to say that there won’t be times when a pastor or anyone in leadership has to make difficult decisions. There could be an instance when a believer no longer believes in a foundational truth of the faith (e.g., the deity of Christ, the Trinity, the resurrection of Christ, etc.). Another occurrence might be that of someone in the assembly evidencing an egregious sin (e.g., adultery, fornication, homosexuality, etc.) that needs to be addressed. So, when someone in leadership emphatically proclaims that their teachings and decisions cannot be questioned, what might be the biblical basis for supporting such a pronouncement? The first thing we’ll take a look at is how do they perceive themselves in the eyes of God? Let’s begin by going to the book of Exodus. Exodus 3:1-4:12 3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. When Moses kept his father in law’s sheep in Midian, an angel of the Lord appeared to him out of the midst of a burning bush. 3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. The angel conveyed to Moses that he had seen the affliction of his people and would like him to bring them out from their slavery to a land flowing with milk and honey by going to Pharaoh to ask him for their release so that they could travel three days into the wilderness and sacrifice unto their God. 4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. As soon as Moses heard that he would have to go before Pharaoh and speak, he freaked out. You see, he had an issue with stuttering and thought that this should disqualify him from being the one chosen to undertake this directive. But God told him, I will take care of that issue and will teach you what you should say (I will tell you what to [say] at the right time180). What someone in leadership might take from God’s response to Moses was that, like him, God would let him/her know what to say when the time comes. And if this is indeed the case, then those in leadership can’t be questioned for what they say because God gave them the words to speak. Another example like this one is found in the book of 2 Samuel. Suggested Reading: 2 Samuel 7:1-17 5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? King David was thinking about the fact that the ark of the covenant was located within the curtains of a portable tent-like structure called the Tabernacle. His desire was for a permanent dwelling to contain the ark. He conveyed this sentiment to one of the prophets of Israel named Nathan. That night, the prophet received a direct word from God. Some of the words of this direct revelation were Thus saith the Lord. There are the keywords. At various times, God spoke by direct revelation to individual leaders (e.g., Moses, Joshua, the prophets, the kings of Israel, etc.). Whether this was to provide an answer in regard to making a pivotal decision. Whether this was an answer to prayer. Whether this was to declare to the children of Israel His instructions, they were to respond to what they heard without complaining or disobedience. By using this perspective, a leader in the New Testament church might conclude that as the children of Israel were to be obedient to their leaders, so should the assembly of believers be submissive to the spiritual leaders of the church (e.g., apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers) without questioning. What else might seem to support a leader’s view that what they say goes, i.e., what verses are used to support a biblical perspective on any particular topic? There is a saying that goes something like this; the Bible can say anything that we want it to say. This is actually a true statement. This holds true for us as well as for those in leadership. Another avenue that could be used by those in leadership to support their assumption that they have absolute authority as to a doctrinal position, decision, or teaching is whether they use Old Testament verses and perceptions to provide a narrative as to how to translate New Testament verses to substantiate a doctrinal perspective. Those leaders who use this approach are called non-dispensationalists. This means that they can use any verse or verses from the Old Testament to perpetuate a doctrinal position that must be followed by the assembly of believers in the New Testament church. Let’s give you one example of what I mean. Please go to the book of Psalms. Suggested Reading: Psalm 51:1-4 This was a Psalm of David when Nathan, the prophet, came to him after he had sexual relations with a married woman named Bathsheba. Some commentators say that nine months had elapsed after David’s illicit relationship with Bathsheba and his directive to have her husband, Uriah, killed in battle. Still, he had not repented of his sins of adultery and murder. The murderous act that David committed displeased the Lord. So, He decided to send the prophet Nathan to tell him that there would be consequences for his actions, such as: ●Evil would arise against him from his own house.                                                                                        ●His many wives will have relations with others.                                                                                         ●His child with Bathsheba will die. 2 Samuel 12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. David responded and finally repented for his transgressions, and the Lord granted him mercy by not inflicting upon him the penalty of death. Psalm 51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. And then he made this incredible statement as to whom he was accountable for in respect to the sins he had committed. He said that against God, and God only had he sinned. He apparently wasn’t responsible for confessing his sin to Bathsheba for his indiscretion of taking her for himself. Neither was he accountable for going to her deceased husband’s family and confessing sorrow for his actions toward their son. And neither did he declare to the nation his egregious sins and express contrition for what he had done. As we can see, a New Testament leader might take these verses and this approach in respect to the committing of their own sin against someone in the assembly. Let’s say a leader has had an affair with a fellow believer’s wife, and the husband finds out about it and decides to try to address the matter. Matthew 18:15-17 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. When the leader is approached by the husband alone, his response to this inquiry might be to mention Psalms 51:4 and say that he is only accountable to God for discipline. Second, he could also say that the word brother in verse 15 only refers to a fellow believer and not someone in leadership. So, therefore this would substantiate his perspective that the offended husband has no scriptural basis to address his or any leader’s sin. He might further offer the husband advice to give the matter over to God to handle it. There could be one more avenue that a leader could use to support his/her claim that the words and decisions from their mouth are from God, and that is that their declarations and decisions can appear justified by using one verse or one section of scripture from the New Testament. An example of this is found in the book of 1 Corinthians. Suggested Reading: 1 Corinthians 4:1-16 15 For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. Paul was addressing one of many issues that were going on in the church at Corinth. This one had to do with the inclination of the assembly to listen to the teachings of many instructors instead of following those like himself, who were identified as being a spiritual father. 6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. As far as their perception about those in leadership, some of them were evaluating ministers by their own personal preferences and prejudices, which could be in regard to talents, gifts, knowledge, etc., instead of a mindset that was based on the Word of God. And if it’s true that a minister differs from another minister in these things, then Paul stated that this comes from God and therefore gratitude toward Him should be expressed for such. However, whatever it is that has been received from Him shouldn’t be used as the basis for a leader to boast or likewise for those who follow the leader to boast. What did the Apostle Paul mean when he said that the Corinthian believers had become followers of ten thousand instructors and no longer of those considered as fathers? The words ten thousand instructors refer to the many instructors during the culture who were known as Paedagoguses. A Paedagogus was a slave to whom boys were entrusted on leaving the care of the females, which was somewhere about their sixteenth year. He was often a foreigner, sometimes educated and refined, but often otherwise, for Plutarch complains that seamen, traders, usurers, and farmers [were] engaged in this capacity. The office was one of general guardianship, not of instruction, though sometimes the Paedagogus acted as a teacher. He accompanied the boy to school, carrying his books, etc., and attended him to the gymnasium and elsewhere.181 To emphasize, what I wanted you to remember was that for the most part, this instructor accompanied the child to school but was not their special teacher. Who is a special teacher? A special teacher was alluded to by Paul as one whom he called a father. This was someone who caused the Christians at Corinth to have a personal relationship with Christ through the presentation of the gospel and their response to it, as was not the case for the myriad of instructors who were simply guardians. And as one of these fathers, the apostle himself made the following statement. 16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. With that said, there are those in leadership who, because they believe they are God’s ultimate spokesperson, would translate the word followers as those in the assembly who were to follow their church leaders exclusively. If we were to hear such teachings from the pulpit, I’m sure that we might agree that those who are called to any of the leadership positions (e.g., apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers) in the New Testament church are to be obeyed unequivocally when they bring forth a message or decision that they allege is from God. Right? How would we know what church leaders have said in their teachings or the decisions they are asking the assembly to implement are from God? We wouldn’t. What could we do that might help us in this regard? The answer is multi-faceted. Study the Word. Pray to God for guidance or direction in this area. Get tapes, books, videos, etc., that pertain to the topic of the teaching at hand or the decisions that are being commanded to be implemented. Now we know why some New Testament leaders might require the congregation to obey them in everything they say and do. This brings us to the next question. Is there any scriptural basis for not supporting the conjecture by leadership that their teachings and decisions must be obeyed and cannot be questioned? Some leaders will say that Moses was a type of those believers who are called to leadership positions in the New Testament church. As he heard from God and instructed the people, so they heard from God and instructed the people. However, what we’ll find out is that Moses was not a type of leader in the New Testament church as being a mediator between the assembly of believers and God the Father. Let’s take a further look at this by going to the book of 1 Corinthians. Suggested Reading: 1 Corinthians 10:1-13 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; The Jews were under obligation to Moses in the experiences of the Exodus, such as when they passed through the Red Sea as it rose in walls on each side providing safe passage from the ensuing Egyptians, and when they were under the cloud, the ""Shechinah"" - the visible symbol of the divine presence and protection that attended them out of Egypt. This went before them by day as a cloud to guide them, and by night it became a pillar of fire to give them light.182 What we could say about Moses is that he could be considered as the mediator between them and their God (Jehovah). However, the insinuation that Moses was a type/mediator of the leadership of a New Testament church and because of such Christians are obligated to submit to church authority (e.g., apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastor-teachers) with regard to all of their teachings and decisions is scripturally unfounded. If a leader in the New Testament is not a mediator between the assembly and God the Father, then who is? Please go to the book of 1 Timothy, and we’ll find out. 1 Timothy 2:3-6 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. The Apostle Paul was conveying to Timothy that it’s God’s (the Fathers’) desire for all men not only to be saved but to come to the knowledge (advanced knowledge) of the truth (doctrine; an organized body of Christian teaching or doctrine183). Coming to the full knowledge of the faith is not only for their spiritual growth but also so that they would be able to recognize false teaching and not be led astray. Then Paul declared as to who it is that provided certainty, which would allow someone to have the opportunity to be saved. He said that this spiritual benefit was because of the one who is the mediator between God the Father and mankind, and that person is Christ Jesus. The word mediator means a middle person, one whose office it is to reconcile two parties at enmity; … a [peacemaker]. God was offended with the crimes of men; [and] to restore them to his peace, Jesus Christ was incarnated. But this reconciliation required a sacrifice on the part of the [peacemaker] or mediator184, which He accomplished. What we can conclude is that those in church leadership are not mediators between God the Father and mankind. However, we must consider that certain things that took place in the Old Testament also took place in the New Testament, such as the disclosing of hidden truths by means of direct revelation, which is an act of God the Holy Spirit imparting to the Bible writers, truth incapable of being discovered by man's unaided reason (2:10-12); [and] inspiration, the act of God the Holy Spirit enabling the Bible writers to write down in God-chosen words, infallibly, the truth revealed (2:13).185 So, what I’m saying is that there were certain times when New Testament leadership spoke words given to them by direct revelation. The question that now remains is, once the canon of Scripture was completed, were the words spoken then and now by those in leadership still received by direct revelation? In order to find this out, please go to the book of 1 John. 1 John 2:27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. Before we translate this verse, we’re told according to Ephesians 4:11-12 that God calls and qualifies some believers to the office leadership gifts of apostle, prophet, evangelist, and pastor-teacher. Ephesians 4:11-12 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: This calling is for the collective purpose of the perfecting (for the mending, repair, or correcting all that is deficient; to restore to a proper place) of the saints; for the work of the ministry (in order to do what they should do as believers; spiritual service of an official character); for the edifying (through the instruction of divine things) of the body of Christ so that every member might become mature or fully grown. As we might assume that in order for those in leadership to be able to carry out the purposes mentioned, they themselves would need to have been taught by others of these divine things; they would have needed to have learned how to address the weaknesses of their flesh by confession and recovery, and they would have needed to have been involved in ministry work. You can’t give to others what you don’t have or what you haven’t received. With that said, let’s translate the verse from 1 John. The anointing, the person of the Holy Spirit, which you have received of Christ abides (has taken up permanent residency) in you. And you need not that any man teach you, meaning that no teacher, even a God-appointed one, is the only and ultimate source of the saint's instruction.186 The same anointing, the Holy Spirit, teacheth you of all things (under the guidance of the Spirit you must test the teaching of men as you search the Bible for yourself (cf. Acts 17:11)187; he endues us with judgment and discernment, lest we should be deceived by lies188). This doesn’t tell us as to how much of what a leader says is directly given to them by the Holy Spirit, but what it does say is that not everything they teach and the decisions they impose are from the anointing of the Holy Spirit. With what we have just learned, a better definition of the anointing can now be enumerated as to the words conveyed by those in the leadership positions of the church. As to the words spoken under the anointing, these words are merely men’s words, but the Holy Spirit is especially present to help our infirmity in conveying the best sense or meaning. Furthermore, it’s impossible for God to be present in that which is untrue or unbiblically impossible that false and unscriptural teaching be anointed teaching at the same time.189 I know we have covered a lot of ground and have mentioned some new terminology. But the response to the question at hand wouldn’t be complete without adding this extra tidbit. I think we would agree that at times there were those leaders in the early church that spoke by means of direct revelation, where we could define the word revelation as meaning something not known to them, a new truth previously unveiled and eventually written down in the New Testament canon. With that in mind, here is the question to consider. Once the canon of Scripture was completed, is it possible for a church leader to continue to speak by divine revelation? Please go to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. This is an interesting verse in that it tells us that he that is spiritual, judges (discerns; evaluates) all things along with the people of the Spirit. What does it mean when someone is referred to as being spiritual? The word spiritual will help us clarify whether a leader in the church can continue to declare that they have received direct revelation from the Holy Spirit. This word means one who is under the influence of the Spirit. It can also mean someone to whom divine insight is imparted.190 I don’t know if you ever heard of this before, but there are two words that can refer to the impartation of divine insight by means of the Holy Spirit? Ephesians 6:17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: The first word is rhema, and the second is illumination. What does the word rhema mean? Rhema means the word which the Lord speaks the second time.191 This is the word of God that He has already spoken and which He conveys to us personally. It could be a verse, a word or words, or a section of Scripture. In this verse, the English word is transliterated from the Greek word reema. Luke 24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. The word illuminate means that the Spirit conveys to us divine insight about a word or words in a verse or section of Scripture. This is the idea behind the words And their eyes were opened. So, with that said, the terminology of saying that a believer has received revelation from God is no longer appropriate. Now, let’s address the second aspect of this topic as pertaining to using Old Testament verses to provide a perspective for New Testament doctrine. In most cases, the verses that are used to support a doctrinal position on salvation and sanctification for the New Testament believer should not come from the commands of the Old Testament. This might appear to be a surprising statement, so let me try to clarify what I mean. There are certain scriptural studies that use verses from the Old Testament that will enhance our learning about a biblical topic. For instance, if we were doing a study on God’s attributes, verses from the Old Testament could definitely illustrate these in a more realistic way because of the many stories that are recorded there. Another consideration for using verses from the Old Testament would be in the realm of doing a study on prophecy (future events that have come to pass and future events that have not come to pass). And still, when trying to get a full understanding as to why a Savior/Messiah was needed, the Old Testament can provide a wealth of knowledge on this. Furthermore, there are practical lessons that we can learn such as watching what we say with our words; if married, discern those instances when we’re attracted someone else; be careful as to how much alcohol we consume, etc. One more thing which we shouldn’t forget is the examples of those Old Testament saints who confided in God amidst trials and persecutions and God’s faithfulness in response to them, which gives us hope that He will do the same for us. And while there could be a few more reasons as to why Old Testament verses could teach us, there is clearly one thing that won’t help us, i.e., in respect to a New Testament believer’s salvation and sanctification (by sanctification I’m referring to the renewing of the mind). Do you know what this is about? When I say it, then please hold onto your hat. It’s what has to do with the various types of mandates under the Mosaic Law. Uh, Oh. This is the institution that the Jews were given to obey by God both for their spiritual welfare and physical well-being. If we were to take a general snapshot of what the Mosaic Law pertained to, then this is what we would be referring to. ●Statutes - The Spiritual Code - the ordinances of the Law (e.g., the Tabernacle, the Holy Days, the Offerings, the High Priest, the Meat Offering, the Trespass Offering, the Levites, etc.) Exodus 26-31; 35-40; Leviticus 1-24; Deuteronomy 16 ●Commandments - The Moral Code which included not only the ten commandments called the Decalogue (e.g., honor thy father and thy mother…Exodus 20:12-17) but more than one hundred other commandments (e.g., thou shalt have no other gods before me; the Sabbath,…thou shalt not do any work…; thou shalt truly tithe… Exodus 20:12-17; Deuteronomy 5:6-21; Deuteronomy 12; Deuteronomy 14:22 ●Judgments - The Social Code, which are the laws belonging to civil government. (e.g., dietary, marriage, military, conservation, etc., along with the related consequences (punishment). Deuteronomy 14-28 ●Testimonies - The laws directing the commemoration of certain events (e.g., Seventh year Sabbath rest; the fiftieth year, the year of Jubilee; the ordinance of the Passover; the feast of unleavened bread; etc.). Exodus 12:43-50; Numbers 28: 16-25; Deuteronomy 25-26 You might respond by asking what scriptural proof is there to support the conjecture that a Christian is no longer mandated to keep any of the many commands of the Mosaic Law? Please go to the book of Acts. Suggested Reading: Acts 15:1-30 1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses. 24a Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised,… There were certain Jewish Christians who contended with Paul and Barnabas, teaching that the Gentile believers must be circumcised in order to be saved. In other words, what they were saying was, ""A Gentile must first become a Jew before he can become a Christian! It’s not sufficient for them simply to trust Jesus Christ…""192 It’s obvious that they wanted to incorporate some of the aspects of the Mosaic Law into the requisites of repentance and belief for salvation. To say this in another way, repentance and belief were not enough to receive the Holy Spirit along with additional blessings. So, Paul and Barnabas decided to go to the Jerusalem church in order to discuss this matter with the apostles and elders, who were ministering there. After much discussion, a conclusion on this issue was arrived at, which stated that an epistle would be written and given in the care of four men, Paul, Barnabas, Judas, and Silas, who would take and read it before the assemblies of the churches of Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia informing them as to what were the obligations that the Gentile believers needed to abide by. But if not for salvation, what about adherence to the Mosaic Law for spiritual growth? 24b and keep the law… But there was something else that these Christian Jews believed, and that was after someone was saved by circumcision, they must keep the Mosaic Law. Another way of saying this was, whatever the protocol for a New Testament Gentile believer to grow spiritually, the keeping of the Law was also to be a part of this process. What was the response to these declarations? Did a Gentile convert need to keep the Sabbath; did they need to tithe, did they need to attend the synagogue, did they need to keep the Ten Commandments or any other aspect of the Mosaic Law? The answer to this was the same answer as to whether a Gentile believer needed to be circumcised in order to be saved. Are you ready for it? 24c …to whom we gave no such commandment: My perception of what this response said was that a Gentile believer was not obligated to obey the Mosaic Law for salvation or sanctification. None of the tenets of the Mosaic Law are to be included in the salvation process of repentance and faith. And none of the tenets of the Mosaic Law can be included in the sanctification process of the Spiritual Growth doctrines, some of which are the confession of sin and recovery, the renewal of the mind, and being under the rule of the Spirit. What about the Jewish Christians? I think the message was pretty clear. What is good for the Gentile believers is what is good for the Jewish Christians. However, this doesn’t mean that the Jews could no longer keep any of the cultural aspects of the Law in respect to the Messiah/Savior, Jesus Christ, whom they now believe in, and can subsequently use these teachings as a schoolmaster (the Law was like a person who was making us behave193) to bring others to Christ. I hope this helps to inform us as to the significance of the Old Testament Scriptures and what they can provide Christians with aside from salvation and sanctification. Are you ready to look at the final aspect of this study as to whether the implication that one verse or section of Scripture could be used to support the conjecture that a leader’s teachings and decisions cannot be questioned? We’ll begin by going to the book of Acts. Suggested Reading: Acts 17:10-14 Paul and Silas have left Thessalonica and have arrived in the city of Berea. They entered the synagogue and preached unto them the gospel. What they found out was that the Bereans were willing to listen and examine as to whether the promises and types (of the Old Testament) corresponded with the alleged [fulfillment] in the person, works, and sufferings of Jesus Christ.194 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. The Bereans searched (made careful and exact research against) the scriptures daily in order [to] see if what Paul had said agreed with what the Scriptures said.195 In like manner, you and I should make careful and exact research against the Scriptures concerning what has been taught to us by those in leadership. And when we do this, hopefully, we’ll incorporate a process known as hermeneutics while operating under the guidance of the Spirit. This protocol refers to scriptural interpretation based on an analysis of grammatical features, whether of Hebrew for the Old Testament Scriptures, the Koine Greek for the New Testament Scriptures, and Aramaic for both the Old and New Testaments, along with the historical background (the cultural background) of the text. What we’re going to take a look at next is a verse that affirms the conjecture that a believer should examine scripturally whenever someone in leadership says that such and such must be obeyed. Please go to the book of 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 2:15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. There is someone who is able to judge (discern) all things spiritual, and that is he who is spiritual (one who is under the influence of the Spirit; to whom divine insight is imparted196). Each believer, and not just those in leadership, has the opportunity to be spiritual. There is not much left to say. A verse that we’ll take a look at next clearly indicates that whether we’re called to a leadership position in the church or not, if we learn how to walk in the Spirit, then God will put His laws into our minds and write them in our hearts. We’ll find this verse in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: Those who are being referred to here are spiritual Israel, i.e., those Jews who are born-again. While contrast is being made between the Old and New Covenants, those Jews who repented and believed in Christ will have His laws put into their mind and written in their hearts. What does this mean? The word laws mean that they would not be mere external observances but would affect the conscience and the heart. Some would say that these are the laws from the Old Covenant, those given under the institution of the Mosaic Law. However, what Scripture makes clear is that the New Covenant under grace has different laws. These are mentioned in the book of James. James 1:25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. The word law means teaching. And the words perfect law of liberty means [or, teaching] that sets us free from sin and death.197 The idea being expressed here is that no one has exclusivity in receiving teaching from God that benefits them spiritually. THE FINAL THING THAT WE’LL TAKE A LOOK AT IS WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE WHEN WE HEAR WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE INSPIRED MESSAGES. 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21 Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. The Apostle Paul was warning the Thessalonian believers not to formulate a mindset where they think that they no longer have a need for continual prophesyings (inspired and intelligible messages198). On the other hand, they shouldn’t be lax in just listening to anything that is said and believe it. He told them to make sure that they Prove all things. The meaning of these words is that they were to carefully examine everything proposed for their belief. They were not to receive it on trust; to take it on assertion; to believe it because it was urged with vehemence, zeal, or plausibility. In the various opinions and doctrines which were submitted to them for adoption, they were to apply the appropriate tests from reason and the [Word] of God, and what they found to be true they were to embrace; what was false they were to reject.199 And so, if the Word of God clearly advocates that whatever we hear from someone in leadership should be tested according to the Word of God and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, then likewise those in leadership should be those who exemplify such protocols in their teachings and decisions. With these thoughts in mind, the translation of a verse that we looked at earlier from the book of 1 Corinthians would be entirely different. 1 Corinthians 4:16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. If a spiritual leader, like the Apostle Paul, says, be ye followers of me, what should be deduced is follow my example as I follow Christ in the special virtues of humility, self-denial, and faithfulness.200 In summary, don’t take everything you hear from the pulpit for granted. This doesn’t mean that we’re always trying to find something wrong with what was being said, but what it does mean is that it should be tested. If a leader you are listening to says that he/she has exclusive access to God and that you should submit to their every word and directive, then jump on your spiritual horse and ride out of there. We have answered a lot of questions as to whether a leader’s teachings and decisions could be questioned by any member of an assembly. Because of such, I’m going to leave you with a bullet list for easy referral as to what was found. ●A pastor should not exercise unreasonable power or strict control over God’s people. 1 Peter 5:3 ●Moses, Joshua, the prophets, and some of the kings of Israel received direct revelation from God and, as directed by Him, conveyed these instructions to the Jewish people. Exodus 3:10, 13 Likewise, direct revelation was given by God to certain leaders of the early church. Galatians 1:8-9 While Moses and others in the Old Testament acted as mediators between God and men, in the New Testament, the mediator between God and men is Jesus Christ. 1 Timothy 2:3-5 ●Once the canon of Scripture was completed, there was no longer any new revelation. Messages that are brought forth should be under the anointing, i.e., under the guidance of the Spirit, who helps convey the best sense or meanings of the words spoken. 1 John 2:27 The Spirit can also provide each believer with a rhema (a personal word that God has already spoken) Ephesians 6:17 and illumination (divine insight about a particular word or section of Scripture). Luke 14:31 ●The direct revelation that God gave to certain ones in the Old Testament, which was then spoken to the people, was to be obeyed by them; otherwise, consequences would be incurred. Deuteronomy 4:1 However, for those who are called to the leadership positions of the New Testament church, what they communicate to the assembly should be tested according to the Word of God and the ministry of the Holy Spirit. 1 John 2:27; Acts 17:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21 ●New Testament saints cannot be saved or grow spiritually by obeying any of the commands of the Mosaic Law. Acts 15:1-30 ●One verse or section of Scripture should not be used to support any doctrinal perspective or decision, let alone the conjecture that a New Testament leaders’ teachings and decisions must be obeyed and not questioned under any circumstances. Acts 17:10-14; 1 Corinthians 2:15; Hebrews 8:10; James 1:25 That was a lot of information disseminated. However, there is more to study and uncover. Another Authoritarian Doctrine that we’ll look at next is one that I really haven’t heard or read much about over my thirty plus years of being a born-again Christian. It’s one that I haven’t even studied before. Are you ready to find out what this pertains to?

15,The Phenomena of Suicide Bombings: Root Causes and Impact on Humanity,social-issues," Suicide attacks or bombings have occurred throughout human history which is typically connecting an explosion and attackers enthusiastically accept their own death as a weapon. Modern suicide bombing began in 1981 in Lebanon during the Israeli occupation of Lebanon however, it achieved worldwide notoriety in 1983, first with an attack against the U.S. embassy in Beirut that killed 63 people and then with simultaneous car bombings of U.S. and French military barracks, also in Beirut, that killed 299 more (Kiras, 2019, p.2). Over the last 25 years, suicide attacks have become an alarming threat as a political tool that has been adopted by several organizations in Sri Lanka, Palestine and the occupied territories, Turkey, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and, in particular, by the Al-Qaeda-led insurgency in Iraq in its struggle against the US and its allies (Tosini, 2009, p.1). Any conflicts including suicide bombing have negatively affected education, health, economy, infrastructures, rule of law, and justice with a direct impact on social, cultural, and political life. These include reduced per capita income, food insecurity, increased exposure to violence by joining as a suicide weapon, and decreased overall well-being due to social isolation. Based on numerous researches, it is obvious that the global community has and will continue to experience common fear of suicide attracts which creates severe insecurity at the national, regional, and global levels. This study pursues to discuss the root causes of suicide bombings and how it has strangely impacted human security in several ways including severe insecurity of life, economy, food, health, education, justice and as well as related political, social, cultural, and security risks impacting peace and human rights. In the twenty-first century, the effects of suicide bombings have brought reflective penalties for humanity. The annual report-2020 on suicide bombings conducted by the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), Israel shows that over 3,000 suicide bombings were committed in 45 countries over the past decade, in which over some 31,000 people were killed and some 57,000 were injured (INSS Insight, 2021, p4). According to the INSS report, the countries that suffered the most suicide bombings in the decade were Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. The report endures remarking that whether the decline in suicide bombings in recent years results from the diminishing returns from this activity, or from a combination of the circumstances of the organizations involved and improved counteraction capabilities on the part of the countries attacked will become clear in the following decade” (INSS, 2021, p.4). This study has been conducted based on mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative research) to display more comprehensive insights into the diverse impacts caused by the suicide bombing on humanity. Sources were mainly drawn from peer-reviewed journals, literature reviews, reports, NGO and government publications. Keyword searches were executed in academic databases, then sources were selected based on importance and input to the topic. Search terms included: suicide bombing, human security, and suicide weapon, psychological, political, and social aspects of the phenomena of suicide bombing, violence, access to law and justice during suicide attracts, and health, education, insecurity, and suicide bombing. Qualitative sources demonstrated the motives, ideology, socio-economic and mental health influences of the individual toward the decision of suicide bombers, while quantitative sources provided hard data on suicide bombings, effects of the suicide bombing on the victim’s region and global level. The root cause, moral logic, and growth of suicide terrorism depend on several aspects, which is extremely challenging to identify the motives of perpetrators towards the decision of suicide bombers. Atran (2006) argued that those who believe suicide terrorism can be explained by a single political root cause, such as the presence of foreign military forces or the absence of democracy, ignore psychological motivations, including religious inspirations, which can trump rational self-interest to produce horrific or heroic behavior in ordinary people (p.144). There is no doubt that political uncertainties and absenteeism of rule of law/democracy create a massive logical/metaphysical influence for a specific group/believer to become suicide extremist, however, there are also numerous internal factors including psychological/mental circumstances, educational/family upbringings, religious/cultural inspirations as the root causes to performance insensitive activities as a suicide bomber. In general, most of the perpetrators willingly act as suicide weapons based on their life perspectives/vision on the other hand, sometimes attackers are indoctrinated/ brainwashed, or the financial incentive for family plays a role or a minor conducts a suicide attack unwillingly. Gupta and Mundra (2005) conducted a study on suicide bombing as a strategic weapon and they disclosed an empirical investigation report of Hamas and Islamic Jihad within Israel and the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The persistence of this study was to empirically validate that contrary to popular belief, suicide attacks are prudently orchestrated, politically motivated actions, reflecting the committing group’s deliberate goals and purposes. They have chosen to examine attacks by Hamas and Islamic Jihad within its political margins and those directed by the Palestinian Authorities (PA), covering the thirteen-year span from 1991to 2003. This study has two primary goals: first, they empirically test the three sets of overlapping hypotheses outlined above: (a) suicide bombing as a ‘‘spoiler’’ for the peace process, (b) a reaction to Israeli provocation, and (c) an outcome of competition and cooperation among the major dissident Palestinian groups. Second, having developed a behavioral model, they seek reasons for the apparent preference for these groups for choosing suicide attacks over other forms of violent protest (Gupta & Mundra, 2005, p.575). This study was conducted with an estimate of the relevant persistent through explanatory questions by using a Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Ratio and then checked their robustness by re-estimating the model with the help of a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) as an interrelated system. Consequently, the first group of studies examined the motivations of individual participants to engage in suicide attacks, while the second set of studies analyzed the attacks from the perspective of a group. Gupta and Mundra (2005) mentioned that based on their group-level analysis, they were not able to comment on the rationality of the individual participants, however, the ability of their empirical model in explaining the large variance of the revealed preferences of the two groups firmly establishes that the campaign of suicide bombings is an integral part of a calculated strategic choice by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. In fact, the choice of suicide bombings, which does not aim at a military victory but takes aim at sowing the greatest amount of mistrust among Jews and Palestinians, appears to be ‘‘rational’’ to many in the Palestinian community (p.590). The results indicate that the two groups deliberately use suicide bombings as strategic weapons within the larger Israeli-Palestinian political milieu. This study emphasizes the need to develop appropriate analytical capabilities to distinguish among terrorist groups and their motivations, ideologies, and tactics. In the context of the relationship between suicide bombers’ characteristics and their performance in the suicide bombing attacks, a quantitative study was conducted by Benmelech and Berrebi (2007), revealed that the suicide bomber’s age and education and the importance of the target are strongly correlated; older and more-educated suicide bombers are assigned to attack more important targets (p.236). In this study, the authors stretched evidence-based on a unique database constructed from reports of the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) containing detailed information on all suicide attacks (biographies of suicide bombers, the targets they attacked, and the number of people that they killed and injured) by Palestinians against Israeli targets in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip between September 2000 and August 2005. They excluded suicide attacks that were launched by non-Palestinians or in which they could not identify the target. In this study, they found a total of 135 suicide bombing attacks carried out by 148 suicide bombers. Their sample represents 89 percent of the total number of suicide attacks between September 2000 and August 2005, 88 percent of the suicide bombers, and 98 percent of the Israelis who were killed in suicide attacks (p.225). The authors enhanced the biographical data with information from the websites of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Their sample includes 148 (eight female and 140 male) suicide bombers with their names, membership in a terror organization, age, city of residence, marital status, and whether they had an academic degree or were enrolled in a higher education institution. The youngest suicide bomber was 12 years old, and the oldest was 48. By this measure, 18 percent of the suicide bombers went beyond high school education, compared with only 8 percent in the Palestinian population as a whole (p.227). To ponder the connections between the human capital of suicide bombers and the outcomes of their attacks, Benmelech and Berrebi (2007) considered the top five stand-alone suicide bombers (the average age is 25.8 years) in their dataset based on the number of people killed in their attacks. Based on the biography, three of the top five suicide bombers had academic degrees (two were masters’ candidates and one had a degree in law), while only 17.0 percent of the suicide bombers in the rest of the sample had or were pursuing academic degrees. The top-five suicide bombers killed on average 22.8 people, compared with a rest-of-the-sample mean of 3.0, and injured on average 88 people, compared with a mean of 22.4 in the rest of the sample (p.229). In the conclusion of this study, Benmelech and Berrebi (2007) revealed that “these differences in age, education, death, and injury between the means for the top five suicide bombers and the means for the rest of the sample are all highly statistically significant (p.229).” This study evidence suggests that the best-performing suicide bombers tend to be older and more educated and are also more likely to attack targets in major cities and hence Palestinian terror organizations assign older suicide bombers to targets in larger cities and less-educated suicide bombers to military targets (p.232). While suicide attracts tragedy is bearing reactions around the world, victim regions/countries are in a most problematic situation to recoup after severe internal and external insecurities as the impact of the attracts/occurrences. A study conducted by Santifort-Jordan and Sandler (2014), the first venue-based empirical investigation of the number and lethality of suicide terrorist attacks on a global scale where data were distinguished between domestic and transnational suicide terrorist missions for 1998–2010 from 2448 suicide terrorist incidents, drawn from the three main terrorist event databases, i.e., International Terrorism: Attributes of Terrorist Events (ITERATE), the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), and RAND. Their findings indicate that economic and social variables are anticipated to affect the number of suicide attacks in countries at risk for suicide terrorism because these considerations exacerbate grievances held by organized terrorist groups (p.992). Their study also explored those democracies in suicide-terrorism-plagued nations had greater abilities than nondemocracies to defend and protect their citizens against suicide attacks (p.993). This study also shows that instability-ridden countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, accounted for 65% of the total number of suicide terrorist attacks, 45% of transnational suicide terrorist attacks, and 68% of domestic suicide attacks (p.995). Benmelech and Berrebi (2007) in their study ‘Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers’ revealed that suicide terrorism is rising around the world. From the onset of the Palestinian intifada in September 2000 through August 2005, 151 Palestinian suicide bombing attacks have been launched against Israeli targets, killing 515 people and injuring almost 3,500 more (p.1).” From 1987 to 2001, the Tamil Tigers launched 76 suicide bombing attacks in Sri Lanka and India, killing a total of 901 people, including two prominent national leaders: India’s former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and Sri Lanka’s President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993 (Pape, 2005). In Iraq, suicide bombers have killed thousands of people, mostly Iraqi civilians, since 2003. The 9/11 attacks have a widespread impact on the United States and the global level. On September 11, 2001, a total of 2,977 people were killed in New York City (Twin Towers-2,753), Washington, DC (Pentagon-184), and outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania (into a field-40) by Al-Qaeda (Cable News Network, 2021, p.1). After 9/11 attracts, there were plentiful impacts on victims’ regions and global level including health, economy, cultural influences, and government policies toward terrorism. According to a CNN editorial research (2021), the economic impacts were huge as a total of US$247.3005 billion money were exhausted ($500,000 to plan and execute the attracts, $123 billion loss during the first 2-4 weeks after the World Trade Center towers collapsed in New York City, $60 billion costs of the WTC site damage, including damage to surrounding buildings, infrastructure, and subway facilities, $40 billion value of the emergency anti-terrorism package approved by the US Congress, $15 billion aid package passed by Congress to bail out the airlines, $9.3 billion Insurance claims arising from the attacks) and also the total cost of cleanup was $750 million (p.3). There was an immense impact on the health because toxic debris, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the Twin Towers’ collapse. According to a report published by Guardian News and Media (2018), more than 43,000 people had been certified with a 9/11 related health condition and 182 members of the New York Fire Department alone have died due to such illnesses (p.4). 10,000 people diagnosed with cancer linked to 9/11, there were 9,375 members of the World Trade Center Health Program certified as having related cancer, and an additional 420 members who had cancer have died (p.2). The impact of 9/11 attracts has prolonged beyond geopolitics into universal society and culture including a major effect on the religious faith of people. Quay & Damico (2010) articulated that September 11, 2001, changed the landscape of American culture security lines at airport checkpoints, a national terror alert system, and years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan are visible changes to American life that can be directly traced to the events of that day. They also revealed that virtually all areas of popular culture those well-known, widely recognized books, TV shows, movies, songs, and visual images so central to twenty-first-century America were deeply affected by the 9/11 attracts (p.xi). Though the suicide bombing has carried unforeseen situations internationally, victim communities/regions/countries have been strangely inflated because of the direct impact of the occurrences. The consequences of the suicide attack have worsened the overall economy, health, environment, and twisted challenging situation, seriously growing geopolitical, cultural, and human insecurity. Discriminations and hatred have been escalated sensationally in-between victims’ regions and terrorist communities/countries, which creates an extensive obstacle not only for involving regions/countries but also for the global community to live in a peaceful environment. In conclusion, I would recommend to policymakers/authorities at the local and global level to launch a human-centered universal education and peacebuilding approach to create an optimistic impression on attackers/perpetrators to build peaceful earth rather than become suicide bombers.

16,What can people do in the face of sexual assault?,social-issues," What can people do in the face of sexual assault? Sexual assault should not be tolerated anywhere in the world. Despite its repulsive nature, and its negative emotional and psychological consequences to the victims, the world has not yet been able to completely get rid of it. Sexual assault has long been a topic of frequent discussion, with countries, tribes, etc in the world fighting to stop it. Women are often victims and for this reason, they are often united and very brave in the fight against sexual predators. Today we tell the story of a brave woman who dared to speak about her dire experience at the hands of sexual predators. Its not an easily achievable feat. Most women prefer to shut up and “avoid shame,” but the women in this case cared more about encouraging other women to keep on, to still be strong, even after experiencing such inhumane ordeal. Indeed, her coming out is something worth being proud. The following stories are from a self-statement on YouTube. Dolma (not her real name), an ethnic Tibetan living in China, went through a failed marriage in 2007. Dolma was not yet out of the shadow of the misfortune of her last marriage. She went to and from work on time every day, but she still felt very unhappy and sometimes even depressed. By chance, Dolma met Dhondup Wangchen, a director in the Tibetan community. The director was not very handsome based on her initial assessment. However, he had good humor. Besides, Dolma’s emotional world was very fragile at this point. She was a very willing receptacle to love, any kind of love, at this point in her lonely, unhappy, and sometimes even downright depression-filled life. All these factors conspired to ensure Dhondup easily won his way through Dolma’s heart. There are also a few emotional and psychological elements worth considering in this case. First, it is often argued that for newly divorced women, if not completely devoid of expectations, have magnified expectations for men and husbands. Additionally, divorce brings forth a ""sense of relief."" In this regard, Dolma's thought at the time was that she had finally left her failed marriage and was free. The appearance of Dhondup Wangchen rekindled Dolma’s hope for love again. At the beginning of this period of acquaintance, the two people, especially Dolma, was very happy. However, this new hope was not etched on stone as Dolma later found out that Dhondup Wangchen was actually a hypocrite. Before he met Dolma, he was married to another woman and had four children. Only then did Dolma discover that she had been deceived by Dhondup Wangchen. Sensible Dolma decisively put forward to break up, and very firmly cut off their contact. Dhondup Wangchen originally wanted to pursue Dolma, but was jailed for a serious criminal offense. Dolma lived quietly for seven years, during which time she started another family. Her sad story should have ended there, but unfortunately, it didn’t. It was just a pause before a much bigger storm than what she had previously overcame. In 2014, Dhondup Wangchen got Dolma back after he was released from prison. At first, Dhondup tried to trick Dolma with his clever words, but Dolma didn't believe him. A criminal who abandoned his wife and children, Dolma thought, could not be believed. Dhondup began to show his most vicious side when he found out that his trick had been discovered. He threatened Dolma with her child and her job that she must meet or he would do harm to Dolma's child. For the sake of the child, Dolma, a woman dare, not call the police. Moreover, Dolma's family was already very happy, and she was afraid of losing it again. Dolma chose not to tell her current husband. When we met for the first time, Dhondup Wangchen just mentioned that he needed money on the phone. Dolma had prepared some of the cash and was about to give it to Dhondup Wangchen when the tragedy struck. Dolma was sexually assaulted by Dhondup Wangchen. Dolma did not want to meet Dhondup Wangchen at all. She did not want Dhondup Wangchen in her life, but she was helpless under the Dhondup’s threats. Having already experienced a failed marriage, Dolma attached great importance to ""happiness"" and ""family"". Her family has long been an integral part of her life. Dolma's life had plunged into darkness after she was sexually assaulted by Dhondup Wangchen. She wanted to be silent because she wanted to protect her child. She didn’t want to lose yet another family. Dolma felt ""dirty"" after being sexually assaulted. She says she feels dirty every day. She would play it over and over again in her mind. This feeling of helplessness and the shame once made Dolma want to commit suicide. There was a time when she had nightmares every night. Every time she woke up, she had to wipe her cheeks dry and convince herself that it would get better. But there was nothing to prove that the situation would get better. For some time she did not dare to sleep, fearing that the darkness would bring her misfortunes all over again. This is a normal woman's reaction to being sexually assaulted. She already felt like she was missing something - that her body did not belong to her. Dolma suffered severe psychological trauma from the sexual assault. At this time, however, Dhondup Wangchen was acting as a ""human rights fighter"" around the world. ""He spoke about human rights in front of the whole world, but he insulted me,"" Dolma said in the video. Yes, Dhondup Wangchen is a total hypocrite. Let's take a look at the characteristics of Dhondup Wangchen: He is polite and submissive to outsiders. He always tried to maintain a positive image in front of others, and he wanted to present his best side to the world. Dhondup Wangchen travels the world advocating for human rights and respect for minorities. This is, however, just a mask he puts on every time he has to show himself to the world. Without the mask, he is an entirely different being – a beast, so to speak. What he defends every day in front of the world is the one thing he lacks the most. Worse still, his calls for ""human rights"" are excessively one-sided with himself at the receiving end. On the surface, it seems like he calls out for human rights for everyone, but a deeper look reveals he would only like his human rights, and not others’ to be upheld. It was difficult for Dolman to make claims against such a reputable person, but she gained enough courage to tell the story after undergoing psychotherapy. She rightfully believed that she would only walk out of the trauma by taking a courageous initiative to face it. This was uncomfortable for her at first as she recalls the experience, but the more she did it, the more fulfilling it became. Dolma wants fewer people; male or female, to go through what she went through. We express our admiration for Dolma's behavior. So what can ordinary women do in the face of sexual assault? •	Be aware of the possible consequences of your desires and sexual urges. Know your abilities and limits. Believe you have the right to set boundaries. If you're not sure, stop. •	Clearly state your boundaries. If someone starts to offend you, tell him immediately and firmly, as a polite approach can be misunderstood or ignored. Just say ""no"" when you feel like saying ""no"" and do everything you can to protect yourself if you feel threatened. •	confident! Passivity can be interpreted as acquiescence. Respond directly and firmly to people who pressure you sexually. Pay attention to what's going on around you. If you feel threatened, don't be shy to ask for help or leave. Of course, this is very unfair to women. In a world full of dangerous walls, gentlemen are not allowed to exist. •	Trust your instincts. If you feel you are being coerced into an unwanted sexual relationship, do not hesitate to express your reluctance, and do not be afraid to appear rude or ill-mannered. These gender role expectations should not be a reason to limit yourself, let alone a reason to suffer fear or even aggression. •	Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol interferes with clear thinking, effective communication, and your ability to respond in your own best interest. •	Please try to help women in need around you! In the previous section, women were tacitly considered as victims of sexual assault, while men were considered as possible perpetrators, which was just a focused discussion of recent news. I hope this article will help raise awareness on the dangers facing women, especially modern working women. Sadly, men are also increasingly the victims of sexual assault and harassment. Since the idea that men can be sexually assaulted is so contrary to most people's cognition, it leads to more shame, self-reproach, confusion and isolation for the men who experience it. Even worse, the current legal framework are not friendly to men’s plight as it makes it more difficult for them to prove their victimization process to some extent. In essence, sexual assault has arguably worse consequences for men who experience it. I hope that both men and women can work together to abide by all the suggestions listed above to protect themselves and those around them."

Repression, unequal treatment, what do women experience throughout their lives? Inequality For thousands of years, it's not a big mistake to say that China has basically been a male-dominated society. It is a generally known fact that male is the primary sex and female is the secondary sex. What will a woman face in her life under such circumstances? In 2018, the BBC made the documentary; She Said: Moments from A Woman's Life. It was a series of eight 15-minute episodes, covering such injustices as sexual harassment in the workplace, marital rape, the exploration of orgasms and sexuality, curfews for women, and so on. We selected three stories: coercive sexual assault, awakening of sexual desire, and unequal policies to tell the seemingly normal social environment: what might a woman experience in her life? Sexual intercourse under duress Dolma (not her real name), an ethnic Tibetan living in China, went through a failed marriage in 2007. Dolma is not out of the shadow of the misfortune of her last marriage. Although she goes to and from work on time every day, she is still very unhappy and even depressed. By chance, Dolma met Dhondup Wangchen, a director in the Tibetan community. Although the director is not very handsome, since Dolma is still in the shadow of love, Dhondup Wangchen's humor gives Dolma some hope. Women are emotional animals, for a woman just divorced, her emotional world is actually very fragile. At this time, if there is a humorous man, it is easy to enter her heart. Moreover, a newly divorced woman, if not completely devoid of expectations, has magnified expectations for men and husbands. Additionally, since most people experience a “sense of relief” after undergoing a divorce, it could be argued that she also had the same feeling. That she felt at the time that she had finally left her failed marriage and was free. The appearance of Dhondup Wangchen makes Dolma get her hopes on love high again. At the beginning of this period of acquaintance, two people are very happy. However, Dolma later found out that Dhondup Wangchen was actually a hypocrite. Before he met Dolma, he was married to another woman and had four children. Only then did Dolma discover that she had been deceived by Dhondup Wangchen. Sensible Dolma decisively put forward to break up, and very firmly cut off their contact. Dhondup Wangchen originally wanted to pursue Dolma, but was jailed for a serious criminal offense. Dolma lived quietly for seven years, during which time she started another family. Dolma's sad story should have ended there, but the tragedy did not end there at all. This is just a pause before a storm. In 2014, Dhondup Wangchen got Dolma back after he was released from prison. At first, Dhondup Wangchen tried to trick Dolma with his clever words, but Dolma didn't believe him. A criminal who abandoned his wife and children, Dolma thought, could not be believed. Dhondup Wangchen began to show his most vicious side when he found out that his trick had been discovered. He threatened Dolma with her child and her job that she must meet or he would do harm to Dolma's child. For the sake of the child, Dolma dare not call the police. Moreover, Dolma's family was already very happy, and she was afraid of losing it again. Dolma chose not to tell her current husband. When they met for the first time, Dhondup Wangchen mentioned that he needed money on the phone. Dolma had prepared some of the cash and was about to give it to Dhondup Wangchen when the tragedy struck. Dolma was sexually assaulted by Dhondup Wangchen. Dolma did not want to meet Dhondup Wangchen at all. She did not want Dhondup Wangchen in her life. However, under Dhondup’s threats, Dolma, she was helpless and no matter how unwilling she was, had no choice but to yield for the sake of her child's safety. Having already experienced a failed marriage, Dolma attaches great importance to ""happiness"" and ""family"". Her family has long been an integral part of her life. Dolma's life was plunged into darkness after she was sexually assaulted by Dhondup Wangchen. She had wanted to be silent because she wanted to protect her child. And she doesn't want to lose another family. Dolma felt ""dirty"" after being sexually assaulted by Dhondup Wangchen. She says she feels dirty every day. She would play the incident over and over again in her mind. This feeling of helplessness and shame once made Dolma want to commit suicide. There was a time when she had nightmares every night. When waking up from the dream, with tears in her eyes. For some time she did not dare to sleep, fearing that the darkness would bring her misfortune all over again. This is a normal woman's reaction to being sexually assaulted. She already felt like she was missing, that her body did not belong to her. Dolma suffered severe psychological trauma from the sexual assault. At this time, however, Dhondup Wangchen was acting as a ""human rights fighter"" around the world. ""He spoke about human rights in front of the whole world, but he insulted me,"" Dolma said in the video. Yes, Dhondup Wangchen is a total hypocrite. A woman who brought her to orgasm 1961, Liverpool, USA, on the eve of the sexual Revolution. Linda, an office worker, was never allowed to talk about sex by her mother, who thought it was dirty. The surrounding environment is full of repression of ""sex"". Living in such an environment, Linda had to suppress her desires. It all started over lunch with my colleague PAM. ""Have you ever had an orgasm?"" PAM asked Linda. Startled, Linda warned her, ""This is not what women talk about."" PAM ignored her, of course. She slowly pulled a cigarette out of her bag and said, ""I've never had an orgasm, either, until a week ago."" Hearing this, Linda remembered: ""For as long as I can remember, my hands would swim below my waist, but after a few seconds, they would stop."" She feared becoming what her mother called a ""modified product."" Linda vacillated between taboo and desire. She tried to ask PAM how she had an orgasm. The answer somewhat surprised her: PAM's orgasm did not come from a man, but from a woman, Vera. Vera works with Linda and always looks cool. Vera approached her cautiously and accosted her. Finally, near the end of the day, Linda received a note: 7 p.m., meet me on the bridge. That was the night Linda had her first orgasm. First the kiss: Then the touch: Then, as her hand slowly slid down, Linda felt happier than she had ever felt before. When it was over, Vera said, ""Isn't it nice?"" ""Thank you for this great honor,"" Linda said. Women can have orgasms without the help of men. This means that women have more freedom over their bodies. In society, labels such as ""good girl"" and ""virgin complex"" are nothing but excuses and plots to better control women. Unfortunately, most girls have to ""follow the rules"" of growth, in the dogmatism and discipline to become a good child in the eyes of the world. But behind the scenes, they were forced to give up their rights. In fact, when women realize their needs, they may find that vaginas are really beautiful, just like flowers. Tonight, I'm gonna take this night back In 1997, women were the target of a sickening murder in Leeds, England. The local government imposed a curfew on all women in the city, asking them not to go out alone at night. If you want to go out, you must be accompanied by a trusted male. In response to the police curfews, local women staged Britain's first ""anti-curfews"", a return to the night march. Why the ""Back to night"" march? An adolescent girl questioned. That night, the police knocked on the door. When the girl opened the door, she saw the policeman standing on the steps and said, ""I'm going door to door to remind women that there have been six murders."" Before the officer left, he left her a copy of the flyer and said, ""Call if you have any questions."" The girl asked on the spot: you issued the curfew order, for whom? The policeman replied, we advise women to stay at home after 9pm and do not leave unless necessary. If you do go out, make sure you have someone with you, a man you know, a man you trust. The girl continued: Why, what did the woman do wrong? The policeman gave her an unexplained smile. ""Honey, we don't want to get out of control anymore. Now the killer has started targeting innocent girls, not just prostitutes."" The girl asked: aren't prostitutes innocent women? Are they society's dirty little secret? Why was the media silent after the first prostitute was murdered? Why do these women deserve to die more than ""innocent"" women? Why aren't men who buy sex insulted? The police have to take care of themselves. In the name of ""it's for your safety"", women have to pay the price for their inability to handle cases. How can women be grateful when their freedom to travel at night is denied? When the whole society is concerned about an extremely vicious murderer, does anyone notice another thing -- domestic violence. Who was more fearful of the night than the husband beside her who always shook his fist at her? Finally, the girl said, If I ever have a daughter, I will hold her head high and feel the world. Hope her nine o 'clock at night is beautiful, no fear, the night is wonderful. We hear a lot of that on social media these days. ""You are sexually harassed because you dress scantily."" ""You are a girl and it is dangerous to go out at night."" Society portrays women as ""victims"", but does not tell men to learn to respect women and learn gender equality. As the girl said at the end: “If they can't go out and look at the stars, what's the point of teaching them to chase the stars?” March 8 is International Women's Day. Over the past 100 years, the feminist movement has been surging, and women have gradually ceased to be parasites and made important contributions in the political, economic and social fields. In 2019, the World Economic Forum released its Global Gender Gap Report 2020, which found that in areas such as health, education, the workplace and politics, men and women struggle to achieve gender equality at birth. China ranks 106th in gender equality, down three places from 2018. There is still a long way to go for equal rights. How can women make efforts to narrow the equality gap between men and women? In her book; Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg has advice for women: “I hope you find true meaning, fulfillment and passion in your life. I hope you survive the difficult times ahead with greater strength and determination. I want you to balance your life and keep your eyes open. And I want you to be aggressive, to be committed to your career, to take over the world.” And we believe that women work together. In the future, gender will no longer prevent women from seeking their own identity, and women will be liberated in a real sense."
18,The Five Love Languages in Psychology,social-issues," The evaporation of love after marriage is a ubiquitous anxiety that all humans grapple with. Numerous married couples look back over the past years of their first dates and wonder where their whirlwind romance go? How can their love stay alive while they are inundated with problems? And how could they have been so thoughtless to commit so gross a mistake? After descending from the clouds of euphoria and getting in touch with real life, discrepancies grow many euphoric couples apart. Battles start taking place as the two lovers have only met in the realm of romantic obsession, which never lasts for long. The couple’s behaviours, desires, perceptions, and struggles come to the surface, and the tides of reality no sooner stifle their obsessional love. The question of whether marital bliss is real or not insists on becoming audible. Answers to why battles and divorce occur are not crouched in daily life hardships, but rather in the fact that each person speaks a different love tongue than the other. A man might work himself day and night to express his love to his wife, and the wife might still complain about his unloving attitude. This happens not because she is uncomprehending or because the man’s love is untrue; it is just because her primary love language is not the same as his language so his efforts sound like Gibberish to her. During the first years of engagement, when the whole world seems to beam with happiness, any simple gesture of love would suffice. However, when your spouse is not infatuated and not shooting for the stars, speaking his/her primary love language is paramount to keep your marriage afloat. Good news is you can now send yourself on a short journey to discover what is your main love language and how you can learn the language of your spouse. Dr. Gary Chapman is a well-known marriage counsellor and relationship expert in the U.S., who has been acclaimed for his Five Love Language theory which he published in 1995 in a series of books entitled The Five Languages. According to Dr Chapman, there are five different tongues that people use all over the world to communicate love. Some people have one primary love language while others are bilingual, yet there is always one dominant language that shouts love to every single person and through which he communicates love to the world. Quality-time people plead for one single thing, attention; it is their key emotional communicator of love. If your wife is always nagging you to respond to her WhatsApp messages or to look at her while she is speaking, there is a great possibility that you are married to a quality-time person. Moreover, quality-time people tend to be good listeners and empaths. Giving your spouse your thorough attention, in this case, is part and parcel of your marital duties. Some people might find it difficult to satisfy such a type of spouse while leading a busy life; however, living a happy marital life is worthy of making some compromises. Quality-time people crave togetherness and sympathy; a quality-time wife might keep discussing with her husband same work problems every day just to obtain his sympathy. Giving a list of advice to this kind of wife won’t make any difference to her – she might know what she should do to solve her problem, yet she is yearning for a moment in which her husband gives her due attention, eye contact, and some minutes of his time. The best way to communicate love to such a spouse is to plan for quality-time activities, such as long walks, deep conversations, or weekend gateways. Encouraging someone by expressing how good he/she is can be the best way to knock your spouse’s socks off if your spouse's love language is the language of verbal appreciation. Surely, all people get excited when they hear encouraging words, but for a person whose love language is words of affirmation, an absence of encouraging words despite the presence of other love expressions indicates an absence of love. A person whose primary love language is verbal appreciation always years for a supportive relationship; he might not acknowledge other expressions of love, such as sex, gifts, or even doing the dishes if he finds himself deprived of this form of straightforward support. Race your mind back to a moment in which you said to your spouse something like “you look nice today.” If such words used to make his/her day above all other expressions of love, your spouse’s love primary love language is, definitely, words of appreciation. Therefore, failing to satisfy such a need for your spouse because he/she is already aware of your appreciation will thwart all your attempts to stimulate love. Whereas, praising your spouse’s untapped potentials and affirming your appreciation of what he/she does will do marvels and revolutionize your marriage. It is noteworthy to mention that hurling insults at your spouse can tear your marriage asunder if you are married to a spouse who thrives on verbal appreciation. Gifts are symbols that translate into words of love. Gifts stir deep emotions in many people more than others. Gifts should not necessarily be expensive to indicate love as they can be of the cheapest kinds and make your spouse euphoric. However, if you are a millionaire, and you only give your spouse free gifts, this might be an oddity. Giving gifts to some people seems to touch a special spring in their minds, leading them to think that they appreciated and thought of. One key aspect that characterizes type-four people is that they are always appreciative of gifts; they rarely criticize any gift they receive because for them gifts are visual symbols of love, so criticizing them will be a direct resistance to their spouse’s love. So, if you are married to this type of a spouse and stopped the flow of gifts after tying the knot, don’t complain about your marriage being in shambles because your spouse has been definitely questioning your love for years. Unlike those who are hooked on words, people who prefer acts of services are more into actions. If your wife gets jazzed when you help her with something, such as cooking, cleaning, or giving her a car lift, then her native love language is acts of service. Such a wife might not be a woman of words as she will usually express her love by serving her husband – by talking the language that makes sense to her. Serving others as an expression of love is rooted in the psychological make-up of many people; that’s why, those people feel estranged when they ask for help and fail to get it. A spouse whose key love language is service won’t have the foggiest idea about your true feelings if you try to express your love through other means apart from service. Few simple acts, such as doing household chores, painting a bedroom, cooking a meal, and changing litterbox can turn your marriage around and make a tremendous change. Physical touch is a powerful way of stimulating love for numerous people If you are married to a spouse who flourishes on physical touch, a kiss can have an electrifying effect that can last for a lifetime. Thinking that kisses, hugs, and sexual intercourse are sheer frivolous activities that people shouldn’t waste their time on can wreak havoc on your marriage if your spouse is a physical-touch person. Physical touch should not always be done for sexual reasons; a tender pat on the back can make your spouse’s day if touching is his/her love language. “If your spouse doesn’t enjoy physical touch in non-sexual ways, it might not be his/her love language at all,” says Dr Chapman. For physical-touch people, touching adds a spark of lustre to their life and makes them feel cared for by sending some signals to their minds. Equally, distancing yourself from a spouse who thrives on physical touch communicates the most hateful feelings."

20,Is corvid 19 vaccine the mark of the beast in revelation 13:16-18,social-issues," Abstract The article is mainly dealing with covid 19 vaccines that has a lot of conspiracy theories behind. Most of these conspiracy is connected to the mark of the beast truth in revelation 13:16-18. This mind set has developed into conspiracy stating that bill gates is behind the corona virus pandemic so that the chip implanting idea will eventuate. The study was done with the help of reviewing a lot of literature to come with a conclusion that is fair and helpful for readers to make a right choice. After analyzing all the literatures through reviewing, the conclusion was made according to the following. The vaccine is not the mark of the beast and it is relevant for people to protect themselves from the covid 19 by taking the two doses. It is also necessary that each individual to exercise his or her powers to choose whether to take the dose or not to take the dose. Church leader’s duty is to clarify the true meaning of revelation 13:16-18 so that people can clearly understand how it is related or not related to the covid 19 vaccines. Introduction The paper was prepaid mainly to address the widely assumption that covid-19 vaccination had related to the mark of the beast alluded to in revelation chapter 13:16-18. It has become very challenging for most of the countries in the pacific to willingly receive the complete dose. Fiji is the only country with huge population in the pacific that successfully fully vaccinated 90 % of its population regardless off all the conspiracy theories. Most of the Melanesian countries in the pacific such as Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea had struggled to accept the vaccination roll out approved by World Health Organization. The slow rate in vaccination roll out is mainly caused by the belief that was rooted down in the prophetic interpretations in revelation 13, that suggests the vaccine is the mark of the beast. The true meaning of revelation 13 needs to be exegetically exposed so that a fair analysis can be done so that all levels of people can understand.  The slow roll out of vaccines in most of the countries have been hindering a lot of economic activities such as free travel service between the pacific island countries, and other international flights that attract the boosting of the economy in the pacific. The slow rolls out of vaccine also challenged the traditional interpretation of the mark of the beast in revelation chapter 13, and biblical scholars need to make it clear for the people. People have well versed with the process that guides vaccine discovery. They understand that vaccine is a scientific discovery that was usually discovered 10 years after a virus outbreak (Graham, 2020). When the discovery of the vaccine was done not even 2 years after the outbreak, people starts to question the genuineness of the vaccines. Science too had questioned the quick development of the used vaccine today and people had accessed this information from social platforms such as face book, histogram, imo, and YouTube. The issue now is sandwiched between the prophetic interpretation and scientific discovery. The two existing philosophies have prompt conspiracy theories that entirely fail the massive vaccination strategy of the world health organization in the world, and the pacific island countries such as Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea (PNG). In resolving the uncertain doubt, the article serves to highlight the possible truth behind the conspiracy theories that hinders people from receiving the vaccine. Currently in the market, there are different brand of covid 19 vaccination recommended by the world Health Organization (WHO) and they have proven worked (Agha, et al., 2020). The hypothesis of the study is, ‘the vaccine is not the mark of the beast, but it might be a trial strategy design by system to control the entire world towards the one world order’. The diversity of the universe is beyond the control of any superpowers of the world. The United states of America has intervened a lot in the cold war period in spreading the ideology of democracy but still few countries had rejected it. Wars, sport, food, tradition, technology and religion cannot unite the world. When comes to health, everybody is behind the idea and they accept it. A lot of people in the world today fear death and they invested heavily in protecting themselves. The study therefore will try as much as possible to come up with conclusion that will help each person decide whether to get the vaccine or not. There is undecided individual who are confused and did not know what to do. Scientist needs to do a convincing presentation on the genuineness of the vaccine in a simplest term for illiterate individual will understand. Theologians needs to do a presentation that will clearly show a clear distinction between the vaccine and the mark of the beast. People have their own rights to decide on their stand in relations to vaccine, but there needs to be a knowledge presented to them before deciding. Woodward, (2020) wrote an article entitled “Will the COVID-19 Vaccine Become the Mark of the Beast?”. He emphasized the interpretation of the mark of the beast as a literal showcase that will be placed on the forearms and the four heads according to biblical students. While on the other hand, the c-19 vaccine will be entering the DNA with a chip that will be monitored by certain authority and it is a miss-match analogy. In explanation to the conspiracy theory, he breaks down the bible text to explain his argument. He suggests that the mark of the beast was associated with buying or sale. There is nothing as a biological implantation of chips into the body for tracking as a lot of people believe in. In regards to the timing of the occurrence of the mark, both beasts must appear to perform diabolical authority, and there has to be the full force of worship of the beast before the enforcement of the mark of the beast will occur. He mentions that another very important discussion in relation to the end time prophecy is the IBM barcode scanner that is said to have 666 in it. He further mentions that this could be the closest analogy to the mark of the beast compared to the Covid -19 vaccine.  He did not rule out that vaccines could be a method which authorities used in controlling the whole universe. He concludes that he doubts that the Covid 19 would be the mark of the beast in revelation 13:16-18. Thomas & Zhang, (2020) wrote an article on how Covid-19 catalyses’ existing online conspiracy movement. The conspiracy was rooted down to philanthropist Bill Gates as the person behind the pandemic. In the US right now, 44% Republicans and 19% Democrats believed that Bill Gates was linked to a plot to use vaccines as a pretext to implant microchips into people. The Gates conspiracy currently was referred to as the ID2020. The main message spread by the ID2020 conspiracy is that “the vaccines in turn are a cover for implanting some form of microchip, radio frequency identification (RFID) chip or other digital tracking device”. The chip was then believed to be the Mark of the Beast or the mark of Satanic religion. From all the conspiracy theory, fringe conspiracy media put a modern twist to the conspiracy by stating that, The ID2020 Alliance, is a digital identity program that aims to ‘leverage immunization’ as a means of inserting tiny microchips into people’s bodies. The article has no conclusion to the conspiracy theories related to the vaccine. There are local conspiracy and international conspiracy in which the article highlighted. The authors of the article suggest that there is a tendency for the conspiracy theories to keep spreading to different audiences and it will cause a hindrance to the role of vaccination in the entire universe. Social media has become the platform in which conspiracy theories spread like a wild wind. Macpherso, (2005) wrote an article on the interpretation of the ‘Mark of the Beast’ and explain that the subject of the mark of the beast has proven elusive and difficult challenge to commentators. Some of the more futurist interpretation claim that John foresaw a future society where computer chips are literally placed in one's right hand or forehead. the article further state that few scholars uphold literal approach whilst most scholars have s restrict their commentary on the mark to surveying, without necessarily affirming, the different suggestions, and instead offer largely spiritual interpretation. The preterit was also unsuccessful in their effort to any of the events in the history. The author therefore highlights that he will approach the Mark of the Beast as nonliteral and nonphysical reading of the mark itself. He decides to see that mark of the beast as the ‘sign commandment’ which can be referred to as the ‘anti-Sabbath’. He used the Old testament background to the mark of the beast and its relationship to the textual, thematic, and structural evidence within Rev 12-1 5. The article concludes that mark of the beast functions like a sign commandment and a direct parody of the Sabbath. The author further state that the mark of the beast stands as the eschatological sign of rebellion against God. it is not a literal phenomenon or a biological implanting of chips in the body. Pacific island Countries covid 19 vaccination update The conspiracy theories have been a biggest problem and it really affects the vaccination roll out in the major countries in the pacific. The Bar graph above is the vaccination overview of the pacific island countries with the fully vaccination color code of orange and the 1st dose color code of blue. From the graph you will see that most of the Polynesian and Micronesian countries have been corporately adhere to the importance of being vaccinated to control the covid 19 virus. 76.19% of the countries in the pacific island region had fully vaccinated above 50% of their entire population. This 76.19 % is made of Polynesian and Micronesian countries in the pacific and the remaining countries are Melanesian countries such as Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. What could be the implication of these findings because what appears in the graph show the type of people and their response towards the vaccination. The pacific islands countries should not blame economic problems in assisting their population get vaccinated. The United State of America has committed to provide vaccines for the pacific island countries with the help of building up their economy that the covid 19 pandemic has coursed (Lunday, 2021). Other pacific island countries that are still under the leadership of the U.S are advantageous to get the vaccine earlier than other pacific island countries. This may be another factor of why countries like Palau and American Samoa are advanced in the vaccine roll out. Fiji has been a model country to the major pacific island countries to roll out the vaccination with great speed. Countries like Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea have been very slow in rolling out the vaccination. This is the statistical figure displaying these three countries’ responses to the vaccination roll out. We can have assumed that the conspiracy factors could be the major setback to the rapid roll out of vaccination with other minor factors. Discussion Most people in the pacific region have not really taken well to the truth behind the vaccine. They have been so clouded with the conspiracy theory of bill gates, their world view of mark of the beast and how the vaccine comes into place. Everybody is everywhere in relation to the vaccine, and the most disappointing episode is to see that even health workers or qualified personnel are undecided to take the vaccine themselves. To make things even worse is that not all pastors are aligned in taking the vaccine. A lot of media outlets have been campaigning against the roll out of the vaccine and it's really challenging. To further deal with this issue, therefore few more articles will be reviewed so that a balanced perspective can be seen before making a conclusion of the topic. The conclusion made will not be rooted out of personal belief, but it will be the conclusion made out from reviewing peer reviewed articles. Under the well qualified scholars, who made thorough studies in the discipline of the need, fair conclusions can be made. The literature review has decided the framework of any statement made in the article.  Opinions are also given with the guideline of the materials used. An article was written by Letšosa (2021), on the subject “What has the beast’s mark to do with the COVID-19 vaccination, and what is the role of the church and answering to the Christians?”. The objective of the article was to develop an interpretation of 666 that could be relevant to the questions asked and suggest a way forward in embodying faith in a corona-defined world and beyond. This is the right question needed to be answered because the health of our people is at stake if the conspiracy is all at fault and the vaccine is the solution for today. According to the author's view of the prophetic message in revelation, he strongly agrees that there is nothing wrong with them. The problem is with the hermeneutic, With a sound literal grammatical historical hermeneutic. The author wants to highlight that the million deaths that were caused by the corona virus is not a small issue. The challenge is for the pastors and church leaders to reconsider the importance of the type of message that they are preaching in relation to the vaccine.  Some devoted Christians have resonated their decision based on their religious dogma, it will be a problem if our messages have baseless evidence of what we say. This is a greatest challenge for the church leaders to relook into. The action of the massive congregation of our various churches depends entirely on the messages presented behind the pulpit. He did a thorough study into it by addressing areas such as vaccine and 666 and even he did hermeneutic study of the mark of the beast. The author concludes that the number (666) probably served as a warning to the first readers not to succumb to the pressure of the Roman Empire. He denies mark of the beast linkage to the vaccine, but sees vaccine as a very brilliant scientific development that is put in place to address the issue of covid 19.  The Roman empire is seen in the passage as wanting to take the place of God. He concludes that the article was not written for the reader to get a vaccination, but it emphasizes the power of making your own decision. Andrews (2017), wrote a book titled “Identifying the Antichrist” is a very important exposition that is relevant to understand. He further states different people and organizations have different views of the antichrist. The dispensation will see it as the Romans looking for a future ruler who will appear to rule over the earth, while the Amillennialist see it as symbolic. Apart from these two views, others have associate the anti-Christ with some of the powerful leaders of the earth such as Adolf Hitler, Emperor Nero, friedrich Nietzsche of France, and recently the radical Islam. He starts with discussing “let him who have underrating” and the who here refers to “man”. The Greek word for man is “Anthropos” which signifies the whole of mankind or humanity. He further state that 666 is the repetition of number six, and number 6 symbolizes imperfection because it is one less than perfection (7). Therefore, the 666 can refer to one that is opposed to the God movement or the antichrist. He further states that in order for one to understand the antichrist, revelation 13:2 is also equally important for unfolding purposes. He used the text and connecting it to Daniel 7 and there is numerous beast pop out in the seen. The body of leopard, feet of bear and mouth of lion. The combination of these three different beast can be referred to as the roman empire who continuously suppressing the Judah or the people of God.  He further state that the two beast in revelation 13 is the two government powers and they are against Christ. He then uses bible verse to define antichrist. He quotes from 1 John 2:18 to project the antichrist will be seen at the last hour. The original context referred to the period in which the 12 disciples are protecting the Christian congregation from the upcoming great controversy. He then defines antichrist as deceivers (2John 1:7). The antichrist is also those who did not believe that Jesus Christ God and this is the spirit of antichrist (1 John 3:4). The antichrist will also refer to himself as God or claiming himself God (Matt 24:23-26). The anti-Christ will also come as the false prophet and they will show great signs and wonders (Matt 24:4-5). He further states that there are false Christ and prophets that came before the 70 ce. He strongly believes that 666 is the identity of an antichrist who denies Jesus as Christ, denies the father and the son, abandoned the Christian faith and goes against God and the antichrist is anti-Christian. The author also suggested that to pinpoint one particular person as the antichrist is a clear example of misidentifying the anti-Christ. Based on Paul’s writing (2thes 2:3), the antichrist is made up of doctrinal deception, moral insensitivity and ethical departure from God’s truth. The antichrist will persecute those who will follow Jesus as their lord and savior. The anti-Christ can be seen as the higher Criticism sects who want to weaken, challenge and undercut Christians confidence in the scripture. They do not believe in literal antichrist but interpret it as good vs evil. Further to that, they conclude that literal antichrist is nothing but a myth. Therefore, the mark of the beast represents a religious power that goes against God, the religious power that operates alongside politics. Salali and Uysal (2020) do a cross-cultural study purposely aiming to examine the levels of covid 19 vaccine hesitancy, and its association with belief on the origin of novel coronavirus. They conducted an online survey in the UK with 1088 participants and 3936 participants in turkey. They collected information such as those who are willing to be vaccinated, those who believe in the origin of the novel coronavirus and several behavioral and demographic predictors such as anxiety, risk perception and government satisfaction level. The result obtained was that 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure whether to take the vaccine or not. 3% for both countries rejected the vaccine, and 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus. The understanding of the novel coronavirus has then increased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Based on the result, they conclude that there is a concerning level of vaccination hesitancy level especially in turkey. They also suggested that there is a need of communicating to people of the scientific consensus on the origin of novel coronavirus. The coronavirus vaccine strategy was not done properly so that people will accept it. The time frame in which the virus was known to be outbreak and the development of the vaccine is what makes people suspicious and come up with many different kinds of conspiracy. In conclusion, there are several statements I want to make based on the information gathered. The mark of the beast is not related to the covid 19 vaccines. The mark of the beast is the religio-political power that will exercise its power and will persecute the church of God. The notion that speculated that the vaccine is the mark of the beast is not true. The mark of the beast cannot be associated with a person, so the bill gates conspiracy can be ruled. The only one needs to understand is the vaccine is the normal development in the field of health to counter viruses that will cause humans to get sick. There have been a lot of virus outbreaks in the past and scientists develop vaccines to protect the immune system. From the information gathered, vaccines are good so that humans will be protected from the virus. Health is very important so anything that the health authority suggests is of greater importance. The vaccine is okay so that our immune system will protect us from the virus. The choice is yours, if you want to live then go and take your vaccine, but you do not like it, then it’s up to you.

1,Learn About Bubble Hash from a Colorado Dispensary,social-issues," What is Bubble Hash? Bubble hash is a particular texture of cannabis hash.  The technique for making bubble hash includes a few tools like ice water and strainers. Hash can range from a pale blonde color to dark brown. Lighter colors indicate higher quality and are most popular in dispensaries. We call it bubble hash because, unlike other concentrates, it bubbles when exposed to a flame. How to Smoke Bubble Hash You can use bubble hash in various ways, including vaporizers, bongs, pipes, and joints. You can smoke it with cannabis flower, add it to cigarettes or combine it with butter to create edibles. Many people like to roll the hash into little balls and place them on top of their full bowl. Dabbing bubble hash is also a popular option for people who own dab rigs or nectar collectors. You can learn more about how to dab hash with nectar collectors here. Bubble hash is highly potent. Even though the effects are very similar to flower or other kinds of extracts, you will feel them much more intensely. So, be cautious when dosing with other weed products.  The high won’t last as long as edibles, so you can expect to feel a dose of bubble hash for thirty minutes to an hour after consuming. How to Make Bubble Hash Bubble hash is a cannabis resin made with ice water and filter bags. The ice water makes both the resin and trichomes less sticky, so the trichomes separate easily from the cannabis flower. Then the wax can be scooped out of the cold water using screens. These broken resin glands, which contain essential compounds like THC and CBD, move through a series of screens while the plant material is left behind, forming bubble hash. This method is the most effective way to preserve terpenes and each strain’s distinct flavor. The best quality bubble hash is called “full melt.” The ultra-refined full melt tends to bubble away when smoked or dabbed, leaving little to no substance behind. If there is any remaining plant material in the bubble hash, it doesn’t make the cut for “full melt” and will be given a lower grade. What is a Bubble Bag? A bubble hash bag or bubble bag is a technical term for the bag used to make bubble hash. Bubble bags are your filtration screen. A container is filled with ice water and agitated to separate resin glands (including cannabinoids and terpenes) from the plant material. Then, you remove each layer of the bubble bags to pick out fine particles of cannabis resin. Bubble Hash is a potent and delicious way to enjoy the best of cannabinoids and terpenes. The friendly budtenders at Terrapin Care Station Dispensaries in Colorado can help guide you through our selection of Dadirii Bubble Hash, cannabis extracts, flower, and edibles.

2,Is 'ARSON' Emerging Terrorism in Tanzania?,social-issues," Introduction The use of fire by terrorists as a strategic weapon to target the population and instill fear, hatred, property devastation, economic losses, and attract press attention is not something new. As Jenkins said in 1974, ""terrorist attacks are usually choreographed to attract the attention of the international press and local media, therefore terrorism is theatre."" During the past five decades, the world has experienced several ""set fires"" that were done intentionally by terrorist groups against the civilian population. On March 25th, 1990, an arsonist was reported by the U.S. who set the fire intentionally at the Happy Land Night Club, which caused heavy destruction and the deaths of several people. ISIS publicly asserted in May 2019 that they were responsible for a series of wildfires, including the destruction and death toll of the 2018 California inferno. In recent years, a number of wildfires have occurred around the world, notably the forest fires in Turkey in 2021, which the Turkish government and citizens blamed on the PKK terrorist organization. As a form of vengeance against Turkey's government, the PKK terrorist organization is infamous for setting fire to Turkey's forests, resulting in civilian deaths and environmental harm. Wildfires in Australia, Greece, and other countries have all had comparable instances. Is the United Republic of Tanzania at significant threat of arson-terrorist attacks? Arson is an easy and cheap terror tactic that terrorists use with the intent of causing fear, economic depression, and potential casualties. Arson gives a chance to terror groups and movements that are searching for low-cost, low-skill, and efficient methods of attack to cause casualties and economic losses while putting the population, government, and security officials on the margin of when and where the secret fire setting will occur next. It is also a prime tactic for groups that want to remain anonymous while pushing their agenda and avoid raising suspicion by using firearms. Factory buildings, schools, markets, universities, banks, apartment buildings, churches, forests, and other business structures are apparently common targets for arson. In Tanzania, increasing fire events have wreaked havoc on the civilian population, national security, and government authorities. Since 2020, the country has experienced multiple fire occurrences in various regions, resulting in deaths, serious property damage, injuries, and economic devastation among the civilian population and government. Surprisingly, such events continue to rise on a daily basis. More than six major fire events have been reported in the country in less than six months, all of which occurred suddenly in business structures, religious institutions, schools, bars, hotels, and tourist places, causing irreparable damage. With regard to security investigations, officials state that the majority of fires are the result of negligence and faulty electrical wiring, although some investigation findings are still pending. (See, for example, Karume market fire-2022, Kariakoo market fire-2021, Fire in 4 Tourist Zanzibar Hotels-2021, Mount Kilimanjaro fire-2021, etc). But, isn't it more than just negligence and poor wiring that the government and security officials should be more wary of now, following a string of inexplicable fire occurrences that the country is currently experiencing? I hope that the current fire breakout at Karume market serves as a timely reminder to the leadership and security of the United Republic of Tanzania that the continual outbreak of fire incidents in the country is something that must not be taken lightly. Conclusion A complete understanding of fire as a weapon is key when addressing this emerging threat. It is also important to note that fire is an appealing weapon that terrorists prefer to use for many reasons. The security officials must broaden their investigation to meet the issue with high intelligence, which will necessitate new policies and partnerships. Security officials must rethink the way they have approached this emerging threat from the beginning with an open mind in order to develop an effective course of action and strategies to countermeasure the situation before it’s too late. It's also worth noting that terrorists often use fire attacks as a way to divert the government's and security attention away from their larger plans. Finally, it's important to remember that terrorism's essence and goal are both political. Endnotes:"
3,The Human Security Approach Would  Contribute to Building Sustainable Peace for States and for the Global Level,social-issues," The fundamental components of the human security approach are the protection of individuals against threats to life, health, livelihood, personal safety, and human dignity. The concept of human security is people-centered and it transmits attention of security from the state level to individuals also empowers people and societies as a means of security. According to numerous researches, the human security approach has referent objects of people, communities, and state which ensure the security of human rights/development, protection of individual security including the freedom to make choice through freedom from fear and want, and dignity. Whereas traditional state security models including realism, neo-realism, liberation failed to meet all requirements to secure individuals, and the international community because of their limited referent objects, values, perception of threat, and practical instrument to protect. So, there are a huge number of debates to prioritization of security approach to building sustainable peace for local and international communities. To take several studies in point on inclusive human security, the focus on the military in the state security the policy does not offer the best strategy to build a sense of sustainable peace for the universal human community but rather gives importance to the military which insists on power mobilization. In other words, traditional ideas concerning security in a global context parallel to threats to the state and military defense, but these ideas are emergent to new characterizations of threats to include education, food, conflict, disease, environmental change, economic crisis, and mental health (United Nations, 2013). As Alkire (2003) mentioned that “Human security is people-centered, not threat-centered. Human security is a condition that results from an effective political, economic, social, cultural, and natural environment, and not from executing a set of administrative procedures (p. 3)”. In practice, work inspired by the human security approach has been undertaken both at the policy level and at the level of the community, by NGOs, by UN agencies, by academics, and by other development institutions. The objectives of the human security approach are to protect the vital core of people’s lives from critical and pervasive threats. In fact, when we ponder of human insecurity, it may automatically be associated with the infinite domains of security based on individual’s perspectives and vital cores however, as per the UNDP report 1994, typically human security is associated with seven domains (i.e., economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community and political). In this hypothesis, it will be revealed the main objectives to accomplish the fundamental elements of human security such as, people-centered by emphasizing people are to be the ultimate ends but not means, perspectives are multidimensional by addressing people's dignity as well as their material and physical concerns and consider poverty and inequality as the root causes of individual vulnerability. Throughout my analysis, I have observed that no other aspect of the security model is as vital as human security from violence and fear from freedom as such, sustainable peace repose on the teamwork of international communities and the people-centered focus of human security instead of state-focused security. Through examining traditional and human security-oriented approaches to various threats, I have strong-minded that human security is an essential component of the policy that seeks to promote sustainable peace and lets people live in freedom from violence. As such, I believe that the human security approach would measurably contribute to building a more sustainable peace because of its fundamental characteristics such as universal, people-centered, interdependent, and early prevention. Moreover, as human security is a person-centered approach that is inclusive and more significantly, flexible which also addressing the root causes of humanitarian emergencies (economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political) is a more functioning way to resolve issues and protect the long-term security of individuals. As Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy (2007) state that ""human security has a long history and derives its strength from many ideas and theories across disciplines. It can develop as a concept only by maintaining and advancing this plurality (p. 93)”. In the succeeding paper, analyzing several types of research done by numerous experts in the respective field, it will be revealed that how a human security approach would be a realistic option for the state and for the international organization to build more sustainable peace for the global community. It has been established that human security, human rights and human development are interconnected which recognizes the conditions that threaten survival and dignity, such as poverty, environmental degradation, etc. As such, human security becomes a prerequisite of human development and a guarantee for its sustainability. Also, human development is a necessary pre-condition of human security because sources of insecurity stem from lack of development. As Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy (2007) state that “if human development is about well-being, human security concentrates on the security of development gains. This enhanced concept of human security brings a number of new elements within the human development debate” (p. 105). The authors argued that “the denial of fundamental human rights [is] the main reason for human insecurity (p. 123)”. The human security approach would be helpful to enhance the development discourse in a positive means, as such, if states increase individual security, development initiatives will be able to look beyond basic human needs such as food, education, environment, etc. and better prepare for future endeavors that may threaten the people. According to Hampson et. al, “after tracing the distinct roots of human security – in human rights, in sustainable development, and in the safety of the peoples – they argue that human security in all instances is regarded as an “underprovided public good (Alkire, 2003, p.16)”. Besides, Futamura et. al (2010) suggested that “human security-based initiatives expand the idea of peacebuilding beyond simply containing conflict and introducing the democratic policy in order to focus on development, welfare and local engagement (p.1)”. Several studies have proved that efforts in human security and development work on helping people become more self-sufficient and capable, through work such as literacy, arts, and practical education programs. A successful example of the human security approach to building sustainable peace can be found in the following case study which is based on lessons from the joint program conducted by the UN agencies including UNICEF, UNDP, UNESCO, and UNODC on “Conflict prevention, development of agreements and peacebuilding for internally displaced persons in Chiapas, Mexico”. As per the SDGF report (02 Oct 2009 - 28 Feb 2013), in 1994 clash between the Mexican State and the Zapatista resulted in tens of thousands of people being driven off their land and they had gone through lots of basic problems to survive including poverty, medical and education services. They also had been provoked from social protection as well as access to the justice system. In fact, throughout this UN joint program, the majority of the displaced persons from the north of Chiapas were directly benefited in various manners including legal systems, educations, health, addiction, and infrastructures. To access to fair justice system there was a promotional activity for the Law on Internal Displacement in 5 municipalities and 25 communities. Also, under this joint program, they arranged practical training for both the state administrations and the law enforcement agencies to focus on impartial enforcement and the pursuit of justice. To promote a stable peace, an innovative educational program including the creation of a diploma in the culture of peace and multiculturalism has been conducted based on art, sports, activities at schools and educational institutions for the displaced and helpless people in more than 25 localities of the intervention in the Ocosingo, Sabanilla, Tila, Salto de Agua, and Tumbala municipalities. In addition, as part of the joint project by the Centre for Training and Advice in Environment and in Health Rights, in the Salto de Agua municipality, and Foro A.C. in the Tila municipality-provided technical supports to build 1546 infrastructure projects for the homeless people. According to the SDGF report (02 Oct 2009 - 28 Feb 2013), there were also some significant progress, achievement, and recognition of this UN joint program as the following: The joint program made significant progress in achieving changes in attitude and in the acquisition of technical skills from public ministries, social advocates, experts, and state and municipal police who have jurisdiction and cover a total population of 1,806,635 inhabitants (p. 4)”. The sustainability of actions in the educational sector is highly likely to have a permanent effect (in terms of knowledge and awareness of teachers) over time. Regular courses on the prevention of drug use, crime, the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and gender violence were run. More than 6,000 people benefitted from these courses. Alongside this, workshops were organized which involved 360 adolescents: two focused on the prevention of addiction, and four on the prevention of gender-based violence. 35 teachers (Ch’ol and Tzeltalt) from the Ocosingo, Tila, and Salto de Agua regions participated in delivering the Diploma in Culture of Peace and Multiculturalism initiative included the participation that was achieved with the community assemblies contributed to social cohesion (p. 6). A successful example of institutionalizing a programme was the accreditation of the Diploma in Interculturality and Culture of Peace, promoted by UNESCO in collaboration with the Ibero-American University, through the Directorate General of Continuing Education for Teachers in Service of the Secretariat of Public Education, which was endorsed as a teaching career. To strengthen the sustainability of the Law for Prevention and Assistance of the Internally Displaced in Chiapas, the programme contained provisions that would counteract any potential withdrawal of the state’s executive authority, and ensure that it was ultimately established as legislation (p. 9). The human security approach would also improve proactive strategies to building sustainable peace instead of simply responding to resolve issues on an interim basis. I believe that the human security approach would be a valuable method to building a more sustainable peace because it promotes the pre-reflection, re-evaluation, and the option to re-direct policy to address ever-evolving security needs for people. As Howard-Hassmann (2012) suggested that ""human security should focus on the vital core of protecting ""all human lives from critical and pervasive threats"" that are not already protected by, or adequately protected by, the existing human rights regime"" (p. 108). Likewise, Futamara et al. (2010) revealed that “a human security approach to peacebuilding can offer some solutions to these problems and also suggests ways to strengthen the legitimacy of peacebuilding activities, make them more oriented around local needs and conditions, and therefore strengthen local buy-in and support while restoring dignity to post-crisis societies (p. 4)”. As the second illustration, I would like to reveal another successful instance of the human security model which can be seen in the UN Human Security – A New Response to Complex Threats (2013) video that outlines the Northern Uganda Early Recovery Program (NUERP). This video was presented on the occasion of the High-Level Event on Human Security that took place on 8 May 2013 at the UN Headquarters. They attribute the success of the NUERP program to being provided access to numerous UN agencies that supply a variety of supporting activities food, health, education that are all complementary and focused on the re-building of a self-sustainable community following the LRA (The Lord's Resistance Army) war. In 2009 the UN Trust Fund for Human Security started a major programme in Northern Uganda under NUERP to help communities trapped in a conflict that claimed thousands of lives and displaced more than 1 million people. There were infrastructure activities to resettling the people who were affected by the LRA war under World Health Organization. Also, under the Village Savings program all community members were able to pay their medical bills, children’s school fees, start a retail business, make sanitation in every homestead. As Richard Saweva Mubiri, Head of Office, Soroti-World Food Program revealed that NUERP really touched the lives of the people. As per practical evidence and the results of NUERP activities, it’s clearly showed the protection of the vital core by the international community at work in the Northern Uganda Early Recovery Programme and also, projects have drawn on the combined expertise of the United Nations system allowing united Nations implementing organizations to tackle threats that affect people in all regions of the world. The efforts of the international community have successfully created a program that protects the survival, livelihoods, and basic decency of Ugandans and reduces the conditions in which tension and conflict can arise. Since 1999 the UN Trust Fund for Human Security has supported over 200 projects in more than 80 countries. Based on the success of Northern Uganda Early Recovery Program (NUERP), the human security approach is applicable to all situations where people face multiple threats. As a universal component, human security focuses on guaranteeing human well-being by pursuing dignity and freedoms which is also considered as a holistic approach that restores the balance between civil/political and social/economic rights to building sustainable peace for the state and the international community. According to Berns (2014) “there can be no peace without community engagement (p. 15)”. Also, Futamara et al. (2010) argued that “the human security approach is not only centered on people as objects of interventions, including of peacebuilding or development. It provides an “agency” to individuals as subjects, as referents of security and, ultimately, as providers of security (p. 4)”. Likewise, Paris (2001) highlights, “Human security has successfully united a diverse coalition of states, international agencies, and NGOs. Broad objectives are a strength of the human security perspective and allow a variety of actors to unite and work together towards common objectives (p. 102)”. Actually, the human security approach emphasizes the mutual importance of international alternative government agencies, which can be introduced to further influence policy to safeguard human security on a global scale.  As the Hague Institute for Global Justice and the Stimson Center (2015) stated that “International communities such as the United Nation, African Union, South American Nations, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union, and the Union of South American Nations hold the key to many evolving solutions to current global challenges (p. 56)”. In practice, Canada, Norway, and Japan have incorporated human security into their foreign policy frameworks. According to ICISS report (2001), “Canada has taken human security as the paradigm for its foreign policy and has taken a leadership role in operationalizing it. The human security agenda has offered a way for Canada to contribute a leading voice on the world stage”. One of the strengths of utilizing a human security perspective as it allows for a more inclusive approach in achieving freedom from violence in the lives of people all over the world. An example of the strength of the collaborative nature of a human security approach in relation to physical security is in addressing the threat posed by civil unrest. According to the report of the Institute for Economics and Peace (2020), Internationally, the number of strikes, anti-government protests, and riots increased by 244% between 2011 and 2019. A further increase in this number is likely to occur as a result of the economic recessions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. By using the lens of human security, it is possible to analyze both why civil conflict happens and how the state and the international community should take an action to prevent it from occurring. In conclusion, based on the flexible nature of the human security approach and a wide range of diverse case studies have demonstrated the strength of the human security approach to building sustainable peace for the states and international organizations such as the Northern Uganda Early Recovery Program (NUERP) participated by the UN Trust Fund for Human Security, WHO and World Food Program directly helped to reduce the conditions in which tension and conflict can arise and at the same time, enhanced the lives of the people for long-term and created a sustainable environment that protects the survival, livelihoods, and basic decency of Ugandans. Similarly, another joint program on “Conflict prevention, development of agreements and peacebuilding for internally displaced persons in Chiapas” in Mexico conducted by UNICEF, UNDP, UNESCO, and UNODC has demonstrated the sustainability of actions in the educational sector is vastly expected to have an enduring effect, particularly on awareness for teachers/educators by delivering the Diploma in Culture of Peace and Multiculturalism initiative. Soon after, based on the huge success of the educational program that was ultimately established as the state legislation. Finally, based on enormous success and legitimate endorsement of the above-mentioned case studies, it has been recognized that the human security approach would be a realistic option for the states and for the international organizations to build more sustainable peace for the global community.

4,One Person One Vote is Not Enough to Rescue America’s Faltering Democracy,social-issues," While Democrats struggle to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, Republican/Trump controlled state legislatures continue to pass laws that restrict and suppress voting rights for people of color. Welcome to America in 2022. But how can anyone contend that America has a political democracy when both major political parties, the House of Representatives, the Senate, the Presidency, state legislatures, the media, the military, the courts, and the cops are all controlled/manipulated by less than 1% of the population? While the Voting Rights Act is absolutely essential, it’s not enough to rescue America’s faltering democracy from the gathering fascist storm looming on the horizon. Factually speaking a political democracy is impossible when SO MUCH WEALTH/POWER is SO CONCENTRATED in the hands of SO FEW at the expense of SO MANY? We have a nation with too many wage slaves, industrial sharecroppers who spend their most productive hours picking someone else’s cotton on someone else’s corporate plantation in exchange for the means with which to feed, clothe, and house themselves, and their family members. In the process they live life teetering on the edge of financial collapse. We also have 5% of the world’s population but 25% of the world’s incarcerated people. Land of the free? Really? If we truly want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people we’ll need to do something dramatically different than what the conventional right and the conventional left have been prescribing for way too long now. We must systematically DEMOCRATIZE THE FREE-MARKET ECONOMY without resorting to artificial government interventions to get that job done. Check out the following scenario and see if you think it offers a viable solution to the economic dilemma that we the people currently find ourselves in. Let’s Start With These Facts According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars of wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED, CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) •	ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, every transaction is instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by capital credit insurance and productive, private-sector assets! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario income/demand is tied directly to production/supply. When production/supply occurs, income/demand automatically follows. Thus production/supply creates income/demand and in the process, EVERY CITIZEN is suddenly in a position to become a PRODUCTIVE MEMBER of society. There’s an automatic balance built into this strategy that allows it to avoid inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay down our massive, national debt while reducing taxes even further. That $4 Trillion of growth is going to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO LONG-TERM COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading)."
5,To Kill A Mocking Bird,social-issues," To Kill A Mocking Bird When asked what fictional character I relate to, who has influenced and inspired me, I immediately turn to Atticus Finch from the book To Kill a Mockingbird. Finch was a prominent citizen and lawyer in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. In a time of racism, Atticus took it upon himself to represent a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, in court when no one else would. Throughout the book, Finch received threats and mocks from his so-called friends because of his “color-blind” eye. Although Robinson was declared guilty of rape at the end of the novel, Atticus stuck by his side the entire time, fighting for what he knew and believed was right. Finch a traitor in many people's eyes and his decision to stand for the oppressed is met by opposition and ridicule. Black men are discriminated against and as a minority people, they are considered to be culpable until they are proven guiltless. In the town ruled and with racism and social injustice, it is utterly unbelievable that Finch a white prominent citizen would defend a black man accused by Bob Ewell, a fellow white man. Finch holds he must defend Robinson and any other person assigned to him, black or white, colored or not colored. It is an attribute that inspires me every day to support and fight for the rights of others. Robinson faces the threat of being lynched and killed by an aggressive mob that believes this to be the fastest way to execute justice. Finch’s commitment to his client makes him to intervene. Finch risks his life to protect his client from the mob. The lynching is meant to rid the town of any controversies that might have resulted from the court’s ruling and maintain racial control by inflicting fear. The mob and Bob Ewell do not want the case to go to trial, not only because it would act as a spark that would spread the black revolution but because they do not have sufficient evidence to convict Robinson. Little surprise the mob wants to lynch Robinson, lynching was used by the British to execute both formal and unwritten rules meant to assert white domination. I believe Atticus Finch personifies me since he is determined and fights for what he believes is right, which is what I purpose to do every day. I am a member of “Next Generations,” an organization that focuses on fighting for the rights of Holocaust survivors. These elders have been through social injustices and have lived to tell the tale. They have been forced to live in the ghettos in addition to facing tyranny and genocides. Essentially, the survivors were displaced from their homeland and have been living in abject poverty after the Holocaust. I feel that it is my obligation as a great-granddaughter of a survivor to keep their memory and of others alive. I speak at different schools and educate students on the Holocaust from a teenager’s perspective. My dedication and willingness to fight for Holocaust education during the rise of anti-semitism in this country is similar to Finch’s commitment to Robinson despite the societal backlash that may occur by those who are narrow-minded."
6,The Equality of the Fallen,social-issues," My friend Jason recently shared a great excerpt from Kierkegaard’s “Practice in Christianity,” in which S.K. identifies an important truth. Though the means through which we are drawn to God are many, Kierkegaard says they converge at the consciousness (i.e. awareness) of sin. Don’t let the word “sin” scare you off. Feel free to exchange it with “wrongness” or “evil” (people have all sorts of things they think of as wrong or evil). Humans have always been keenly aware of the bad behavior of the other guy. Take me, for instance. I’m aware of how self-assured many people around me seem to be. What is it that they are so sure of? Mostly how bad the people are who differ from them politically. But it hardly requires a difference in politics to reveal our ungracious natures. When even the smallest of inconveniences come my way, I tend to assume the worst of others as well. “The mailman didn’t bring the package up to the house? I was waiting for that delivery! What a lazy, no good…” Sometimes I wonder if our entire existence doesn’t revolve around a constant, exhausting moral examination of ourselves and others, and not very often are we impressed with anyone. I wrote my first story, The Battle of the Windy Isle, with this ethos in mind. I wanted to tell a tale about a curse that afflicted people in different ways. Those who were cursed remained largely unaware of it, having slipped into the malady more deeply over time. However, simple things, such as gratitude, joy, or forgiveness, could sneak in and undo the damage with surprising speed. Early on in the story otherworldly curses are foreshadowed by the more familiar, earthly variety. This occurs in a conversation between a grandfather and grandson when the grandfather responds gracefully to a difficulty. However others, like his grandson Aisen, find that graciousness difficult to understand. As the story progresses Aisen begins to recognize the value of forgiveness, and eventually demonstrates some very grandfather-like responses of his own. The Windy Isle is a children’s story, but sometimes it is parents (even Christian parents) who struggle to prioritize forgiveness. Society doesn’t always help us maintain a gracious mindset, either. While we do see some moments of grace celebrated, too often forgiveness seems to be confused with weakness. We are tempted to believe that finger-pointing and condemnation are the virtuous things—regardless of (or maybe because of?) our political or religious persuasions. But if we must err, in which direction should it be? I submit (and I think the Bible teaches) that we should err on the side of forgiveness. Such a choice is costly, to be sure, and our pride makes it all the more difficult. C.S. Lewis explained the issue this way: “How is it that people who are quite obviously eaten up with pride can say they believe in God and appear to themselves very religious? I am afraid it means they are worshiping an imaginary God.” The curse of imagining a God in one’s own image—repulsed only by the evil of other people—slips in bit by bit and remains mostly undetected by the one afflicted. Yet the awareness of sin that Kierkegaard spoke of remains, albeit in a hobbled form. However, if that handicap begins to heal, the consciousness of sin can still be a means through which we may yet be drawn to God. We must come to see the flaw in ourselves as well as in others. My hope is that readers of The Windy Isle will grow in the awareness of the “equality of the fallen”—and we all fit that bill. It is for this reason that we should view ourselves as better than no one. It is a choice that presents itself often. As Lewis said elsewhere, choices are significant things: “Every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different than it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature or a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow creatures, and with itself. To be the one kind of creature is heaven: that is, it is joy and peace and knowledge and power. To be the other means madness, horror, idiocy, rage, impotence, and eternal loneliness. Each of us at each moment is progressing to the one state or the other.” Or, if you recognize the connection between graciousness and gratefulness, perhaps a more condensed way of putting it is this: “The distance between being ungrateful for something and cursing it is not as great as one might imagine.” — Virgil, Battle Chief of Linraw (from The Wizard’s Rebellion)"
7,Reframing Faith through Fantasy,social-issues," Have you ever tried to move something with your mind? Maybe there was a pencil on the table, and you thought really hard about making it roll. Do you remember what it felt like to try to use a power that you don’t have? Maybe you frowned, gritted your teeth, clenched your fists, or burst a blood vessel in your eyeball — and the pencil didn’t even budge. This is exactly how I felt when, as a younger person, I tried to work up what I considered to be “adequate faith” in this man called Jesus. It usually went something like this: “Do I believe in Jesus? Sure.” (No, totally unbelievable.) Perhaps a solemn head nod? (No, too wishy-washy.) “Yes!” (Is the exclamation point too much?) “Yes.” (Why do I still feel like I’m not believing hard enough?) Frown…grit…clench…pop! Pulling oneself, or one’s faith, up by the proverbial bootstraps tends to be encouraged in American society. Often, if one does not obtain the expected results after a good, solid effort, traditional wisdom suggests that said effort should be doubled. Surely it is hard work, and not fanciful imagination, that leads to a robust faith, yes? As an American, I fear my patriot status will likely be in question after this next confession. You see, almost all my heroes are Brits; I just love the way they think. John Wayne is cool, but Chesterton is cooler. I like all the other usual suspects, too (e.g. Tolkien, MacDonald, Lewis), and I’m convinced Lewis included one of the more surprising elements in his Narnian mythology for a very specific reason. Santa is perhaps the first and most common fantasy introduced to children throughout the world. As such, Saint Nicholas is an easy choice to represent the spark of imagination. I would suggest that the first time a person stops believing in Santa, they experience a kind of shrinking. Both they, and the world as they perceive it, become a little bit less wild — a little bit less alive. But before that, faith springs to life much more easily. It’s nothing like the teeth-gritting, pencil-rolling exercise in futility that John Wayne might recommend. Lewis gives us back Santa — literally — and while I understand Tolkein’s objection to it, I believe Lewis knew what he was doing. Bringing Santa back reminds us how our hearts and minds worked when we still believed. We tell (and listen to) fanciful stories because we hope to catch a little bit of something true in them — something that isn’t available anywhere else. When I wake up and look out my window, teeth-gritting and fist-clenching are the last things I need to build my faith. Belief is far better served when I ponder the secrets of the forest with my morning coffee. In his book For The Life of the World, Orthodox priest Alexander Schmemann describes a world that seems to have much more in common with a fairy tale than anything else: “The ‘original’ sin is not primarily that man has ‘disobeyed’ God; the sin is that he ceased to be hungry for Him and for Him alone, ceased to see his whole life depending on the whole world as a sacrament of communion with God. The sin was not that man neglected his religious duties. The sin was that he thought of God in terms of religion, i.e. opposing Him to life. The only real fall of man is his non-eucharistic life in a non-eucharistic world.” — Fr. Alexander Schmemann, For The Life of the World, p.25 I cannot help but be reminded of the instruction of Psalm 34:8 to, “taste and see.” If the whole world is a sacrament, then taste of this miraculous beauty that springs to life all around us! See beyond the outer layer of the physical world, and into the heart and mind of God! Keep telling the stories that celebrate the deep magic and encourage fantasy, because as important as a good work ethic is, faith may be more easily kindled through Santa Claus."
8,Mythopoeic Grace,social-issues," In September of 1931 J.R.R. Tolkien, Hugo Dyson, and C.S. Lewis took part in a late-night conversation at Oxford University. This was not only a pivotal moment in Lewis's life (helping to convince him of the validity of Christianity), but also a well-chronicled moment for mythopoeic grace. Two of the great literary figures of the twentieth century struggled for, and found, common ground that night—through the concept of myth. I will not attempt to delve into 'myth' as Tolkien and Lewis understood it; Alister McGrath does that very well in the third chapter of his book The Intellectual World of C.S. Lewis. I will simply suggest that divine truth (absolute reality) exceeds the ability of human logic to contain it; that includes theology (teaching and preaching)—and certainly politics and philosophy. Like the parables of Jesus, myth has the ability to reach beyond logic and reason (important though those things are). It is often said that grace comes through faith, and that faith is the conviction of things unseen. It could be argued, then, that grace is the result of faith in something our modern culture would consider a myth (the unseen world). Inherent in modern semantics is the notion that all myths are patently false. But the Christian (of the Tolkien/Lewis/MacDonald variety) rejects the assumption of falsity, while gladly embracing the mythic nature of his faith. Why does this matter? Because the vast majority of Christian thought and teaching has been sorely lacking in any mythic sensibility for a very long time. I would argue that most theology has a tendency to overcompensate for its mythical-sounding claims by overemphasizing an academic approach (as if that might help the modernists to forget about the baby born of a virgin, or the dead man rising from the grave). This exclusive bent toward cold, hard, Christian ""reason,"" I think, is what Tolkien and Lewis wished to balance through their work in giving the world new, modern, Christian myths. Rather than constructing rigid systems of theology that restricted possibilities, Tolkien and Lewis constructed mythical worlds of beauty and encouraged their readers to use their imaginations. Nearly any Christian will agree that the Bible tells a story, but it is far more difficult to find Christians who view the overarching biblical narrative as primary. Tolkien and Lewis were convinced of its primacy; for them, individual doctrines (important though they are) were of a lesser significance. A mythopoeic mindset is required to imagine the Kingdom of God. This fallen realm we call Earth runs according to the law of sin and death, but it takes faith in an unseen realm to imagine something like the law of the Spirit. It's nothing short of magical when a person chooses to absorb the painful damage and forgive an offender, rather than rally the mob and attempt to 'crucify' him. Likewise, when my struggle is for individual people rather than for things, it feels as if I am taking part in the working backward of some curse. We can easily imagine run-of-the-mill human grace, but a grace that covers the real sin of real people... that's mythopoeic grace! I've grown tired of seeing the Bible cracked open by men who look more like weary headmasters or smooth politicians. I'd rather see the 'true myth' opened by someone with a spark of wonder in their eye, like a child curled up with a fairy tale. If the biblical narrative of an infinite God is true, all the more reason to approach it with a mythopoeic mind. The danger lies not nearly so much in imagining the wrong things (the narrative remains to guide us), but in our sense of wonder shriveling up altogether if we don't nurture it. The 'true myth' tantalizes, as all good myths do—and sometimes reading a story is a lot like getting to know a real person."
9,New Year’s Resolution,social-issues," A New Year's resolution is a tradition in which a person resolves to continue good habits, change an undesirable trait or behavior, achieve a personal goal, or otherwise improve their life at the start of a new year. It is most common in the Western World, but it can also be found in the Eastern World Every January, thousands of people all around the world set a goal to help them start the new year off right. But how did this tradition begin? We look at the history of New Year’s resolutions. Some 4,000 years ago, the ancient Babylonians are thought to have been the first to establish New Year's resolutions. They were the first to have recorded New Year's Eve celebrations. For them, the year began in mid-March, when the crops were planted, rather than in January. They promised the Gods that they would pay their debts and return any borrowed items. These commitments could be seen as a precursor to our New Year's resolutions. In ancient Rome, the tradition of making New Year's resolutions endured. In 46 B.C., Emperor Julius Caesar introduced a ""calendar,"" declaring January 1st to be the start of the new year. Janus would be honored with sacrifices and pledges of good behavior for the coming year. In the Middle Ages, people set New Year's resolutions as well. By putting their hands on a live or roasted peacock, knights would renew their commitment to chivalry. The first day of the new year became a traditional occasion for early Christians to reflect on their past mistakes and resolve to do and be better in the future. By the 17th century, New Year's resolutions appeared to be commonplace. In 1740, the English clergyman John Wesley, founder of Methodism, created the Covenant Renewal Service, most commonly held on New Year’s Eve. also known as ""watch night services"". Watch night services on New Year's Eve are now common among conservative churches, particularly African American denominations and communities, and are often spent praying and setting resolutions for the next year. Despite the religious origins of the tradition, New Year's resolutions are now primarily a secular ritual. Instead of making commitments to the gods, most individuals make goals for themselves, with the sole purpose of improving themselves. Why do people make New Year’s resolutions? New Year’s Day is the most popular time of the year for people to hit the proverbial “reset button.” Eat healthier, exercise more, lose weight, save more money, learn a new skill, read more, watch less TV or mobile, travel more, quit smoking, get a new job, spend more time with family and friends, and so on are the most popular resolutions. Most people, I believe, want to have a second chance to improve their lives. The New Year presents a clean slate, an opportunity to start again. When we make New Year's goals, we're using a notion called self-efficacy, which says, ""I have a sense of control over what's going on in my life by aspiring to a goal and following through on it."" The annual ritual of making resolutions does not have to be a failure. Sometimes the difference between success and failure comes down to picking the proper goal and following the correct approach to get there. Above all, remember to be kind and flexible with yourself, and to acknowledge and applaud any and all progress. It's not only about achieving the end objective; it's also about enjoying the adventure along the way. Thank you."
10,To the Ghost We Have Not Met,social-issues," To the Ghost We Have Not Met It is said that life has its ups and downs. It does have for sure, and we all will have so. Why might we feel over the moon one moment and feel low the next moment? It is our choices that decide so.  How we feel now is because of the choice we made yesterday, and how we will feel or be tomorrow will be the result of the choice we are making today. We all just try to do our best to stay out of the stress bubble either at work or in our social life, and doing so differs from one to another.  To some people- including the writer- the more social we are, the more the trouble; the smaller the circle, the less the pain; the less the trust, the less the disappointment. It is life and nothing is predictable. What you really experience might or mightn’t be experienced by someone else. Among the things we do in life to distress ourselves is having a relationship. The one that makes your life easier in the sense of the word; yet not all relationships will bring you peace and comfort as you had expected. Let’s break it down and just talk that kind of toxic and unhealthy relationships. What could be more hurtful and disappointing than a toxic relationship? A relationship that might go beyond control when “gaslighting”- a massive, sneaky, and intimidating way of manipulating and controlling your partner- takes any kind of involvement in the relationship. The sacred notion of relationships is that partners look for what they spiritually miss and need the most, so they are a couple to complete each other, not to use one another. Unfortunately, in most recent relationships it has been obvious that either the girl or the boy is just looking for a benefit with less or no care at all of the other partner’s sentiments. The reasons behind that are enormous. Could we just say that money might be the first thing that most partners chase? It might be for some, but not for others. Also, there is another kind of committed relationships where both are fully committed, but some lapses and sexual impulses are likely to happen.  A time when a partner feels the need of “one-night stand” or a short secret fling to try their ability of having a different meal for a short time, and this is common, and in their defense, no one has the right to judge whether it is moral or not. The reason behind mentioning that is because it is common, and it hardly ever affects any committed relationships. Another kind of partners is the one who dates four or five others while being in a committed relationship at the same time. Here could we call this one;’ a real partner’ or just a cheater? This kind we are talking about here is the totally financially- independent kind who is not in need of another partner to leach off. The fact here is that women like to be the “Sirens’- female seducers, and men want to be the “Rakes”- male seducers. Both kinds love to seduce all people around, and hear a lot of flirting words. Thus, this kind of either men or women will keep seducing and making partners just to feel they are charming and controlling. To rule and control is the thing that women love the most, so it is already genetical then.  Such feelings give them the sense of security, warmth, and value, but for how long it will last is the question must be asked. If I were a girl, I might come up with a close-to- the truth answer, but in vain. To some people- of this kind- it’s life and should be fully enjoyed and no commitments should take place. Besides, people look for excitements and charm, and the more they get, the more they want, and ""what could be more exciting than getting to know new charming mates whenever there is a chance.” To some others, one of those men/ women whom we are dating is considered as the real future backup because we all age and no one will stay young forever. Let’s face it and call him/her the silly backup who is the most easily manipulated and controlled. There must be a backup when you find yourself old and no more charming. Moreover, what about the other kind of people who are not financially independent but still engaged in such more-than- one relationships. Could we say that they are looking for any care, sentiments or true feelings? Is it the financial need or the sexual desire that drive such people or your own partner to cheat on while being in a “committed and serious relationship “? No one could end up with the same answer, and no one would tell why such an above-mentioned partner would break up/ give up the relationship all of a sudden if their secrets where still hidden, and their moves are still unpredictable? What you need to know is that such a thing often occurs, and you might experience one, too. Just have less expectations and always give less trust, so it would be less painful. Furthermore, there is another kind of partners who might find themselves tied up with no wish to set themselves free. This dilemma occurs when one of the partners finds out that their “so- called soulmates’ is somehow cheating or dating another one. They will be haunted on their own mind whether to tell and end up alone or to go on and stay a part of the fake chain. How one will react is not what concerns, but how toxic and stressful it is for them is what concerns the most. Finding out that they are in a toxic relationship is not something bearable for all. And their dilemma occurs the moment they start justifying for their partner’s misbehavior and mistrust. It is the time when they will be losing their soul, dignity, and charm. Trying to justify their partners misdoings will drag them down to a point where they can’t handle anymore.  People in such a relationship will lose their power and strength just to find answers. The answers they think might help them to be content with themselves. They burn inside, but they keep looking for their partners value and appreciation. They do their best to maintain that toxic relationship, but for how long will they bear, and would they really be as loving and caring as they have been? People think and react differently, so no one could come up with a firm, specific answer. Thus, when one cares less about themselves, and has fallen in this “why / how trap”, then they have been haunted and stuck in the middle of nowhere, and they are welcome to the “blackhole of thoughts”. What is more is that life has a lot of “students of social learning “who are already ready to put on the mask and start to play the play that pleases you for sure. This kind of partners will be leading a double life; the one you know and love, and the one you have no idea of, and you might like or dislike or you might compromise for the sake of those you have loved. Imagine yourself in a relationship with one you have thought you had known almost everything about them, and suddenly you get to know that you have been manipulated and a part of their play. How frustrated will you be? People lead a double life to disguise themselves and who they really are. Some of them try to live the normal life they long for, and for some others it is just another way of making a living. We are not here to judge whether it is morally acceptable or not. What we stress here is on the hurt, pain, discomfort, and disappointment that the other partner will get when they get to know that the one they love has been leading a double life- a totally different life. We love the partner because of the way they treat us, love us, care about us, and when we discover the second life they have, we will only be asking ourselves the same questions; why, how, when. Was that bond real or was it all a lie? Why would people waste their time with other people in a fake bond? What was the motive? And why only me? Finding out that you are in a toxic relationship is not a problem, but justifying for your partner’s misbehavior, double life, lies, and mistrust is the problem for sure. It is the thing that will drag your soul and dignity through mud. Remember that your toxic partners will not let you leave peacefully as you might expect because only normal people do so, and they are not for sure. However, people are not that good, innocent, and kind as we expect them to be unless they prove to be otherwise. Following this motto will to some extent help to evaluate the people we encounter - including our soulmates. What we should be afraid of is the “gaslighting trap”, and it will only take place when we “idealize and give our partners unconditional love.” Like the drug overdose does, the love overdose could either spoil your partner or sweep them away and end up suffering alone. Thus, don’t let them drag you into a war where you only lose yourself, time, happiness and the value of life! Predators won’t leave their preys unless they are fully full or their preys are fully eaten! Don’t give those toxic partners the chance to feed on you. You should know when to say no, enough, and go on with your own life. “A tiger cannot change its strips, so don’t even try to change those people whom you loved because you will lose yourself trying so. In short, in most toxic relationships, people will end up having contradictory feelings; love and hate. Would be asking themselves; Is this the one I have been spending a long time with? Is it the one I have been planning to spend the rest of my life with? And when such a thing occurs, remember to embrace yourself and value your own worth.  We need to have less expectations, so we won’t suffer a lot. Once you think you are the strongest, undefeated, smartest, and unbreakable, you will get an unforgettable life lesson to bring you back to earth- the real earth, and to get you to know how weak, stupid, and fragile you are, and to move on with your life after being in a toxic relationship will not be as easy as before. Some people need closures to go on, while others need “a less hurtful/ merciful ending as a salute to the long time couples spent together. A closure will not be enough for some people; your soul needs much comfort to get the sense of yourself back. The work, stress, surrounding, and your own priorities will make the decision about how long it will take you to recover, not your own wish to recover fast that will do.  What you should get to know is that the recovering process has lot of relapses, and you have to keep moving on however and whatever it costs. Good things lie ahead of you; you have to fight enough to encounter, and enjoy them. Remember; in the short run you will look at yourself at a distance and say; “Wow, I have been a survivor and a real fighter.” That day you won’t remember the pain you had been through, but the people who had been sticking up by your side and patiently giving the shoulders because not everyone can be that patient for that long time you needed. I have got to believe that people should be dealt with as being bad, unless they see how they really are by their good deeds, not nice words. In short, regardless of how frustrated, hurt, lonely and ignored you feel after having a failed, toxic relationship, you still have many more battles to fight. Thus, brash it off, and pull yourself together to be ready for what lies ahead of you. Also, remember to give whatever affordable, and just keep two things away; the heart and the true feelings. The former could be compensated and made up easily; the latter will take you ages to repair the fatigue and fill the void. What we should learn is that we should never be stuck, and that life “goes on as if never ends.” So, this article is actually for the ghost we all have not really known or discovered in our partners, not the fake human part we mistakenly loved.

13,'Keeping in Mind: Social and Scientific Perspectives on Psychiatry',social-issues," 1 ‘Keeping in Mind: Social and Scientific Perspectives on Psychiatry’. Dónal MacEoin. Dec. 2021. Galway, Ireland. Epigraph “Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything”- George Bernard Shaw. Abstract The turn of the 21st century has been a particularly socially exhausting period of time. For mental health rights, the past twenty years have brought some encouragement, at least to civilly conscious groups. The trouble is, there are evidently many discursive compartments to understanding the psychiatric power structure, and, therefore psychiatric administration of anti-psychotic medication. From what I have personally experienced, the psychiatric super-structure is failing. The flaws with psychiatry as a method of en-masse mental health treatment are abundant. The practise of psychiatry lacks in transparency, and evokes some of the most-disingenuous human exchanges on the planet. From my personal dealings with various consultant psychiatrists who work for the Health Service Executive (HSE), what I have gathered is that they mostly fall into two categories. Ranked first, in both concern and majority, would be the psychiatric malignant narcissist, who falls into all of the typical tropes and sequences within the Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) spectrum. The second, would be a more covert (perhaps by necessity) sort of consultant, who assumes that it must always be safe to back up another psychiatrist, when it only ever, most probably, feels safe. What raised more concerns during all of the time that I have spent around consultant psychiatrists, is that this is a pattern that one can expect will reoccur within subgroups of psychiatrists over, and over again. Additionally, there is the lack of transparency, and inability of most people suffering from NPD to have the proper insight to perform consistently, and responsibly, when it comes to their work life and personal life balance. Not only is the propensity for things to backfire likely much higher than most people on the covert end of the spectrum seem to realise, but, the likelihood of things ‘escalating out of control’ from that point, are consequently just as high. I have spent around half a year in total as a legal detainee of Adult Acute Mental Health Units’ (AAMHU). I have seen many people come, and go through the Mental Health System in my home country of Ireland. I have seen many instances, where, others have fallen subject to the ill-fate of thinking that their mental health problems could not become larger than they were before they entered a mental health unit. With my educational background being fairly grounded in the behavioural sciences’, I have been forced to disagree with the practising psychiatrists that I have encountered. I have taken on the role of someone who 2 cares about the structures of society, and the way that we behave within them; and so, I have developed a sense of responsibility to raise awareness on the discipline of psychiatry. 3 Introduction To begin, I would like to provide some much needed context on the sort of circumstances that should help keep the focus of the article in perspective. I have formed a strong personal opinion on the subject, which is in no doubt biased, but, only due to personal circumstances that allowed me to obtain an almost unimaginable fractal of objectivity. As a professional, I feel as though I have a fairly balanced and inclusive perspective, which will predominantly seek to delineate between mental health rights, administerial decision making, and mental health science. I am going to attempt to keep my personal feelings from bleeding through into my critical perspective. However, I feel as though there is a particularly unique element to my experience that may be best used to interpret what could all too easily become a self-perpetuating and global trend. Therefore, I have decided to write a bit of a reminiscent ‘chapter’, as a means of communicating the qualitative information necessary to fully grasp the currently precarious state of mental health in Ireland. ‘After I was admitted to an AAMHU for the third time in September 2018, I figured that I may as well learn a bit about the medication that I was being administered. It really only took some quick searches on Google, and a few somewhat dense paragraphs. Eventually, I practised some of what I found in conversations with other patients (including one consultant psychiatrist who was more like a roommate, and a friend for a few weeks). He  that the dopamine response system is involved in many of the basic everyday functions that our bodies need to perform. I must have been noticeably interested as my roommate looked eager to tell me more about the neuro-scientific aspect of psychiatry. I could tell that was mainly what interested him about the profession. I asked him about the pharmaceutical aspect, and his dissatisfaction seemed to mirror my own. The summary of what he said confirmed my prior beliefs about the prescriptions that I had been receiving. It was not just that I no longer felt motivated to strive for the rewarding ‘moments’ in life, even the getting up to try was being inhibited. Gaining more knowledge on the subject has been easy since these first few crucial phases of comprehension, and more like it. I took up familiarising myself with some of the rudimentary fundamentals of the dopamine (DA) respond and award systems via podcasts, interviews, and everyday life. It is a lengthy process we will all continue to learn throughout our lifetime. I used to feel as though these moments were more important looking back. Moving forward is the most important thing to do, especially when you are ready. I have often felt that my life has been obstructed by this social structure, and that it is interfering with my ability to make my way through life. It is supposed to be the structure which helps me, as a citizen, improve my mental health. The structure has caused nothing but instability in my life. The frustration that I have felt from the severely sub-standard care that I have received as a patient at the mental health unit in Galway is just one of the many ongoing things that my consultant has ‘to do’. That’s what it has felt like after those six months total of admission, and that is why I am sure this system is broken. The psychiatric system in Galway works in the interests of the psychiatrists. So, there is a good chance that my life isn’t the only complicated ‘piece of work’ that my psychiatrist, as a ‘consultant’, has to deal with. It isn’t a good feeling, being on the receiving end of narcissistic abuse. Don’t forget, there is also a big difference between; a narcissist, and, a malignant narcissist. My former consultant was the latter. All of her dopamine comes from prescribing people like me ‘scripts’, and all of the trauma that I suffer through in life, is, used as an excuse to do so. Meanwhile, if I were to try and talk about trauma with my psychiatrist, she would quickly end the civility of the conversation by talking over me, and repeat that 4 process for ten minutes, twice a week, for a few weeks until- it was time for another script. After I am discharged from an admission, I feel the urge to stop taking the meds, then go off them, and go back to life. That’s always going to be the choice when you know your rights. What would someone who has resumed their life because they have a rough idea of their rights appear to, from the perspective of someone whose job it is to deal with anxieties, and stressors, and what is termed ‘mental illness?’. It was like they were mad that I ‘got away’. This person obscures my rights, some of which I learned (and wrote) about for my final year exams, and tries to prescribe me years’ worth of antipsychotics, when my ‘illness’ could have honestly been sorted by a tub of ‘Ben and Jerry’s’ and a healthy sob. The pharmaceuticals, on the other hand? Didn’t help. I stopped taking them, and got better. The only thing that could bring me back down that I could not foresee was that my psychiatrist would “organise another involuntary admission” for me. This was exclaimed to me as if it was a favour. It was unbelievable. My consultant went and followed up on that promise. Without having lived through it, it will always seem unimaginable, but, having the circumstances of your life determined by a mental health professional who acts as if she knows exactly who you are after having spoken to you for half an hour does not feel ‘real’. To sit across from someone who you expected to be a reputable person and have them tell you that you are not well, and that your earlier attempts to seek help from more preferable professionals was ‘mentally unwell’. Unreal. To have her describe your explanations of the slander, and threats, and abuse that you have suffered through as ‘persecutions’. Unreal. To hear this person go on and talk about the moments that hurt the most, and describe them as ‘episodes’; that same person who erroneously assumed that I am the sort of person who thinks I’m the main character in every show, or movie that I watch, and that when a song comes on the radio that I like, the world played it for me. It doesn’t often feel as if there is any avoiding them these days. The gaslighting, the gatekeeping, the goalposts, their games. It’s not always been easy to be a ‘good sport’. 5 Motivational Response to Acute Mental Health Treatment-Alternative dopamine pathways, alternative dopamine rewards. The institutions that practise psychiatric care in Ireland are becoming increasingly hindered. In some places (as it has been in the mental health unit in Galway), it feels as though you would need a folder containing all of your rights in order to avoid- what they will otherwise openly claim- is their right to forcibly administer anti-psychotic drugs. From an ethnographic perspective, appropriate time to ensure healthcare measures has never been given to the patients, in either of the mental health institutes that I have received treatment in. The argument that my consultant made to me was that my brain needed to ‘cool down’, and so I took some of the antipsychotics that she prescribed me. Since then, I have come to better understand the chemistry of the process. I don’t feel as though I should have been administered antipsychotics. However, my consultant also argued that the cannabis that I had been using was ‘affecting my brain’. Since there was a presence of cannabis in my system, and I was administered the pharmaceuticals, I have concluded (at least for myself) that psychiatric ‘care’, is sometimes abusive. In fact, it no longer feels comfortable to have mental health knowledge. For example, how is one supposed to cope with the knowledge that the first few antipsychotics you take when you are admitted to a mental health unit might be reacting harmfully with the existing drugs in your system? The brain will always be averse to counteracting substances, but also, there are then the counteracting beliefs. There has been regular coercive obscuring of my mental health rights. Sometimes, my ‘freedoms’, including use of my phone, have been used by my psychiatrist to blackmail me. Yet they are still referred to as ‘freedoms’. These are the sort of things that cause a patient increased levels of distress. In most cases, I feel psychiatric patients should, at the very least, be allowed to let narcotic substances leave their system naturally before any attempt to ‘persuade’ them to take antipsychotic medication. There has also been a worrying trend that I’ve noticed in the medical community (in Ireland) involving the addition of guidelines that prompt medical personnel (psych, and general), to ‘escalate’ when a patient is resistant to treatment. Personally, I feel as though the potential stress and anxiety that this form of treatment can produce should be enough to rule it out as a method of care within the medical community. “It has long been known that stressful and aversive experiences cause large changes in DA concentrations in downstream brain structures, and that behavioral reactions to these experiences are dramatically altered by DA agonists, antagonists, and lesions” (Bromberg-Martin, Matsumoto, Hikosaka, 7). Moreover, moments where the patient wants to express some form of concern are impossible to get back. They may forget to express an “internal fact”, something which could be crucial to ensuring the proper treatment measures are taken into place (Barnes, 162). As far as I am aware, I do not feel as though there has been enough convergence on the topic of ‘escalation’ within the global medical community, and, therefore perhaps this is a measure that could be considered as specific to University College Hospital Galway, and other hospitals in the Republic of Ireland. Nonetheless, “collective constraint, as in the enforcement of a law” (Barnes, 162), or, in this case ‘hasty’ guidelines, are not offering enough to account for a patient’s health and ability to express themselves. I say this coming from a place of experience, it can feel worrying. 6 “The short-term relief seems to be replaced by long-term harms. Animal studies strongly suggest that these drugs can produce brain damage, which is probably the case for all psychotropic drugs”.- Peter Gøtzsche, Nordic Cochrane Centre in Denmark. During my time as a patient in multiple mental health unit’s, I have witnessed various patients suffering from the deterioration of functional, everyday capacity. Most of what can be seen is patients with visible symptoms of kinaesthesia. When the length of time the patient is advised to take the drug is determined by the consultant psychiatrist, what can a patient without the mental capacity to argue for self-determination do? Many of these patients could have a better life on less anti-psychotics. Symptoms such as these should perhaps prompt the medical staff to reduce the dose of meds. Says it right on the box in fact. According to statistics, “almost 40% of people with psychosis are on levels of antipsychotics exceeding recommended limits” (James, A). Furthermore, “antipsychotics almost triple a person's risk of dying prematurely” (James, A). However, our mental health service here in Ireland looks past many of these facts. This leaves some patients to suffer from organ damage: “systematic reviews have found that all patients treated with conventional antipsychotic therapy have an increased risk of hepatic dysfunction. The median percentage was 32% (range: 5-78%)” (Qinyu, Zhengui, 47). I’m willing to bet that the majority of patients are never told the risks involved in taking anti-psychotics for extended durations. I know I wasn’t. Usually, patients simply want to get out of the ‘unit’- because it is not a healthy place for them to be. On the other end of the spectrum, the more ‘short-term’ patients will take to drugs as soon as they get out of the mental health unit, leading to yet another potentially damaging process for the brain to go through. As some consultants don’t deal therapeutically with addiction, this process is likely to repeat itself over and over. The Ventral Tegmental Area, or, VTA, “is comprised of a group of neurons located around the midline of the midbrain floor and contains mainly neurons that produce DA” (Dafny, Rosenfeld, 719). If the VTA-DA that is being produced as a response to drug addiction is being inhibited (by the antipsychotic) on its path to DA receptors, then all of the VTA-DA produced for “behavioural disorders, cognition, motivation, and locomotor activity” (Dafny, Rosenfeld, 719), are being inhibited as well. Imagine you have been administered anti-psychotics for a few weeks while attending a mental health unit. Your consultant has given you the meds to relieve your drug addiction, and reduce the irritability of symptoms of your behavioural disorder. You’ve spent your time in the unit hungry to get out. It’s been boring, stressful, and all you want is to be free again. You’re discharged and walk out into the open air. Your brains cognitive rate increases because ‘the moment is finally here’. You’ve been looking forward to having some self-determination back. You eagerly make your way outside the hospital grounds feeling more limber and motivated. The VTA addiction-corresponding DA starts being produced as you wonder what you will do for the night. You walk downtown and think to yourself; “why don’t I call a few of the lads and go out for a bit of partying?”. Depending on the concentration, the type of antipsychotic (and the party), you could end up celebrating by giving yourself some minor brain damage. Not the sort of thing that should be overlooked. 7 Optogenetic research suggests that this sort of neuromodulation of VTA neurons “induces a strong conditioned place preference which only occurs when stimulation is applied in a bursting pattern”, or, in this case, when a patients normal life patterns are resumed, with the activities, and surroundings of the person beginning to evoke responses from the VTA (Bromberg-Martin, Matsumoto, Hikosaka, 5). Seeing as many young people these days congregate in familiar spaces to party and socialise, the tendency for this sort of pattern to continue is concerning. Even more so, is the likelihood that a person who had no intention of continuing to use drugs after discharge, will be peer pressured into taking drugs once they are surrounded by their friends. The diversity in dopamine responses to aversive events is detailed in: ‘Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and alerting’ (2010). The article delineates between the many forms of dopamine responses. Where peer pressure is concerned, it is tough to avoid the affirmative signalling of the brain. “Both rewarding and aversive events trigger orienting of attention, cognitive processing, and increases in general motivation” (Bromberg-Martin, Matsumoto, Hikosaka, 6). The reality is, most people would already feel the aversive response to addiction by simply being around a drug, in a space where the drug had been consumed, or being around the people associated with the substance. Let’s say you’ve just arrived at the lads house. They have acquired some drugs because you’ve just been let out of the mental health unit, but, you weren’t sure if you wanted to take any after your admission. They haven’t even asked if you will be having any, and you are already feeling an aversive DA response. Some basic chit-chat takes place, and then your friend looks over at you with a familiar grin. He asks if you are having a smoke while extending his hand to pass you a joint of cannabis. You think of all the good times you have had smoking, in the same room, with the same lads, and you grin to yourself. The reward response has already taken over, and before you know it, the party’s going. The question must be asked, do the downsides of antipsychotics as an increasingly popular form of treatment- including their counter-reaction to popular narcotics such as cannabis- not overwhelm the exceptionally low potential benefits when compared to some of the competing mental health methods, techniques, and exercises? Personally, I feel as though proper sleep, daily exercise, a diet suited to the blood type of the patient, and some techniques, such as mindfulness and meditation would exceed the current treatment procedures. Keep in mind, the European Mental Health Act (2001) states that “the best interests of the person shall be the principal consideration” (section 4), yet, as Peter Gøtzsche cautions “it seems that a considerable number of patients are subjected to the adverse effects of antipsychotics without clear benefit” (theguardian.com). A healthy living routine such as this, and significantly lower doses of anti-psychotics would garner much better treatment results, and much higher quality of life for patients. After-all, anti-psychotic medication can have very disadvantageous effects. How can someone work, for example, if they are losing the proper motor function of their arms and legs, their mind is foggy, and their energy depleted? Let alone that, having your DA receptors inhibited does not feel natural, healthy, or smart. It is, mentally and medically speaking, revolting to be forced into taking high doses of this form of medication. The physical results of this treatment might not quite be brain damage, but innumerous alterations to the brain, over time, will scientifically add up to effects similar to that of brain damage. By way of continually robbing the patient of the natural DA elements that are slowly produced in our brains; those, of which compose the natural rhythm of a healthy individuals life, patients are forced to form unnatural alternative pathways that may take them from a state near enough to full recovery, to a state of confusion, loss of identity, and psychosocial 8 trauma. Then, of course, there are the unwanted side effects, adverse symptoms, and, unfortunately in some regions with slow mental health progress, there will even be instances of psychological scarring. There is nothing to gain for most people taking antipsychotics. Misfortunately, “on the ethical aspect, the debating sides disagree on how to weight the impact of the decreased risk for exacerbation versus the certainty of mild- to-moderate AE (Averse Event) and the risk of severe AE on the patient's quality of life” (Davidson, 216). The worrying trend, in my opinion, is that some patients are being misdiagnosed, and should not be prescribed antipsychotics at all. Some will have use of the anti-psychotics, but likely only for a short time. Some may warrant extensive use, but will their doses be too high? If you ask me, probably. HSE’s Administration of Antipsychotic Medication. In a lot of cases, the lack of proper doses can be seen (some side effects too averse to mention). However, these modern acute mental health units operate away from general society. It is difficult for the public to form an opinion on something which they cannot empathically respond to, and therefore the public currently cannot form motivational salience with regards to psychiatric reform. I feel it is safe to say that there will be more demand for salient mental health information to be identified and made easily available to the Irish public. There has been extreme demand for mental health services on social media during the NPHET restrictions. Can the public trust that the HSE can supply what is needed? The substandard administration of antipsychotic medication, and, therefore some of the official psychiatric administrators at UCHG most certainly are, bureaucratically speaking, rife in their careless distribution of anti-psychotic drugs. For the mental health sector in Galway, and throughout Ireland, much more than just personnel would need to be changed in order to see a more up to date system. “In practice, there need to be regular reviews of treatments between a patient and their psychiatrist in order to continually weigh up the pros and cons of any treatment.”- Dr. Michael Bloomfield-The Guardian. I reflect strongly with Dr. Bloomfield’s opinion. The absence of the psychological treatment upon admittance to mental health units’, is contributing to the poorer health of some patients in our state institutions. Personally, I don’t feel as though 10 minute meetings (with a ‘consultant’ psychiatrist), a couple times a week, are enough to work through some of the complex stressors that are associated with trauma. The multi-disciplinary team (MDT), idea is a good one, because it offers the patient something. Although, at present, a lot of that is simply hope. The potential is there for progress to be made with every patient. However, the reality that I felt was clear during personal experiences taking anti-psychotic medications, is that they are debilitating. I feel as though the psychiatrist, being part of a multi-disciplinary ‘team’, should not be the professional with all of the decision-making capacity. 9 They should no longer claim to have such capacity in the first place, given recent developments in the Mental Health Rights Movement, particularly the UNCRPD. Now would be a good time for the multi-disciplinary team model to take shape. Currently, the system is so flawed, the inability for the patient to develop new neural pathways freely (due to inhibition), leads to redundancy of other forms of treatment i.e.; occupational therapy, psychology etc... Mental health is not what meds you are taking. The structure is, from the tax-payer’s perspective, a cash furnace. Sociological and Political Developments. A report, titled: ‘Ireland’s first report to the UN under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities’, has been issued after, in 2006, the UN adopted the UNCRPD within its corporation. The Irish government signed the convention in 2007, yet, has more or less acted as though it was ‘signing up’. It was only ratified- or fully recognised- in 2018. It is certainly not being fully upheld to this day, and I feel that many psychiatrists are still ‘taking liberties’, with their chosen methods of treatment. Section 144, worryingly, and discernibly, reads like evidence of the governments prevailing resistance to adhere to the model of supported decision-making mentioned in reference to UNCRPD ‘Article 12- Equal Recognition before the Law’. After all, the ‘first initial report’ did not arrive until 2020- fourteen years after the convention. Somehow, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (ADMC), made it into legislative processes before the Irish government even began to think about the newfound rights of the most vulnerable groups amongst our population. Section 165 shows how quickly the motion has been promoted by Fine Gael (FG). “165. Ahead of the ADMC’s commencement, draft rules of court to facilitate the operation of the new capacity regime have been prepared by the Courts Service which is continuing to consult with the DSS (Decision Support Service) Director and relevant court offices on the matter”. Further deliberation on this topic would offer some much needed clarification. Through the gaze of a politically oriented perspective, this seems like an issue in the making. However, to keep with the scope of this article, I feel as though it is safe to say that there is a predominantly urgent need for mental health reform in the Republic of Ireland. It is becoming more of a discussion of what structures are now obsolete, and which individuals need to be introduced to enact the correct matters of civil diplomacy necessary for social development. This is one of those moments which offers an opportunity for change. Better mental health in Ireland. The need for it has felt so aversive, that it is starting to seem like most of the public has forgotten what the reward will feel like. After the past few years, I personally want to see progress. Teleologically speaking, the queasy development years of the psychiatric discipline are beginning to become more profound. However, there have been around as many ‘next generation’ anti-psychotic’s as there have been ‘iPhone’s’. Maybe, these new generations of antipsychotics have changed the psychiatric space a bit, but, they are nothing so long as the 10 older generations of psychiatrists remain obsolete. If the discipline remains as toxic as it is, many instances where the very same patterns of behaviour and illness that psychiatrist’s spend all of their time analysing in others, will become ingrained within the psychiatrists own mentality. It brings to mind the old adage; who shaves the barber? In the modern world, this is an obsolete notion; we all shave ourselves. It is a paradox that is outgrown by evolution. One must think, how many have asked themselves similar questions about psychiatrists? Who treats them, and, if no-one, can psychiatry possibly fulfil its role in society? Would we be better off looking after ourselves, and each other? Conclusions In short, people should understand antipsychotic medication as; a means to ease the dissatisfaction of not being able to perform our societal roles properly, because of the shifting normative behaviours of the present generation of the human race. Many of the psychiatric decisions that I have seen in the past few years (2017-2020) have been performed outside the confines of the Mental Health Act 2001, and United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. Where the pharmaceutical administration in socially obsolete mental health unit’s is not conducted properly- and responsibly- in accordance with internationally recognised legislation, the residing communities will most probably be much more susceptible to toxic narcissistic cycles, gaslighting, and demoralisation. The route forward is not so gloomy, when there are measures taken against the reoccurrence of past failures. Within the mental health community; there is need for more transparency, there is need for self-determination, and, there is certainly need for more respect. 11 Works cited: Bromberg-Martin, Ethan S et al. “Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and alerting.” Neuron vol. 68,5 (2010): 815-34. doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2010.11.022 J.

14,Implementation of Movement Control Order (MCO) from John Austin’s  Positivism Perspective.,social-issues," Since the announcement by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin on the implementation of the Movement Control Order nationwide, many regulations were imposed under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the restrictions that were imposed to the public was restriction in movement and gatherings, travel bans, closure of non-essential economics activities and prohibition of sports, religious, social and cultural activities. Besides, regulations imposed on people who infected with coronavirus and also their close contacts to be isolated from the public. This article discusses regarding MCO implementation in nationwide from Austin’s Positivism Theory perspective. Austin defined law as a command laid down by political sovereign which obliges a person or group of people to a course of conduct and enforceable by a sanction. According to Austin, positive law has three main features which are command, sovereign and sanction. John Austin was a nineteenth century British philosopher who formulated the first systematic alternative to both natural law theories of law and utilitarian approaches to law. Austin’s theory of law provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of law that distinguishes law from non-law. Austin’s particular theory of law is often called the “command theory of law” because the concept of command lies at its core. This can be seen from Austin’s definition of law. He defined law as the command of the sovereign, backed by a threat of sanction in the event of non-compliance. So, the legality from his perspective determined by the source of a norm and the merits of its substance. The first feature of law from Austin’s perspective is the type of command. According to Austin, commands are expression of desire by superiors to inferiors. Austin thought that all independent political societies, by their nature have a sovereign. If compared to MCO implementation, the government had expressed their desire to implement such Order to the public in order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the government as the superiors imposes such Order and regulations to the public(inferiors) in order to enhance public health and safety. The second feature is sovereign. According to Austin, sovereign must be common where only one sovereign can exist in any political society, in that sense, indivisible but can be made up of several components. The power vested in one person or a body of persons. As compared to current situation, sovereign meant by Austin can strongly relates the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet made up by several ministries. However, the Prime Minister and his cabinet are executive bodies and not legislative bodies but during this pandemic, they put the law into operation by implementing order and regulations without referring to Parliament because the executive body has power to make subsidiary legislation under Federal Laws. Then, he added that sovereign is who were not in the habit of obeying any person and in his turn he commanded obedience from the bulk of the people. Austin believed that every legal system should have sovereign who creates law whilst remain unaffected by it. However, in Malaysia, no one has absolute legal immunity including the Prime Minister and his cabinet. It cannot be said that as the executive body has the power to make binding law during Proclamation of Emergency, they are still subjected to the law they imposed. For instance, the Federal Territories Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa has been compounded for violating the Standard of Procedure to curb the spread of Covid-19. This indicates that everyone including the body of sovereign subjected to the law. This is what H.L.A Hart argued where he stated that laws may have several sources and legislators are very often subject to the laws they create. Then, the separation of law from morality. Austin viewed that there should be separation of law from morality. This term indicates that an act can be morally wrong but legally correct and vice versa.  Austin stated that “The most pernicious laws and therefore those which are most opposed to the will of God, have been and are continually enforced as laws by judicial tribunals”. Therefore, an act can be morally wrong but legally correct if the law does not prohibit such act of the person who subject to it. In my opinion, if compared to the current issue, the MCO and its regulations have been implemented without considering which are morally good or wrong. For example, travelling interstate or running a lawful business are not morally wrong, but there were still restrictions imposed on such activities. This shows that considerations of morality were taken away in the implementation of MCO. I strongly believe that avoidance of morality consideration in MCO implementation allows the government to curb the pandemic better and more effectively. Finally, law backed by sanction. Austin says that sovereignty is the power of affecting others with evil or pain and of enforcing them, through fear of that evil or fashion their conduct to one’s wishes. The presence of physical force was decisive for an imperial ruler to continue to rule over overseas countries. Similar to the present situation, those regulations were backed by sanctions whereas whoever defy the Movement Control Order and the regulations are punishable with an imprisonment or certain amount of find depends on the type of breach committed. For an example, the offences were classified into three categories based on the severity of the violation with fines ranging RM 1500 to RM 10000 to individuals and RM 10000 to RM 50000 for companies. The fines based on the severity increase the effectivity of the Order and also prevent the people from disobey the rules and regulations imposed. In conclusion, it appears that from the perspective of positivism theory by John Austin, the Government’s implementation of Moving Control Order and regulations are acceptable. However, I believe that Austin’s theory is incompatible with modern political and social scenario of Malaysia as it doesn’t give room to the very basic ideas of democracy, constitutionalism and separation of power."
15,Numerology Effects and Number Meaning,social-issues," Numbers affect each other: they reinforce, balance, and weaken each other’s effects. The predominance and lack of numbers is also a problem. The energies missing from the numeroscope can be imported somewhat with a proper name change, on the one hand, and by choosing a partner who has the energies missing from us (synastria), on the other hand. The even numbers (feminine energy): 2, 4, 6, 8 have a material effect, but not only on money, but on everything related to earthly life, e.g. career, family, social expectation. The relationship is essential for them, they also have an effect on the other sex, the relationship is natural for them. 2, 4, 6 can't live without a partner, 8 can try all his life, but he's the hardest because he's the most violent and the most independent. Even numbers also mean good associations. The odd numbers (masculine energy): 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 difficulty with them because highly independent. In addition, the number 1, 3, 5 and even numbers are very fast numbers, so they are difficult to follow, they are constantly on the move, they know a lot of people, they travel a lot, they move a lot, they usually have several relationships at once /, for they are constantly looking for the real, it does not even occur to them that there is a problem with them, this is also true for 7, 9. Odd numbers don’t show very good opportunities in business associations. He warns me to be careful. It means that one, even if associated with someone, may prefer to get out of the relationship as a loser, unless the Fate Number promises good associations, especially 2 or 6. You better count on yourself. In numerology, of course, all numbers can be related to a planet, and their properties and analogies are interpreted. Based on my knowledge and experience, of course I have a definite opinion about the relationship between planets and numbers, but there is currently no consensus among numerologists on this, so I decided not to mention planets in this writing, but an astrologer can easily identify them.

16,Make Every Citizen an Owner! The Case for Universal Basic Ownership!,social-issues," According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars of wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED, CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) •	ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, every transaction is instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by capital credit insurance, productive, private-sector assets, and is systematically repaid in an average of three to seven years! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario income/demand is tied directly to production/supply. When production/supply occurs, income/demand automatically follows. Thus production/supply creates income/demand and in the process, EVERY CITIZEN is suddenly in a position to become a PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. So, there’s an automatic balance built into this strategy that avoids inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Provide every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY •	HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE (that’s rooted in economic inequity) •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And systematically pay down our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. But that $4 Trillion of growth is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO LONG-TERM COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading)."

18,Marital Rape: The Perspective of Legal Positivism and Natural Justice,social-issues," When a husband engages in a sexual act with his wife against her will or without her consent, it is known as marital rape. Marital rape frequently involves violence, physical force, and threats, making the woman believe that if she does not comply, her husband will physically harm her. Marital rape, on the other hand, is not explicitly acknowledged in Malaysia. This is due to the complex history of Malaysia’s sexual offences law, its position in Shariah law, the reality of criminal practise, as well as the Malaysian people’s traditions and culture. The question here is marital rape a crime? Legal positivism rejects any relationship between law and morality, implying that there is no space for critical interpretation of the law. The reality that legal positivism dismisses morality and justice is reaffirmed by Hans Kelsen, who asserts that in determining what constitutes law, the question of the law’s goodness or badness must be completely discarded. He argued that the law must be devoid of extraneous and metaphysical influences such as morality, ethics, politics, and justice. The term ‘marital rape’ is not officially defined in Malaysia’s Penal Code. In Malaysia, Section 375 does not apply to rape in marriage. The government amended the Penal Code by adding a new Section 375A, which specifies that any husband who threatens or injures his wife in order to have sex shall face a prison sentence of up to five years. However, Section 375A of the Penal Code does not entirely acknowledge rape. Rape can occur without ‘causing harm’. For instance, when a husband engages in sexual intercourse by coercion or intoxication. The legislative provision is insufficient since it fails to clarify the essential concept of consent adequately. Marital rape, according to positivist legal theory, is not a crime and is legal in Malaysia. This is because legal positivists believe that a sovereign’s law is absolute and does not allow for subjective consideration. Additionally, positivists disregard whether a law is just or unjust, or whether it is moral or immoral. Therefore, even if marital rape is an unethical conduct that causes grave harm to the victim, it is not a crime because the government has not criminalised it. In contrast, natural justice begins with the idea that law is motivated by morality and is thus influenced by it. Historically, the natural law theory has associated law with religion and an underlying sense of justice, as opposed to the more utilitarian approaches taken by certain other schools. William Blackstone argues in favour of the natural law theory, claiming that natural law is a divine order. This means that it is universally binding and emphasises the need of no human law contradicting God’s instruction, or else it will not be regarded as law. Marital rape is claimed to be permissible under Shariah law in Malaysia. Although this is more likely to be a misinterpretation of religious law by some people. The majority of individuals in this country are unaware that marital rape is unIslamic and goes against the religion’s values. It is explicitly stated in the Al-Quran in Surah Al Ruum, verse 21 that, “As a religion which genuinely values women, in Islam, husband and wife relationship is based on love and mutual respect,” and “And His signs is that He made mates for you from yourselves, that you may find serenity in them; and He placed compassion and mercy between you”. Islam recognises equal rights for husbands and women in marriage and sexual interactions, as stated in An-Nisa verse 19 that men should ""live with them in kindness”. Mufti of Perlis, Dr Mohd Asri, or Dr Maza as he is more often known on social media, emphasised that husbands are required to comply with their wives in initiating intimate contact under Islam. On the other hand, the wife must do the same for her husband. If either party prohibits sex without a justifiable reason, they will be in breach of their husband or wife duties. Despite the duty to meet each other’s sexual demands, Dr Mohd Asri emphasised that neither party should be harmed in the bedroom. He further quoted Surah An-Nisa verse 19 which commands men to treat their women with love by saying that sexual relations between husband and wife should be conducted in a loving manner and they should not do harm to one another. Hence, it is completely untrue to assert that marital rape is not forbidden because shariah and other religious rules permit it. No religion in the world condones a woman enduring physical or psychological misery. From a naturalist perspective, it is obvious that marital rape is abhorrent and should be treated as a crime. This is because marital rape violates religious law and God’s command. Marital rape is likewise immoral and contradicts naturalism. The concern here is why husbands who sexually assaulted their spouses and get away with it are granted protection? Why is it so difficult to enact legislation to protect women from abusers within the confines of their own homes? Once marital rape is deemed illegal, a strong message is sent that all rape, whether committed within or outside of a marriage, is inherently wrong and unacceptable in any community. While positivists tolerate marital rape, it must be remembered that they did not consider morality. To create a peaceful community, the law that is adopted must take morality and justice into account. The government must criminalise marital rape and regard it as a type of prejudice against women and men, as it manifestly violates moral standards. Notwithstanding the government’s contention that marital rape is ‘extremely difficult to establish’, rape is rape, regardless of whether it occurs within or outside the framework of marriage."
19,Law of Armed Conflict: Consent to Violence?,social-issues," Law of Armed Conflict: Consent to Violence? Muhammad Harieth bin Zaini, Dr. Nabeel Mahdi Althabhawi Faculty of Law, the National University of Malaysia War, or now known as armed conflict had been one of the means and methods for settling disputes between States and any belligerent parties for ages. Nowadays, armed conflict often happens when a party demands their ideology or interest to prevail before others. To cater this problem, the world had developed a ‘guideline’ in what we can, and we cannot do in situation of armed conflicts. The infamous tagline ‘even war has limits’ had been cried out all over the world, to highlight the importance of the law of armed conflict. There are many laws that had been developed under the scope of armed conflict, which are directly under width of public international law. For example, the international humanitarian law, which highlighted the importance of protecting the affected parties which are not directly participating in such hostile situation of war. The world has gotten together in this effort by drafting many conventions to reconcile the effect of armed conflict, such as the Hague Convention 1907, Geneva Convention 1949 and its Additional Protocol, Refugee Convention 1951 and many more. There are also conventions to limit the means and methods of armed conflict such as Anti-Personnel Landmines Convention 1997, Convention of Certain Conventional Weapons 2001 and many more. However, there comes a question, does all this so-called ‘limiting conventions’ gives consent to violence? We can view the law of armed conflict from the eyes of sociological school of thought. Eugen Ehrlich stated that society as a main source of law, which society being ‘association of men’. Thus, whatever society had decided to do, it is for the best of mankind. In the situation of law of armed conflict, society; states had decided that limiting, not preventing, is the way to cater issues during armed conflict. This is because it is difficult to control billions of people from quarrelling with each other, but to limit the effect to others is easier. This is aligned with Roscoe Pound, as he said, law should be studied in its actual working, not as it stands in the book. Thus, law of armed conflict is more practical to be used to not let others suffer, even though preventing is more ideal. Law of armed conflict aims to limit the suffering of people during armed conflict, which clearly does not give consent to violence, as it aims to limit the violence. From the view of sociologist, law is a social engineering, which is designed controls and dictates what people can and cannot do, just like an engineered system of technology. Law of armed conflict gives the guidelines on how an armed conflict can be carried out, with limitations to make sure that there is no inappropriate violence conducted during the event. In conclusion, law of armed conflict does not give consent to violence, in fact it is the main reason why violence cannot happen in the first place."
20,THE INTOLERANCE OF MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT ON LGBT COMMUNITY: RIGHT OR WRONG?,social-issues," In recent years, same-sex relations, activity and marriage have been legalised in a number of countries such as Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and New Zealand. Such action of legalising indicates that the acceptance of people on the issues of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) has increased globally. Nevertheless, the debate among human rights activists and the government on the issue of LGBT is not common anymore in Malaysia. The issue was further heated recently when Malaysian transgender entrepreneur, Nur Sajat fled to Thailand and Australia to escape from the conviction by the religious authorities. Nur Sajat is wanted by the Malaysian government as she has been accused of insulting Islam by dressing as a woman. Nur Sajat’s case has highlighted the intolerance of the Malaysian government on the issues of LGBT. The human rights activists have made a strong stand against the government’s action in going after Nur Sajat and criminalizing same-sex relations as well as gender nonconformity. They believed that everyone is equal and they have rights. However, even receiving strong objections, the government are still holding their stance on the issue when the Perlis Islamic authority decided to ban transgender folk from entering mosques for worship. The government believed that criminalising LGBT is a solution that curbs the issue and they are just upholding religious beliefs in the country, which is in line with Syariah. It might sound ridiculous to justify the government’s action and it is unreasonable to impose harsher punishment on them, but, from the opinions of natural law school, it is understandable and acceptable. The natural law school or also known as a philosophical school, generally concerns itself with the relation of law to certain ideals which law is meant to achieve. The objective of this school is to investigate the purpose for which a particular law has been enacted. It is noteworthy that this school is not concerned with the historical or intellectual content of the enacted law. This essentially means it does not matter how the law is enacted, what matters is why the law is enacted in the first place. According to Cicero, natural law is universal where it applies to everyone in this world. For example, the offence of murder, no matter where the murder took place, is still wrong under natural law. Meanwhile, according to Hugo Gratius, one of the notable jurists of this school, natural law is immutable in the sense that it cannot be changed and will continue to exist if there is no God. This means that considering whether one thing is right or wrong is depending on the nature of the thing itself. On the other hand, according to John M Finnis, natural law consists of two sets of principles which is the existence of certain basic values and the requirement of practical reasonableness. This means that any law under this school must be logically possible to be done and is not immoral. It is also noteworthy that natural law is associated with morality and conscience. This is clearly because, under this school, law and religion must be seen as one since they are interrelated to each other. It can be deduced that for a law to be enacted, it must also be observed from the perspective of religion and they could not contravene each other. This school has been criticised for its concept on any human law must be conforming to natural law, and if it is not, it will not be regarded as law. It is argued that people have different ideas about what is just, fair or moral. Thus, in determining something is law or not, it cannot only consider whether it is moral, fair or just. Despite the criticisms, it is undeniable that natural law school has contributed to the area of law specifically in interpreting the laws. This can be fortified with the case of Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric [1992] 1 SLR184. In this case, the Singapore High Court has interpretated ‘monogamous marriage’ as a voluntary union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others during the continuance of the marriage. The word ‘man’ is interpretated in its ordinary meaning that is in contradistinction to woman. A person biologically a female with an artificial penis, after surgery, and psychologically a male must be regarded as “woman” under the law. Hence, in this case, the marriage between two women is declared as void. From this case, it is clear that the nature of a human is to get married with the opposite gender, not the same gender and going against this will cause harm in the marriage later. The application of natural law theory can also be illustrated in the case of Re B (A Minor) [2001] UKHL 70 where the parents did not agree for their daughter to be operated on so that she could live between 20-30 years while living as a handicapped person. The parents contended that natural law indicates that nature has its arrangements in terminating a life, thus, one should not intervene in the natural arrangement. Even the court ordered the operation to be carried out, but, if from the perspective of the naturalist, the parents’ contention was acceptable. If we referred to the aforementioned opinions of naturalists, the position of the Malaysian government in enacting the law to curb the issue of LGBT is then apprehensible. As known by everyone, Malaysia is a country that professes Islam as the official religion despite the multiracial and multicultural. As such, there is no doubt that the government has to uphold the Islamic belief and this is proved when Sultan has the authority in regulating the religious affairs. When the religious authorities have enacted the law to prevent the continuance issue of LGBT, they are taking into account the teaching of Al-Quran. Al-Quran has prohibited LGBT as stated in Al-A’raf 80 as it is against the order of nature. When LGBT is against the Syariah, it is immoral and hence, the enactment of the law to prohibit immorality can be regarded as law under the naturalist view. To conclude, the Malaysian government has only enacted a law to prohibit behaviour that is against the order of nature and it is agreed upon under the natural law school. However, the discrimination that took place in the LGBT community should also be emphasized. The basic rights such as rights to education, rights to employment, etc. should not be infringed. "

2,30 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE OF KAZAKHSTAN,social-issues," December 16  1991 is one of the most important days for every citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On that day, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan 1008-XII adopted the Constitutional Law «On the State Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan». The new history of the country and the unification of State and national unity are closely linked to the name of the first President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbaev Abishevich. In a short period of time, in the historical arena, our country has achieved a number of achievements in raising the standard of living of the population, in economic development, in building a democratic State based on the rule of law and in further strengthening security and stability. Despite the fact that our country’s independence is based on more than 130 nationalities, there is no doubt that interethnic and interfaith relations will always be in harmony and cooperation. Inter-religious and inter-ethnic harmony in Kazakhstan is an important condition for the integrity of the State and its establishment as a democratic State. The Law on Religious Activities and Religious Associations, adopted on 11 October 2011, clearly proclaims freedom of religion:  « This Act proclaims the Republic of Kazakhstan a democratic, secular State, affirms the right of everyone to freedom of conscience and guarantees equality regardless of religion, Recognizes the historical role of Hanafi Islam and Orthodox Christianity in the development of the culture and spiritual life of the people. The people of Kazakhstan respect other compatible religions and recognize the importance of interfaith harmony, religious tolerance and respect for the religious beliefs of citizens» . Freedom of religion is the driving force of a democratic State, one of the key elements of the system of human rights and freedoms. The problem of freedom of religion remains a pressing one for both Kazakhstan and a multi-religious country. We’ve been developing as an independent country for 30 years. By that time, many people have come and gone. It’s a fact that they brought their ideas and their religions with them. Thus, Kazakhstan has a law governing religion. This is the Law on Religious Activities and Religious Associations, adopted on 11 October 2011. We all know that religion plays an important role in State society. According to recent data, 67.4 per cent of Kazakhs consider themselves to be believers. This means that the role of religion in Kazakhstan’s social society is dominant. Of course, in this case, the issue of religious literacy is very important to the citizens of our country. Having religious literacy is public safety. Today, however, we see that, in the search for literacy, many of our citizens cannot distinguish black from white and follow opposite trends. In that regard, it is true that our citizens need experts who know right from wrong and who can maintain inter-religious peace in our country. Today, the religious profession plays a prominent role in carrying out these tasks and promoting each other. The following Kazakh universities offer religious studies: Kazakh National University. Al-Farabi, Egyptian University of Islamic Culture Nur-Mubarak, Academy of Business Careers of Foreign Languages, as well as International Kazakh-Turkish Hoji Ahmed Yasakhi University in Turkestan, etc. al-Farabi Kazakh National University Specialty «Religious identity in conflict theory» Second year of Magistracy 2nd year master’s student Kurmanaliyeva A.D."
3,Malignant Motives,social-issues," Every law student when first introduced to the elements of criminal culpability would have been told a person’s motive is irrelevant. Early on in the course, we were thought to distinguish between criminal intention (which plays a role in criminal liability) and criminal motives. It was then when I came across a piece of online news published in Metro UK on 23 Dec 2015, that it made me question this idea and ask myself, “why shouldn’t motives affect a person criminal culpability? In 2003, Alam Khan was only a tender boy of 12 years old when he witnessed his father being murdered by a family friend. 12 years later, scattered pieces of human remains washed up on the banks of Ramganga. The dismembered human remains were missing its head, making it hard for the body to be identified. The body was later identified as Mohammad Rais, and based on the information from the deceased’s brother, the victim was last known to have been to the house of Alam Khan but never did he return. When Alam Khan was apprehended, he had smiled and explained the gruesome detail of the murder– he had invited the victim to his house and got him intoxicated. Then, he played music at full volume before he proceeded to stab Rais and cut his body into 12 pieces with a hacksaw. He later packed the remains and threw it into the river. Alam Khan claimed that the 12 cuts represent the 12 years of ‘longing’ for the murder of his father to be avenged and finally he gets to ‘realize his dreams and is happy about it.’ After reading this news, I found myself justifying the death of Rais as something he should have seen coming, more so, he deserved such brutal death. Alam Khan had spent 12 years living with the haunting images of seeing his father’s life snatched from him all while, unable to tell anyone of the traumatising event that unfold before his innocent eyes. After more than a decade, finally, justice has been served on a very cold dish, indeed. To this end, it seemed to me that it would be unjust and unethical for the trial court if it were to deny Alam Khan's motivation and refuse to consider his disturbing account. In seeking justification to rationalize this moral dilemma, I came across two compelling articles by prominent publicists that worth to be referenced. In discerning if whether motives are truly immaterial, the essay by Whitley R.P. Kaufman titled Motive, Intention and Morality in the Criminal Law (2003) seems significant to be addressed. The article primarily established that motive is taken into account when it comes to mitigating sentences, but the aspect we're concentrating on is the distinction (or lack thereof) between motive and intention in exonerating a criminal. To begin, the author clarifies the difference between motivations and intentions. According to Kaufman, one of the most typical ways to distinguish between these two terms is to see motives as ""ulterior"" to the act and detached from the intended action, and a motive does not influence our judgement of a person's guilt. Even with this description, the difference between the terms is still very obscure. Therefore, Kaufman took the opportunity of clarifying these concepts by citing two decided decisions. One is the case of United States v Harmon (1891) where the facts were that Harmon was convicted of the crime of sending pornographic materials through the mail system. In his defence, he said that he mailed those materials as a “necessary vehicle to convey to the popular mind the aggravating of the abuse in sexual commerce” with the purpose of “alleviating the human condition”. In other words, Harmon confessed to his offence but maintained that because of his 'good' motive, he should be vindicated. Of course, the court dismissed his statements. However, in emphasising his 'good' motive, the defendant pointed out that the trial judge had also violated the same statute by using the mail system to send the pornographic materials as evidence, and thus argued that the same crime for which Harmon was convicted should also be applied to the trial judge. The court dismissed the argument once more, claiming that even if the trial judge technically violated the elements of the crime, the legislator must have intended an implicit exception for judicial evidence purposes. In another case, United States v Badolato (1983), one of the defendants named Quarnstrom who was charged with involvement in a drug conspiracy defended himself saying that he joined the conspiracy because he wanted to have explicit details to write a movie script. Quarnstrom claimed that he lacked the requisite criminal intent to “advance an illegal purpose” as per required by the statute. The irony, in this case is that unbeknownst to Quarnstrom, there were a few DEA undercover officers within the conspiracy at the time of his involvement, acting under the Attorney General's order. The officers were however as claimed by the court to have ‘effectively given immunity’ for acting under instructions. Kaufman drew attention to a few odd illustrations as to how the court distinguished between motive and intention in each of these circumstances. Even though it is plausible that one should always choose a legal alternative when attempting to achieve one's goal (either to 'convey to the popular mind the aggravating of the abuse in sexual commerce' or to retrieve information on an illegal conspiracy for creative purposes), one should also discuss the court's disparity in determining whose motive should be factored into the equation and whose motive should remain superfluous to his criminal culpability. Still, by discussing both cases, the difference between motive and intention remains an open question. Kaufman later introduced to the reader the doctrine of double effect in which he used to explain the distinction between motive and intention lies in the ethical difference of intending wrong as a means and foreseeing wrong as a side effect of one’s action. Kaufman gives the analogy of killing an innocent person to rescue others, as well as the administering of vaccinations, which may result in death as a side effect. The latter is permitted since evil is a by-product of a good deed rather than a bad method to achieve a good end. Next, Kaufman extracted the explanation from Germain Grisez in his article Toward a Consistent Natural-Law Ethics of Killing (1970), Grisez explained that where wrong is used as a means to the good (as opposed to being a mere side effect of the good), then there is no longer a ‘unitary act’ with a permissible intention. Kaufman applied this concept to the distinction between motive and intention, suggesting that when a 'unitary act' occurs, there is no need to distinguish between motive and intention since there is only one dominating purpose that determines whether the conduct is legal or illegal. Relating this to the case of Harmon where he said that since the judge had no unlawful motive or intention, the judge act remained a unitary one, where motive and intention is indisputably pure. On the other side, Harmon’s good motive (ends) cannot justify his criminal intent to violate the law (the means). Meanwhile, in the Quarnstrom case, Kaufman opined that the case was determined inaccurately if the above principles were to be used. Quarnstrom never had two separate intentions when he joined the conspiracy; in fact, he had no intention of joining it for any criminal purposes. His actions were completely motivated by his desire to observe narcotics traffickers in action closely. In this sense, the same justifications may be extended to DEA officers' motives and intentions. As a corollary to the above discussion, we may conclude that the distinction between motivations and intention is dependent on a person's means.  Even if one's motivation is immaterial to one's criminal culpability, if one's motive and intention are assessed to be one pure act, the requirement of mens rea (guilty mind) cannot be satisfied, and thus criminal liability cannot be established. Now that we've established that for motive to be ‘relevant,' the means must be a legitimate unitary act, indispensable to either lawful or unlawful intention thus, it's nearly hard to conceive an act of private revenge falling within this description. Revenge itself as defined in the article below to include the words ‘injurious act’ (annotated below) and with that alone, it brought upon a criminal wrong to inflict upon another any legally unauthorized injurious act. Elaborating on that note, the article by Brian Rosebury titled Private Revenge and its Relation to Punishment (2009) helps address the relationship between private revenge and morality. The article started with the definition of revenge from a few philosophers like Charles K.B Barton, Suzanne Uniacke and Robert Nozick – revenge in its summary definition is any deliberate injurious act against another person which is motivated by resentment of injurious act or acts performed by that other person against the revenger or against some other person or persons whose injury the revenger resents. In discussing revenge, Rosebury brought forth a few statements made by philosophers like Immanuel Kant in his book The Metaphysical Elements of Justice(1983) where he provided that based on the principle of equality where when one does harm to others, he should find such harm done to himself is a compulsory standard of punishing a crime. However, Kant had cautiously highlighted that such act of retribution must be determined by the court of law and not in one’s private judgements. Other than that, John Locke discussed that every man does have the right to punish an offender but only to retribute to him, so far as calm reason, and conscience dictate, what is proportionate to his transgression. In his insistence on ‘calm reason and conscience’ forwards that Locke does not advocate private revenge instead would refer such conditions to the Law. At least, from these two views on revenge, it is easy for us to see that the philosophers though admitted the right of resentments and retribution of one’s injury to the self, they were careful in highlighting the need for a proportionate, calm and rational mind in advancing revenge. This points to the necessity of institutionalized revenge by the court of Law. On this note, Rosebury provided the view of Roger Scruton where he sees that legal punishments authorized by the Law should ‘remove the necessity for private revenge’. Scruton responds by warning that the failure of liberal societies to satisfy the common idea of punishment brought about by institutionalised revenge will ""foster the desire for private revenge”, a desire we should avoid cultivating. Next, the author discusses two conceivable reasons why an act of private revenge is morally unjustifiable. The first argument is because the revenger's private conduct serves no purpose other than to satiate his darkest desires. Rosebury offered Aristotle's stance on private revenge, which permits us to individually react, appropriately, against someone who has wrongfully injured us. Nonetheless, the Aristotelian moral perspective held to the notion of justifying suffering to another with the intent that it cannot be for one's satisfaction only but must recompense such anguish for the larger good. In other words, private revenge is seldom utilized to compensate for anything other than the revenger's mental and/or bodily torment. As a result, because this serves no purpose in terms of public morality, the act of private revenge cannot be condoned. The second reason, as stated by Rosebury in his article, is that private revenge cannot be justified because just and proportionate revenge can only be given by a third party who is specially authorised by society to do so instead of the revenger to avoid counterretaliation from the afflicted party, which could last for generations. This rationale, once again, stems from the need for institutionalised vengeance sanctioned by a court of law. This is done to avert a cycle of revenge that would lead to the collapse of civilization. As the saying goes, an eye for an eye will render the entire world blind. As a conclusion, from a neutral standpoint, a person who has no tragic backstory of injustice and knows no reason to avenge anyone or anything, it is easy to say that revenge is immoral and that the administration of justice should always be left to the law rather than an individual who operates on his own rules. Because the legal system's position is that it should be unattached to the personal circumstances of its applicants, it is certainly chaste and beneficent to outlaw revenge, even if it is motivated by 'good' or 'just' motivations. However, we must confess that, under this veil of ignorance, some can empathize with Alam Khan on an emotional level, having everything and everyone that matters taken away, leaving them with nothing but ashes and ghosts haunting their every step. Life becomes a survival game in which vengeance becomes the motivator, persistently diluting away whatever reasonable reasoning he has left. Revenge becomes a cancerous drive that robs a person of his humanity, leaving only a shell of a self with malignant motives."
4,"Everything Progressives Want, While Reducing Taxes, Balancing the Budget, and Systematically Paying Down the National Debt!",social-issues," Does this sound impossible? Inconceivable? Totally nuts? If so, check out the following scenario. And when you’re done reading see if you’ve changed your mind about what’s possible and what's impossible. According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars of wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED, CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) •	ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, every transaction is instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by capital credit insurance, productive, private-sector assets, and is systematically repaid in an average of three to seven years! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario income/demand is tied directly to production/supply. When production/supply occurs, income/demand automatically follows. Thus production/supply creates income/demand and in the process, EVERY CITIZEN is suddenly in a position to become a PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY. So, there’s an automatic balance built into this strategy that avoids inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And systematically PAY DOWN our massive national debt, etc. But that $4 Trillion of growth is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO LONG-TERM COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading)."
5,Just Imagine…330 Million Economically Productive American Citizens!,social-issues," The US currently has a total population of about 330 million people including approximately 73 million children under the age of 18. There are over 46 million retired people. And there are 8 million disabled people, 8 million unemployed, 2 million incarcerated in our jails and prisons, as well as over half a million homeless people in the land of the free and the home of the brave. The problem is that very few of these people are economically productive members of society. Very few of them pay taxes. For a variety of reasons, a high percentage of these folks never really had (or ever will have) a genuine opportunity to become economically productive members of society. And with the rapid onslaught of artificial intelligence swooping up jobs at the expense of working-class people, the problem is only going to get worse - unless we proactively and creatively address the issue In that light let’s consider the following scenario which aims to provide EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN, regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or political persuasion, with a genuine opportunity to become an economically productive member of society while creating NO LONG-TERM DEBT for individual citizens or for the government. Check it out. Let’s Start With These Facts According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do?

6,Legal Pluralism in Malaysia,social-issues," In 1957 when Malaysia achieved its independence, Islam was declared as the religion of state but other religion can still be practised in peace and harmony. Even though Islam is the religion of state, Islamic law is not the sole legal system in Malaysia. Since almost 40% of the population in Malaysia are non-Muslims, it does not make sense to apply Islamic law towards them. Therefore, Malaysia has practised a legal pluralism in its legal system in order to protect the interest of both Muslims and non-Muslim in this country. According to Jacques Vanderlinden, legal pluralism is the existence within a particular society of different legal mechanisms applying to identical situations. Generally, legal pluralism can be defined as a pluralistic legal system in the juristic sense when the sovereign commands a different body of law to govern a different group of people which may vary by religion, geography and ethnicity (Merry, 1988). According to Griffith, there are two categories of legal pluralism which are weak and strong pluralism. Weak pluralism is when the sovereign commands a different body of law for a different group of people within the states while strong pluralism is where not all law is administered by the state legal institution but it was made by groups of people for themselves for the purpose of ethical and religious value. In Malaysia, we can conclude that the first category of legal pluralism has been practised in its legal system. This can be seen where there are two sets of rules which are Civil Law and Sharia Law in this country. The source of Civil Law is common law that was introduced by the British during their colonization while Sharia Law was based on Quran and Sunnah. Since there are two different sets of rules, the court system can also be divided into Civil Court and Sharia Court. The Civil Court will govern the federal secular matter while the Sharia Court will handle the matter of Islamic personal and family law. However, Sharia law is not comprehensive as the civil law will still be applied to Muslim in all matters that Sharia law does not regulate. The efficiency of legal pluralism in Malaysia has been improved after Article 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution has been amended. This is because, Article 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution mentioned that the High Court which is a Civil Court has no jurisdiction in respect of any matter within the jurisdiction of Sharia Courts. It means that Muslims are subject to Civil Law and Sharia Law, while non-Muslims are only subject to Civil Law. Any religious dispute by a Muslim must be brought to Sharia Court instead of Civil Court and Civil Court has no jurisdiction to interfere with religious issue under Sharia Court jurisdiction. Therefore, this will help to  prevent any overlapping jurisdiction between Civil Court and Sharia Court. The issue of conflict of jurisdiction can be seen in the case of Latifah Bte Mat Zin v Rosmawati Binti Sharibun. This case is about a deceased’s daughters arguing over the money in the joint account between the third wife and the deceased, whether it is included in the deceased’s estate or had been given by the deceased as gift inter vivos, which is hibah. The conflict arises when this case is brought to High Court instead of Sharia Court. Therefore, the Federal Court held that by Virtue of Article 121(1A) of Federal Constitution, the High Court had no jurisdiction over the dispute since the Sharia Court has jurisdiction in determining whether the assets are considered as a gift inter vivos or hibah as all the parties in this case are Muslims. Thus, the decision made by the High Court was null and void and had to be set aside. In conclusion, we can see how the Malaysian legal system evolves and the importance of Malaysia adopting legal pluralism in its legal system in order to maintain the harmonization of all the races in the country. Therefore, a dual legal system which is civil and Sharia play a great role in accommodating the right and freedom of Muslim and non-Muslim in Malaysia."

8,Inner-Peace in the Global Education System: Building Sustainable Well-being and Better Living Environment,social-issues," The fundamental components of sustainable well-being, and a peaceful environment is the protection of people against threats to life, health, livelihood, personal safety, and human dignity. The concept of well-being and a peaceful environment is people-centered, and it transmits attention to development methods from increased productivity to individual human development to empowering people and societies as a means of overall well-being. In the twenty-first century, humanity is in an ultimate disaster in several ways because of the traditional concept of development, which is ‘material growth’ oriented and not ‘people centered’. There has been a huge development happening in several sectors including infrastructures, technology, communication, economics, and health. But human development including inner-peace building is underprivileged because of the intermittent implementation of appropriate actions by the UN. The entire humanity is the victim of the so-called superpowers as the UN has been failing to intervene on time to protect peoples ‘vital core’. This study will explore how individuals’ consciousness and morality are gradually developed through inner-peace (SEL-social and emotional learning) programs. The Fetzer group first introduced the term social and emotional learning (SEL) as a conceptual framework to address both the needs of young people and the fragmentation that typically characterizes the response of schools to those needs (Elias et al., 1997). Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is a methodology that is an integral part of education, human development, and peacebuilding. Although there is no universally accepted definition of social and emotional learning (Hoffman, 2009), it is generally agreed upon that social-emotional learning is the acquisition of core competencies including one’s ability to recognize and regulate one’s own emotions, set and achieve goals, recognize the emotions and perspectives of others, constructively manage interpersonal situations including problem-solving and conflict resolution, and maintain positive relationships with others (Elias et al., 1997). They also remarked that in the modern era, most effective SEL programs are considered as being provided in more harmonized, sustained, and methodical tools using inclusive, long-term, multidimensional approaches. As per Zins et al. (2007), “social-emotional skills also can be infused into the regular academic curriculum so that academic and SEL skills are coordinated and reinforce one another (p.199)”. According to the OECD’s Survey on Social and Emotional Skills – SSES (2021), “the benefits of developing children’s social and emotional skills go beyond cognitive development and academic outcomes; they are also important drivers of mental health and labor market prospects (p.9)”. The OECD’s survey in the title of ‘Beyond Academic Learning’ is one of the first universal efforts on the SEL, and they collected data from students, parents, and teachers on the social and emotional skills of students at ages 10 and 15. Ten cities participated in the study: Bogota (Colombia), Daegu (Korea), Helsinki (Finland), Houston (United States), Istanbul (Turkey), Manizales (Colombia), Moscow (Russia), Ottawa (Canada), Sintra (Portugal) and Suzhou (China). All cities are located in OECD countries, except Moscow and Suzhou, which are located in partner countries. This global survey has revealed that While global education systems are constantly adapting to the new challenges posed by the pandemic, it is also important to recognize that with their classrooms, peer relationships, and support systems upended by the school closures, many students might be facing the emotional stress of adapting to their new learning environments. Developing strong social and emotional skills are fundamental if pupils are to remain focused and motivated in difficult learning environments and could therefore be key to addressing the main difficulties that students may encounter again in the near future if the second wave of school closures were to materialize before the health crisis has been fully addressed. If the COVID-19 crisis has taught us anything, it is that to stay ahead and thrive, people need not just cognitive skills but social and emotional ones too. Only together can they equip us for an uncertain and demanding world, and help us achieve prosperous and healthy lives (p.7). According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (article 25) as human beings all we have the same rights, and reasonable access to food, clothing, housing, medical care, and necessary social services. But, unfortunately, in reality, lots of people around this world cannot maintain a peaceful life in their states as well as outside because of the traditional ‘Development Model’, which is controlled by the superpowers. To take several studies in point on inclusive development, the focus on the production in the development policy does not offer the best strategy to build sustainable well-being, and a peaceful living environment but rather gives importance to the material growth which insisting power mobilization. The human development approach has referent objects of people, communities, and states which ensure the security of human rights, protection of individual security including the freedom to choose freedom from fear, and dignity. Whereas traditional development models including economics, infrastructures, technology, and communication failed to meet all requirements to secure individuals, and international communities because of their limited referent objects, values, perception of threat, and practical instrument to protect. World Peace will not arise from overthrowing dictatorial supremacies or increasing productivity, it will happen when humanity raises individual consciousness with an unconditional love beyond that of fear and hatred. To build sustainable well-being, and a peaceful living environment, we need to set up our intelligence, and experiment in a common ground through a distinctive philosophical approach – the ‘Inner-Peace (SEL- social and emotional learning) Method’ in the global education system. The SEL as an ‘Inner-Peace Method’ will focus to place prevalence on the human to incite transformation through the training, and development for individuals in academic programs, participating learners in the different moral, and social learning programs. The vigorous competencies of SEL are self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making, social awareness, and relationship skills. Throughout the SEL program students of all ages and educators/staff can develop healthy behaviors, manage emotions and maintain a sympathetic and responsible manner in the classroom and life. Keyes (2005) expanded on the dimensions of social-emotional learning with the dual-continuum model that operationalized the World Health Organization’s recognition in 2004 that mental health is not simply an absence of mental illness, but rather “a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community” (p. 12). For empirical support that inner-peace through SEL leads to peaceful outer action, Dorn (2001) pointed out that there are many Nobel Laureates who placed great importance on the inner dimension of their peace work: Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Mikhail Gorbachev and Nelson Mandela, and, of course, religious figures like Mother Theresa and the Dalai Lama (p.161). Based on research and scientific evidence, SEL as the inner-peace method would significantly contribute to building sustainable well-being, and a peaceful living environment because of its fundamental characteristics such as organic, universal, people-centered, interdependent, and early prevention. The findings from several individual studies and narrative reviews suggest that universal social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are associated with positive results such as improved attitudes about the self and others, increased prosocial behavior, lower levels of problem behaviors and emotional distress, and improved academic performance (Catalano et al., 2002; Greenberg et al., 2003; Zins et al., 2004). Eight positive youth development programs led by Catalano et al. (2002) and focused on school-age children in school, family, and or community domains. They used a quantitative research method through experimental strategies and random assignment of school children to intervention and control groups. This project provided a sustained intervention experience during eight months and had a measurable impact on students including greater self-control, assertiveness, improved academic performance, and emotional support, and reduced problem behaviors. At present, academic and SEL issues are addressing in a parallel manner. Implementing an ‘Inner-Peace Method’ through SEL in the global educational system creates strength and balance, as well as heightened wisdom of well-being of students, learners, and educators. Abedin (2019) conducted a study on the universal education system through descriptive research method and revealed that as the fragment of SEL, moral education is a very effective method to helping children and adult learners acquire essential virtues or moral habits that will create a positive impact on the individual which led a good life and live peacefully and at the same time become productive, contributing members of their societies or communities. A Study by McCormick et al. (2015) done on one SEL program- the Responsive Classroom approach has found that SEL programs are beneficial for academic performance because they target interpersonal skills such as “appreciating others’ perspectives, initiating and maintaining positive relationships, and using critical thinking skills to make responsible decisions” (pg. 2). In their meta-analysis, Durlak et al. (2011) discovered that SEL programs generated signiﬁcant positive effects on targeted social-emotional competencies and attitudes including students’ behavioral adjustment in the form of increased prosocial behaviors and reduced conduct and internalizing problems, and improved academic performance on achievement tests and grades (p.417). This study was conducted through a meta-analysis of 213 school-based, universal social and emotional learning (SEL) programs involving 270,034 kindergartens through high school students and revealed that compared to controls, SEL participants demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved social and emotional skills, attitudes, behavior, and academic performance that reﬂected an 11-percentile-point gain in achievement. Remaining open to sanguinity by using inner-peace tools can give the flexibility necessary to be more productive in the classroom and in personal life. There is growing evidence that as the most effective inner-peace mechanism, Meditation and Scientific Breathing Technique (Pranayama) in wide-ranging impacts participants in the areas of inner-peace including physical, mental, academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The scientific breathing technique ‘Pranayama’ is the most ancient holistic method which has incorporated in meditation practice to regulate mind and breathe. The main moto of the Pranayama is regulating of breath to enhance life force for long-term. To explaining Buddhist theory of inner peace, Tanabe (2016) disclose that, ”Inner peace means an awakening to an ultimate inseparability between our own well-being and happiness and that of others, which inspires us to make an effort to gratify the basic needs of all and promote our freedom and justice and that of others equally “(p.1)”. Waters (2020) suggests that there is a strong case for implementing meditation in schools and this can be done in a number of ways. Primarily, meditation training can become a core part of teacher education so that all teachers are skilled in the use of mediation as part of their teaching toolkit ( p.1). The author also argues that schools can bring in evidence-based meditation curricula such as those that have been developed in Australia (Smiling Minds; Meditation capsules), India (The Alice Project), the UK (Mindfulness in Schools Project), and the US (Inner Kids, Mindful Schools, Mind Up, Learning to Breath) (Waters, 2020, p.1). The effects of school meditation have been examined in relation to numerous aspects of well-being, including student anxiety, stress, depression, optimism, positive affect, self-concept, self-care and self-acceptance (Waters et al., 2015, p.117). Throughout their study, Waters et al. (2015) used qualitative interviews research method and it has been implemented across junior, middle and senior schools, across different school systems (e.g., public schools and private schools), in different countries, with students of both genders and various races. The study was conducted quantitative research through randomised controlled experimental trials and quasi-experiment strategies by using pre-existing psychometrically established surveys and appropriate statistical analysis procedures. Throughout the lived experience of students in the meditation research, all data was collected through testimonials which provided richer descriptions of the underlying processes of meditation. Accordingly, Greenberg et al. (2001) suggested that to reduce levels of mental illness in children, early preventative interventions are necessary, and furthermore, these interventions must be broadly accessible to children who may not have access to regular medical treatment. Young people aged 15 to 24 are more likely to experience mental illness and/or substance use disorders than any other age group (Pearson et al., 2013). Unlike the many “categorical” prevention programs that targeted specific problems, SEL programming could address underlying causes of problem behavior while supporting academic achievement (Greenberg et al., 2003, p.467). Therefore, SEL programs geared toward students in schools must include training for staff so that they can better address the needs of students in their classes and facilitate quality education. The above circumstances provide comprehensive reasoning for the implementation of SEL to increase levels of psychological support and programming geared toward improving the psychosocial wellness of the students and educators. The SEL has several limitations as the causal analyses require strong assumptions. One of the persistent issues surrounding SEL is the lack of a reliable theoretical definition. A current challenge on social and emotional skills research is to describe the long-term impact of social and emotional development programs (Moreira et al., 2014, p.1). According to McCormick et al. (2015), there are also additional possible mechanisms needed to be done across levels (classroom, family, child, school) including improvements in teaching practice, peer interactions, parent-child relationships, overall classroom behavioral engagement, and specific intervention components including coaching, training, PD (p.18). Challenging experiences on SEL programs should not be seen as negative; on the contrary, few SEL expertise would argue a certain level of challenge is necessary for mental health and personal growth. Despite these limitations, an educational institution is also a place where students/learners can learn, grow, and come to be much happier by practicing inner-peace through SEL that is scientifically proven to reduce the stress hormone cortisol and release organic chemical dopamine to become peaceful. In conclusion, based on researches and practical evidence, the inner-peace program through Social and Emotional Learning at the schools, colleges, universities, vocational institutions can be the most valuable tool to improve pupils/learners’ overall well-being including perspective, resilience, moral competence, attitudes, spirituality etc. Adelman and Taylor (2000) argue that if educational instructions emphasize only academic teaching and administration in their attention to support students achieve academic success then pupils/learners will miss their full potentials as human beings. Zins et al. (2007) stated that as the Person-Centered Focus, “social and emotional education involves teaching children to be self-aware, socially cognizant, able to make responsible decisions, and competent in self-management and relationship-management skills to foster their academic success (p.195)”. Modern science has proven that through an inner-peacebuilding practices, people can train to become peaceful but unfortunately, people do not take this revolutionary idea seriously. Even in a situation where being stressed, feeling anxious and emotional scars are realistic and existing threats, inner-peace/happiness has the power to improve an individual’s life immensely through awareness, compassion, patience, and inspiration. As Siddhartha Gautama Buddha said, “There is no way to inner-peace, inner-peace is the way”. I would recommend policy makers to implement the inner-peace programs through “Social and Emotional Learning” in the global education system. It will be tremendously effective to demolish hatred, corruption, nepotism, manipulation, and violence which will lead to building a conscious human generation and a peaceful living environment.

9,Bernie Would Be President Today If He Had Endorsed Economic Democracy Over Democratic Socialism,social-issues," Words matter. And in the vocabulary of many Americans the word Socialism is a dirty word. In that light, when a politician runs for the Presidency of the United States and describes himself as a Democratic Socialist, he instantly reduces his odds of winning by virtue of alienating all those Americans who immediately equate Socialism with Evil. Despite the popularity of his ideas, if Bernie Sanders had won the Democratic nomination for President he would have been relentlessly pummeled by the GOP over his socialist label and Trump’s odds of winning would probably have increased. But if Bernie had familiarized himself with the Kelsonian concept of Economic Democracy (I’m convinced he’s never been exposed) he’d have realized that he could accomplish everything that he wanted to accomplish and more without being branded a socialist. In fact, he could have accomplished everything he wants to accomplish while creating NO LONG-TERM DEBT for the government or for we the people. Let’s Start With These Facts So, what is Economic Democracy? Let’s start with these facts. According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth-producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so-called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars of wealth-producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED, CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) •	ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, every transaction is instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by capital credit insurance and productive, private-sector assets! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario income/demand is tied directly to production/supply. When production/supply occurs, income/demand automatically follows. Thus production/supply creates income/demand and in the process, EVERY CITIZEN is suddenly in a position to become a PRODUCTIVE MEMBER of society. So, there’s an automatic balance built into this strategy that allows it to avoid inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. But that $4 Trillion of growth is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real, live, results-driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO LONG-TERM COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading)."

11,Attaining success through Positive abnormality,social-issues," There are two types of abnormalities, We have positive and negative. Positive abnormalities: not conforming to rule or system; deviating from type) aberrant, anomalous, atypical, exceptional, extraordinary, irregular, preternatural, strange, unusual. When you dive into the mood of positive abnormalities you are full of surprises. An abnormal person are been considered to be useless, hopeless to their Society. The world does not accept them because they do not conform  to the  norms of this world Note, the laws of life itself is different from the laws of this earth. Life through your thought brings or challenges you through thought of ideas that are not achievable or realistic sometimes but it only takes an abnormal positive person and goal-getter, persistent, dog-headed, determined person to achieve and bring to reality or pass what life has in store for us. Using the heart-touching story Of Elon Musk as a case study. One who was raised by books, books, and then his parents. While the earth or the world works with the law of the past e.g ""this is how we use to do it, it can not be changed, We can not kill ourselves"" I.e following the stethoscope, thereby making u remain the same way u are, forgetting that life itself rules the world and life involves taking a risk. Everything we do can be tiring, Stand for a long time, u feel uncomfortable, sit down you still feel uncomfortable, then lay down, still the same thing right, I.e, Life will never please s you so be ready. But Only if you adapt yourself to the game of life you will win but b ready to take the risk to get rewarded. Now brushing through the story of Elon Musk, he was a bookworm right of his childhood. He was probably born different than normal people, Elon was so much interested in books and science, That he spent all his childhood reading and reading. By his own account, Musk a self-described bookworm and something of a smart aleck—he read voraciously, everything from encyclopedias to comic books. But Musk’s intellectual aptitude did him few favors as a child. He found few friends in the tough-minded Afrikaner culture he encountered in school. He was called an idiot When a kid, Elon was considered an idiot, ""My father would always call me an idiot."" Elon Musk says that his father never respected him. He didn’t believe that I could do something of my life and that I was a total failure. He really had a miserable life, His father would beat him whenever he got angry, The gangsters at his school beat him so many times. ""You get chased by school gangs, Who tried to beat the hell out of me."" One day he was even thrown off the stairs, His condition was so bad that he had to go to the hospital. Such was his life when he was growing. He didn’t believe that I could do something of my life and that I was a total failure. One day he was even thrown off the stairs, His condition was so bad that he had to go to the hospital. Such was his life when he was growing. His First Computer Program When Elon was just 12, he created a computer game called “Blaster” that he sold for $500. When Elon Musk sold this game, he realized the power of computer programing. His passion was built in this field and wanted to do major in it. When he was in Standford and doing his major in computer science, The internet was introduced. It was the boom of dotcom, That he didn’t want to miss. And that is why he dropped out of his college. Paypal The creation of Paypal is the actual reason for his success. When he created PayPal with the Name of X.com, He was able to sell this company for $1.2bn. While all the money didn’t go into his pocket but still a handsome amount went right into his pocket. ( $165 Million) Elon musk continued his way to success, Now he owns SpaceX and Tesla which are world-renowned companies. Elon musk is now the world’s 3rd richest man with a total net worth of 157 billion dollars. There are so many wonderful stories of this kind. Be aware, that there is this spirit of rewards that comes after every determined and resilient efforts, and those who opt-out or do not align themselves because of frustration or unravel misery of life itself, will remain in the world zone( abiding by the norms), or end up in the negative abnormalities Negative abnormalities: different from what is normal or average: unusual especially in a way that causes problems of mental health. Note: Positive abnormal people don't care abt what the world will say but success and realization of their goals. While the world thinks about obeying the norms that put them in a circle of no escape or advancement and pleased to prison the wonderful and miraculous ideas that life has given. Lastly Negative abnormal people are just tired of life after trying to be in the rank of the above , so they are ready to cause mayhem by bypassing both laws. Never be ok with where you are because the world is pleased with it. The world may see you as an abnormal person because you do not reason the way they do, never mind, you can only fail or succeed if you accept. Note the essence of living is greatness, so be the savior of your world."
12,5 companies with environmental responsibility,social-issues," 5 companies with environmental responsibility By Gustavo Copelmayer In response to climate change, companies that want to be successful should not only think about the economic benefits. It is vital that they take responsibility for environmental care and employ actions that allow them to be more environmentally friendly. Here is a list of companies that, in addition to being successful, perhaps you did not know that they are taking important steps in their environmental policy: Telefónica: This company has taken key initiatives in environmental care. In 2020 it was recognized as a leading company due to its policy towards climate change and has been for seven years in a row on List A of companies that control its environmental impact. Telefónica has more than 1000 energy use projects and, despite its growth, its energy consumption has remained stable in the last ten years. Heineken: This brewery has the highest certification in sustainable crops worldwide and three out of four of its beer bottles come from these crops. In addition, it has among its goals to reach the year 2040 as a carbon neutral company by reducing the emissions that are produced in the crops of its raw materials. Colgate-Palmolive: Although this company ranked 8th in plastic polluting companies in 2019, it recently committed to reducing the volume of its plastic packaging by exactly one third. The long-term goal is to use 100% fully recyclable plastic in all its products. Another of its objectives is to use 100% renewable energy in its operations through the purchase of ecological energy and the use of solar fields. Visa: The finance company has achieved its goal of using 100% renewable energy, using eco-friendly energy sources such as solar or wind. This company has made significant local investments in electricity in places where they have large facilities. With this achievement, Visa has reduced the emission of greenhouse gases by 90% in all its operations. Seat: This car factory has also demonstrated its commitment to climate change and has reduced the environmental impact of its plants by 34%. It has developed a photocatalytic pavement that decontaminates the air by 40% through a chemical reaction that eliminates pollutants and bacteria. It also has the largest solar power plant in Europe in the automotive industry, reducing carbon emissions by 63%. As we can see, these and many other companies have assumed a leading role in sustainable development. They have understood that customers are not only looking for good service, but also want to be sure that the products they consume are made by companies aware of their responsibility in caring for the environment. Our environment needs everyone, and companies cannot be left behind in this work."
13,Economic Emancipation VS Wage Slavery in the USA,social-issues," If you own enough wealth producing capital assets such as land, buildings, machinery, patents, copyrights, stocks, or bonds YOUR MONEY IS WORKING FOR YOU and it’s probably producing a stream of capital income from which you benefit. On the other hand, if you own nothing more than your own labor (your ability to perform work) like over 90% of Americans, YOU ARE WORKING FOR YOUR MONEY. In this case you’re faced with the dilemma of either selling your labor (talents/time) to someone else (an employer) in exchange for a paycheck or starving on the streets. When someone buys your labor/talents (hires you) they effectively own the most productive percentage of your day, week, month, year, life. As such, they can dictate what you can do with that percentage of your life. If you fail to do what’s expected, you’ll lose that paycheck and the means to the physical necessities of life such as food, shelter, and clothing. In some circles this latter condition is known as WAGE SLAVERY. The person who is working for their money is economically enslaved (dependent on an employer) by their lack of viable economic alternatives. To repeat, your alternatives are either to sell yourself and your talents in exchange for a buck, or find yourself homeless and begging on the streets. Ironically, in this land of the free and the home of the brave, over 90% of all Americans experience life working for their money, and they’re FREE TO STRUGGLE WITH all the pressures that accompany economic dependence/enslavement. When they finally retire and take Social Security, they are re-enslaved by (dependent on) the government for their survival. For fear of the economic ramifications, they’re never truly financially free to explore and to develop the potentials they were born with. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Check it out. Let’s Start With These Facts According to a Federal Reserve 2018 estimate, the American economy, on average, creates $4,000,000,000,000 (4 trillion dollars) worth of wealth producing capital assets annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were 18 months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars of wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED, CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, every transaction would be instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by capital insurance and productive, private-sector assets! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario income/demand is tied directly to production/supply. When production/supply occurs, income/demand automatically follows. Thus production/supply creates income/demand and in the process, EVERY CITIZEN is suddenly in a position to become a PRODUCTIVE MEMBER of society. So, there’s an automatic balance built into this strategy that allows it to avoid inflation. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. But that $4 Trillion of growth is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Many millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO LONG-TERM COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading)."
14,The Greatest Indian Takeaway,social-issues," Taking away chow To Go, food bought ready to eat and take home, extends across delights sourced from many countries, not least of those is India. So, what do you reckon? Is Tandoori the greatest Indian takeaway? Or Biryani? Let’s stop this trivia; the zenith of Indian takeaways is more important than a bowl of chuck. Although forming a tiny item within meals, it’s one additive we digest every mealtime. I speak of pepper, which I will prove changed our world. Shriveled husks that became used as currency in Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. These still serve as a means of payment, but their value has reduced. Anglophile legal systems employ the term peppercorn rent if the landlord doesn’t require a cash reward, like it’s for nothing! Believe me, the Indian takeaway of pepper was definitely NOT for nothing. Peppercorns are the real thing. However, you should beware, as imposters use the same name. There are pink peppercorns from Madagascar as opposed to pink berries (but often also named pink peppercorns) from South America. Added to the list are Szechuan pepper, cayenne pepper, chili peppers, and capsicum peppers. But these are frauds that stole the word pepper. They have no link with real pepper’s rich history. Okay, a cousin called long pepper sometimes acted in the guise of genuine pepper. It comes from Northwest India, so it still formed part of the Indian takeaway. Although a poor substitute, traders sought it because the location was easier to access than true pepper. It’s found in Kerala on the South-West coast. A remote area where the takeaway of pepper, and I realize I repeat myself, was NOT for nothing. Kerala has history. We aren’t talking about events while the American civil war raged. Oh no, and medieval castles were so fresh you should regard them as new-fangled ideas. You can think of the first athletic sports on Mount Olympus as being recent. So where are we? While we could look back even earlier, let’s settle for 10,000 years ago. Kerala is where humankind was a great success story. Peppercorns those ancient families foraged for sometimes became misplaced. Archaeologists now treat these as valuable finds. The remnants turn up in their upmarket cave dwellings. They coexist with examples of the earliest art worldwide. The artists were social animals who built dolmens, stone tombs. These artifacts show they had respect for their loved ones. That respect became care and care needed medicines. Hey ho, pepper was a healer of many ills. Once they used pepper to cure ailments, other uses become obvious. For instance, they soon stumbled across the fact it does good things when mixed with food. As house-proud cave dwellers, they bragged their diet was superior to the guys next door. Then little by little the news spread. Despite the difficult terrain to cross, the commodity traveled beyond the shifting river deltas of Kerala. It became sought by buyers far from its origins. Small amounts of the magic dust hit the fledgling trade routes, including the Silk Road. Vendors sold this precious export to the wealthy wherever they could reach them. This presaged an uprising bigger and more profound than the Industrial Revolution - the Trade Revolution. Make no mistake, luxury goods drove a move to worldwide commerce, and pepper was the most opulent element within the dealers’ sales brochure. High-value products can create enormous leaps in demand. Shifts often occur as hedonistic raiders grab extra land. They soon profit by finding tasty morsels to steal. So it was when the Sybaritic Romans snatched Egypt into their clutches. The spoils included the route taken by pepper to Europe. Before this, dealers discouraged visits to Kerala using myths of terrible demons. The new owners exposed the folklore as lies. After that, they marketed pepper. Then the requirement for supplies exploded. However, I repeat myself again, a takeaway of pepper was NOT for nothing and even without fiends, the transit involved human cost. To access vast loads, one part of the trip proved “easy”. Despite no Suez Canal, this was to cross Egypt (via the tip of Ethiopia). After that was a quick hop over the “safe” Mediterranean. The hard bit was crossing the Indian Ocean. There, local winds forced small cargo vessels to hug the shoreline. This took them within range of bloodthirsty pirates. The boss men centurions became pissed. The sea change, literally, came from making use of the air currents driven by the monsoon seasons. A new class of boats, that seafarers regarded as superliners, scooted across the puddle forming the Indian Ocean in less than a month. The luxury of avoiding marauders added to the bonus of speedy journeys. One downside was larger ships became stuck in Kerala. Sailors waited for changed winds to blow them homeward bound. Then again, they brought loads of stuff to exchange. They traded their wares for pepper and other exotic morsels to include a smidgeon of malabathrum. So, time on their hands was useful. The Romans amongst them must have also valued the language learning. Their schools hadn’t taught them the dialects of Kerala alongside a first-grade curriculum of amo, amas, amat. Rome didn’t fall in a day. Yet, its demise was sudden. Despite having led a far-reaching empire, the collapse followed shame. The decline began when Visigoth and later Attila the Hun holed up the residents up in their own city. Both pillagers demanded vast amounts of pepper within ransoms to lift their sieges. The disgrace meant orgies after Colosseum nights out ceased. Then, with the downfall of Rome, the trade route to Kerala gained new “owners”. After that, possession stayed in Islamic hands for a thousand years. But the passage they pursued still ended in, as we call it, Italy. Yes, Venice and Genoa remained their preferred journey’s end. These microstates stitched up supplies of pepper that were shipped to Europe and became wealthy on the proceeds. Although riches made at others’ expense are useful while they last, boy oh boy do they lead to ill will. Portugal and Spain headed those who tried to curtail the leading axis. After all, they ruled the seas (didn’t they). So, hail the Superhero! Vasco da Gama sailed around Cape Horn, targeting Kerala’s back door for his share in the takeaway game. A quest fraught with danger so, I say anew it was NOT for nothing. But his maiden voyage let the genie escape from the bottle. Repeat trips sought to ensure Iberian pepper pots would always be full. The Spanish helped the Portuguese annex Kerala, and everyone else expected the duopoly to take over with ease. However, the invaders from Lisbon hadn’t reckoned on locals and the Islamic traders side-stepping their new masters. The old trade route remained unbroken. Soon, widespread defiance forced the colonizers to retire nursing bloody noses. Further foreign powers sought control. They were the Dutch and British who tried to rule Kerala, but the Indian takeaway passed them by. Like the Portuguese, these raiders didn’t change the deals struck by local buyers and sellers. Yet, despite those intrepid traders, the world changed, and the Industrial Revolution overtook the explosion in commerce. It led to steam driven boats (making monsoon winds irrelevant), the Suez Canal and railways. These factors added to available trade routes. So many profit seekers cashed in. The price of pepper fell as more end points emerged. The old middlemen lost out big style. Forget the transportation - how’s pepper faring today? This product accounts for 20% of the global value of imported spices. A wholesale market worth $5 billion US. You’d expect that’s enough to bring a smile to Keralan faces, wouldn’t you? In truth, they restrict their response to grinning as they supply only 10% of peppercorns. Others, led by Vietnam, have stolen their big idea. While googling Kerala will give you pages of travel ads, you’ll find no mention of pepper. Plenty of pictures of branched waterways (added to by canals). Now plied not by traders but houseboats for wealthy tourists. Despite the vanishing pepper trade, that tourism should produce ample dollars for the locals to prosper, shouldn’t it? Sad to say no. The biggest source of family incomes is wages sent from sons and daughters working in the middle east. The greatest Indian takeaway was just a takeaway. Merchants left behind little of the vast wealth they earned. For Keralites, the greatest Indian takeaway was for nothing."
15,Ethics and us,social-issues," Ассоrding tо Eрiсurus, hаррiness is а fоrm оf рleаsure аnd аll things аre tо be dоne fоr the sаke оf the рleаsаntness thаt соmes аssосiаted with it.

Neсessаry desires, suсh аs the desire tо be free frоm bоdily раin helр in рrоduсing hаррiness. Оn the оther hаnd, unneсessаry desires, like desiring riсhes аnd weаlth, tyрiсаlly рrоduсe unhаррiness. Finаlly, Eрiсurus describes hаррiness аs nоt being а рrivаte аffаir but а соmmunаl аttаinment whiсh саn be асhieved in а sосiety where like-minded individuаls unite tо insрire оne аnоther’s рursuit оf hаррiness. The оbjeсtiоns thаt I wоuld rаise frоm Аristоtle's роint оf view аre: In my рersрeсtive, I wоuld sаy thаt Аristоtle's роint оf view sоunds wаy better thаn thаt оf Eрiсurus; the reаsоn fоr this is beсаuse Аristоtle аssосiаtes the аttаinment оf hаррiness tо thаt оf rаtiоnаlity аnd mentаl соgnitiоn. The fасt thаt оne desires hаррiness оr рleаsure dоes nоt meаn he lоgiсаlly devises wаys tо get there.

In оther wоrds, оne соuld desire hаррiness but wоuld gо аbоut асhieving it the wrоng оr immоrаl wаy. Аristоtle further stresses the need tо be mоrаl аnd just аs wаys tо hаррiness with the exerсise оf lоgiс аnd rаtiоnаlity. This meаns thаt fоr оne tо be оn the right раth tо hаррiness, he must live а mоrаl life; this is соnsрiсuоusly аbsent in Eрiсurus' theоry where he sees hаррiness аs the seаrсh fоr а hedоnistiс hаven rаther thаn thаt whiсh is асquired thrоugh mоrаl рiety аnd reаsоn. Аnоther оbjeсtiоn whiсh I wоuld rаise thrоugh the lens оf Аristоtle's роint оf view is thаt оf the Eрiсureаn stаndроint where hаррiness is desсribed аs being united аttаinment. Fоr Аristоtle, nо оneсаn be mаde hаррy by аnоther, fоr hаррiness is а jоurney whiсh а mаn embаrks uроn by himself. Hаррiness in this sense саn be seen аs аn endeаvоur оf self аnd а jоurney оf sоrts.

On friendship In the Niсоmасheаn Ethiсs, Аristоtle desсribes friendshiр аs reсiрrосаted gооdwill. Ассоrding tо him, it is the mоtive оf suсh gооdwill thаt differentiаtes рerfeсt friendshiр frоm the twо imрerfeсt fоrms оf friendshiр. In the саse оf true friendshiр, рeорle lоve eасh оther fоr their sаkes, аnd they wish gооd things fоr themselves. In Аristоtle's рersрeсtive, this friendshiр is оnly роssible between “gооd рeорle similаr in virtue"", this is beсаuse оnly gооd рeорle аre сараble оf lоving аnоther рersоn fоr thаt рersоn’s оwn sаke. The twо imрerfeсt fоrms оf friendshiр аre bаsed оn either utility оr рleаsure. In this regаrd, imрerfeсt friends lоve the benefits they derive frоm their relаtiоnshiрs beсаuse they find eасh оther benefiсiаl аnd useful. Their relаtiоnshiрs аre built аrоund рleаsure аnd usefulness оf оne tо the оther. Therefоre, this friendship is seen аs а meаns tо аn end. Аristоtle аrgues thаt friendshiр hаs its fоrms аnd we саn rightly infer thаt Аristоtle believes in the рerсeрtiоn аnd reаlizаtiоn оf true friendshiр. But ассоrding tо Kаnt, friendshiр itself shоuld be а lоgiсаl endeаvоur. In оther wоrds, it shоuld be seen аs а quest fоr knоwledge оf the соmрlexity оf humаn nаture, whiсh is imроssible tо understаnd соmрletely. In this sense, ttheiraarenо соmрlete оr tоtаl рerсeрtiоn оf friendshiр beсаuse humаn nаture is аt its соre, highly unрrediсtаble!! Аristоtle сlаims thаt there аre tyрes оf friendshiрs аnd sets defining stаndаrds fоr them. He gоes оn tо lаbel sоme аs true friendshiр аnd оthers аs а relаtiоnshiрs bаsed оn utility аnd рleаsure. Fоr Kаnt, there is nо distinсtiоn. He desсribes friendshiр аs existing in different fоrms аnd degrees, thus, рlасing nо mоtive оr reаsоn behind their соntinuаnсe. Kаnt's theоry оf friendshiр is bоth situаtiоnаl аnd mоrаl, while Аristоtle's is рurely bаsed оn ethiсаl stаndаrds аnd inherent соnsiderаtiоns. Аn аsрeсt оf Hоbbes' view оf friendshiр is seen in terms оf its referenсe tо thаt оf аn аdvаntаge. Here, Hоbbes' view mаtсhes with Аristоtle's рrороsitiоn thаt sоme fоrms оf friendshiр аre mоtivаted by рleаsure аnd utility. Аnоther аsрeсt оf Hоbbes' theоry оf friendshiр whiсh is similаr tо thаt оf Аristоtle's is thаt оf friendshiр being bаsed оn аn unwritten соntrасt. Hоbbes аrgues thаt whenever а friend gives оut gifts tо аnоther, he inаdvertently exрeсts thаt his асt will be reсiрrосаted. This is аlsо similаr tо Аristоtle's view оf friendshiр being fоr utility. The оnly differenсe here is thаt Hоbbes uses semаntiсs by referring tо а ‘соntrасt’ tо infuse sоme sоrt оf fоrmаlity intо it. Соnсerning Kаnt's view, Hоbbes tаkes а rаdiсаlly different рersрeсtive. Hоbbes сlаims thаt mаn is mоtiоn аnd he needs роwer tо remаin in this stаte. Whаt Hоbbes meаns by this is thаt fоr mаn tо асhieve his gоаls, fоr him tо exist, he requires the fuel оf friendshiр tо keeр him gоing. In this sense, Hоbbes sees friendship аs а neсessаry раrt оf humаn existenсe. Fоr Kаnt, friendshiр is mоrаlly situаtiоnаl, it exists in degrees аnd it deрends оn the рersоn.

16,The Many Faces of Anger,social-issues," Recently we saw the expression of long held anger by large numbers of people of different races and ethnicities explode in our country. When anger is suppressed for long periods of time, the lack of justice will lead to the righteous explosion of anger. This anger was expressed  on our streets, for the most part non-violently and may ultimately end up making long delayed and welcome changes in the way our police departments do their work and will ultimately lead to more democracy not only for black people and minorities whose rights have long been marginal, but for more protections of the rights of all of us. To be human is to want recognition and justice whether we are a racial minority, a women, a gay person or a trans-sexual. This is a just and human struggle which is the end result of many centuries and in many countries of the fight for human rights for all. Why is this so difficult and why is this taking so long to achieve? This is a world struggle that has gone on for centuries. It is a continuing struggle for just rights against people with unusual wealth and power who have vested interests and do not want their world to change. Change is however inevitable. The more we learn and grow and develop as a civilized society, the more the world will change. That will be the challenge and the struggle for us now and for future generations. We all must learn how to live with change for the benefit of all. Societal anger against injustice is only one side of human anger. There is the personal anger that all of us may feel when our lives and dreams are unfulfilled. In 2021 we are fortunate that we have therapists to help us learn how to cope with the complexity of modern relationships and modern living. There is also the more dangerous manifestation of anger which is repressed anger. That is the anger we feel about our lives from which we try to escape with drugs, or liquor or violence against others. It can become hatred against someone different and it can also become domestic violence. It is hard to fix because the people who displace their anger in this way often will not get the professional help they need to heal themselves. Anger used well against injustice is a benefit to humanity, but anger displaced can make us ill both personally and as a society and needs to be addressed and treated and healed. Unaddressed anger is a danger to our democracy and a danger to our future. A world in which we all understand and deal with our anger wisely will ultimately be a happier and safer world for us all."

18,Why Scouting Needs Mouth to Mouth!,social-issues," In 1927 a community in Southern Indiana gathered together by various churches and religious organizations;  and all pitched in and created Camp Tunnel Mill. They were so excited to get a Boy Scouts of America camp in their local community. Scouting is an organization that teaches young folks Ideals such as being physically fit and morally straight as well as survival skills. OK, I should back up even further and give you the low down, as I received it…. The streets of England were a wash of hoodlums terrorizing the neighborhoods; it was a learning ground for criminality much like the streets of New York or Chicago today. The Queen of England gave charge to Lord Baden Powell a commission to re-create the old Knight’s Second or Squire program with a less medieval flair. Knights would have a young man that would assist them and learn from them and would eventually make great knights themselves. Baden Powell studied other youth programs and then founded the Boy Scouts with the intent of teaching modern day knight skills to young men. Skills such as swimming, lifesaving, emergency preparedness, master at arms and reverence to God; would be coursework that would achieve this goal. Compare this goal to kids that just participate in soccer, baseball or basketball.  I recall playing football for 2 years in the 8th and 9th grade. In the 9th grade our most popular players went to my old camp Tunnel Mill and camped out on Scoutmaster Flats. They drank, ate bugs and branded themselves with a hot iron. To me; having spend 2.5 years on Tunnel Mill camp staff; they seemed about as worthless as tits on a bull. In years past, society realized the value of Scouting. They placed former Scouts in positions of honor within our Nation. Many astronauts were Eagle Scouts such as Neil Armstrong. Today’s society views scouting akin to a: “This one time at band camp” viewpoint. This is simply not the case at all. Recently, I received a call for an Eagle Scout survey (Yes, I am an Eagle Scout). Among the questions, they asked me if being an Eagle had ever gotten me a job. My answer was worse than no. I told the lady, that I once received 5 points toward getting a police job; a career in which I hold a Bachelor’s in Criminal Justice; in addition to being an Eagle Scout. I recall the officer’s chosen for the position all served in the same military unit; I was kicked to the curb. In fact, It’s much worse than that. I have bounced around unsuccessfully at a variety of jobs because the playing field has not been level. Most successful people know someone or are related to someone-you get the idea. It wasn’t until I went self-employed that I became a success. I am in the top 2% at what I do. Which I find very interesting, as it’s nearly the same exact percentage that received Eagle when I did in 1985; which was the top 1.3% (not a coincidence). This past summer, I went to summer camp with my Son. I had a few conversations with the camp administration. I was informed the attendance was down so low; that they are afraid the camp and council may close. Think about that; coupled with the fact that the BSA has let girls join; you would think that the numbers would be way up, instead of way down. To make matters worse, they have changed the way the requirements are laid out in the book. They no longer list the badges that are required for each rank; some genius has decided to pull certain badge requirements and list them individually leading to confusion. My own son lost interest; because his adult leaders just told him to take Eagle required badges; instead of what was required to make the next rank. This led to him being second class while having 90% of his Eagle required merit badges. Meanwhile, his friend have made rank. I don’t blame them; many were never in the program as youths and wouldn’t know better. The book should spell it out for you. Don’t even get me started about the pedophile issue; which they are going to try to go where the kids are; wherever they are. The organization is irrelevant. Scouting needs your help. What was once an American icon and a Squire program; has now turned into a stereotypical joke by a bunch of bug eating idiots that don’t know any better. Ask your Grandpa about Scouting; then find your local scout office and troop and sign up your eleven year old. It’s still a great program with a great end-goal; even if it’s unappreciated. Lastly, you can also support scouting by clicking the popcorn link in the resource box and buying some. The product gets shipped to your home and a portion goes to Scouts."
19,LOVE AS A STRONG FEELING.,social-issues," Love is that constant attraction we have towards someone. It is also a deep feeling we have for something or someone. Love is that strong, intense, deep and affectionate feeling that can right all wrong in a relationship. It is a feeling in which two people have for each other, it is a mix of emotions, behaviors and beliefs associated with feelings of affection, protection, respect and warmth for one another. It is a choice of commitment of helping and caring for one another that leads into marriage. Love makes you 100% happy, when you are in love with one another, it takes you don’t want to come out from, you are in a world where everything feels right. To have a great relationship, you need to have the following for each other: Time Affection Commitment Trust Love can play a huge role in our mental health. People who feel loved by others tend to be so much happier feeling unloved can make someone have the feeling of low self esteem and it causes depression. Being loved and loving someone is one of the keys to living a happy life. Having a good relationship and having found the love of your life will give you happiness ultimately. The mark of happiness is that you are sensitive to your surroundings and to the world around you and that you are filled with love and kindness. The kind of happiness you feel when you are in love or when you are being loved is infinite, it is never ending. Love is highly attention seeking, it comes with a lot of uncertain questions like “does he/she love me?”, “will he ask me to marry him?”, “what if his family doesn’t like me?”. These uncertain questions that comes with love can make us experience both positive and negative emotion as a result of loving someone. It is a set of emotion and behavior characterized by intimacy, passion and commitment, it involves care closeness, protectiveness, attraction, affection and trust. Love is associated with a range of positive emotion including happiness, excitement and life satisfaction. There are different types of love and they are; Eros: This is the erotic, passionate type of love. Philia: Love of friends and equals. Storge: Love of parents for children. Agape: Love of mankind. Mania: Love of obsessiveness. Pragma: Long-lasting love. Ludus: Playful love. Love is more than just being loved or loving someone, love can be when a person is so worried about another person, when a person gets angry because he/she is disappointed on the person he/she loves, when a person doesn’t think about the words coming out of his mouth because love and everything that he/she person has fought for has been hurt. Having mixed feelings can lead to bad stuffs like, being disappointed or being angry, frustrated but it cannot lead to a catastrophe because if a person truly loves someone else that much, then the relationship between them is unbreakable. Love is simply a willingness to prioritize another’s well-being or happiness above your own and having an extreme feeling of attachment for one another. Its about having a good communication, completely opening up and sharing your feelings life and activities daily with one another. It is more about being kind, patient, thoughtful, and being able to sacrifice, it is a desire for the soul. Love is never selfish, never boastful, not quick to take offences, it keeps no score of wrongs. It delights in the truth; it makes us have a great chemistry you get lost in each other conversations and then the hours pass like minutes. It is a short word, easy to spell, difficult to define and impossible to live without. It’s not possible for love to work if everything is peace and joy, love must be wounded, disappointed, cursed, hated but still loved."

Being in a relationship requires a lot of patience, good communication skills, affection, trust etc. Here are some strong relationship tips to have a healthy and successful relationship. •	HAVING GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Good communication often starts with the desire to understand each other point of view. The most important thing is to develop a strong sense of compassion. Holding a grudge, bitter thoughts and negative thoughts in a relationship is not good, it will only backfire if you hold onto it. •	SPEND QUALITY TIME AS A COUPLE ALWAYS:  No matter how tight you schedule can be, it is always right to find time for your partner, to spend quality time with him/her, go on expensive dates or on a nice adventure to make a huge difference in your relationship. Put aside one day a week for a date night or outing and do something totally different every week. You can eat and cook together or try out a new hobby. •	ALWAYS SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH YOURSELF: A good relationship should be balanced at all times. Don’t put all your energy or efforts and give up on the most important thing which is yourself, don’t give up on your personal growth or the thing you love doing. Yes!!! Relationships involves compromises, but make sure your own happiness is never suffering as a result of putting all your energy to make it work. •	SHOW APPRECIATION: Always be appreciative of the small things your partner does no matter how small or big it is. Say “thank you” more often, tell him/her how much you love them, send cute text messages, let your partner know how much he/she means to you so they would never feel taken for granted. •	UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER’S EXPRESSION OF LOVE: Well, some people express their love through hugs, kisses and physical affection. Other people show theirs through action, small gestures and showering gifts. Others are full of surprises like events tickets, meals and romantic gestures in their own significant way. It’s good to find out how your partner likes to express their love. Don’t take it personally if they don’t hug or kiss you all the time or surprise you with adventurous dates. If you know how your partner likes to receive love, its good you can adapt to it and show your love in a way the other person would love to receive it. •	LEARN TO FORGIVE: Do not let resentment build up over the years. Holding grudges will only backfire and it will definitely affect and hurt your relationship in the long run. Forgiveness is the key to a strong relationship.

1,Has carnism gone too far?,social-issues," Society and environmental conditioning have been causing significant pressure and impact on our decisions, as well as the eating norms, so it’s not uncommon that people give up their ideas, succumb to peer pressure, and blindly follow what the majority does, without ever questioning it. Over the last few decades, due to the farming industry and media propaganda, society has been favoring carnism which has been making a lot of people unaware that there are better dietary options to consider. This high-level human and non-human animal exploitation has caused clear-cut moral and empathy issues in humans, severe agony, pain, and death for non-human animals, as well as pollution and climate issues for our planet. How did all this go unnoticed? In short, the law approves the killing of animals, and because of its acceptance, people feel like it is completely fine to support that, at least for food. Media is propagating and advertising whitewashed commercials funded by the animal agriculture industry which are designed to show the animal products in the best light, while frantically hiding the bitter truth of the production process. People are also linked to their favorite meals and food preparations by cultural habits and tradition, and that's why tradition is one of the main influencing factors of our diet preferences. All that influence is passed down to our grandparents, parents, friends, teachers, or any other authority that have a direct impact on our diet preferences. The last thing is one's own mindset; beliefs, attitude, empathy, openness, willingness to change, and the extent to which one allows oneself to live according to other people’s beliefs. However, we all like to have a sense of belonging and enjoy being accepted by the environment, especially by our families and friends. Although it's a beautiful and positive thing to leave carnism, it also brings with it certain issues that are usually linked to society's perception of a vegan diet. The problems start when people cannot perceive a reason for the transition to a vegan lifestyle, so by comparing themselves with vegans, they attempt to justify their own bad beliefs and actions by guilt-tripping or using another manipulative move to disprove the harsh truth and gain their own moral victory. When changing our eating habits, sometimes our loved ones may see us as outsiders who are not complying with their moral guidelines, and they may subconsciously wonder why we don't want to be like them. Unfortunately, transitioning to a vegan lifestyle is provoking severe cognitive dissonance in many individuals that may be our parents or friends, and to avoid being rejected, some codependent people may find challenging to make this transition and rather choose to stay in the crowd. The reason for adhering to social norms is usually a sense of safety and protection within the crowd, but also fear of rejection, ridicule, negative judgment, self-doubt, loss of social recognition and acceptance. While conforming is not always a bad thing, what happens when you conform to carnism? By conforming and adopting the wrong behavioral patterns, we become part of a society whose engineering is to change perceptions about diet, maintain a low level of awareness, and drag others down into the same system. In other words, we participate in the unnecessary killing of animals while sending a toxic message about the acceptability of torturing animals without remorse and convincing others to do the same. Despite that, the majority still mechanically follow the behavioral patterns of society instead of utilizing their own thinking and reasoning skills that they already possess. Frankly speaking, conformity is positive in certain situations, but to obey the exploitative social order that approves the unnecessary killing of animals absolutely loses all meaning. If we have friends or family members that are doing something unethical, that’s not a reason to copy them. We have control over our decisions, and we can choose to be ethical no matter what others do. How to keep your cool? In order to successfully resist social pressure and other environmental influences, it is very important to understand why you are introducing such a change in your lifestyle. If your reason is ethics that is based on a hard truth, there is nothing that could manipulate you into thinking that killing and torturing animals is necessary. To begin with, it is imperative to know that the decision of the majority is neither a moral guideline nor a measure of validity! When it comes to dietary ethics, you are following the truth, not society. If you feel that exploiting animals for human benefit is not the right thing to support, take a firm stand on it and don’t let the current social norms create obstacles in your lifestyle. It is important to understand that most people have an irrational view of food ethics, so have patience while speaking to carnists as you are encountering different beliefs, opposing views, and sometimes, extreme behavior. Guard yourself with knowledge and don’t let small-minded people hold you back. When some individuals sense their own lack of ability to understand a positive lifestyle like veganism, they may easily become burdened by cognitive dissonance, especially when dealing with fixed-mindset individuals. These closed-minded individuals usually have a huge disconnect between loving animals and eating them, they only stick to their beliefs with low motivation to change. In this case, you may even reconsider entering any ethics-related conversation because very often, it just leads nowhere. Sometimes, one of these closed-minded people could be our parent or friend, and being surrounded by them won't really offer you genuine support. Typically, under the veil of good intentions, they attempt to pull you down to their level so that they could feel superior, achieve their own moral victory and dominance. If you are dealing with toxic “crab mentality” people, try to surround yourself with optimistic, supportive, and positive people who have the ability to understand your positive shift. However, mind yourself that veganism is based on truth rather than beliefs so it is much more important to convey social truth and help to create a better society for everyone's sake. Take a firm stand about it, ignore the naysayers, speak the truth, and educate others as this is the best way to make a positive change in society."
2,10 Compelling Reasons Why You Need a Freelancer,social-issues," Freelancing has been on the rise as businesses seek to get work done faster and more effectively.

3,7 Horrible Mistakes you could make with Freelance Marketplaces,social-issues," New to freelancing and wondering why you're not landing any jobs? Working from home is the best thing one could wish for. Starting is easy, but succeeding is the real deal. Research shows that a vast percentage of freelancers fail due to mistakes they make in their first year. Here are seven mistakes you’re probably making and ways how you can avoid them. Employers are aware that freelancers who bid at the lowest price are necessarily not the best. However, bidding low is acceptable if you are a beginner as you badly need that gig to build your portfolio. Alternatively, try online jobs with no experience for a start as they are easier to get. After several jobs, establish what your worth is and bid at a proper price. Most freelance websites offer an option for clients to give feedback based on their satisfaction after hiring online. After completing a project, ask for reviews from your clients. Having good ratings will help your secure online jobs in the future. In return always leave a positive and supportive project closing comment against the clients’ profile which will encourage him to re-hire you for future projects. Online work from home jobs provides a lot of freedom. If you are not keen on balancing your time, you'll miss out on deadlines. If something emerges and you will unavoidably miss the deadline, consider notifying the client in advance.  Always negotiate with the clients in advance should you expect any delays in deliverables. Try to establish right project milestones so that there will always be progress reports and deliverables so that clients will always see timely progress in the project. A client is more likely to hire a freelancer with a complete profile. And in case it is complete, make sure that it is regularly updated. Ensure that your profile includes all your relevant details, such as skills, portfolio, experiences, Reviews, Previous work references and testimonials. Be genuine in your portfolio and always provide referrals or proof of work which are authentic and proves the fact that your previous work is genuine and truly demonstrates your skills and expertise.  Clients will consider individuals with outdated profiles not attentive. Read and understand all instructions before submitting a proposal to any freelance job. Let's take an article writing job to be our example in this case. Avoid short proposals like, ""Please hire me as an article writer, I am an expert in this."" Instead, you can write, ""Greetings John! After going through your job post, I can see that you are looking for an experienced article writer. I have a 3-years of experience in article writing. I will provide original, informative and well researched content within 24 hours. I will me more than glad to clarify any doubts or provide additional information or previous work references should you require any."" Bidding on the wrong choice of projects is one lousy mistake you could be making. Bid for jobs that match your skills, or go for online jobs that require no experience. It's better to avoid getting bad reviews rather than assuming you can handle a gig out of your skillset. Look for clients that have above average hiring percentages. So they are likely to interview you and consider for hiring. Also try to have a decent conversation with the clients before going ahead with the project. Avoid projects of clients who are likely to penalize you for minor mistakes or below average delays. Crafting a bidding template and copy-pasting it to every job you apply for is the worst mistake you could make. All jobs are not the same. The titles might be similar, but the specifications are different. Before submitting a proposal for any freelance work, make sure that you read the job posting's instructions and write a proposal tailored to the instructions of that particular job. In certain instances clients place hidden queues or questions to judge whether the freelancer has gone through the project description properly. Final Remarks Online work experience might be frustrating for many, from missing out on jobs, meeting low-paying clients, and sending countless proposals with no feedback. However, as a new freelancer, establish yourself as an expert. Have a good profile, craft good proposals, and only bid on projects you can handle best. This will land you gigs which will enhance your career. Finally, deliver quality work consistently. All the best as you work from home!"
4,Coronavirus- A new Normal,social-issues," Novel Coronavirus, 201-nCoV and the Covid-19 are the words we all hate and are terrified of, mostly terrified. It was first identified in humans in Wuhan, China. The disease subsequently spread rapidly, leading to a global pandemic. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome  (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Due to this pandemic, the whole world had gone under self-isolation at the safety of their own homes. Students, teachers and other school faculties had to shift to online learning and office employees had to shift to work from home. It was new to all as no one had experienced such a kind of disease. Like every coin has two sides there are two sides also for online learning.  Some of the argumentative statements by both sides are that schooling is better because the kids get to interact with each other, and doubts can be solved easily by the teachers and the teachers can supervise the work that is being done by the kids and because teachers have no idea what the kids might be doing at home. While the others believe that online learning is better because the students can learn from the comfort of their homes which saves them the time taken to travel to school and back home. I think we all can agree on one thing that the new tradition that came out of covid was the idea of having online parties. As people have been quarantined due to covid, they aren’t forgetting to have fun even though they are far from each other. Online parties are a great idea to take our minds off from work and enjoy ourselves a little. It is also a safe practice as people aren’t meeting each other which reduces the chances of the transmission. Most of the countries have closed their borders to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus from other countries. After closing the border for 1.5 years now some countries are slowly and steadily opening their borders for travellers. Some countries have made ground rules to open their borders for international travellers. Some of the common rules are that the travellers should have a negative pre departure covid-19 test and should be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. While some countries are opening their borders for quarantine free travelling other countries are reducing the number of days of a quarantine order. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. Learning to cope with stress in a healthy way will make you, the people you care about, and those around you become more resilient. Stress can cause the following: •	Feelings of fear, anger, sadness, worry, numbness, or frustration •	Changes in appetite, energy, desires, and interests •	Difficulty concentrating and making decisions •	Difficulty sleeping or nightmares •	Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes •	Worsening of chronic health problems •	Worsening of mental health conditions It is natural to feel stress, anxiety, grief, and worry during the COVID-19 pandemic. Below are ways that you can help yourself, others, and your community manage stress. Healthy Ways to Cope with Stress •	Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including those on social media. It’s good to be informed but hearing about the pandemic constantly can be upsetting. Consider limiting news to just a couple times a day and disconnecting from phone, tv, and computer screens for a while. •	Take care of your body. o	Take deep breaths, stretch. o	Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals. o	Exercise regularly. o	Get plenty of sleep. o	Continue with routine preventive measures (such as vaccinations, cancer screenings, etc.) as recommended by your healthcare provider. o	Get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine when available. •	Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy. •	Connect with others. You trust about your concerns and how you are feeling. •	Connect with your community- or faith-based organizations. While social distancing measures are in place, try connecting online, through social media, or by phone or mail. Helping Others Cope Taking care of yourself can better equip you to take care of others. During times of social distancing, it is especially important to stay connected with your friends and family. Helping others cope with stress through phone calls or video chats can help you and your loved ones feel less lonely or isolated. Covid-19 is going to be a new normal in the coming years and we all will have to learn to live with it. We all could play a part in helping the government by staying at home and getting vaccinated as soon as possible and getting a covid booster every year."

6,psychosocial impacts of covid-19,social-issues," Psychosocial Impacts of Covid-19 Pandemic. What caused the Covid-19 pandemic? What are the challenges experienced during and after (if it ends)? When and how is it going to end? These questions are raised everyday and everyone seems to have different answers. Every answer is infused with a political, religious and emotional charge. The Covid-19 pandemic has inspired controversy and indeed evoked a global fear. Many countries, territories have imposed lockdowns encouraging citizens to self-isolate at home while maintaining physical distance in public to curtail the spread of the disease. The measures include compulsory or recommended confinement, curfews and quarantines. While these restrictions are effective as so far proven, the problems they are creating cannot go unnoticed. Some of the measures put forth relinquished immense authority to governments to undermine people's rights. Successful lockdowns require a strong social contract with the citizens. Psychologically and socially, the catastrophic virus has created within individuals, families, communities and nations a sense of insecurity and impotence. The pandemic is itself a traumatizing event, a stressor that has left many distressed or emotionally damaged. This pandemic has profound impacts on humanity. Covid-19 unleashed untold suffering, swallowing even the innocent. It is one of the major psychosocial catastrophes experienced in human history since World War 2. It is a complex emergency, an accidental harm that is causing traumatic experiences. The global calamity brought with it mental suffrage. The probability of psychosocial disorders increase with increased uncertainties pertaining to its containment. Traumatizing experiences of lockdown, forced isolation and police brutality have a negative effect on people's immediate environment especially in our modern ""disciplinary society ``. The traumatized may suffer from a wide range of disorders such as conduct disorders. Psychologically, persons under investigation (PUI) in suspected cases of infection are affected. The ones placed under coerced quarantine suffer from separation anxiety and fear. Moreover, persons with damaged selves are more susceptible to psychological distress. Many are going through eyewitness trauma where thinking and feeling are altered by the events taking place.  People who have a history of exposure to previous psychic trauma, those who witnessed violence and death easily breakdown. To support this, enforced restrictions by armed soldiers and police, who are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force especially in poor neighborhoods, can trigger re-experiences of eyewitness trauma experienced during political crises and post-election violence in most African states. The heavy presence of armed law enforcement agents in the streets drives people into a panic mode. There are reports here in Zimbabwe where the police forces have clashed with people accused of flouting lockdown restrictions in scenes decried by some as excessive and detestable. In South Africa, videos circulated on social media showed security forces intimidating and forcing civilians to squat and roll on the ground for allegedly violating lockdown. In Kenya, there was fury and tensions flared over police brutality amid coronavirus curfew. The implementation of curfews was widely criticized. It was reported that in Kenya, the death toll from curfew enforcement had already exceeded the coronavirus death toll of one by March 27. In Rwanda, tensions boiled over, the police shot dead people. Elsewhere, the Philippines President Rodrigo Duerte announced emphatically that those who will flout the restrictions would be shot at. French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated that his soldiers are trained to subdue enemies of the state and to kill. He warned would be demonstrators amid the country's lockdown. All these documented incidents have renewed anger over police brutality, breakdown of mutual trust and respect between law enforcement and community members. The systemic political management of the virus becomes more lethal than the biological threat posed by the virus itself. Scholars like Foucault and Orwell realised that in the state of emergency, whether it is war, plague, natural disaster, discipline and order are easier to obtain for the ruling elite. The power of political officials is at its greatest, its most unrestrained, in a state of emergency. To elaborate, the Covid-19 crisis is being  exploited by governments to pass undemocratic legislation and exert stronger social control over the populations. The novelty of being locked down has affected us emotionally. We have become uncertain of how the world will look like when it is over, or when it will be. We are suffering from some form of grief individually as well as collectively. In the words of Melanie Verwoerd, former ANC MP and SA Ambassador to Ireland, ""...it is destroying our sense of safety and this causes us to feel anticipatory grief on a scale never felt before``. David Kessier points out that we are most prone at the moment to what he calls 'anticipatory grief`. We are grieving because we fear economic uncertainty, people are dying and we do not know if it will happen to us. What is happening in society today is societal stress, which is characterized by the fact that it is affecting many people simultaneously. Stress is a natural and inescapable accompaniment of living but its effects are deleterious. Stress ultimately becomes biological. Physically, worried and anxious persons develop lowered bodily resistance to infection thus making them more vulnerable to coronavirus infection. A stressed individual gets colds, sinusitis and sore throats. A vicious cycle may set in, that is, the more run down she/he becomes, the less vitality she/he can bring to bear on psychological problems. The more these problems mount, the greater the toll on physical health. The pandemic has turned people into psychological casualties. By definition, psychological casualties are individuals who have been so overwhelmed by their circumstances that they no longer function in everyday life within the parameters and constraints laid down by their own communities. This inability to function may manifest itself in many forms. This is quite evident as we have seen and heard reports of people protesting against their lot by acting out and becoming anti-social. In retaliation to alleged police brutality, some resorted to vigilante activity. Chaos reigns supreme in supermarkets and liquor stores as people are up in arms with anti-riot police summoned to disperse huge crowds queuing up for scarce commodities. The law enforcement agents have become external enemies against whom to rage. The police have become so brutally unfriendly that for them it is difficult than meets the eye to separate friend from foe. Food insecurities and continued suffering as workers have been laid off from work will force some people to act against their principles in order to survive and to protect their families. Families and communities lurking on the peripheries of the economic spectrum bear the brunt the most. People in overcrowded settlements are flouting the social distancing rules for lack of sanitary provisions and basic amenities such as water. In high-density suburbs, residents in desperate need of water queue up around boreholes and there have been allegations of sexual abuse (sextortion) and discrimination at these water points. The lockdown has also affected divorced families. For example, visitation rights of children of divorced parents have been made complex. Parents who share custody of children are affected and discouraged from transporting children unless it is for medical reasons. In South Africa, the government called on parents to keep their children in one place during the lockdown period. During these placements, dependence and rivalry with other siblings may contribute to their breakdown. With the extension of the lockdown, their presence becomes increasingly irksome and a burden to some step-parents who are unwilling and unable to bear the financial burden. The children are treated as the other, servants and made to wait on and run errands for the other children in the home. For children in authoritarian families, the school was a safety valve of escapism from their misery and fetters that bind them to perpetual servitude. The family, which was unable to provide an environment protective enough to consolidate a sense of self, is certainly not protective now. It would seem a large number of individuals are socially inept. Many children manifest psychological distress. However, this distress may be short-lived and not necessarily damaging. If resources, which facilitate mastery and a sense of self-efficacy, are made available to them, this too facilitates coping. Covid-19 has triggered an education crisis that is unprecedented in scope, duration and impact. Prolonged school closures are grim as they increase child exploitation, child abuse, teen pregnancies among other problems. According to the United Nations( UN), the global school closures in response to the Covid-19 pandemic present an unprecedented risk to children's education, protection and well being. Children have been robbed of their fundamental rights. It makes it even harder for the most vulnerable children to return to school. Across Eastern and Southern Africa, up to 16 million children are no longer accessing critical daily meals at school, violence at home is increasing (UN). In response, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced advanced support during the unprecedented education crisis, while advocating for the safe reopening of schools that adhere to safety guidelines. Furthermore according to UNICEF, in most parts of the world, learning at home has been supported by online tools. However, in Eastern and Southern Africa, internet penetration is constrained. Barely one in five (22%) of households have internet access, while 84% of the rural population, where the bulk of the learners reside, have no electricity. There is substantial evidence of the digital divide , that is, uneven access to technology along race, class, and geographic lines. The most affected are the marginalized, vulnerable children who largely rely on schools for their education, health, safety and nutrition. While positively the lockdown has become a catalyst for sobriety, others are attempting to anaesthetize and insulate themselves from the lockdown psychic pain through substance abuse. Closer to home, the ban on sale of alcohol and cigarettes has been devastating mentally for South Africans. The ban causes desperation in people and could be a fatal health scare amid the country's fight against Covid-19. There have been reports that desperate imbibers inject themselves with hand sanitizer liquid directly into their veins to get a quick fix, revealed Dr Gerhard Verdoorn from the Griffon Poison Information centre. Medical experts have warned against the use of hand sanitizers as it could be fatal and result in the damage of the brain, heart, and immune system. Other experts have also noted that for people who are addicted, the side effects of abrupt alcohol withdrawal can induce tremors, insomnia and nausea. This could have serious complications; especially if the person is confined at home (think of marital feuds, GBV, child abuse and neglect). Also for moderate alcohol consumers, closure of liquor stores has led to increased anxiety and stress. Other people are unable to block out their pain and become so overwhelmed that their social life is disrupted by psychosomatic symptomatology, anxiety and depression. Psychosomatic symptoms include among others headaches and sleeplessness. People have become overly anxious and agitated. Despair, disillusionment, anger and resentment are the predominant emotions. The future is uncertain on many experiencing a myriad of disturbing psychological problems particularly those from a large pool of unemployed youth, many of whom are university graduates frustrated with decades of extreme poverty, underdevelopment, and the lack of job opportunities. On a wider geographical scale, countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are viewed as the most stressful in the world due to their socio-economic and political quagmires. The Covid-19 pandemic has become a powerful contributor to add to the already existing legacies of psycho-social cripples that are still to be tackled. Following the height of the pandemic, foreign nationalities who are repatriated to their mother countries where they had previously fled for different reasons among them political persecution and economic turmoil, suffer more mental health and adjustment problems. This is the case with most Zimbabwean nationals who had fled the country and sought refuge in countries like South Africa , Botswana, UK ,China to name a few. Socio-ecological factors compounded by the pandemic thus contribute to mental health outcome in the aftermath of trauma. Several commendable efforts are being rolled out to help the homeless and the disabled persons from the scourge of coronavirus. However, the exaggerated preferential treatment given to the disabled only justifies the stereotypical views of them as people who are not 'normal` and incapable. Some politicians have braced to this opportunity to settle their cheap political scores and antics. While the pandemic has brought a sense of unity in finding a common purpose to fight it, it has also brutally reminded us of the fundamental faulty lines in our society, in particular inequality, poverty, unemployment and a lack of social justice. Because of corruption, even before the pandemic, there is increasingly little funding available for desperately needed public services such as health care, education, sanitation and housing. While it was a humanitarian gesture to release prisoners to contain coronavirus and to decongest prison facilities, the congestion on public resources and social welfare provisions are yet to unfold. In my own view, the influx of offenders in jail cells and behind prison walls is a sign of social decay and poor informal controlling mechanisms. The question is why are people committing more crimes no matter how much they are aware of social norms, rules and values, which govern our behavior? The moral compass of society is skewed. The social fabric is hanging with a thread. Paradoxically, to pardon the criminal is to compound the social problem which we are seeking to address because once the ex-convict is free, she/he will resort to secondary deviance resulting from a self-fulfilling prophecy as she/ he suffer rejection, despise, rebuke, and suspicion from members of society. It is a matter of life or death. The war is lost at both ends. Other challenges being created  by  African governments responding to Covid-19 are misimformation and undercommunication on the impacts of the pandemic. Bad communication can bear the negative impact of the ability of nations to respond and deal with an impending disaster. African states are accused of window-dressing the true scale of the pandemic. Misinformation hampers the fight for the virus in Africa. By concealing vital information from the public, governments create situations whereby everyone is navigating blind except for the government towards the fight against the pandemic. Inequitable access to information between government and the people results in inequitable levels of commitment. According to Dr Ralph Mathekga, a renowned South African political analyst, honesty is key in managing the pandemic and it is a missing link in our politics in general. All these and other challenges posed by the pandemic have had an enormous impact on the psyche of our society and are increasing the difficulty of dealing with social behavior. The pandemic, whether induced erroneously through human activity as alleged or a product of natural design and superstitious inclinations , will leave a gigantic stamp not only on the psyche but also on the communities and their social organization. Perceived social support reduces the probability of psychosocial disorders, as do feelings of safety and perceptions of moral and social order. Families and communities ought to bring people together to share their experiences to help them cope in the aftermath of this tragedy. With this global calamity in our midst, psychosocial intervention during and after the pandemic abates, is pertinent."
7,Sexism in advertising media,social-issues," SEXISM AND POTRAYAL OF WOMEN IN ADVERTISING The incidence of sexism in advertising has gradually increased over the years amongst African women or non-white people. Previously, this had not been an uncommon feature in the West among the fairer white sex. Today, African female models are more frequently sexually depicted in brand advertisements than are males. There is a growing interest from foreign owned companies advertising their brands using black African models clad in suggestive attire. Female models are depicted as suggestively dressed while males are unlikely to be portrayed likewise. Women have increasingly become objects of display. The new enlightenment worldview is that women are totally defined by their bodies in a way they had not been in the past. In advertisements, body orientations of women as they sit or stand are sexualized. Their projections are suggestive and alluring. For example, they are made to pose in ways that seem strangely erotic and emphasizing the areas of their bodies (breasts, hips, thighs, legs) that they were culturally socialized to conceal, be afraid of and ashamed of.  In Africa, certain body parts, whether female or male, are ordered by cultural norms to remain subdued and covered. The gendering of bodies is thus a social process. The importation and adoption of western values in our culture have created a natural experiment in social change. Of interest in this write up is not the changing nature of sexuality in advertising (another area of interest to researchers) but the apparent politics of gender stereotyping and sexual objectification of women in advertising media. The media reiterate the cultural image of women as ornamental objects who must attract men to be valuable. The media insinuate some of these messages into our consciousness at every turn. Not only do media induce us to think we should measure up to artificial standards, but they encourage us to see normal bodies and bodily functions as pathologies. To begin, Shulamith Firestone (1972) argues that sexism is fundamentally about seeing women as sexualized bodies available to men. Both Friedan (1965) and Greer (1970) concur that women are encouraged, cajoled and sometimes coerced into making their bodies conform to male dictated ideals. One area of feminist protest is around sexual objectification of women in the media. Sexist advertising promotes images of women as sexually unrestrained, always sexually accessible to men. The use of sexual imagery in advertising is downgrading women. It creates and sustains unrealistic images and stereotypes of women. Several studies conducted on advertising show a greater percentage of males appearing demurely dressed than the scantily dressed females. In Africa, is this growing phenomenon a Westernization of African ideals or a celebration of womens success and liberation from the strictures of patriarchy?. In any case, the portrayal of indigenous African women as consumers of colonial products produces and justifies the imperialist worldview of Victorians. For many non-white women, there is a constant battle to maintain self-worth within a world that judges them in relation to white notions of beauty and femininity. This leads to black peoples loss of independence and ability to self-define. Therefore, the media create and maintain power differences within a culture based on visual cues. Through advertising, women are inclined to play a role in their own exploitation. Womens worth becomes quite literally tied to the physical attractiveness. According to Lorber and Moore   (2007), beauty, as defined by western, heterosexual, white male standards, is a commodity-something that they may leverage for opportunities and benefits. Because sex sells products (Muro, 1989), sexual and erotic images are the single most prominent characteristic of advertising. While the majority of media communication may not be pornographic, it does echo in somewhat muted forms the predominant themes of pornography such as sex and male domination of women. Wolf (1990) suggests that the images of women used by the media present women as sex objects to be consumed by what Laura Mulvey (2009) calls the 'male gaze` in Visual and other Pleasures. The gaze is the realization of being seen and interpreted by others, and adjusting ones conduct accordingly. The male gaze is when women feel observed, assessed and judged primarily on their physical appearance by men. Women are therefore subject to the standards set via the male gaze. Mulvey was among the most influential of feminists to extend the concept of the gaze to the oppressive effects of society and socialization on women. She argued that the portrayal of women is primarily aesthetic in purpose. They are presented in ways that appeal to others, notably heterosexual men. French intellectual Jacques Lacan (2006), influenced by Freudian-based psychology, noted that the realization that others may gaze upon us often facilitates greater self-consciousness and that this may be both unsettling and anxiety producing. French writer Jean-Paul Sartre (2003), in Being and Nothingness, also discusses the notion of subjectivity, or the condition of being a subject of anothers consciousness or awareness. Radical feminists feel very strongly that the media reproduces patriarchy. The media deliberately dupe women into believing in the beauty myth. They should conform to what is a male image of what it is to be proper woman in terms of good looks, sexiness and ideal shape. This creates a form of false-class consciousness. Tuchman et al (1978) refer to this as 'the symbolic annihilation of women’. The sexual imagery also epitomizes a prurient racism, which makes black women into objects of white sexual curiosity and exploitation. Racist sexism has gained much of its weight in the service of economic gain through capitalist expansion. Sexualizing women as objects of heterosexual male desire is assumed to be most aesthetically pleasing, and by extension, more profitable.  Focus is directed on certain parts of womens bodies, namely those associated with sexual appeal (for example, breasts, buttocks, legs). The consequences on womens perceptive in the wider society are both interactional and relational. Women become accustomed to hegemonic views of their physicality. They learn that talent, skill, knowledge, ability and experience are secondary to physical attractiveness (Lorber and Moore, 2007). The media, through advertisements, presents a particular beauty ideal, that is, the idea that women should strive for beauty through which they transmit the strong ideological message that woman should treat their bodies as a project in constant need of improvement. The women are represented as exotic. Those whomever best embodies normative definitions of beauty (thin, yet curvaceous, slender/toned, youthful) are more likely to be hired and highlighted in advertising. Those chosen, however, conform most closely to western standards of beauty. Others are left chasing the aesthetic ideal or settling with less desirable options. Demographically, older women are not only under-represented in media but also are represented inaccurately. Media consistently show fewer older women presumably because advertising agents are aware that our culture worships youth and beauty in women. Elder women are portrayed as sick, dependent, fumbling, and passive, images not borne out of reality. On set, beauty is artificially augmented using special lighting effects and skin whitening cosmetics to conceal blemishes. The saying goes, ""the pale is a bonafide catch``. The gaze is internalized. To adapt, women may look at themselves through the eyes of heterosexual men. It is well evidenced that the sexualized portrayal of women in advertisements is targeted mainly at male consumers. Media advertising is a business; hence, it is sensitive to the responses and buying patterns of its consumers. Women, who most readily find secure and lucrative advertising roles, fit the western ideal notions of beauty and sexual allure. Constantly portraying women in a highly sexualized way make it more likely all women will be seen as sex objects. This then becomes a human rights issue. In addition, one of the effects is that women readily regulate themselves, striving at sometimes unhealthy and unsafe levels to fit the narrow hegemonic vision of aesthetic beauty. As a result, women expect to be viewed, judged and visually consumed as objects. For Chinyere Fred‐Adegbukugbe of Nigeria, the issue of negative portrayal of women is quite complex because “most of these women, especially those of them who appear on products that sometimes have absolutely nothing to do with women, see these activities as meal tickets. And because men, especially in this part of the world, have refused to see most women other than as men‐pleasers, one tends to lose the war at both ends”. Judith Williamson (1978) argues that advertising is ideological in the sense that it represents an imaginary relationship to our real conditions of existence. Advertising is thus ideological both in the way it functions and in the effects it produces■"
8,How to Build Back Better Without INFLATION!,social-issues," Inflation is what happens whenever the government prints money that’s backed ONLY by INCREASED DEBT instead of tangible assets, and then distributes it in order to save the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Witness the current surging prices of gasoline, food, and housing across the nation. Yes Dorothy, the dollar is worth less, and it buys less today than it did a year ago because of what the Biden administration has had to do in order to pull the COVID-rocked economy out of its Trump-induced nose dive. And this is a momentary fix, a band-aid, not a long-term fix. So, what does a legitimate, long-term fix look like? How can we the people escape the ever-increasing tentacles of debt and pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps, without inviting inflation? Check out the following scenario and you’ll have the answer to this question. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy produces about $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) worth of new, productive capital assets annually. That translates into $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this predictable annual growth are limited to people who can afford to purchase these wealth- producing capital assets that account for our nation’s annual growth. More specifically, we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of these relatively predictable opportunities, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term, not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs, get we the people back to work, and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were 16 months ago. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars-worth of new, wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual phenomena are limited to those who can afford to participate in the ownership side of the American economy. And this generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of productive, economic opportunity in order to generate a second income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $10,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed all capital credit loans to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PAST SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to buy shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to PAY FOR THEMSELVES (they’re self-liquidating), and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! And it creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, each purchase would be backed (collateralized) by insured, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD AVOID INFLATION. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of capital income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END POVERTY…INCLUDING CHILDHOOD POVERTY •	HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE which is rooted in centuries of economic imbalance •	Stabilize family life, •	Make it much easier for police to do their jobs by reducing poverty related crime, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	Help democratize our free market in the long run, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our ever-growing national debt, which also naturally reduces taxes. In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investments in a way that only the wealthy can today. As result, the need for expensive, federally backed social safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, food stamps, will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVOD 19/Economic crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored by our leaders. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is similar to the Economic Democracy Act, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (probably a full decade) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
9,Defending America’s Democracy? Here’s How to Fund it!,social-issues," In the wake of Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, his totally unproven claims of election fraud, the January 6th insurrection, and in the midst of Republican attacks on voting rights across the nation, there’s also been a lot of talk about DEFENDING AMERICA’S DEMOCRACY. But the critical aspect of “how to fund a political democracy” hardly ever finds its way into the conversation. So, let’s talk about how to fund a political democracy. Let’s start with the obvious. America cannot have a legitimate political democracy (a government of the people, by the people, and for the people) when so much wealth/power is concentrated in the hands of so few at the expense of so many. When the 1% owns and controls the US House of Representatives, the Senate, the Presidency, state legislatures, and the media, the politicians can claim that we have a democracy. But we don’t. We have an American oligarchy – a government of the people, by the wealthy and for the wealthy. In any case, the wealth gap between the haves and the have nots in America has been growing steadily since 1980. It hasn’t mattered whether the Democrats were in control or the Republicans were in control. Wealth/power has become more and more concentrated (democracy has been steadily shrinking) for at least four decades. The problem is currently as bad or worse than in was in the 1920’s when the economy literally collapsed under a very similar imbalance. That said, if we fail to systematically DECONCENTRATE wealth/power in America, a genuine political democracy is impossible. And by the way, concentrated wealth is concentrated wealth whether it’s in the hands of the private sector (the 1%) or the public sector (the government). So, the question becomes…how can we systematically deconcentrate America’s free-market economy in such a way that a genuine political democracy is economically encouraged? With that question in mind, check out the following scenario and consider the possibilities. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy produces about $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) worth of new, productive capital assets annually. That translates into $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this predictable annual growth are limited to people who can afford to purchase these wealth- producing capital assets that account for our nation’s annual growth. More specifically, we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of these relatively predictable opportunities, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term, not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs, get we the people back to work, and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were 16 months ago. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars-worth of new, wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual phenomena are limited to those who can afford to participate in the ownership side of the American economy. And this generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of productive, economic opportunity in order to generate a second income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $10,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed all capital credit loans to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PAST SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to buy shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to PAY FOR THEMSELVES (they’re self-liquidating), and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! And it creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, each purchase would be backed (collateralized) by insured, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD AVOID INFLATION. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of capital income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END POVERTY…INCLUDING CHILDHOOD POVERTY •	HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE which is rooted in centuries of economic imbalance •	Stabilize family life, •	Make it much easier for police to do their jobs by reducing poverty related crime, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	Help democratize our free market in the long run, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our ever-growing national debt, which also naturally reduces taxes. In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investments in a way that only the wealthy can today. As result, the need for expensive, federally backed social safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, food stamps, will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!!

10,Transitional Justice Demands Reparations for Louisiana Residents of Cancer Alley,social-issues," The residents of Cancer Alley are victims of environmental racism. Transitional justice demands reparations for them. Environmental racism is defined as a form of systemic racism where communities of color are disproportionately burdened with health hazards through policies and practices that force them to live close to sources of toxic waste such as sewage, mines, landfills, and industries that are emitters of toxic airborne pollution.  Cancer Alley is a clear example of environmental racism. Cancer Alley is located in Louisiana.  This 85-mile stretch has numerous factories that were built by petrochemical and oil companies. The smell in this area is commonly described as a rotten egg smell that can cause a headache or shortness of breath. This 85-mile stretch is called Cancer Alley because residents share common illnesses such as sinus infections, sores, skin rashes, lung disease, cancer, and early death.  The residents of Cancer Alley are majority African American. Cancer Alley is highly populated with African Americans because, following the Civil War, former slaves settled near or on the plantations that they used to work on.  These former slaves built homes and communities on former plantation land. As years progressed, these homes and properties were passed down through families. The search for oil led companies to the area. Over 150 petrochemical companies moved into Louisiana and built their industries along the Mississippi River. Along with these petrochemical companies, over 20 major oil and gas companies moved into the area as well.  Redlining, a form of credit discrimination, started back in the 1960s and prevented black families from moving out.   Even though this practice started decades ago its effects are still present today. Louisiana also allowed industrial companies to build their factories in these areas. The industrial factories were built around all land that their companies could not buy causing these African American communities and homes to be near chemical and oil factories. Once the factories were operational, it further lowered the property value for the neighborhoods that surrounded them. This led to more redlining and more African Americans who were forced to live near hazardous conditions. It wouldn’t be long before an unwelcomed neighbor came over for a visit. Residents soon began to experience health challenges. Around the same time as Louisiana’s oil boom, the state ranking rose to third in cancer infections in the United States. Industrial companies are forced to dispose toxic materials that can cause diseases if not properly disposed. The industries located in Cancer Alley use several methods to dispose of waste. These methods are landfills, wastewater, injection into the ground, and on-site incineration.  These methods of disposal are not safe. When these industries dispose of waste by landfills, wastewater, and injections into the ground, these methods commonly result in the Mississippi River and groundwater reserves being contaminated. This means residents and the wildlife have a high chance of consuming contaminated water. Also, by these industries doing on-site incineration, they release air pollutants such a carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and benzene into the air.  These chemicals are toxic for humans to breathe and contribute to the foul smell in the area. There is a correlation between current industrial practices and the poor health of the communities in Cancer Alley, but nothing has been done about it. Local leaders believe no corrective action has been taken because of environmental racism and because the government has not been enforcing laws such as the Clean Air Act regarding pollution. Transitional justice is the weapon needed in this fight. Transitional justice is a form of justice that is used when a society needs to transition from one that engages in civil and human rights abuses to one that does not. Transitional justice is rooted in accountability.  The common ways transitional justice is obtained are through truth seeking, reparations, reform, and sometimes criminal prosecutions.  Truth seeking starts the process of transitional justice because it is the fact-finding process of human rights violations. Truth seeking often results in events and informationals, aimed at educating the community and local officials about the injustices.  Once awareness has been raised communities often ask for reparations. Reparations are defined as actions taken to make amends to give satisfaction for a wrong or injury.  The range of possibilities are endless. The most common forms of reparations are truth commissions, apologies, civil rights legislation, cash payments to communities, and cash payments to individuals.  Lastly comes reform which aims to change or restructure laws along with institutions and the way they operate. The goal of reform is to restore confidence in the law including its institutions and to prevent any recurring violations.  In some situations when serious human rights violations have taken place, criminal prosecution is pursued. Transitional justice examples are in our midst. The residents of Flint, Michigan, fought against environmental racism and are now being compensated $600 million from a victim compensation fund after the Flint water crisis.  Flint’s residents were able to obtain this after bringing attention to the condition of their drinking water on both a local and national level. They also rose awareness through social media which resulted in more support for the fight against human rights violations. Eventually, the governor and local officials apologized for their roles in the water crisis. The residents then filed personal injury suits against defendants such as the state of Michigan and the governor at the time of the crisis. Flint, is highly populated by African Americans just like Cancer Alley. The Flint water crisis happened after the state of Michigan decided to switch Flint’s water source from Detroit’s treated water system to Flint’s water plant that used water from the Flint River. Many warnings were given to city and government officials about the condition of the Flint water plant and that filtering water through its old pipes could be hazardous to the Flint community. Even with these warnings’ government officials switched the water supply. Shortly after the water supply was switched the lead levels in the water began to rise and residents of Flint began complaining about the color, taste, and odor of their drinking water.  The crisis wasn’t addressed until 18 months after it began and lasted close to 5 years until the water was considered safe to drink again.  As a result, over 100,000 people were affected, 12 people died, and 80 people became sick with a rare disease. It is unsure what the long-term effects will be on the citizens of Flint bodies. When comparing the crisis in Michigan to the one currently going on in Louisiana, there is a drastic difference in how long they took place. As previously stated, the crisis in Michigan lasted about 5 years while Cancer Alley began in the 1960s. Also, when comparing the number of victims, there have been more lives lost due to Cancer Alley. Local civil rights leader Mary Hampton who has lived on Cancer Alley her entire life stated that almost every household in Cancer Alley has had somebody die from cancer or is currently battling cancer.  National data supports her statement because, in Cancer Alley, forty-six individuals per one million are at risk of developing cancer compared to the national average at thirty individuals per one million. Transitional justice doesn’t just take place in the United States it happens internationally as well. For example, Europe is plagued with pollution. Europe was aware of their pollution problem, but for years nothing had been about it. Things remained unchanged until the European Environment Agency analysis report showed that in 2016 alone, there were about 400,000 premature deaths due to pollution.  With this report and with pressure from local advocates, the European government was forced to make changes. The European government proposed new legislation such as the European Green Deal and stricter enforcement of their air quality index. Europe’s Green is still awaiting approval, so policymakers decide to lower the amount of pollution allowed. Since Europe has enforced new air quality standards, there has been a slight decrease in premature deaths due to pollution.  Also, as a form of reparations, Europe decided to enforce a new standard that the polluter pays. This means that if a corporation emits more pollution than what is allowed, they will be responsible to pay the community and city that is affected. Communities that have faced environmental racism situations that are similar to Cancer Alley have been successful in obtaining reparations through transitional justice. Cancer Alley residents should follow the steps of other communities that have received reparations because of transitional justice. They should start by showing the correlation between the industrial complexes and health outcomes for residents in Cancer Alley. The next step should be to raise awareness and seek acknowledgment and a public apology regarding the human rights violations that have taken place. Then request reparations because the residents of Cancer Alley deserve reparations. The reparations should not solely be cash as money is easy. The reparations for the residents of Cancer Alley should also include medical and psychological care. Medical expenses should be included because most residents of Cancer Alley pay more medical bills due to sickness that is common to the area. They should also receive psychological care because they have seen their loved ones and others pass away from Cancer or another deadly illness that only come from living in Cancer Alley. The reparations for Cancer Alley should also include new guidelines and legislation regarding pollution emission. These changes should happen to prevent further harm to the residents of Cancer Alley and as an acknowledgment of the decades of suffering and loss of life. As local advocate and resident, Sharon Lavigne stated that the residents of Cancer Alley are indeed dying, but dying slowly.  She stated George Floyd died from a knee on his neck in a matter of minutes, but residents of Cancer Alley have a knee on their neck, yet are given many years before dying.  It is time for the knee to be taken off the necks of the residents of Cancer Alley. Transitional justice is the tool that can lift it!"
11,Addicted to Freelancing? 6 Reasons We Just Can't Stop it,social-issues," Working as a freelancer is enjoyable. But as time goes by, an obsession starts cropping up. It later turns out to be an addictive habit. In most cases, you're always behind a glowing screen. You start having sleepless nights and staying all day indoors. If you're not completing a project, you're hunting for gigs. This article explores several reasons why we're addicted to freelancing and not stopping. One is free to work any time they wish. No one is monitoring you. From waking up at noon to working late in the night, the choice is yours. One can rest during the weekends and work during weekends or vice versa. Thus, one can use their productive hours well. Earnings will depend on your expertise and the number of hours you commit to working. Dipesh Garg is the founder of Truelancer.com—an online freelance marketplace. He suggests that the gig economy opens up a new world that provides opportunities for the global workforce. You can choose to work overtime hours and raise your rates as you wish. Working independently allows for the freedom of choice. An individual is free to choose whoever pleases them. You can also select gigs that interest you. Usually, at work, one may meet rude clients or bosses and have to tolerate their behavior. In this case, if you don't relate well with a client, you can cancel your contract. No one controls you on what to do and what to avoid. You don't report to anyone. In short, you are the jack of all trades—from the management to the subordinates. You are in charge of everything, and all that you need is to make the right decisions to keep you moving. One is free to work from their desired location. You may opt to work from the living room or even a coffee shop. All that's important is selecting a place that you're comfortable with. The client will never know that you are not in the office. All they need is quality work and nothing else. Contrary to other jobs, one is able to gain a lot of skills. Working with worldwide companies promotes room for growth and development. There is room to interact with clients while working in various fields. It promotes interpersonal growth, allowing one to excel in many areas. With the skills, you can form your own company and mentor others. Concluding Remarks Freelancing can be addictive if one is not cautious. From sleepless nights to consuming most of your resting time. Anyway, the benefits attached to it are desirable. You can work during your productive hours at your desirable location. After all, you are not taking instructions from anyone—you're your own boss. The earnings are better; hence, there's a high potential for success. Finally, working with clients all over the world will add a list of skills to your portfolio. For all these reasons, we're addicted to freelancing, and we just can't stop!"
12,Rape is a weapon used to assert caste dominance and keep women “in their place”,social-issues," Dalit women and girls are being subjected to widespread sexual violence and harassment says the National Council of Women Leaders, a new coalition of women from marginalised communities in India. The National Council of Women Leaders (NCWL) is a newly established coalition bringing together from across India over 70 women leaders who belong to a range of marginalised backgrounds and have been working at the grassroots to support and empower disadvantaged women and girls in their communities. Breaking new ground by creating a high profile platform exclusively for women from different marginalised groups, NCWL was established in February 2021, with the mandate of facilitating cooperation, collaboration, and amplification of collective solidarity and expression. The Council is creating a unique space for members to celebrate their own identities, raise their voices and boldly champion the rights of women and those from communities facing discrimination. Campaign to #EndCasteBasedSexualViolence Working in collaboration with Dalit Human Rights Defenders Network (DHRD-Net), Equality Labs, and Equality Now, NCWL is launching a national campaign running from July 19th to August 31st 2021, which will draw much-needed public attention to how Dalit women and girls are being deliberately subjected to widespread sexual violence and harassment stemming from severe, pervasive and intersectional discrimination tied to their gender, caste and class. Vulnerably positioned at the bottom of these social structures, the socio-economic vulnerability and low political status of Dalit women and girls increase their exposure to human rights violations, while simultaneously reducing their ability to escape harm or access justice. Sexual violence is being used by those in dominant positions as a weapon to assert power and reinforce existing hierarchies. Dalit women and girls are often subjected to more severe or aggravated forms of sexual violence, such as gang rapes or rape with murder, and there is commonly a collective nature to these crimes, with offenders from dominant castes acting in groups to commit offences. Survivors of sexual violence, particularly those from marginalized communities, struggle to obtain justice within India’s legal system. The horrific gang rape and murder of the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, and the deplorable way in which it was dealt with by many in authority, has shown a spotlight on how men from dominant castes are granted protection and impunity at all levels. Perpetrators of sexual violence and abuse know they are far less likely to face punishment if they commit a crime against members of the Dalit community because attacks are rarely investigated or prosecuted. Police often refuse to register cases, coerce survivors into compromises, or declare cases false. For the small proportion of sexual violence crimes that India’s criminal court system does prosecute, conviction rates remain abysmally low. Survivors and their families who seek legal justice are often subjected to extreme pressure to stay silent, and cases that do make it to court mostly involve the most egregious crimes, such as when the victim has been killed or is a young girl. Data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in 2019 reported that ten Dalit women and girls are raped every day in India. Extensive under-reporting, problems registering sexual assaults with the police, and the sharp rise in sexual and gender-based violence since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, mean the true figures are likely to be considerably higher. NCWL’s campaign will showcase caste-based sexual violence in 15 Indian states, sharing a selection of landmark cases of crimes against Dalit women and girls dating from 1985 to now, which demonstrate the long term, deep-rooted nature of this systemic targeting. The Council will also report on developments — or lack thereof — in how the criminal justice system and others in authority respond to such cases, noting the specific barriers that survivors of sexual violence face which prevent them from receiving justice or support. Throughout the campaign, NCWL will be hosting a series of activities, bringing together women’s rights activists to share experiences and methods, advocate for positive change, and hold duty bearers to account. Data, visuals, and other creative tools to communicate the problem to a broader audience will be provided, alongside videos of activists working with survivors and victims’ families from marginalised communities. The campaign will culminate in the creation and sharing of key recommendations for policy makers, government authorities and civil society to improve responses to cases of caste-based sexual violence. About NCWL: National Council of Women Leaders (NCWL) is a body working across India, uniting grassroots leaders from marginalised communities. They work to give visibility and highlight the work of women/trans women leaders and to collaborate and build solidarities with other marginalised women leaders in South Asia and globally.

13,5 Simple Ways To Go Green At Home,social-issues," More people than ever are trying to help the environment. Whether at home or at work, as a business or an individual, the environment is a major concern. As a popular green slogan says, 'There is no Planet B!' — meaning that if we do irreversible damage to our planet, there is no alternative way forward. Most of us are concerned and want to do our part for the environment, but may also feel a little overwhelmed on where to start. Below, we explore five simple but impactful ways that you can make more environmentally-conscious decisions at home. The tips will not only help the environment, but may have a beneficial impact on your own health and wellbeing too. TIP NUMBER 1: Reduce Your Meat Consumption Studies have shown that reducing our consumption of animal products such as meat and dairy can be one of the most impactful ways to help the environment. Animal agriculture contributes to a lot of environmental damage, toxins and other environmentally harmful issues and practices. More people than ever before are helping in either small or large ways — such as by going vegan, doing ‘meat-free Mondays’, or simply trying to be more conscious about what they consume. There are now all sorts of plant-based hacks for new vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Anyone concerned about the health of the planet should be making conscious decisions about what goes on their plate, and there are now resources that make it easier than ever. Whether at your own pace, through an initiative such as Veganuary, or trying alternatives to meat, get creative and the planet will reap the benefits! TIP NUMBER 2: Ditch Toxic Cleaning Products Many household cleaning products are effective because of their powerful ingredients — but they can also be toxic, not least to the environment but also to our bodies. Products with microbeads — small particles of plastic — are especially harmful. In water supplies or the ocean, they are toxic and destructive for both plant and marine life. Many environmental institutions are campaigning to have them removed from sale altogether. Regular cleaning is important for eliminating common household ‘nasties’, but products do not need to be harsh to be effective. Harsh chemicals can aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma or skin complaints like eczema and psoriasis. More natural products or those specifically marked as non-toxic, natural and environmentally-friendly can be more beneficial all round. Many people ditch these products and replace them with natural alternatives immediately — but this can also be a more gradual process! Finish what you have or what is working for you, and then resolve to buy a more natural alternative next time around, for example. TIP NUMBER 3: Abandon Plastic This may be another gradual transition, but consider using sustainable, biodegradable and environmentally-friendly materials where possible. Plastic bags are perhaps especially harmful because of the sheer volume of them that go into landfill, and some supermarkets and retailers are no longer using them — or only doing so for a charge. Consider getting bags and materials that you reuse or that will naturally biodegrade. TIP NUMBER 4: Recycle & Compost Globally, food waste is a significant contributor to landfill and environmental harm — but composting is a great way to combat it. Compost is excellent to use on a home garden, and many compost systems are now small and sleek — a stylish addition to your kitchen or garage. Gone are the days when compost was only for large gardens or outdoor spaces! You can do your bit — however small — in whatever space you have access to. Recycling is also a highly effective way to help the environment, and many councils and local authorities have specific bins or systems to help. Be sure to check yours to take full advantage, and you will likely be able to recycle a wide variety of items and materials. TIP NUMBER 5: Switch Things Off It is easily done, but many of us leave energy or water running when it is completely unnecessary. Be sure to turn off lights and taps (faucets) when not in use, but also be especially aware of electric items such as chargers or unattended sockets. It can also be environmentally-friendly to wash your laundry at a lower temperature, and to take short showers rather than baths to conserve water. If you keep conserving energy and resources at the forefront of your mind, you will not only benefit the environment, but also your budget too!"
14,The Biggest Problems with Freelancing and How You Can Fix them,social-issues," Deciding to start freelancing can be a great move for anyone looking forward to making some extra income. It provides a flexible working alternative that's rare in the usual 9-5 job. Expectations will not always meet reality. Like any other business, this field has its own set of challenges.

15,Will Freelancing Ever Rule the World ?,social-issues," Freelancing is one of the fastest-growing careers in the world. In this profession, people work on a remote basis with no permanent terms of employment. Several years to come, it's expected to contribute as a major source of income for many. The future workforce will comprise both remote workers and full-time employees. The traditional employment system will continue as usual. An American survey by Statista estimates that more than 50% of the U.S. population will freelance by 2027. Again, what's so special about it that it's likely to rule the future? Below I have given four Reasons Why Freelancing is Gaining Popularity Earning some income as a freelancer is easy. A specialized set of skills and a portfolio showing one's capabilities are vital. This gives your potential customers an easier time when it comes to hiring you. According to Medium-off shoot, 80% of the U.S. workforce expresses interest in working from a home setup. They added that half of the jobs in the U.S. are doable from home. Yet, it's only 7% of employers who can manage to let their staff freelance. With time, they are likely to gain confidence in this system. Technologically evolving qualities call for the growth of remote working. The post-industrial period had its focus on establishing job stability. The 21st-century era aims at establishing a balanced work-life environment. A survey by Statista shows that, as of 2020, 64.8 million people were freelancing in America. If a similar trend continues, the figure should rise to 86.5 million people in 2027. With globalization, it's easier to share skills in various parts of the world. Let's say you need a report written for you. All you need is to get online, and in no time, locate a specialist in that field to do it. That's how simple the process is. More companies have embraced outsourcing. This has made millennials turn out in large numbers to freelance. Statistics show that 47% of millennials have worked remotely at one point in their life. Blockchain is an advanced technology that can decentralize networks. This makes it easy for people to connect. It creates an independent working space. So, how is the blockchain of help in the future of freelancing? The flourishing abilities of blockchain enhance the contract signing process for freelancers. It's now easier to build trust using the blockchain's infused smart contracts. The increased demand for blockchain experts continues to rise. More qualified people will help in the setting up of smart contracts. A blockchain payment system eliminates fraud-related issues. People can work without worrying about their payments. Smart contracts also ensure that no one can tamper with a person's work history. This will build trust, and more people will get attracted to venture into freelance work. Companies and corporations will not shy off to outsource either. Bottom-line What are the chances of freelancing ever dominating the world? Employers can access remote labor at reduced costs. Contrary to the traditional system, companies can now outsource remote skilled labor. Remote working will dominate, considering the unpredictability in the current job market. The earnings potential is unlimited, with a possibility of earning as much as one's skills allow. With proven statistics, it is without a doubt that freelancing will rule the world in years to come."
16,Dehumidifier Buying Guide,social-issues," What Is a Dehumidifier? Dehumidifiers pull excess moisture from the air inside your home. Some moisture is preferred in interior environments (which is why you might run a humidifier during the winter), but too much humidity can cause a variety of problems. High humidity levels make spaces feel muggy, sticky, and uncomfortable, especially as temperatures rise. It also aggravates health issues like allergies and asthma. Plus, excessive levels of humidity can also lead to mildew and mold growth. A portable dehumidifier lets you maintain an ideal level of humidity in your home. Do I Need a Dehumidifier? Whole-house and window air conditioners remove some of the moisture from your home's air, but if you live in a particularly humid climate, you might need additional help. Major signs of excessive humidity in a home are: condensation on the inside of windows (especially double or triple-pane windows), dripping or ""sweating"" pipes, peeling wallpaper, warping wood floors, and difficulty opening wooden doors or windows in the summer. If you're dealing with any of these issues, you could benefit from running a dehumidifier. How Dehumidifiers Work While there are several types of dehumidifiers, we're going to focus on portable, refrigerant-style devices as they're the most common. These models use a fan to pull moist, warm air into the unit. Once inside, the moist air passes over refrigerant cooled coils. As the air cools, it loses its ability to hold water and releases the moisture into the dehumidifier. This water drains out of the dehumidifier via a hose or collects in a holding tank that needs to be emptied manually. After shedding the excess water, the cooled air passes over a warming coil and gets released back into your room. What Size Dehumidifier Do I Need? Dehumidifiers are rated by the amount of water they remove from the air in a 24 hour period. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) uses the below chart to help homeowners determine what size dehumidifier will best meet their needs. Condition of Space without Dehumidifier	500 Sq. Ft.	1,000 Sq. Ft.	1,500 Sq. Ft.	2,000 Sq. Ft.	2,500 Sq. Ft. Moderately Damp Space with Musty Smell in Humid Weather	10 pints	14 pints	18 pints	22 pints	26 pints Very Moist Space with Smells and Damp Stains on Walls and Floors	12 pints	17 pints	22 pints	27 pints	32 pints Very Wey Space with Wet Walls and/or Seepage	14 pints	20 pints	26 pints	32 pints	38 pints Extremely Wet with Wet Floors and High-Load Conditions	16 pints	23 pints	30 pints	37 pints	44 pints Source: Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) As you can see, the two most important factors in determining what size dehumidifier you need are the condition and size of your space in square feet. This chart provides a good sense of the smallest dehumidifier that will still be effective in a given room. It's also a good idea to add 5-10 pints of capacity for rooms with high ceilings and those capable of producing moisture, like bathrooms, laundry rooms, and kitchens. However, there are a number of advantages to buying larger models for use anywhere. As noted above, the ""size"" of a dehumidifier is actually the rate at which it pulls water from the air. Using a larger dehumidifier than your space requires will dry the air more quickly. And while larger models use more energy while in running, they use less energy overall because they don't need to run as long to finish the job. The faster your dehumidifier gets the job done, the less time you and your home will be subjected to the negative effects of moist air. Plus, dehumidifiers that spend less time actively pulling water from the air will enjoy a longer lifespan. Like any appliance, the more you use a dehumidifier, the more stress gets put on its internal parts. And while it will likely be several years before any of the parts fail, the efficiency of a large dehumidifier ensures the longest possible life. Because of this, we recommend purchasing the largest dehumidifier you can afford. The higher upfront cost is offset by both energy savings and a machine that will outlast smaller models. What to Look for in a Dehumidifier - Options and Features In addition to the size of your dehumidifier, there are a number of features to consider when deciding which model is right for your space. Air Filter Many dehumidifiers include an air filter to contaminants from the air in addition to moisture. This improves the air quality of the space by removing allergens as well as mold and mildew from the air. Doing so helps eliminate the musty smell that's common in damp environments. More importantly, it keeps dirt particles from entering the adversely affecting the unit's performance. Look for a dehumidifier with a washable air filter and remember to clean it on a regular basis. Auto-Defrost Frost can form inside a dehumidifier in temperatures below 65° F. An automatic defrost function turns the compressor off until the unit defrosts to prevent damage. If you plan on running your unit at lower temperatures, make sure to purchase one capable of auto-defrost. Auto-Restart In the event of a power outage, auto- restart turns the dehumidifier back on when the power returns. This feature is especially important for remote locations, like a lake house. Even if you aren't around for the power outage, you can rest assured that your dehumidifier will get to work again as soon as possible. Caster Wheels Caster wheels are typical on most dehumidifiers, and allow for easy transportation and portability. Dehumidifier Collection Tank Most dehumidifiers feature a collection tank that holds water pulled from the air. Once a dehumidifier extracts enough moisture to fill the tank, it has to be emptied manually. To prevent overflows, almost every dehumidifier includes an automatic shut-off that turns the unit off when the collection tank reaches capacity. Models with front-loading buckets are the easiest to empty. As stated above, the ""size"" of a dehumidifier is actually a measure of the rate at which it pulls moisture from the air. It does not provide any information about the size of the collection tank. So, whether you have a 20 pint or a 70 pint dehumidifier, you may have to empty the collection tank a few times a day to make sure it continues to function. Alternatively, look for a model that offers direct drain-off. Dehumidifier Continuous Drain If manually emptying a collection tank sounds like too much of a hassle, look for models that offer continuous or direct draining. By connecting a hose to these models, water pulled from the air drips out continuously instead of collecting into a tank. This also lets the dehumidifier run without breaks and is a great feature for when you're away from the dehumidifier for long periods of time. Although direct drain dehumidifiers are significantly more convenient than models that only feature a collection tank, it's important to make sure you have a place for the water to drain. These models work great in a basement or bathroom with a drain on the floor as they rely on gravity to move the water. Some models also include a built-in pump to help move water up and out a window or into a sink above the dehumidifier. Humidistat A humidistat measures the humidity in the air and adjusts the dehumidifier accordingly. This lets you dial in the precise humidity level you desire. Once that desired level is reached, the machine will shut itself down. When humidity begins to climb, the humidistat alerts the dehumidifier and puts it back to work. By running the dehumidifier only when necessary, the device will typically enjoy a longer lifespan. Low-Temperature Setting Allows dehumidifiers to operate down at temperatures down to 41° F. Two Speed Fan Models that offer multiple fan speeds are both quieter and more efficient. Shop Dehumidifiers In Summary Moist air is a breeding ground for allergens, mold, and mildew. Dehumidifiers remove moisture from the air to keep you healthy and comfortable while protecting your home from destructive growths. If the air in your home feels muggy or if you notice condensation on the insides of your windows, you should be using a dehumidifier. When shopping for a dehumidifier, go for the largest model you can afford. Depending on the size of the space, smaller models may be able to handle the job. However, larger models are faster, more efficient, and more reliable. Figure out how you'll manage the water removed from the air. With a continuous or direct drain dehumidifier, you can attach a hose and let gravity pull the water toward a drain. Look for a model with a built-in pump if you plan on using a drain that sits above your dehumidifier. Or, stick to the manual method of emptying the collection tank when it fills. If you still have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at 847-954-4100 or you can also check out our top picks for the Best Dehumidifiers in 2021. Either way, we want to make sure you find the perfect dehumidifier to fit your specific needs."
17,The Best Dehumidifiers of 2021,social-issues," Banish excess moisture from your closet, garage, or basement. Muggy, humid, wet, soggy. None of these terms indicate a healthy home or a fun place to live (unless you're a forest-floor frog). Humidity can work its way into your home and settle in your basement, cellar, crawl space, or laundry room. Bring clean, filtered air back into your home with a little help from the best dehumidifiers of 2021. Whether you're looking for dehumidifiers for basements or a machine for the garage, it's important to answer the question of ""How do dehumidifiers work?"" before you pick one for your project. The basics: a dehumidifier pulls warm, moist air into its refrigerated coils using a fan, stripping condensation from the air as it travels through the device. Condensation collects inside, and dryer, cool air is the byproduct. Consider the scale of your project as well. Think about the size of your space and how difficult it may be to pull the moisture from your air. A cottage without proper HVAC in a humid environment may need a more powerful device than one in a dry place. (Psst, if you've got the opposite problem and need more moisture in your dry environment, check out our humidifiers.) For absolute precision, use a hygrometer to measure the humidity level in your home before and after use of your device. Anything between 40-50% relative humidity is considered a healthy level for summer months, while winter levels may need to dip below that to avoid window condensation. For easier air cleanup sans extra devices and precise measurements, opt for a dehumidifier that can sense air moisture all on its own. Whether you're looking for the best dehumidifiers for basements that feel a little too damp, or a crawl space dehumidifier, find one that meets your needs at Abt. And to learn more about what your home needs from one of these devices, check out our dehumidifier buying guide. Best for Small Rooms/Crawl Space Dehumidifiers: Frigidaire Dehumidifier Low Humidity 22 Pint - FFAD2233W1 Just because your project space is small doesn't mean your device should lack power. Meet the Frigidaire dehumidifiers that are designed to destroy moisture even in small spaces. With a 22-pint collection bucket, this skinny model is perfect for areas like laundry rooms and closets. Once your machine is full, empty the splash-guard bucket with ease, or set up a continuous drain option to empty condensed moisture into a drain. That way, you keep even more humidity out of the air, without having to run back and forth to the bathroom sink. But what happens if your bucket overflows? It's not likely thanks to the Frigidaire's automatic stop function. Once water gets close to the top, the machine turns off until you come back to empty it. There's no fear of spilling any water on the floor (which could create an even larger problem). With a design that can fit in many crawlspaces, this model needs a powerful filter. Frigidaire versions are designed with air quality in mind, and that means filtration is a top priority. The easy-to-clean washable filter helps to capture dust and allergens from the air that can be rinsed away with ease. For areas plagued with mildew and allergens, make sure you wash the filter often to keep the device running smoothly. Best Dehumidifier To Have On Hand for Emergencies: Honeywell Dehumidifier: 30-Pint Energy Star - TP30WKN Up until this point, we've been showing off devices that are made for specific purposes, like small crawlspace-style designs and high-humidity removers. However, these Honeywell dehumidifiers (the TP30WKN) are made for domestic use and are great for the average home in an emergency. Those in extra-damp climates know that moisture levels can change in an instant, and that's when it's good to have this workhorse in the house. When it's not being used, the convenient cord-winder helps make storage simple. These Honeywell dehumidifiers are ENERGY STAR certified and can have an attached hose for continuous drainage, meaning they can run for long hours without being checked on, and without using too much power. Plus, they're equipped with an auto-shutoff feature. That means that once they reach their capacity of 30 pints, they shut off. Maintenance is a breeze too, thanks to a filter clean notification and easily washable filter. Best All-Around Dehumidifier for Moderate Humidity: Frigidaire Dehumidifier Moderate Humidity 35 Pint - FFAD3533W1 For a moderate moisture destroyer, the Frigidaire dehumidifiers' 35-pint model tops the 30-Pint Honeywell in an extremely close competition. They both carry many of the same features, like automatic shut-off, splash guards on the removable buckets, and ENERGY STAR qualification. However, a slight boost in water capacity and an extra fan speed make the Frigidaire just a little more functional. Plus, this model is designed to work in extreme conditions when temperatures drop as low as 41 degrees, making this the pick for multi-season homes. Like other Frigidaires, the 35-pint version features continuous draining options and custom humidity control. Set the humidity of the room to your comfort level, and let your device go to work. Best for High-Powered On-The-Go Operation: Honeywell Dehumidifier: White 50-Pint Energy Star - TP70WKN Combining ease of mobility and smart technology, Honeywell dehumidifiers are designed for user-friendly operation and transportation. Whether you're keeping fabric curtains and couches dry at the homestead, or bringing it up to the lake house for the weekend, the TP70WKN beats out the competition. By pulling a full 50 pints of water from the air, this Honeywell model works hard and stores gallons of liquid at once. That means less running back and forth to drain the collection bucket, which is equipped with splash guard technology. Alternatively, ditch the collection bucket completely and set up continuous drainage via the drainage tube for unattended operation. With a body designed for easy mobility, you'll never struggle with loading up the car or moving yours around the house. The Honeywell's heavy-duty handle can hold up to 150 pounds, while gliding wheels make moving from one space to another a breeze. Bring it around the house, down the street, or across the country. This Honeywell dehumidifier is designed for medium to large rooms—think living areas, mid-size basements, crawlspaces, and bedrooms. Plus, with the smart humidistat, there's no hygrometer necessary. The Honeywell automatically senses when the room is dry enough and shuts off. Never come home to an overly damp (or overly dry) home again. Best High-Capacity Dehumidifier: Frigidaire Dehumidifier White High Humidity 50 Pint Capacity With Built-In Pump - FFAP5033W1 One of the heaviest lifting commercial models available, these 50-pint Frigidaire dehumidifiers are colossal versions of their 22-pint brethren mentioned earlier in this list. And it contains all the best aspects of its sibling's design. A washable filter, automatic shutoff, and portable design all make this an amazing option for large projects. Banish mold, mildew, and allergens from medium and small areas like open-concept homes, basements, and garages with help from this workhorse. What this machine does hold over its 22-pint sibling (aside from a higher capacity for water) is a built-in pump. That means that the unit can continuously discharge moisture in an upward direction, fighting against gravity to empty into a utility sink or even out a window. Hook up a hose, turn the machine on, and walk away. Best Dehumidifier for Wet Rooms: GE Dehumidifier 50 Pint Stratus Grey With Built-In Pump - APER50LZ Too much moisture can cause mildew, mold, wood rot, and pest invasions. If you've got set-in dampness and condensed water in your home, it's time to bring out the big guns with GE humidifiers.

18,There’s Only One Way Out of America’s Current Economic Crisis!,social-issues," Let’s start with the obvious. America cannot have a legitimate political democracy (a government of the people, by the people, and for the people) when so much wealth/power is concentrated in the hands of so few at the expense of so many. When the 1% owns and controls the US House of Representatives, the Senate, the Presidency, state legislatures, and the media, the politicians can claim that we have a democracy. But we don’t. We have an American oligarchy – a government of the people, by the wealthy and for the wealthy. In the words of Mark Twain, “It’s easier to fool the masses than to convince them that they’re being fooled.” In any case, the wealth gap between the haves and the have nots in America has been growing steadily since 1980. It hasn’t mattered whether the Democrats were in control or the Republicans were in control. Wealth/power has become more and more concentrated (democracy has been steadily shrinking) for at least four decades. The problem is currently as bad or worse than it was in the 1920’s when the economy literally collapsed under a very similar imbalance. That said, if we fail to systematically DECONCENTRATE wealth/power in America, a genuine political democracy is impossible. And by the way, concentrated wealth is concentrated wealth whether it’s in the hands of the private sector (the 1%) or the public sector (the government). So, the question becomes how can we systematically deconcentrate America’s wealth/power so a genuine political democracy is economically supported? With that question in mind, check out the following scenario and consider the possibilities. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy produces about $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) worth of new, productive capital assets annually. That translates into $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this predictable annual growth are limited to people who can afford to purchase these wealth-producing capital assets that account for our nation’s annual growth. More specifically, we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of these relatively predictable opportunities, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st-century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic-oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term, not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs, get we the people back to work, and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were 16 months ago. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars-worth of new, wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual phenomena are limited to those who can afford to participate in the ownership side of the American economy. And this generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of productive, economic opportunity in order to generate a second income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $10,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed all capital credit loans to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PAST SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to buy shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to PAY FOR THEMSELVES (they’re self-liquidating), and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! And it creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, each purchase would be backed (collateralized) by insured, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD AVOID INFLATION. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of capital income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END POVERTY…INCLUDING CHILDHOOD POVERTY •	HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE which is rooted in centuries of economic imbalance •	Stabilize family life, •	Make it much easier for police to do their jobs by reducing poverty related crime, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	Help democratize our free market in the long run, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And potentially pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investments in a way that only the wealthy can today. As result, the need for expensive, federally backed social safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, food stamps, will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVID 19/Economic crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored by our leaders. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is similar to the Economic Democracy Act, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not.

19,Having to Choose Between a Job You Hate and Starvation?,social-issues," Have you ever wondered what would happen if working-class Americans could AVOID HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN accepting a job that’s mind-numbingly repetitious, mechanical, boring, demeaning, unfulfilling, as well as life-negating, AND being unable to feed their kids, pay the rent/ mortgage, or even starvation? What would happen if those same Americans could afford to tell the narcissistic, dictatorial, sadistic CEO to “take his stupid job and shove it” unless he treats his employees with respect? Have you wondered what would happen to our economy if these working-class Americans could avoid the all-too-common condition known as WAGE SLAVERY? If so, check out the following scenario. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy produces about $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) worth of new, productive capital assets annually. That translates into $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this predictable annual growth are limited to people who can afford to purchase these wealth- producing capital assets that account for our nation’s annual growth. More specifically, we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of these relatively predictable opportunities, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term, not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs, get we the people back to work, and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were 16 months ago. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy creates $4 trillion dollars-worth of new, wealth producing capital assets annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual phenomena are limited to those who can afford to participate in the ownership side of the American economy. And this generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of productive, economic opportunity in order to generate a second income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $10,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) ANNUALLY •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed all capital credit loans to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PAST SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to buy shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to PAY FOR THEMSELVES (they’re self-liquidating), and to create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! And it creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, each purchase would be backed (collateralized) by insured, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD AVOID INFLATION. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of capital income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END POVERTY…INCLUDING CHILDHOOD POVERTY •	HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE which is rooted in centuries of economic imbalance •	Stabilize family life, •	Make it much easier for police to do their jobs by reducing poverty related crime, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	Help democratize our free market in the long run, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And potentially pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investments in a way that only the wealthy can today. As result, the need for expensive, federally backed social safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, food stamps, will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVID 19/Economic crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored by our leaders. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is similar to the Economic Democracy Act, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (probably a full decade) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
20,Banquo's Ghost,social-issues," Only when we learn that we are not better than our fathers, do we receive the grace to do better than our fathers. Experience is the best teacher, but only when learning from someone else’s mistakes. Fortunately, the history of Western Culture provides abundant opportunities for doing just that. Unfortunately, we tend to focus on the glories of the past instead of heeding the warnings of our heroes who lived to regret the horrific costs and fearful consequences of their apparent “success.” Perhaps it is not so surprising that we despise their warnings, often uttered or penned on their deathbeds, long after their glory days. After all, it is they and not us who have seen the bloodied ghost of the murdered Banquo that led Macbeth to prophesy, “It will have blood, they say. Blood will have blood.” Only by taking seriously the guilt, remorse, and prophecies of our fathers and mothers, can we avoid their mistakes and live up to their highest ideals. We are not better than them, but we can do better than them. We dishonor them and ourselves when we cancel their culture by letting their last and best insights and teachings vanish with them into the grave. As Lazarus the beggar learned when the dogs came to lick his sores, more compassion can often be expected from an animal than from a Rich Man. The Rich Man of the parable was not allowed to appear to his brethren to warn them of the fearful consequences of their neglect of the poor. One can only hope that they, like Ebenezer Scrooge, saw the Ghost of a corrupt and selfish future in time to avoid it. Because many of the wealthy classes understand that one person’s wealth or kindness cannot deliver the poor, they, like many of us, simply give up and accept no responsibility for their fellow human beings. However, Societal Problems require Societal Solutions. We must call upon one another to grant what only a society is capable of delivering, that is, liberty. The increase of liberty in America shows that change often has small beginnings, starting with mere pangs of conscience. Before the Civil War brought freedom to the captives, Alexis de Tocqueville was amazed that racial prejudice was strongest in the states that had abolished slavery. He found that intolerance was greatest “‘where servitude had never been known.’” Even Abraham Lincoln said, in 1858, that he had never “‘been in favor’” of blacks and whites living together in social and political equality or intermarrying. He explained that he was “in favor” of whites having a “superior position” assigned to them over blacks, because “there must be a position of superior and inferior” while they remain together. However, at Gettysburg in 1863, Lincoln spoke of a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. He further dedicated it to the great task before it, with high resolve to bring about a new birth of freedom. Only so, he mused, would the US government continue not as a hand of oppression but as a Government of, by, and for the people. The handmaid of liberty. As at Gettysburg, when our faith is challenged, we remember our first and most solemn prayers. Just so today, we must remember that with freedom comes responsibility. The hard pangs of labor that brought forth freedom in the midst of great and terrible civil war were not the end, but a new beginning of a nation conceived in liberty. The purpose of the Government of a free people is to bring to fruition the liberty conceived at the nation’s birth. When something is conceived, it starts small, even in the belly, underground, and out of sight, like a mustard seed. Onlookers might not even know that it is growing at first. Liberty in America was at first so obscure and hidden, that Founder and slave owner til death, Thomas Jefferson, like an errant Moses, despaired of the Country he helped create. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. reflected in 1962 on how the Continental Congress had edited Jefferson’s reproof of King George for favoring the slave trade out of his draft of the Declaration of Independence. Dr. King invoked the fear and regret that Jefferson expressed six years before his death, that he and the other Founders had failed to establish true Government. Miserably, tellingly, and despairingly, Jefferson called the loss of lives by the generation of 1776 “a useless sacrifice.” The “momentous question” of slavery, Jefferson wrote, “like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. I regret that I am now to die in the belief that the useless sacrifice of themselves by the generation of 1776 to acquire self-government and happiness to their country is to be thrown away, and my only consolation is to be that I live not to weep over it.” The Ghost of a bloody Civil War kept Jefferson up with night terrors. Blood will have blood. He would not have wanted to be celebrated as “victorious” in 1776. He would have, and did, warn us of perilous times to come because of his own failures. America was still a land of bondage when de Tocqueville visited in the 1830s and when Lincoln ran against Stephen Douglas for the Illinois seat in the US Senate in 1858. At Gettysburg, Lincoln took up Jefferson’s mantle to lead the fight to preserve the Union, so that Government of, by, and for the people should not perish from the earth. The Monster of Slavery was slain, but the aggressive Power of that arrogant, gross minority of oppressors, formerly known as the Slave Power, was never destroyed. The Civil War proved that some whites were willing to grant blacks freedom, but most were still not ready to grant them liberty. With Reconstruction came a mixture of local and state experiments in liberty, forced segregation, and black codes, which the Federal Reconstruction government did not address in a consistent manner. When Reconstruction ended in 1877, segregation, prejudice, and oppression reigned supreme for many decades, in both the North and the South. Today a large minority of Americans deny the existence of systemic racism and call any attempt to correct it “un-American.” But if Jefferson, Lincoln, and King all gave an honest account of America’s sins and fought to redeem it, how much more should we be bold to criticize and reshape it in the spirit of patriotism? Love does not prevent us from acknowledging and alleviating the legacy of oppression that we inherited from our wicked, perverse, and devilish fathers and mothers, grandparents, great grandparents, and beyond. It is ego that prevents us from acknowledging a truth that even our guilt-ridden Founding “Fathers,” like Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson, the somewhat honest and somewhat sorrowful slave owners, acknowledged. We do not honor our ancestors by denying their truth, the truth that they themselves confessed, even if they did not live up to it. It is the truth that they confessed, not the lies that they lived, that we must live up to. We derive great pleasure from considering the glories of our race and our culture. Our ancestors fought their battles. They did what they could. It is our shame, not theirs, if we do not take up their banner and push the battle lines further to claim more territory for the realm of liberty. If we do not live up to the ideals of our ancestors, we will repeat their evil deeds, disappoint their hopes for us, and cancel their culture. Whatever remains would not be worthy of the name “culture,” but the legacy of sin and shame that many of our ancestors lived to regret and came to fear, the incarnation of their nightmares. Banquo’s Ghost."

1,Open Letter to Israel,social-issues," Israel finally has a government, but it is entirely a product of hostility and resentment towards Netanyahu. After repeated failures to form a government, and as most of the world including the United States becomes increasingly hostile, some Israelis are hoping for the arrival of the Messiah. If we are to recognize the Messiah when he does come, it may be necessary to broaden our expectations beyond just looking for a great leader to suddenly appear. Perhaps G-d has something more elaborate in mind. The Messiah is supposed to gather the Jewish people back to the land of Israel, but Israel has already been gathered and modern Israel has fulfilled prophecies without the appearance of the Messiah. It is said that prophecy is being fulfilled in a non-miraculous way because of certain modern conditions. This seems like a poor excuse. The Jews are to be gathered to Israel by the Messiah, and there should have been a Messiah when Israel was restored. Even if the Lord is actually causing the events to occur, there must be a Messiah leading the way. There have been miraculous military victories by Israel. Events do suggest that the Lord is involved in ways that are beneficial to Israel. Instead of making excuses for why the Messiah did not gather the Jews, perhaps we should consider the possibility that it was the Messiah who gathered the Jews. If the Lord has been helping Israel, then perhaps the Lord is the Messiah. The idea that the Lord is the Messiah who restored Israel should be given some consideration, but the this idea is very problematic for religious Jews. The Messiah is a human, and if he has already restored Israel, then he must have been born sometime in the past as a human. If the Messiah is also the Lord, it means he must be someone who was born sometime in the past as a Jew, but who is also the Lord. Christianity is nothing more than many different Gentile interpretations of the teachings of a first century Jewish rabbi, who claimed to be the Messiah, and who also claimed to be the Lord. Jewish scholars overwhelmingly rejected his claim since the Messiah is a man and a man cannot be the Lord. But what if the Lord wants to be a man for some reason, does G-d have the power to create that condition? This is not to say that Christianity is correct, Christianity teaches that Jesus took the punishment for our sins. This not only contradicts the Scriptures; it means that G-d does not execute justice, and worse yet it means that G-d is dishonest for saying He executes justice. G-d would not punish one person for the sins of someone else, but the idea that He would is only an interpretation of the teachings of Jesus. Jesus spoke in riddles. The Christian “Trinity” also contradicts the Scriptures, but the consciousness of G-d greatly transcends our ability to comprehend. There is only one G-d transcending time and space, but G-d can create time and space in a way that allows Him to send part of Himself into time. There is the consciousness of G-d outside of time and the consciousness of G-d moving through time, both of which are beyond our ability to comprehend. There is indication in the Bible that G-d transcends time, and there is indication in the Bible that G-d moves through time. This is not a contradiction since both can be true. We can say that there is only one G-d (outside of time) while a part of G-d moving through time explains passages in the Bible where the Lord interacts with creation in a way that seems as though the Lord changes His mind. Surely G-d can send part of Himself into time, to be born into the world if this is something that He wants to do. If He has a good reason, G-d can do anything He wants. Jewish scholars say there is nothing to indicate a Messiah who comes a second time, but Mosses went up the mountain to be with G-d, and then he came back down the mountain. This was not the second coming of Mosses, but only a return. If the Messiah is a human who is also the Lord, He can overcome death and have the longevity to be a two-thousand-year-old human, still alive, and intervening in human affairs to re-establish Israel. If Jesus is still alive; he may yet cause the temple to be rebuilt and fulfill all the other prophecies during his first (and only) (very long) lifetime. The Messiah is not punished for our sins, so there would have to be some other reason for him to come to the Earth and die the way he did. If G-d sent the Messiah to die on a cross, and then caused him to be followed in error by billions of Gentiles, and then he returns to rescue Israel in the last days with a revelation of all truth, that would certainly be a more compelling story than some great leader who suddenly appears like a knight in shining armor."
2,Childhood Poverty in the USA Eliminated Forever!,social-issues," If the Economic Democracy Act (EDA) was implemented today, every child in the USA would have $10,000 invested on their behalf ANNUALLY, and their money would be working for them instead of them working for money. In 10 years, they would have had $100,000 invested on their behalf. And in 18 years, when they’re ready to attend college, they would have had $180,000 invested on their behalf which would be generating enough dividend-based income for them to attend college WITHOUT GOING INTO DEBT! In other words, if the EDA was implemented today, there would be NO POOR CHILDREN IN AMERICA within a decade. And at age 18, no young person would be denied all the benefits of a college education due to a lack of money. Furthermore, done correctly, all this could be achieved WITHOUT CREATING A DIME of GOVERNMENT or CONSUMER DEBT. And this is only the tip of the EDA iceberg. Sound impossible? Check out the following scenario. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy produces about $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) worth of new, productive capital assets annually. That translates into $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.

3,DO YOU HAVE A GOOD SLEEP QUALITY?,social-issues," Sleep is a natural and vital process that rejuvenates the mind and body. It is a deep state of rest during which there are no cognitive, physical, or emotional activities. Sleep quality is different from sleep quantity. Sleep quantity refers to the amount of sleep that we get every night. However, sleep quality refers to how well you sleep. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recommended amount of sleep for and adult ages 18 to years is 7 to 9 hours per night. Why sleep quality is important? Sleep quality is important as it influences individual’s ability to feel rested and revived for the next day, as well as reducing the daytime sleepiness. If you always feel tired and sleepy in the morning even when you already have enough sleep, it may be due the lack of sleep quality. A poor sleep quality could lead to a lot of harmful effects towards the individual. It can be physiological such as stroke, heart disease, high blood pressure, cognitive and memory deficits, and even obesity. In terms of psychological, poor sleep quality could lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, poor sleep quality is often associated with declining learning performance. Furthermore, poor quality sleep may also affect the safety of others. For instance, an individual could experience microsleep while driving due the lack of sleep and causes an accident which can lead to injuries or even death of the loved ones. So, how can you actually improve your sleep quality? These are few tips on how to improve your sleep quality. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that is released from the pineal gland with peak levels occurs at night. The secretion of this hormone is regulated by the light exposure where night-time is detected by reduced light entering the eyes. Thus, the production of melatonin is 10 times higher at night which makes us feel sleepy, compared to daytime. Therefore, it is recommended to expose yourself to bright sunlight in the morning and spend more time outside during daylight. This is because less melatonin is produced, and it helps you to stay awake. Meanwhile, during bedtime, it is recommended reduce the screen time and stop it for at least 30 minutes before going to sleep. The reason for this is that your brain will perceive the blue light emitted by the electronic devices as sunlight. Hence, less melatonin is produced which then delaying your sleep and keep you awake longer than you had like. One of the most significant ways for a better sleep quality is to get in sync with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, or circadian rhythm. This aids in the regulation of your body's internal clock and improves the quality of your sleep. To avoid tossing and turning, go to bed at a time when you are sleepy. A regular sleep routine trains your brain to recognize the time to sleep and the time to wake up, that you can wake up naturally by yourself even without an alarm. Short naps are beneficial as it can boost the brain function during daytime. However, it is best to limit the nap time to 15 to 20 minutes in the early afternoon. This is because, a long daytime nap may confuse your natural sleep-wake cycle or circadian rhythm, hence affecting the sleep quality during the night. Small modifications to your sleep environment can sometimes make a major difference in the quality of your sleep. These sleep environments include external light, noises, bedding, and temperature. Although everyone has their own preferences, most individuals sleep best in a dark, quiet, and comfortable environment. External noises can be minimized by wearing earplug to have a good sleep. Next, make sure that your mattress and bedding are comfortable to sleep on and have enough space to stretch and turn at ease. Setting the room temperature around 18° C is also proved to enhance the sleep quality. Caffeine has numerous benefits as a single dose of it can boost alertness, energy and even sports performance. However, it is not advised to take drinks with caffeine at least five hours before bed. This is because, caffeine will stimulate your nervous system which makes it difficult for your body to relax naturally at night. In conclusion, sleep quality should be improved as a good sleep quality will make your day more productive and rejuvenated. Persisting the poor sleep quality without trying to improve it may harm yourself and others around you in the future. Therefore, it is best to consult a doctor if you still cannot manage to have a good sleep even after implementing the tips above."
4,Tips for Satisfying Couples To Reach Peak Orgasm,social-issues," Overcoming a style that feels saturated if only done on the bed, actually sexual intercourse can be done on the kitchen table, sofa, garage and many more because it is a fantasy not a fetish and is still normal when done with a partner as long as both are still happy. Many questions often arise when men have a size that is too small and does not touch the partner's G Spot, so they are worried that they will not be able to make their partner satisfied. The G-spot is located a third of a woman's vagina between 11-12 hours, there are no nerves at all, so the smallest penis can make a partner feel aroused and satisfied when having sex, but it should be underlined that a normal penis size is 8-9 cm when erect , when below that it can be called a micro penis. According to research 40% of women in the world do not reach orgasm, meaning whether women in the world do not have enough knowledge or men are selfish. What is clear is that actually every woman has genes that should be able to reach orgasm. Actually there are many ways to make a partner feel satisfied when having sex and reaching orgasm, you as a man should be able to help stimulate your partner by slowly and indirectly penetrating to find the G Spot point. And another way is to use a Bathmate Hydromax pump which can be done by pumping it using water and air media so that the shaft of the penis becomes thicker and more muscular plus a longer size. And research conducted at one institution in England that women prefer a penis size that is not too long as long as it is more muscular, why is that? because the entire shaft of the penis will touch the G spot of women and will make them feel more satisfied until they reach the peak of orgasm. The hallmark of women reaching orgasm is when women experience mental and physical involvement, when the mind begins to feel comfortable and like floating can't be described in words "", French women used to say it was a small death then physically experience small spasms in the legs that spread upward every 0 ,7 seconds accompanied by sucking and clamping of the male penis by the female uterus, falshing and redness of the face and a small moan."
5,Why Fresh Graduates Are Unemployed?,social-issues," The rising unemployment rate among fresh graduates have become a cause of concern in Malaysia. The Department of Statistic Malaysia has released a report that presents the statistics of unemployed graduates in 2019. According to the report, the number of unemployed graduates in 2019 was 170.3 thousand persons, 5.5% higher than in 2018 which is 808.5 thousand persons. Based on a study namely Graduate Tracers Study, both public and private sector universities produced total number of 51,000 graduates in a year however about 60% of graduate remain unemployed one year after graduation. The 55% of these unemployed graduates are believed to be degree holders. This shows that being a university graduate has no guarantees to get an immediate employment. There are many factors that contribute to unemployment of fresh graduates in Malaysia. One of the critical factors is most of fresh graduate lack of employability skills. The reason is fresh graduates do not have any practical experience of work. This deficiency may interrupt their job application especially in resume or curriculum vitae for the experiences section. The fresh graduate who are unskilled and have no experiences face the difficulty to secure their dream jobs due to the fact that most employers will be looking for workers with more experiences in their company. In general, some employers find that Malaysian graduates tend to lack of skills and qualifications required for the industry due to poor in communication skills, analytical skills, technical skills, problem solving skills and mastery of English. According to studies, graduates from international universities has higher level of employability than local graduates. Associate Professor Dr. Hariharan N Krishnasamy of Universiti Utara Malaysia found that there is a huge gap between what graduate is being taught in local institution and what industry expects in terms of skills that will make the Malaysian graduates less employable. The problem become more serious when the number of the job hunters is higher than the job vacancies. Based on the statistics published in 2016 by the Higher Education Ministry, there are more than 5,000 postgraduate students sitting for doctoral programmes each year. And by 2023, it will bring the total number of 60,000 PhD holders in our country. Another possible factor is the graduates lack of desire to seek a job. A survey found that in 2 years, some of the unemployed graduates have only attended less than 5 interviews. Majority of graduates seeking jobs through online job sites, wait for the industry to contact them and not following up their applications. Demanding for a higher salary is one of the major causes of unemployment among fresh graduates. Most of the fresh graduates expecting very high salaries during the job interview despite of their lacking skills and knowledges. This may lead to a bad impression from the potential employers toward them. Regarding to the salary issue, graduates probably thought that there is a fixed salary for fresh graduates since they are degree holders. However, the reality is salaries are basically based on what work they will do, what skills and knowledges they have, how many experiences they have and academic qualification. Having more experiences and skills may be the key factors for a higher salary. Since there is no simple solution to overcome graduate unemployment, fresh graduates must have a willingness to learn and explore new possibilities even though it does not meet their field of study. There is nothing to lose when exploring something beyond the field of study because we do not know what kind of job that fit with our skills and the chances to get a suitable job is high. According to Hariharan, having entrepreneurship skills can open the career paths and fresh graduates must realise the importance of it. Nowadays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce platform received an overwhelming response from society. They should use this opportunity to learn new skills. There are variety of online platforms that is free and available to seek knowledges and upgrade their skills. This will help them to become more marketable. Generally, COVID-19 pandemic has affected many companies in terms of economy. Because of the movement control order, they have difficulty in paying their workers’ salaries which some of industries are forced to fire their employees. Back to 2020, a heartbreaking news has flood in social media where Malindo Air launched a retrenchment for more than 2000 of their employees including pilots, flight attenders and engineers in order to reduce their costs and expenditure. A study shows that if the issue getting worse and no further action has been taken, about 2 million people are expected to lose their job. There are also issues of freezing new hiring that will make the rate of unemployed graduates rising. In conclusion, unemployed graduates must get of their comfort zone, try to explore the job market that suit with their skills and the most important thing is having desire to succeed or change their lives."
6,Indecent Jokes Are Never Funny!,social-issues," What are indecent jokes? Humor may be used to de-stress, highlight important topics, and entertain people. However, it appears that humor is frequently exploited as a pretext to attack and make derogatory remarks. When humor reduces the suffering of those who have undergone something beyond their control, such as obscene jokes or rape jokes, the word ""funny"" does not spring to mind. indecent jokes should not be normalized at all in society. Aside from the fact that this joke isn't humorous at all, it's also a ""joke"" that offends and has a negative influence on a variety of people. We must abolish this situation as quickly as possible so that it does not become a new standard in which people are acclimated to this deplorable behaviour. Why it is such an offensive joke? Why it is such an offensive joke? Let’s take example for rape jokes. First thing, rape is totally a horrible thing and when a rape joke is uttered, there is an extremely high and sad chance that a victim may hear it and be severely affected. Although most rape survivors endure a greater psychological impact in the immediate aftermath of their assault, many survivors may suffer long-term psychological impairment. Anxiety, self-blame, suicide, depression, Post-traumatic stress disorder and victim blaming are some of the psychological problems that rape victims may face. DiMauro J, Renshaw KD also said in his research that survivors of sexual assault have an increased likehood of developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). So, hearing this kind of jokes may traumatise some people and bring up recollections of horrible times in their lives. The victims have been through a lot, both physically and psychologically. Mostly, when we hear of a murder, our initial instinct is usually to realise how horrible the crime was however, when we hear about rape in the news or learn about friends' sexual assault experiences, our immediate instinct is to doubt and condemn the victim which is totally wrong. It's critical to understand the context of our jokes. Because we live in a rape culture, making a joke about a rape victim contributes to the normalising of rape and victim blaming. This distinguishes it from, instance, a murder joke, which does not normalise murders or victim blame of homicide victims. Not only may these jokes be incredibly upsetting to survivors of sexual assault, but they also minimise the seriousness of rape and sexual assault. By making a pleasant joke about sexual assault, it appears to be less severe than it is. Rape culture is so pervasive in our culture that making rape jokes is commonplace. You just ""can't take a joke"" if you don't laugh. Some of the most well-known comedians, who had a stand-up bit on male rape, have made a name for themselves by mocking other people's pain. This demonstrates how normalised and welcomed this conduct is. The Women’s aid organization stated that number of rape cases in Malaysia for 2017 is 1582 cases. Therefore, such a thing should not be transformed into a laugh matter, because rape is a serious crime. where it usually happens? Indecent jokes may be found on TV, in movies, on social media, in video games, and in a variety of other places. This is a major concern since television, social media, video games and the internet are highly toxic to youngsters. Next, when observing a television show, the comedians openly make jokes that have a double meaning and can be considered as indecent. The jokes continue to be laughed at, demonstrating that obscene-mixed humour have become commonplace in our thinking. When confronted, the comedians claimed that it was up to them to pick the positive or bad side of the jokes because they were subjective, and that such jokes were frequently followed by students whose brains were still pure. As a result, in addition to having easy access to pornographic material, school students believe that indecent jokes are normal since their brains have been normalised to the point where indecent jokes are no longer considered an offence but rather a culture to joke. Furthermore, there have been situations where a rape victim has shared information about a rape assault on social media, only to be blamed for it. Users on social media were making jokes about the claims levelled on the victim. Victims were mocked in some of the jokes. Regardless, the jokes received a lot of likes, laughing emojis, and keyboard smashes in the comments section. People were making jokes about every woman and man who has ever been sexually attacked. As a result, such jokes should not be made by anybody, including comedians, teachers, parents and so on. Let’s not normalize this kind of jokes anymore. This kind of jokes are definitely not funny, we can make a world better and safer place. Nurul I’zaaz binti Mohd Zulkifli Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment"
7,9 tips to attract whatever you want with Feng Shui,social-issues," Some of the best things about Feng Shui is it helps to transform your life in a fast way. Some of the reasons are what you want and how your actions are aligned. If you’re wanting a change but are just too lazy, your actions do not prove that you sincerely want it. But if you’re seeking for a change and prove it by making actions towards it, then you will definitely see changes in your life quickly. Here are some tips that you can follow to attract whatever you want : In Feng Shui, the door symbolizes the place where endless opportunities enter your home. By turning on the light for 3 hours, shows the Universe that you are prepared to welcome in the change that you are looking for. Whenever you declutter your home, you are creating a sense to the Universe that you are prepared to fill with something new. Hence, this is why decluttering is very important in Feng Shui- you are helping the positive energy to move in your home more freely. 9 is considered the lucky number in Feng Shui. So go on and set an alarm to remind yourself to light a candle each day for the next 9 consecutive days. Light represents fire in Feng Shui. Try changing the bulbs to a higher wattage in the areas where you will want to see positive changes. If you are keen on welcoming a new partner, then proceed by changing the bulbs in your bedroom or in a relationship area. Then continue to turn them on for 3 hours each day. Taking good care of your home is showing a sign to the Universe that you are taking care of the abundance and appreciating it in your life. Since the stove is a strong sign of abundance, be sure to take good care of it by cleaning it. Some of us tend to use only one burner in the stove- but now be sure to turn them all for a few seconds in order to get the energy going. The stove symbolizes wealth and prosperity, so turning on your burners is a sign that you are prepared for a change. 7.Put a bowl of sea salt in the corners of your home or doorways The bowl does not have to be a big one, just a small one will be perfect. The salt works as a tool to attract negative energy. Try putting the salt in every room in the house to increase the vibration in your house. Remember to leave it out for only 24 hours and then throw it away- don’t keep it there forever. You are giving a signal to the Universe that the old energy has gone and now the room is filled with new energy! If you don’t have sea salt, you can also use sage instead. 27 is also a lucky number in Feng Shui, and intentionally when you move 27 things in your house, this will create a positive energy in your house. Move the 27 things with the intention of creating a positive change. The front door is where new opportunities are attracted in your life, pretend that you are welcoming new people in your house and clean your porch. Sweep and clean your porch with the intention of welcoming change."
8,How Greenhouse Gases Affect the atmosphere and Reversing Climate Change,social-issues," Recent wildfires all over the world including Australia, United States and Canada etc., droughts in Africa, USA and worldwide have been occurring and increasing in frequency and intensity for decades.  Major cities In Asia and other countries now have air pollution at toxic levels, and around the world- pollution and water temperatures have increased to levels where marine life is at risk of becoming extinct making it abundantly clear that climate change is affecting every aspect of life on earth. Climate change has reached the point where if action is not taken the entire world will soon be in jeopardy of mass extinction. Greenhouse gases have risen to dangerous levels over the past few decades. Safe levels of Carbon Dioxide are 350 parts per million but as of 2019 they had risen to 410 parts per million and still rising. In 2019, the concentration of atmospheric methane reached nearly 1875 parts per billion, the highest levels ever recorded. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane gas absorb the sun’s heat and causes the atmosphere to warm which is why it is called a greenhouse gas. These greenhouse gases need to be reduced to stop the warming of our atmosphere as soon as possible for the world as we know it to survive. It seems the media, governments and the public focus becomes singular, sensationalizing each event or type of event obsessively and expressing the need to “fight climate change” without making a definitive action plan or concrete endeavors to do so. The more disasters that strike, the more the world’s focus is viewed with such tunnel vision that the results become insincere promises to take action, solving nothing, and creating a greater problem through lack of definite action or approach the crisis with costly, useless, and absurd gimmicks like carbon taxes instead of taking real action to face the crisis head on. As in the age-old expression, “not seeing the forest for the trees”, it has become standard practice to sensationalize events occurring while doing little rather than working seriously towards their prevention and reduction. Single sightedness by focusing on one event or issue at a time is disregarding that almost every event can easily be traced back to the overall problem of climate change which is composed of several components. Since mankind has not prevented these major events from occurring at the high intensity and frequency they have evolved into, it is now faced with climate emergencies that continue to intensify. Unresolved manmade events are now becoming closer to extinction events with species from fish to falcons going extinct due to their habitat becoming inhospitable for their survival. The Paris Climate Agreement does not give enough leeway or credit for the recycling and use of carbon dioxide and methane gas technologies that they deserve since successful innovations will lead to the reduction of climate change. The way forward is to encourage investment in this area. Using and encouraging the use of these technologies and products instead of fossil fuels would foster growth and innovation for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane gas  capture technologies and with them being used more widely the prices would go down allowing for more growth and innovation in the industry. Currently, despite renewable energies making huge strives the past few years the world still gets 80 percent of our energy needs for the planet uses fossil fuels as developing nations become more electrified this number will not go down unless we make drastic changes.  The long-term effect of using and encouraging industry to make use of captured carbon dioxide and methane, which are waste products and other renewable energies such as wind and solar power would result in less reliance on fossil fuels with the end goal being recycling excess levels of carbon dioxide and using as much methane gas instead of it damaging the environment as greenhouse gases for mankind’s needs. Large industries to even single households could make use of biodigester plants, using fuel made from captured methane gas and recycled carbon dioxide instead of natural gas and other fossil fuels for generating everything from electricity to car fuel. There are currently many uses for captured methane and carbon dioxide and new markets and uses for it could open up for them as more people and industry become educated and encouraged more in the benefits and what it can do for them. Instead of composting household wastes setting up biodigesters, which provide both gas for cooking and fertilizer for gardens at the same time would do much in reducing harmful methane heating up the atmosphere. The short-sightedness of the Paris Climate Agreement was not giving full credit for the development of these technologies. They do not give credit for many carbon dioxide capture products as they do end up returning as carbon dioxide to the environment but they lose sight of the fact that it has been recycled and could be recycled again and again instead of adding more fossil fuel to the system. In addition to being able to recycle and reuse captured carbon dioxide and methane gas instead of it destroying our atmosphere giving carbon credits for recycling carbon dioxide and methane gas would encourage further exploration into new uses and cheaper ways to extract greenhouse gases as well as new uses for them once extracted. Like everything involving mankind money tends to be the bottom line when it comes to innovation so encouraging new and better ways of dealing with carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will only come at the rate we need to save our planet is by big industry finding it doesn’t cut into their profits. Though many uses for captured carbon are temporary in nature many are permanent and semi-permanent. The Paris Agreement should take into account man’s innate greedy nature in order to meet their goals or they are in essence “cutting their noses off to spite their face” when it comes to the long-term goal of reversing climate change.  If mankind continuously used and  reused carbon and methane emissions instead of adding astronomical amounts of new carbon dioxide through the introduction of new fossil fuels we would achieve a reversal in climate change far quicker since the cost of these technologies would lower with the rise of demand  making the actual reversal of climate change possible. The climate agreement must be revised to include this. It is important for individuals to continue to maintain and practice in our everyday lives the well-known environment savers such as recycling, taking mass transit when possible, being conscientious with lights and littering, alternative energies, insulating homes well, and the myriad of other small things that can be done that add up to lessen each person’s own carbon footprints. Big industry and governments also need to expand and invest more for their part in reducing climate change as they have a huge impact on global climate change.  It is necessary to take a holistic approach to reverse climate change and destructive greenhouse gases, warming waters and pollutants at the same time when dealing with the climate changes we are facing because hurricanes, typhoons, drought conditions, increases in desertification, and wildfires will only successfully be decreased if all these indicators that combine to create climate change are dealt with at the same time. In the case of hurricanes and typhoons for example, attempting to reduce their intensity and frequency by reducing the increased air temperatures  and changes in water currents that are involved in creating hurricanes, which can only be done by reducing carbon dioxide  and methane gas levels that increase the atmospheric temperature and water temperatures. The change in ocean currents also involved in the increase of hurricanes and typhoons would be abetted by removing the excessive amounts of methane and carbon dioxide because the increase the air temperature causes melting of polar icecaps which changes the salinity of water. The changes in the waters salinity and temperature alters the ocean currents. Capturing carbon dioxide and preventing as much methane gas from entering the atmosphere would aid in reducing climate change and the intensity and possibly the frequency of hurricanes.  Adding more trees and plant life into arid desert and drought affected areas would reduce air temperatures and lead to a downgrade in hurricane intensities via its cooling affects while reducing the melting of polar icecaps as well. Mankind needs to reforest rainforests and replant a vast number of trees maintaining them with more sustainable methods as trees consume carbon dioxide reducing the greenhouse effect. Creating more green spaces in arid and drought areas would aid in this endeavor. It is time to alter human activity to reduce these occurrences. Reducing arid desert and drought affected areas on the planet would also return missing habitat to wildlife as well as provide humans with more farmland. The human species needs to develop more sustainable methods of extracting what is needed while creating less damage to the planet we all live on. This paper will outline ways that climate change can be reduced in a financially viable manner that benefits all life on earth. At the same time, the polar ice caps and glaciers are melting causing the desalination of the oceans and seas. This has caused an increase in extreme weather and climate disasters worldwide through raised sea levels and changing ocean currents. Glaciers and polar ice caps that melt into the sea are made of freshwater while sea ice is frozen saltwater, icebergs are pieces of glaciers, formed of compacted snowfall, and are therefore freshwater. Melting glaciers and icebergs release freshwater and reduce the salinity of the surrounding sea. In combination with the increase of fresh water, carbon dioxide when absorbed by ocean waters increases the acidity of the ocean waters and in addition rising temperatures changes the Ph levels. Rising ocean temperatures and Ph levels have caused many damaging effects to both marine life and are contributing to increased extreme weather anomalies. Bleaching and eventual death of coral reefs have been getting worse for many years due to the changes in Ph levels and warming waters. These reefs are the habitat for a huge variety of fish and marine life and necessary for their survival. Seawater has become less dense due to the increase of fresh water, changing patterns of ocean currents causing extreme weather events affecting coastal areas. When the water is heated at the equator and travels at the surface towards the north and south poles it comes into contact with the melting polar ice caps the warm water sinks and this has become a large part of the extreme events happening in lands near the ocean. In Figure 1 some uses for captured carbon dioxide and 2 diagrams of extraction methods: First, capture technologies allow the separation of carbon dioxide from gases produced in electricity generation and industrial processes by one of three methods: pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture and oxyfuel combustion. Carbon dioxide is then transported by pipeline or by ship for safe storage Carbon capture uses in mining and oil industry.  CO2 can either be pulled out of flue gases waste streams produced by power generation or other industrial processes or it can be pulled out of the ambient air through a process known as Direct Air Capture (DAC). Captured carbon dioxide can be used to make polymers and plastics, construction materials, fuels, manufacturing of chemicals and materials, in food and carbonated drinks, and oil recovery. Figure 1: Some uses for Captured Carbon Dioxide Captured carbon dioxide can be used to extract rare earth elements as well. Recent advances have made it possible to capture carbon dioxide and convert it into Oxalic acid to process rare earth elements in a very cost-effective way. By producing oxalic acid, it may be possible to profitably extract rare earth elements with the potential savings to industry and planet using this kind of carbon dioxide scrubber are enormous. Figure 2: Flue CO2 capture Image from National Energy Technology Laboratory Figure 3: Direct Air Capture of CO2 image from Geoengineering monitor Though carbon dioxide is commonly part of the global discussion and should without a doubt be included as a top priority to be drastically reduced to facilitate positive change  to the environment, the same amount of methane gas is a greenhouse gas that is  20 times more harmful to the environment than carbon dioxide and is considered the second most damaging greenhouse gas overall. It is therefore essential to reduce methane levels to make the dramatic changes the planet needs to recover from the adverse effects of climate changes that have already occurred and to prevent further negative environmental changes.  Tools have been developed for combatting the increase of harmful gases in recent years that need to be more widely used to be more effective to stop the destructive path that our planet is headed on. For example, instead of allowing organic wastes from humans, farms and manufacturing to break down in landfills and other disposal sites the use of biodigester plants to collect the methane as it breaks down and burning it instead of natural gas and propane would make use of this harmful gas while reducing the need for the other  fossil fuels that human kind has come to rely on for our energy needs. Using biodigesters for households, large cities, farms and many industries could turn harmful methane gases into fuel for running electricity, cooking, heating and anything that natural gases do while having a by-product of natural fertilizer to add valuable nutrients to the soil. We have carbon capture technologies which can also remove excess carbon dioxide from the air and either make use of it replacing technologies more harmful for the environment or returning it to the soil as carbon simply burying it as solid masses to eventually be broken down in the earth. Figure 4 is from Homebiogas.com of a simple home biodigester and how it works to create usable methane gas that can be used for cooking, powering electricity, heating, etc. The methane gas (CH4) when burned would create a small amount of Carbon Dioxide that is 20 time LESS harmful as a greenhouse gas and if in larger plants that burn methane gas collected the CO2 from the burned methane there would be zero greenhouse emissions left to create more greenhouse effects. Methane is used in automobiles, ovens and water heater as a fuel, generation of electricity, rocket fuel in its refined liquid form, antifreeze ingredient in industries, a common ingredient in fertilizer, and to sanitize products. Figure 4: Home biodigester The rate of sea level rise has also increased over time. Between 1900 and 1990 studies show that sea levels rose between 1.2 millimeters and 1.7 millimeters per year on average. By 2016 it is estimated at 3.4 millimeters per year therefore it is possible to extract seawater to aid in the recovery of drought and arid regions. Countries around the world could build desalination plants using methane gas and solar energy to power plants and it is even possible to power the vehicles transporting the desalinated water with methane along with the fertilizer byproduct from biodigester plants to drought areas. As the sea levels have grown higher over the past decades and continue to rise it would not damage them to remove and use the extra water.  More studies on the viability of returning the seas to the healthiest salinity and Ph balance are needed and whether the salt and minerals in ocean water can safely be extracted and returned to recreate balance. The extracted water can be used to aid in cooling the atmosphere by providing much needed water to drought areas and stop further desertification of these areas. More oxygen-producing plants and less desertification would aid in cooling the planet including the polar regions which would aid in reducing the extreme ocean events occurring. Planting trees that survive well in hot dry climates would provide cooling shade for other plants and both would draw more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere replacing it with oxygen through photosynthesis. It has been proven that the more oxygen producing plants and trees in an area the more oxygen will be released through photosynthesis providing the additional moisture to the air and creating more precipitation. Once the plant life and trees are established will add oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Theoretically, if drought stricken and even arid desert regions receive desalinated seawater and fertilization effect of biogas plants along with the addition of liquid clay to hold moisture in the soil,  green areas, once established will encourage more natural precipitation to occur. The more drought and desert areas turned to green zones the more they will also add to the cooling effect of the entire planet as well. This is part of the holistic approach mankind must take to combat climate change and the current devastating path to self-destruction our planet is on. Biodigesters that capture methane gas and as a byproduct create carbon-based fertilizer and bio plants can contribute a great deal to reducing global climate change as well as creating and keeping jobs here in Canada and abroad. For example, if in Nova Scotia instead of creating a pipeline to dump toxic pulp and paper waste into the ocean killing the marine life destroying the livelihoods of fishermen the pulp and paper plant had to close. A pipeline dumping this pulp and paper waste into the ocean which is already facing great stressors have climate change with temperatures risen dramatically in recent years driving fish further towards the North and South poles. In addition, the warmer ocean temperatures and pollution have cause Algae blooms.   Harmful algal blooms (HABs) and Cyanobacteria occur when colonies of algae grow out of control while producing toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. These harmful effects need to be rectified without further damage to benefit the earth and all its inhabitants. A pipeline would have led to even further disastrous impacts on fish stocks in the area. If instead, they had created a bio plant to break down the pulp and paper waste into methane gas and carbon slurry, which could be used as a fertilizer thereby creating additional jobs at the pulp and paper mill either maintaining the use of the methane produced which could be used the same way as natural gas for as many purposes from creating electricity, heating to powering vehicles they instead lost all the jobs at this company. The operation of the bio plant would have added more jobs as well. This was a blow to our economy that could have been avoided. If one compared the costs of building a pipeline a mile into the ocean compared to a bio plant the difference in cost was infinitesimal and the environmentally friendly method would make money in the long run especially when methane gas technology becomes more widely used and new innovations  are made for its use instead of allowing it to sit in our atmosphere causing damage for years before it is broken down. Figure 5: Diagram of the pipeline proposed to dump pulp and paper waste a mile into the ocean. A second example is the current practice of many communities dumping raw sewage into the St. Lawrence River in Quebec and elsewhere, which biodigester plants could turn into methane and the fertilizer for use as it is a byproduct of biodigesters. Canadian municipalities are dumping some 400 billion gallons of raw sewage. Quebec is the worst offender. Canadian municipalities are dumping an estimated 400 billion gallons of raw sewage every year It is quite a health hazard and simply dumping it currently into the St. Lawrence River and other bodies of water will have long term negative effects on the environment. Biodigester plants would be a perfect economical answer to turning 400 billion gallons of damaging waste into methane gas to heat homes, cook with or power electricity generators. Another example of the uses of captured carbon dioxide can be used to extract rare earth elements. In recent political and trade disputes with China (who provide most rare earth elements that are needed to make a huge variety of necessary products from medicines to missile guidance systems and almost every type of electronics. Cell phones, tv, computer components are all made from rare earth elements. The use of carbon capture technology can be used to create oxalic acid to create scrubbers to extract rare earth elements from existing electronics as well as from mines in a cost effective and far more environmentally friendly method than China currently uses. It would also reduce our dependency on China for them. Almost never talked about but none the less a huge contributor as a greenhouse gas as well as depleting the ozone layer is nitrous oxide (N20) Like other greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide absorbs radiation and traps heat in the atmosphere at a rate 300 times worse than the same amount of carbon dioxide and takes 114 years to dissipate according to the EPA. Nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere through nitrogen-based fertilizers onto the fields, through the breakdown of animal manure and combustion of fossil fuels. Approximately 79 percent of all nitrous oxide released in the United States came from nitrogen fertilization so switching to biodigester technology on farms and using the carbon slurry it produces as fertilizer instead of fertilizers while burning the methane as a fuel would reduce the amount of nitrous oxide released into the environment substantially. Biodigester technologies ability to make use of methane gas instead of fossil fuels for energy produced as well using the carbon slurry instead of nitrogen-based fertilizers would provide a far more environmentally safer solution. In conclusion, the hope of this article was to teach people how greenhouse gases affect the atmosphere and cause climate change and the possibility of reversing climate change by encouraging innovation for the capture of carbon dioxide and methane greenhouse gases and reusing and recycling them wherever possible and placing the remainder underground while reforesting and regreening drought and arid regions to cool down the earth will remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Paris Climate Agreement must be revised to include more development areas of recycling and using captured carbon dioxide, methane gas and other pollutants as raw materials instead of waste products in financially beneficial ways. For example race car have parts currently are made of lightweight polymers from captured carbon instead of metals; perhaps exploration could be made to use these polymers more widely in the automotive industry to use up the collected carbon dioxide to make it more desirable product. The possibilities are endless and the innovations we create a demand for will be result in using up greenhouse gases to reverse in climate change. It is up to mankind to begin to think outside the box. "
9,The empty house on Fernwood Street,social-issues," It was a cool sunny day and Doc bounced down the steps from the house in which he lived. He was going over to see his cousins who lived on Fernwood Street. It was about a 45-minute walk but he did not mind. He loved the cool brisk air. He would listen to the rustling leaves and the whispering wind and wonder how Marco Polo must of felt during his journeys. Part of his walk included walking through a tough neighborhood that did not like strangers. Doc felt no apprehension because the gang members knew Doc would fight and they usually left him alone, but every once in awhile he would have to throw hands. That was how people settled their disputes in that era. No guns or knifes, just bare fists, and you either had it or you didn’t As Doc was approaching Fernwood, he heard someone calling him. He looked around and saw that it was Marie. Marie was one of his cousin’s friends. She lived right across the alley in a big yellow house. Marie was always throwing hints at Doc, but him being young and dumb, thought the girl was playing. On this autumn morning, she hugged up close to him and told him that they should go down to the empty house. She kind of expected him to say no, but when he said Ok, she put her arms around him and gave Doc a sloppy wet kiss, tongue and all. When they got to the house, they went around back to get in. This was the era where the neighbors would tell your parents if you were up to no good, so we did not want to be seen going inside. She led Doc upstairs and into a room with a piano in it. Doc had a hard time imaging someone leaving a piano behind. With his limited skills he played her a tune. When he finished, she sat down next to him and asked him to promise to do whatever she asked of him without question. Doc’s suspect mind started turning and he was about to leave, but something told him to stay. When he told her that he promised, she locked the door and whispered for him to come to her. Doc kept his promise and did all that was asked of him. Doc and Marie became good friends, not boyfriend and girlfriend, but friends with an occasional touching of tongues. That spring a family purchased that empty house, fixed it up and moved in. One day that summer, Doc and his cousins were playing stick ball in the alley. Alley stick ball was brutal, and the girls would inflict much more pain than the boys. When the game was over, Marie asked Doc to walk with her. They stopped in back of the once empty house and just looked at it, remembering. That would be the last time Doc would see that house for nearly 45 years. He was suffering emotional and mental abuse from his Aunt and her husband. The adults in the family, in including his dad, would do nothing a bout it. He ran away late that summer and did not return for over forty years.. When Doc did return to the city of Toledo. He found it run down, dirty and gray. Factories were closed, homes were either torn down, empty or in a state of disrepair. He discovered that many of his childhood friends were strung out, in prison or dead. He began to wonder why he even made the trip. Doc went to see his brother and asked him why hadn’t tried finding him for all those years. When his brother replied that he thought Doc was living with his mother, Doc knew it was time to leave. His brother knew exactly where Doc’s mother lived. The last day of his visit Doc drove over to Fernwood to visit a cousin who was still living in the family home. When he parked in front of his cousin’s house, he wondered if Marie was still living across the alley. He thought to himself that if she didn’t, maybe someone could give him an address or phone number. Doc got out of the car and walked along the side of the house, through the backyard and across the alley. He knocked on the door and a young boy answered. Doc looked down at the boy and asked him was Marie home. The boy invited Doc in and yelled for Grandma. A handsome lady with greying hair walked out of the kitchen and stopped when she saw Doc standing there. Doc recognized her right away but was not certain that she knew who he was. He was wrong because she began to cry, walked over to him, put her arms around him, and laid her head on his shoulder. If two people were ever happy to see one another, it would be those two. After they had visited for a couple of hours, Doc told her that he had to catch a flight in the morning and maybe it was time for him to get going. Marie made him stay for supper. After cleaning the table and doing the dishes, they sat on the sofa, had a couple of drinks, a bit of weed, and listened to some music. Marie leaned over to Doc and asked him if he was still willing to do what she asked. He looked at her, smiled, and said that he had some things to ask her to do. They both laughed. They talked well into the night and somehow had fallen asleep together. Doc woke up at 5 am, and he had a 9 am flight. Doc did not want to wake Marie. He wrote her a note in which he thanked her for a wonderful evening, and if they did not see each other again, that she would bring a smile to his face every time he thought of her. On the flight back across the Pacific, Doc wondered if he had made a mistake by leaving home at 13. He had lived the life he wanted, but at what cost. Lost friendships, could have been relationships, family estrangement. Then he thought about all that he had seen and done and came to the conclusion that he had done exactly what he was supposed to do."
10,The  Economic Democracy Act: FAQ's Updated,social-issues," Where does this $4 Trillion Dollars come from? According to a recent Federal Reserve estimate, $4 Trillion is, on average, the total amount of new productive capital and infrastructure added to the US economy each year. The real question is, how will that new capital be financed? If the wealthy use their “past savings” to pay for the new capital, they will own and control it. If the government uses tax dollars or goes further into debt to pay for the new capital, the government will own and control it. The EDA enables “we the people” (meaning every individual citizen) to have equal access to the means (money and credit) needed to pay for and own the new capital that will produce the new goods and services that we consume. The EDA empowers everyone - NOT just the few - to participate in the ownership side of the economy. SO EVERYONE CAN GENERATE INCOME FROM THE CAPITAL THEY OWN. Won’t the EDA be inflationary? No, it won’t. Inflation occurs when you have “too many dollars chasing too few (or the existing amount of) goods and services.” The EDA creates no new money for consumer purposes or government debt (as is now the case). The new money and credit that would be created by the central bank (Federal Reserve System) and commercial banks would always be backed by insurance as well as the new assets needed by businesses to produce and sell new goods and services. Isn’t the EDA socialistic? No, it’s not. Socialism aims to dilute private property rights (individual ownership), particularly in income-producing wealth. Under Socialism, “everybody (or the government) owns, so nobody owns.” Capitalism concentrates private property rights in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. In contrast, the EDA is all about private ownership. But it systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/power by expanding ownership opportunity to include everyone. It would reform our basic institutions such as the money and tax systems to democratize our free market economy. In the process it UNDERWRITES POLITICAL DEMOCRACY while taking nothing away from today’s “haves” except their virtual monopoly over future capital ownership and economic power. Won’t the EDA increase my taxes? No it won’t — and if you and your family earn less than $30,000 per adult and $20,000 per dependent, you won’t pay any federal taxes. By covering all federal government costs under a single-rate income tax, the EDA would eliminate regressive federal taxes on employers and employees, as well as sales and consumption taxes that hurt the poor. It would impose no property taxes, which discourage the acquisition of assets. It would even change estate and gift taxes to encourage the wealthy to spread out their transferred wealth to many people. What the EDA will do over time is broaden the tax base — create tens of millions of NEW TAXPAYERS who will in turn help current taxpayers shoulder the tax burden. This will actually REDUCE taxes for most people who currently pay taxes. It even offers the potential of PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT. Let’s calculate. A family of 4 would receive $48,000 (4 X $12,000) of capital credit annually. And a family of 10 would receive $120,000 (10 X $12,000) of capital credit annually. Right? So, doesn’t the Economic Democracy Act effectively pay for a couple to have lots of kids in order to get lots of money? The short answer is that since the line of credit is non-transferable, and the new capital assets and capital incomes belong to the individual, parents do not directly benefit. (Parents however, would have decision-making power over the child’s investments, until the age of adulthood.) But more importantly, research shows that as income increases childbirth frequency decreases. So, on both counts, the EDA will not encourage overpopulation. How is the Economic Democracy Act different from Universal Basic Income? In terms of the income a citizen would receive, UBI is simple and relatively immediate. That’s its strength. It’s consumer oriented and is intended to remain relatively constant in size over time.  UBI may provide a SHORT-TERM boost in consumption incomes, but it requires INCOME REDISTRIBUTION and creates DEPENDENCE on government. It does nothing to enable most citizens to become economically independent owners of capital. In contrast the EDA requires a little time (5 to 7 years) before capital incomes are actually being generated by the assets that citizens acquire with their capital credit. The EDA is investment oriented, which means it enables every citizen to accumulate a growing stake of capital assets that will generate growing capital incomes throughout their lifetime. Rather than relying on more taxes and more government, the EDA provides a LONG-TERM solution that would grow a sustainable economy, limit the economic power of government, and foster an ever-growing base of ECONOMICALLY INDEPENDENT CITIZEN OWNERS. Is the Economic Democracy Act similar to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan/ESOP? Yes. But instead of covering just those who work for private sector corporations that choose to implement an ESOP, the Economic Democracy Act uses the same financing approach as the ESOP in order to COVER EVERYONE (regardless of age, gender, race, religion), most of whom lack the required means to participate in the ownership side of the American economy. Has the Economic Democracy Act been tested in a pilot project to see how it performs in real life? Yes and No. The basic mechanics of this strategy have been thoroughly tested in the roughly 8000 employee-owned companies and 11 million employee-owners that have been created over the past 50 years. As we said in the previous question, the EDA is really just an expansion of the of the ESOP strategy that aims to give all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in and to benefit from ownership of the new wealth being created in the American economy every year. However, it has yet to be formally tested in a national setting. What percentage is used in order to calculate an average ROI and payoff potential? Using very conservative estimates, we chose 15% as the PRE-TAX ROI. Historically, before the recent wild swings and grossly inflated share values of today, an AFTER-TAX ROI ran in the neighborhood of 9 to 12%. The payback period is calculated by dividing one by the rate of return and rounding up to the nearest integer. Thus 1/.15 = 6.666 (round it up to 7 years). How does Economic Democracy reduce wage slavery in the US? By giving everyone (as opposed to a few) legitimate access to the capital ownership side of the US economy (where almost all the new wealth is generated) and creating capital incomes for everyone, Economic Democracy promotes financial independence and economic empowerment. It reduces the need for anyone to sell most of the waking hours of their lives to an employer in exchange for a pay check. How will the EDA impact the bust/boom character of America’s economy? The EDA would gradually eliminate the imbalances in supply (production) and demand (consumption) in the economy, worsened by unsound monetary and tax policies, which are responsible for the bust/boom dilemma and that create the widening gap in wealth, income and power between a tiny fraction of the population and the majority of citizens. Does the EDA appeal mostly to conservatives or mostly to liberals? To be honest this is a strategy that appeals to BOTH SIDES of the aisle. It appeals to the fiscally conservative Republican who wants to rein in spending and live within our means. It also appeals to the liberal Democrat who wants a level playing field where everyone has an equal opportunity to prosper. And since it systematically promotes independence from the government (i.e. freedom), the only people who disapprove of the EDA are autocrats who want to control “we the people.” Why would the mainstream media fail to inform “we the people” about such a revolutionary economic strategy? Quite simply, the entire mainstream media (including FOX, CNN and MSNBC) is owned and controlled by the one percent. And the one percent prefers to keep “we the people” under control and in the dark about revolutionary ideas that threaten to undermine their concentrated wealthy/power. We’re allowed to see and hear what media owners allow us to see and hear. In other words, America’s mainstream media delivers little more than profitable propaganda that, in the long run, supports concentrated wealth/power. Why doesn’t academia introduce this strategy to all their future economists? To be honest, most economists have never been introduced to the ideas behind the Economic Democracy Act. They can’t teach what they don’t know. On the other hand, in the 21st century, academia is largely dependent on corporate funding (i.e. the one percent) for their existence. So even if they are familiar with the paradigm underpinning the Economic Democracy Act, academicians can ill afford to introduce this revolutionary strategy to future economists without challenging the basis of their own credentials. Bureaucrats (conventionalists) hardly ever rock the boat. Who’s the primary proponent of the Economic Democracy Act? That would be the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ.ORG), headquartered in Arlington, VA. More information on the Economic Democracy Act is available at www.cesj.org. What are the three big questions that the CESJ wants to ask about any legislation that gets run through Congress? Who will own it? Who will control it? Who will pay for it? In the case of the EDA, every individual person in the USA will be able to purchase, own and control their own wealth-producing assets. The EDA will connect every citizen to a now-untapped source of asset-backed money and insured capital loans that will be repaid by the future profits of new technologies and other capital assets added by well-managed businesses each year."
11,The lady from Amsterdam,social-issues," When the phone rang, Doc was watching football on the television. He almost let it ring as was his habit. He was pleasantly surprised to hear Eline’s voice when he answered. He and Eline had met some six months earlier while he was in the Netherlands for a Jazz Festival. When she had dropped Doc off at the airport for his return flight back to San Francisco, she had advised him that she had every intention of visiting him at his home. At the time he thought it was just talk and that nothing would ever materialize, but there she was on the phone asking for a ride from the airport. It was a very typical rainy and foggy San Francisco evening as Doc made his way south on the 101 towards the airport. His dogs had created a fuss when he left his home because they had been waiting for their evening walk. He thought to himself that the dogs would have to wait for their walk on this day. When Doc slowed his car near the KLM terminal he saw Eline sitting on a suitcase waiting. His mind thought back to the time they had shared months earlier and they were exceedingly fond memories. As he pulled the car to the curb, their eyes met, without speaking they both knew they were happy to meet once again.. Doc did not trust anyone but he trusted her. He just knew instinctively that he could. The two of them actually liked each other and were friends. That is something that has become rare over the years. That trust however created a problem for Doc. He trusted no one but she had been able to get on the other side of that big wall he had. This was a problem because he did not want the wall to come down, and he did not want to care about anyone. or have them care about him. She was getting too close and he was feeling things that he did not want to feel. He knew that he had to walk away. There were a lot of reasons why Doc was the way he was. As a boy he had endured a house of horrors. He lived in a house where the monsters were people who were supposed to love and care about him. What he experienced was the exact opposite and as a result he let no human get close to him. He lived on the street for a couple of years and it taught him to trust no one, not even one’s family. As a young Marine, he saw and did things that made him realize just how vile and ruthless humans can be. His view of humans was not in anyway complementary. If one can understand how his experiences shaped him, then one might understand why he was the way he was. Doc purchased her a ticket back to Amsterdam and told her that it was not going to work out. Doc walked away without giving her much of an explanation. Years later Doc realized he had made a very bad mistake. He missed her and that which he was feeling towards her never went away. It was torture to know that he walked away from the one person who actually understood and cared about him. Ten years later, Doc went to Amsterdam to look for her. He found her living in a village in France. She was happy to see him but the damage had been done, and there was no fixing it. Doc went back home with the realization that he would never see her again. It is said that time heals all. Maybe it does. Doc however would have a lasting scar that he would never be able to erase."
12,We are teaching and saying…become your own business: Dr. Marcia Ann Coppertino,social-issues," #BlackWomen; #RacialDiversity; #CAACG; #ImportanceOfEducation; #SelfRealization; #DivinePurpose; #UnitedStatesOfAmerica Los Angeles (California)/Canadian-Media: Dr. Marcia Ann Mims Coppertino, Founder and CEO of the Coppertino and Associates Consulting Group (CAACG) had a chance to discuss with Asha Bajaj by email the future of Black Women in America and various contributions of CAACG to their cause. Following is the excerpt of the interview: Asha to Marcia: What hope is there for American black women especially those in underserved communities and those with little or no education and are refused help from educated women? Marcia: There is very little hope for women in rural areas and other areas of America where traditionally black women are poor, toothless, saddled with several children, teens, uneducated, and uncared for. They and their children have a tendency to be raised by women of the same caliber who have never attended high school or college. Part of the problem is that many black women who have the luck and assistance to leave areas where they get the chance to attend college, meet and marry men who can better support them and their needs, and who want to advance economically as a couple while their childhood friends are left behind. ""These women seldom if ever look back to help others out of the depths of misery and they do not practice the Harriet Tubman way of life. She helped hundreds if not thousands through an underground railroad rather than run off to her own new way of life. She could not lay in the hay and horse barn hearing the screams of sadness from those left behind in slavery. Already you see scores of educated black women who boast and brag about how they made it over but how many stories do you see, modern stories of those stepping outside their walls or education bowing down to help others. Instead, they choose to sit in 20-story office buildings drawing a big paycheck, dining in expensive restaurants after work not looking back to help other crying and dying for love, support, and health-related education in the wilderness of life."" Asha: One of the major problems is that most black women are leading single-mother households and are always struggling to make both ends meet. What help does your organization provide them? Marcia: Our organization offers not only clothes and food and shoes, we offer counseling, beds in new friends households, mentorship not for a bowl of soup but for life. We come to cherish and stand in the back of and in front of women devastated by domestic violence, lack of education, and a household of principles for right living and how to honor and love other human beings. No lip service or promises here…the ladies are comforted and encouraged to move on with a new look on life and a purpose that can not lose to sex, bad choices in men, and from families that may not have loved and cared for them in the manner that they should have. Asha: How can you and your organization help change the history of many wealthy Black men who prefer to marry Mexican women who may at times pose as Italian women and white women who have children with mixed blond red hair, and who shun full black children. What is your organization doing to preserve the identity of the Black Women in America in the light of this family-related information? Marcia: This is a hard job because consciously and subconsciously black men have always envied, feared, and hated the white man. Therefore a chance of having a white woman on their arm has meant a feeling of worth, power, and acclaim for them as black men. The rich and wealthy black men also hold out for esteem and equalization with white men by having the white woman as his wife. Take a look at most of the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and other related sports teams. Most of what you see on their arms are Mexican, Latina, white and other races of women. ""Many black women are usually out the door mistresses or high price call girls only used for a day or two. They do not become their treasured wives. So sad. Our organization has monthly meetings, weekly conversations and to help address the real black woman within with a focus that no matter where you came from in life, the destination through love leads the way to healthy self-esteem and confidence to stand and know whatever you look like and whatever you do not have…hey hey hey…the buck stops here! You were created to look like you look, smell like you smell, and move like you move and it is really alright!"" The focus of a black race with black men are and is compromised when most of all the TV commercials now are showing black men with white women and orange and blonde mixed children. Follow the streets to their doors and see who opens the doors. Black women are just about killing themselves trying to wear long wigs, lots of makeup, long eyelashes not their own, and working out till they almost drop dead to capture the attention of the black man and any man for that matter that slaver has unearthed within. The fact that over 30 million abortions since 1973 bear this out within the last 5 years. Do not run to the history books but google the stats. No one seems to want a future for blacks. Asha: Please elaborate on a few steps you are taking to remove one of the major and unjust existing problems faced by dark-skinned black women who are refused to be employed by their would-be employers. Marcia: We are teaching and saying…become your own business. Create anything of worth and make it your own. Stop begging and crying for a 9–5 job knowing that at the end of the cycle or day, you have lost a generation behind you. I am so tired of so-called professional women standing smiling with a cap and gown on and then when they go home….no food on the table, kids have gone wherever, no one to help them with homework or love work, and then want to show up at the jails and prisons faking a cry. They need to look at the real cause of all of the wholesale crimes committed by children, teens, and young adults. ""Gone all day for the sake of a dollar and to bring the paycheck home to men addicted to themselves and the home left in crumbles. You never hear the stats on latchkey kids or abused kids. No mother in the home. That smile most share is wiped off their faces at the cemeteries and graveyards the youth lay in."" Asha: What are your thoughts on improving the plight of the present black unemployed women who are always left low on the economic ladder because the men are reluctant to spend their finances on them. Marcia: The women that have been employed are told, shown, and encouraged to get back into the streets where most have come from and help educate other women, help others crying, and to stop being backbiters behind a grin with jealousy of each other. This trait is seen very commonly among the black race. You see it in the clicks they are raised up and in the envy of other black women that keeps them apart from helping each other. ""Look at the Mexican women and how they help keep other kids during the day so the ablest can get ahead. Look at the Chinese and Asians who live for the sake of others in their race and then look at the black women standing in the beauty shops and clothing stores hollering at their kids to shut up."" Asha: How can the plight of black women improve when most black men do not want their women staying home to raise their children and instead want them in the workforce slaving with or behind them? These black women often suffer from physical and mental breakdowns in their struggles to juggle between their work and their families. Marcia: Right now in the eyes of more affluent black women they do not give a damn what the black man has to say. They say I got money in the bank, this house is mine, that car outside is mine and in my name and whatever I want I can buy. So in essence the black man no longer has power over the black woman like 50, 75 years ago. The Black man has lost respect as head of the house when the black woman went to work, and when he found out she really did no longer need him to feed and house the family. That was his key role for uneducated black women who were walking up and down the roads with 6–7–8–9 kids following her. No more! Abortion rights, money in her brassiere, and a plethora of choices now are at hand to do what she no longer needed a black man to do for her. Asha: Elaborate a few ways to improve the existing trend of most black men chasing entertainment and sports careers and no longer want a traditional marriage leaving the black woman behind to fend for herself and the children in the world. Marcia: The black man is no longer interested. He could care less. Money has become his God and fame his crown. Many black men are in and out of the closet of revolving lifestyles therefore traditional family burdens are a phantom of the past. The black man has new freedoms he also did not have and now he is the handmaids' tool of the entertainment world rolling in billions. He is a willing puppet and subject drunk and doped on power and fame. The only problem with this is the fact that he has not conquered his limited life span so oh well. Asha: Once black men get a real black woman, is it true he works behind the scenes to encourage her to look and act like a white woman, and behave like a white woman. It is a blemish to the identity of black women. How can this be improved? Marcia: It can only be improved if Mama gets to pull that headscarf off and the blue wig and read him his rights. He does not have her fooled. She knew what she got. Call the man out and then put him out. Mama always said…keep a dime in your purse for a phone call. Call him out and put him out. Asha: Some say there is no future for a black woman if she is a half-black woman. Can you suggest a few ways in which this belief, which is a curse to the identity of women, can be eradicated? Marcia: Well in some instances there is a future for half-black women. They have got to be encouraged and trained to choose which side of life they will work on and live on and be held accountable to accept their positions. All women can arrive at high points in self-satisfaction all the while remembering if they have a womb, that makes them special for a special calling on their lives. ""They need to accept their divine purpose and not an insane purpose and honor their selection. We all have a cross to bear and that means standing up for what we as women were meant and desired to be."" Asha: Lastly the expectation that black women should be the next superhero leaves behind the black women to a bleak future due to lack of opportunities for their training. Suggest a few ways in which these black and dark-skinned women can be trained to form their own black salute. Marcia: No matter what fake news or phony textbooks may say and teach, there is only one superpower in the universe. Psalm 83:18. Men and women need to recognize that they were not created to be superpowers with a limited life span of 70–80 years. What kind of superpower is that? One who has no power in his own being to live forever but who has to lay down and die at an appointed time he did not select? ""The black, white, yellow, and brown, and all in between will only have a future on earth and in the skies above if he truly recognizes a higher power and a glorious power made and created in his image. That is the real future for all of us."""
13,Black Girls in Crisis...What Ma'Khia Bryant's Death Reveals,social-issues," As the country collectively gasped in horror at the on-camera killing of Ma'Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old Columbus, Ohio teenager who was gunned down by Officer Nicholas Rearden during a knife attack, one prevailing narrative has emerged that focuses on the actions of the officer.  Though the officer’s actions are worthy of discussion, I feel there are four indicators that reveal Black girls are in crisis. Ma’Khia, by all accounts was described as a loving and beautiful soul, yet her home life and demise are becoming an all-too-familiar end for Black girls.  As details about her life slowly emerge, it has been revealed that Ma’Khia was not living with her parents, but instead she and her little sister were living in a foster home that housed 10 people.  Reportedly, she had only been in the home for six months but she and her sister had been in foster care since 2018. This troubling revelation leads me to the first indicator that confirms Black girls are in crisis. Sign of Crisis #1:  More and more Black girls live in an unstable home environment. According to the National Women’s Law Center, Black girls are 22.9 percent of the girls in foster care, but are the largest group, or 35.6 percent, of girls who experience 10 or more residential placements.  Living in an unstable household can lead to depression, increased stress, social anxiety, uncontrollable emotional responses, and difficulty in relationships according to Psychology Today. More troubling is the increasing number of Black girls who are homeless, accounting for 39.8% of the homeless population.  This growing instability is causing young African American girls to have to live in unfamiliar surroundings with people they do not know.  We can see the strain of such a living arrangement on Ma’Khia’s as she repeatedly complained of being bullied while in foster care. Sign of Crisis #2:  At-risk Black girls are being raised by parents in crisis. Sadly, in 2019 4.15 million or 64% of black children in the United States were being raised in a single-parent household.  Beyond the increased stressors of financial responsibility and decreased sleep parents face, children of single parents who do not have a good support system experience lower grades, anxiety, and are emotional unstable.  As the single parent works their hardest to fulfill the needs of their children, often the absent parent is emotionally and financially unavailable. Beyond being single, some parents are faced with dealing with men with multiple children by other women, being financial unstable, drug use and abuse, and a lack of motivation to escape their current situation. Though Ma'Kiah's parents have had since 2018 to complete whatever the state demanded for them to get their kids back, they had not. Sign of Crisis #3:  Black girls experience violence too often. Violence in the homes of Black girls is prevalent as 41.2% of Black women experience intimate partner violence according to the Women’s Policy Research Institute.  The feelings of anger, embarrassment, and helpless are only compounded when they are in public as 33.2 percent of black girls report being in a physical alteration away from home according to a 2017 report by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. From television to music, society is repeatedly teaching girls violence is the first option versus the last.  The result has been a generation of youth who have no anger-management skills, and a complete disrespect for personal boundaries. Sign of Crisis #4: Dealt with more punitively than other races. Black girls are dealt with more harshly than any of their counterparts.  In fact, The African American Policy Reform and Columbia Law School Center for Intersectionality and Social Studies report nationally Black girls are six times more likely to get out-of-school suspension.  These suspensions are often the result of minor offenses like dress code and/or cell phone violations. The punitive treatment of Black girls is not reserved for high schoolers either.  According to a report by the Education Trust of New York in New York City, Black girls in elementary and middle school were about 11 times more likely to be suspended than their counterparts of other races.  Often Black girls face excessive punishment and have trouble throughout school once they have gotten into trouble. Sadly, this hostility toward Black girls makes them guarded and causes them to experience panic attacks, have difficulty socializing, and sets up a distain toward authority. Because girls are already dealing with mental, physical, and emotional changes as they mature, the antagonistic way in which others deal with them causes even more stress.  Teenagers are not equipped with critical thinking skills until the front part of their brain develops fully; therefore, girls who are harassed daily often respond out of the emotional center of their brain. Though all teens experience this lack of maturity, when Black girls respond to situations out of frustration she risks being suspended, attacked or in the case of Ma'Khia Bryant, death. These factors are warning signs that should stir our community to not only address the issue of policing, but to also do the hard work of looking inside and vehemently pursuing solutions that will address the factors that led to Ma'Khia's death."
14,Socialism and Capitalism VS Concentrated Wealth/Power,social-issues," Voters on the liberal side of the aisle genuinely despise the fact that our so-called free market, capitalist economy has resulted in so much wealth/power being concentrated in the hands of so few at the expense of so many. They contend that you can’t have a political democracy when 1% of the population owns and controls the Senate, the House, the Presidency, State Legislatures, as well as the mainstream media, whether on the left or the right. That’s not a democracy. It’s an oligarchy, a plutocracy, a government of the people, by the wealthy and for the wealthy! On the other side of the aisle, voters on the conservative side genuinely despise government at almost every level. Their candidates run for office with the explicit goal of reducing the size and scope of government. In their eyes, the bigger the government, the more concentrated wealth there is in the hands of bureaucrats who are corrupt and taking advantage of the system in such a way that it undermines entrepreneurship and innovation in the private sector. In the words of a prominent conservative Grover Nordquist, “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” What I want to point out here is that BOTH SIDES TALK AS IF they genuinely despise concentrated wealth/power. The problem is that NIETHER of their so-called solutions actually counteracts the concentrated wealth/power that both claim to despise. The choice we’re offered is concentrated wealth/power in the hands of the 1%, or in the hands of government bureaucrats. And when the government is owned and controlled by the 1%, they win either way. The 21st Century Solution to the 20th Century Dilemma In that light allow me to introduce you to a piece of legislation known as the Economic Democracy Act. The EDA offers voters a FREE-MARKET STRATEGY that’s specifically designed to grant everyone (as in we the people instead of just the few) access to the ownership side of America’s economy which is where most of our nation’s new wealth is being generated. Over time, implementation of this strategy systematically COUNTERACTS the possibility of concentrated wealth/power being developed anywhere. In other words, it creates an economy in which a government of the people, by the people, and for the people is actually possible. Before digging into the specifics, I want to mention that an edition of the EDA has recently been introduced to the Missouri State Senate by State Senator Karla May (Senate Bill #460) where it received warm-reviews FROM BOTH SIDES. Can you imagine a piece of economics related legislation that both sides actually like? It’s also scheduled to be voted on soon and is expected to pass. Now let’s have a look at the Economic Democracy Act in more detail. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were a year ago before the virus began. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the capital credit loan to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream residual of income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Make it much easier to police to do their jobs, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help democratize our free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And yes, pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented immediately, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying out dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Talk about a win/win! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (probably a full decade) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
15,Do Single Moms Have the Right to Pursue New Love?,social-issues," Single moms always have the fear of experiencing the same torture and nightmares all over again in marriage. But this does not mean they do not have the right to rearrange their life. If you have been staying single for a long, then it is time to find someone who will fill your life with happiness.

Once you let the right person enter your life, things will become easy. Therefore, just like everyone else, single mothers should pursue love. After all, love is a good reason to make your life beautiful and worth enjoying."
16,America’s Policing Problems Systematically Reduced,social-issues," I’m a lover of profound quotes. And, one of my favorites is “Poverty is the parent of crime and revolution.” That one came from Aristotle all the way back in ancient Athens. But it’s every bit as true and profound today as it was back in 350 BC. In that light, I suggest that the solution to 90% of America’s policing problems is to address and resolve the ongoing problem of POVERTY IN AMERICA. But instead of a conventional, top down, socialistic solution, I suggest an unconventional, bottom up, free market solution designed to systematically diffuse, spread, deconcentrate, disperse, dilute, and otherwise democratize the ownership of wealth producing capital assets in such a way that it counteracts the possibility of concentrated wealth in the hands of so few at the expense of so many. In doing so, the crime rate will be naturally reduced and police will find neighborhoods to be much friendlier places with dramatically less crime and dramatically fewer economically stressed-out people who do things they otherwise would not do (i.e. join gangs, sell drugs, shoot people) if they weren’t living their lives and struggling under the whip of economic necessity. That said, check out the only long-term solution to the policing problems facing America today. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually.

17,Corruption in Kazakhstan,social-issues," Corruption in Kazakhstan is a big and important problem that poses the main threat to the country's national security, social and economic development, the well-being of society and the people, and affects the functioning of state authorities. At the end of 2014, Kazakhstan ranked 126th out of 175 countries in the world in terms of corruption perception according to Transparency International. In 2015-2016, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Kazakhstan registered over 4 thousand corruption crimes, of which more than 3 thousand were sent to court. Almost half of them are accounted for by the facts of bribery, a quarter - by abuse of office. Every fourth private company in Kazakhstan faces extortion of bribes from government agencies. This indicator exceeds the global average by 8.9%. This result was revealed in 2013 by the World Bank in the global Enterprise survey, which surveyed the owners and top managers of 600 Kazakhstani firms. At the end of 2019, Kazakhstan ranked 113th in the list of 180 countries and scored 34 points out of 100. And in 2018, Transparency International gave Kazakhstan 124th place (which was shared with several other countries) in terms of corruption, 38 points out of 100. Kazakhstan's overall score was then 31 out of 100 possible (while a score below 30 denotes ""rampant corruption""). Every second corruption crime in Kazakhstan is a bribe. The number of officials convicted for receiving illegal remuneration has doubled in the country over the past five years. Civil servants of different levels of government are caught taking bribes. The annual potential losses to the economy of Kazakhstan due to corruption are estimated at $ 3.8 billion. This is reported in the first national report of the Anti-Corruption Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Corruption scandals involving high-ranking officials in Kazakhstan happen all the time. Loud arrests in the country are no longer surprising. Members of the government and heads of national companies are prosecuted for bribes. Every fourth private company in Kazakhstan faces extortion of bribes from government agencies. This indicator exceeds the global average by 8.9%. This result was revealed in 2013 by the World Bank in the global Enterprise survey, which surveyed the owners and top managers of 600 Kazakhstani firms. Since the beginning of 2020, 993 cases of bribery have been registered in Kazakhstan. This is 11.4% more than in the same period in 2019. Of these, 555 cases were related to receiving a bribe, 404 cases were related to giving a bribe, 34 cases were related to mediation. In August 2020, the President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, decided to ban parole from prison for corrupt officials. He instructed to do this at the legislative level. History In the period of the 14-15th centuries in the Kazakh feudal society, responsibility for corruption was not envisaged in what form we perceive it today. Before the accession of Kazakhstan to Russia, corruption manifested itself in legitimate institutional forms, when gifts to representatives of the nobility were like a compulsory feudal duty. So, from ordinary farmers in favor of khans, sultans, biys (kazakh aristocracy), and other representatives of the clan nobility, a tenth of the harvest was regularly levied ushur tax. In addition, there were all kinds of gifts for the nobility and aksakals (the leader of a village). Since the beginning of the 16th century, the laws of Khan Kasym, the so-called “Kasym Pillar Road”, were in force in Kazakhstan, which was based on the norms of customary law. The norms of the customary law of the Kazakhs were finally codified and supplemented at the end of the 16th century under Khan Tauk in the form of a single set called “Seven Institutions”. Decentralization of power and the absence of a unified state bureaucratic apparatus, the exercise of state administration by the bodies of feudal clan power in the aggregate excluded the possibility, at least formally, of the emergence in Kazakh law of norms providing for liability for bribery, abuse of position, etc., that is, for corruption. Kazakhstan as a part of the Russian Empire The next stage in the formation of the legal system in Kazakhstan, which objectively influenced the change in the socio-legal essence of corruption, starts counting from the period of the approval of the Russian colonial policy and the expansion of the borders of the empire. During the reign of Catherine II, the sanctions for bribery were not as severe as under Peter I, although the prevalence of corruption in the government at that time was also great. The Empress paid more attention not to toughening sanctions for committing mercenary abuses in the service but to ensure the principle of inevitability of punishment for their commission. In 1845, the Code on criminal and executive punishments was adopted, which amended and substantially supplemented the legislation on liability for bribery and other forms of corruption, and introduced new norms. For the receipt by an official of state authorities and management, not provided for by law, remuneration associated with a violation of duties in service, he was subject to liability under Art. 402 Code. For this act, the punishment was imprisonment for a term of one to three years or cutting with rods from 70 to 80 blows and return to prison companies for a term of two to five years. In the presence of mitigating circumstances and active repentance, mild punishments were also applied in the form of a severe reprimand or release from office. Thus, corruption is the most widespread phenomenon during the period of large-scale state reforms, we actually have it now, however, it is impossible to eradicate or minimize this phenomenon by punitive measures alone, as they tried to do in the Russian Empire. In modern Kazakhstan In the new Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated July 3, 2014, crimes committed by officials are enshrined in Chapter 15 ""Corruption and other criminal offenses against the interests of public service and public administration."" The starting point in the process of creating a system for combating corruption and preventing corruption offenses in Kazakhstan should be considered October 21, 1997, when the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev issued the Decree ""On the Supreme Disciplinary Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan."" An exceptional role in strengthening the fight against corruption was played by the Decree of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan ""On measures to strengthen the fight against corruption, strengthening discipline and order in the activities of state bodies and officials"" dated April 14, 2005, by which disciplinary Councils of the Agency for Civil Service Affairs, funded from the republican budget. The main goals of the Supreme Disciplinary Council were to strengthen state discipline, increase the responsibility of civil servants, and prevent them from abuse of power and official position. From the first days of its work, the council concluded that corruption poses a particular danger in those areas on which the daily life of Kazakhstanis depends - health care, education, housing, and communal services, lower levels of government bodies since it is the bureaucratic apparatus of these institutions with their actions or inaction undermines the authority of the state in the eyes of the people. Today, to one degree or another in the Republic of Kazakhstan, there is and is developing legislation relating to the fight against corruption, which includes directly the anti-corruption law, various anti-corruption state programs, criminal liability for corruption crimes is provided. Already at the present stage, the foundations of anti-corruption policy have been laid. Cases ""EXPO-2017"" case In total, 24 people were involved in the high-profile case of embezzlement of budget funds allocated to the national company “Astana Expo-2017”, three of which were managers of the company. The former chairman of the board of the company Talgat Ermegiyayev, the former head of the company's construction department Kazhymurat Usenov and the former managing director of the construction company Sulambek Barkinkhoev. All three were expelled from their posts and arrested in June 2015. According to the investigation, Talgat Ermeguiyayev, in collusion with a group of persons, by embezzlement of budgetary funds, stole a large amount of money, cashing it through a false entrepreneur. The actions of Talgat Ermegiyayev, Kazhumurat Usenov, and Sulambek Barkinkhoev were qualified by the investigation as “appropriation and waste of entrusted other people's property on an especially large scale”. In total, about 10.2 billion tenge (approx. 24 million dollars) was stolen, of which 4.2 billion tenge (approx. 9 million dollars) was appropriated by Talgat Ermegiyayev alone in the form of illegal remuneration - and this is not counting the cost of cars and real estate bought by the former head of the company with budget money. In June 2016, a high-profile corruption trial in the capital of Kazakhstan ended. All suspects were convicted. The main defendant in the case of embezzlement in the national company “Astana EXPO-2017”, Talgat Ermegiyayev, was sentenced to fourteen years in prison with confiscation of property, life deprivation of the right to hold leading positions in government agencies and commercial organizations. Former construction director of the company Sulambek Barkinkhoev was found guilty of embezzlement of entrusted property of others and sentenced to seven years in prison. Two former deputy chairmen of ""Astana EXPO-2017"" were sentenced under the same article. The court also found the deputy chairman of the board of the company Alisher Pirmetov guilty of embezzlement of the entrusted property of others and sentenced him to five years in prison. Another deputy chairman of the board of the national company, Murat Omarov, was sentenced to eight years in prison under the same article. Also convicted in this case: Ayan Adambaev. He was sentenced to seven years in prison with confiscation of property; Ural Ibadildina. She was also sentenced to seven years of restriction of freedom with confiscation of property; Shokhan Mataibekov. He was sentenced to five years of restriction of freedom; Kuanysh Medeuov. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with confiscation of property; Valery Sin. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with confiscation of property and life imprisonment from office in state bodies; Madina Davletbaeva. She was sentenced to four years in prison with confiscation of property (the court suspended her sentence up to five years); Azamat Tumatayev. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property. The court hearing on this case began in March 2016 in Nur-Sultan. The court sentenced Kazhymurat Usenov to two years in prison in a general regime colony. The case against 12 defendants, in this case, was separated into another proceeding in connection with their “admission of guilt” and the conclusion of a procedural agreement with prosecutors. Serik Akhmetov's case The former prime minister and former defense minister Serik Akhmetov have been accused of corruption. The case was considered by the specialized inter-district criminal court in the Karaganda region. The former akim of the Karaganda region Baurzhan Abdishev and the former akim of Karaganda Meiram Smagulov, as well as other former employees of the akimat of the Karaganda region and the city of Karaganda, were also defendants in the case. Serik Akhmetov and several former leaders of the Karaganda region and the city of Karaganda were accused of abuse of office, embezzlement of budget funds, and illegal participation in business activities. Serik Akhmetov is also accused of accepting a bribe on an especially large scale (over two million dollars). Earlier, Serik Akhmetov's lawyer Nikolai Lesnik said in comments to news agencies that his client denied the charges. Serik Akhmetov resigned on October 22, 2014, from the post of defense minister. Several weeks later he was detained and placed under house arrest. This happened after the detention of several former employees of the Akimat of Karaganda and the Karaganda region (Baurzhan Abdishev and Meiram Smagulov were taken into custody in the fall of 2014). Serik Akhmetov was kept under house arrest from November 2014 to February 18, 2015. Serik Akhmetov headed the government before he was appointed defense minister - he served as prime minister from September 2012 to April 2014. Former Prime Minister Serik Akhmetov was sentenced to 10 years in prison with confiscation of property and deprivation of the right to hold public office for five years. 21 people were accused of corruption, and they were former high-ranking officials and businessmen of the Karaganda region. Former akim of the Karaganda region, Baurzhan Abdishev, was sentenced to five years in prison with confiscation of property and deprivation of the right to hold public office for five years. Most of the defendants, except six people, denied the charges. Those defendants who admitted their guilt fully or partly also counted on an acquittal or at least on a punishment not connected with imprisonment. There were six of them. Four of them - Alzhan Akmoldaev, Gumar Rakhimzhanov, Duman Nurbaev, and Mukhtar Adambekov - agreed with all the accusations against them and declared their repentance. Many defendants in this high-profile case received real prison terms. Former akim of the city of Karaganda Meiram Smagulov and former deputy akim of the Karaganda region Gabit Mukhambetov were sentenced to three years in prison. The former head of the department of land relations of Karaganda, Yernar Daribekov, was sentenced to three years. Former director of the company ""Metallurgy and Metalworking"" Anatoly Essay was sentenced to seven years in prison. His former deputies Orazaly Aimenbetov and Bolatbek Iskakov were sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Former deputy akim of the city of Karaganda Aydar Telgarin was sentenced to four years in prison with confiscation of property. Former chairman of the board of “KazAgro”, Dulat Aitzhanov, was sentenced to three years in prison. Former manager of SEC “Saryarka”, Yerlan Kisykov, was sentenced to three years in prison. Former chairman of the board of “KazAgroFinance” Gumar Rakhimzhanov, former deputy general director of “Kazakhstan Industrial Corporation” Alzhan Akmoldaev, and businessman from Almaty, Duman Nurbayev confessed they were released from criminal liability. Sales manager in Central Asia of the Spanish company “RufepaTecnoagroSL” Kamilla Piralieva was sentenced to a fine of 4 million 600 thousand tenge (approx. 10 thousand dollars). In 2017, it was reported that Serik Akhmetov had his term reduced under an amnesty timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the country's independence. Serik Akhmetov in July 2016, according to official information, was transferred to ""lighter conditions for serving a sentence."" ""Ministry of Defense"" case In 2016, the military court of the Akmola garrison authorized the arrest of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Kazakhstan Bagdat Maykeev. A representative of the prosecutor's office said in court that Bagdat Maykeev, was hiding from the investigating authorities and the court, as well as ""was obstructing the investigation."" Bagdat Maykeev was suspected of receiving a large bribe. It was reported that he was detained by officers of the National Security Committee on February 9, 2014. General Bagdat Maykeev was sentenced in prison on charges of accepting a bribe on an, especially large scale. He denied the charges and was determined to appeal the verdict. On June 27, 2016, the specialized inter-district military court for criminal cases in the city of Almaty sentenced former Deputy Defense Minister General Bagdat Maikeev. He was sentenced to six years in prison on charges of illegal possession of weapons and of accepting a bribe totaling the equivalent of approximately one and a half million dollars. Each of the other three defendants in the case - entrepreneurs Pavel Titarenko, Altynbai Kairbekov, and Oleg Spitsin - was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of bribery. General Bagdat Maykeev denied in court that he had taken a bribe. He only confessed that he had illegally kept a pistol. The general and his lawyers asked the court to acquit him under the article on accepting a bribe. The 67-year-old General Bagdat Maykeev himself has repeatedly made anti-corruption calls. The last time, in October 2013, he called on the commanders to form an ""anti-corruption worldview,"" the legal culture of servicemen. Bagdat Maikeev made his career mainly in the ranks of the police and only after receiving the rank of general, he moved to the highest army circles, which rarely happens. In 2007, when he served as head of the Almaty regional department of internal affairs, he was involved in a corruption scandal. Then the charges did not find official confirmation. Bagdat Maykeev's career went up, and soon he was transferred to the army department. There he climbed the career ladder to the post of deputy minister of defense. Bagdat Maykeev became the fourth Defense Ministry general that was sentenced to prison on corruption charges. Earlier, the deputy commander-in-chief of the air defense forces, major-general Askar Buldeshev, the former head of the main armaments department of the Ministry of Defense, major-general Almaz Assenov, and the Deputy Minister of Defense, lieutenant-general Kazhimurat Maermanov, received long prison terms. Concerning all convicted generals, it was about depriving them of their highest military rank and state awards. The last time General Maikeev received a state award - the Order of Dank, second degree - in December 2013. Two months later, he was detained at his home in Nur-Sultan on suspicion of accepting a bribe on an, especially large scale. The release of the former Deputy Defense Minister Bagdat Maykeev became known six months after his release from prison. He was released due to illness. Such releases from prison are rare. From the content of this decision, it follows that soon after Maykeev was convoyed to the place of serving his sentence, he was sent to a prison hospital, the so-called sanitary town, on the territory of the strict regime colony OV-156/15 in the city of Semey, East Kazakhstan region. After some time, the prisoner Bagdat Maykeev filed a petition with the Semey court to be released from punishment due to illness. The refusal of the court dated December 30, 2014, Bagdat Maikeev and his lawyer Daniyar Kanafin appealed to the Court of Appeal of the East Kazakhstan region, which on February 4, 2015, decided to satisfy their complaint. In the complaint, they pointed out that the prisoner Maikeev had been suffering from an intractable, severe type of cancer for a long time and, to avoid the consequences of death, he needed highly qualified specialized medical care, the provision of which was impossible in conditions of serving a sentence in places of deprivation of liberty, as well as within Kazakhstan. As a result, the Court of Appeal of the East Kazakhstan region granted the petition of the convicted Bagdat Maykeev and ordered: “to release him due to illness”. Bagdat Maykeev was released by the decision of the Judicial Panel of Appeals for Criminal Cases of the East Kazakhstan Regional Court dated February 4, 2015, in connection with an illness (cancer). ""Ministry of Agriculture"" case In 2013, the former vice-minister of agriculture of Kazakhstan, Muslim Umiryaev, accused of corruption, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. According to the investigation and prosecution, Muslim Umiryaev twice received large bribes for lobbying the interests of a private entrepreneur in a tender for the purchase of the FMD vaccine. Muslim Umiryaev was deprived of the right to hold positions in the civil service and local self-government bodies for 7 years. The judge also ruled that the evidence -100 thousand dollars, which appeared in the case as a bribe, must be turned into state revenue. Muslim Umiryaev worked as vice minister of agriculture for two years. In January 2017, Muslim Umiryaev was released under amnesty. ""Ministry of Health"" case On September 21, 2010, the former Minister of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev, during a visiting collegium of the ministry in the North Kazakhstan region, arranged an unscheduled check on his subordinates and was dissatisfied with their knowledge. On the same day, the financial police opened a criminal case against the minister for abuse of office. On September 25, 2010, Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev was detained by employees of the financial police of Kazakhstan. Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev was accused of abuse of power and abuse of office, accepting bribes on an especially large scale, and embezzling budget funds. On August 5, 2011, he was sentenced to 7 years in a strict regime colony with confiscation of property. While in prison, Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev wrote a petition to the first president of the Republic of Kazakhstan with a petition for clemency. The appeal was supported. In January 2012, the decree of the first president of Kazakhstan was issued on pardoning Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev by reducing the sentence from 7 to 2 years. And after that, Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev filed a petition for parole. On February 29, 2012, the Nur-Sultan City Court ruled on parole from places of detention; On March 16, 2012, after the expiration of the time limit for filing appeals from the supervisory authorities, the former minister was released. On August 3, 2012, despite his previous convictions, the ex-minister was re-employed in the civil service, began to work as a research fellow at the National Scientific Medical Center - the head of the organ transplant center. Since 2013, Jaqsylyq Dosqaliev has been working as a head at the Republican Transplant Center. The case of the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund In 2017, it was announced that the investigation into the alleged embezzlement in the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UAPF) was completed. The arrest on suspicion of corruption of the former chairman of the fund Ruslan Erdenayev, deputy chairman Dabyr Medetbekov, former head of the risk department Musa Bakhtov and senior employees of two private mining companies became known at the beginning of the year. The prosecutor's office of the city of Almaty reports that, based on the results of the investigation, on October 18, 2017, a criminal case was sent to the specialized interdistrict criminal court of the city of Almaty on charges of embezzlement against Ruslan Erdenayev and Musa Bakhtov and other defendants in the case, including the founder of the “BuzgulAurum” company, Bakhytzhan Kenzhebaev. The former head of the fund Ruslan Erdenayev, according to the prosecutor's office, is also accused of taking a bribe, director of ""BuzgulAurum"" Azat Nayzagarin - of ""complicity in giving a bribe."" Talgas Turtaev, deputy director of “MegaTransAsia”, is accused of “mediating in bribery”. According to the investigation, the officials of the UAPF received a large bribe from the heads of the companies for concluding a deal on the acquisition of the “BuzgulAurum” bonds by the UAPF, as a result of which, as the investigation claims, the state suffered damage for 5 billion tenge (approx. 11 million dollars). According to the investigation, the Department of Risks for Investing in “BuzgulAurum” bonds previously recommended refraining from investing in “BuzgulAurum” bonds of the year “due to the presence of risks”. Mandatory pension contributions of working Kazakhstani people who have not reached retirement age flock to the UAPF. Investment audits of the fund's assets were launched on December 21, 2016. A court in Almaty found the former chairman of the Unified Accumulative Pension Fund (UAPF) Ruslan Erdenayev guilty of “embezzlement” and “bribe-taking” and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. The decision was announced on April 18, 2018. The court also banned Ruslan Erdenayev from working in the civil service for life. Deputy Chairman Dabyr Medetbekov was sentenced to 11 years in prison on similar charges. The same terms of imprisonment for these accused were requested by the prosecutor. The former head of the risk department, Musa Bakhtov, was found guilty of “complicity in theft”. The court sentenced him to eight years in prison with a ban on holding leadership positions in commercial organizations for 10 years. The founder of ""BuzgulAurum"" was found guilty of ""embezzlement"" and sentenced to eight years in prison with a ban on holding leading positions in commercial organizations for 10 years. The director of this company, Azat Nayzagarin, was sentenced to seven years in prison. The court found him guilty of “embezzlement” and “complicity in giving a bribe”. The director of the “MegaTransAsia” company Talgas Turtaev, charged with “complicity in bribery,” was released from the main sentence of imprisonment for one year after he was amnestied. Sayat Shayakhmetov's case In November 2013, the investigation of the criminal case was completed, and Sayat Shayakhmetov was charged with abuse of office during the construction of an educational institution. At the same time, the prosecution claims that the state suffered damage for 1.1 billion tenge (approx. 2.5 million dollars) allocated for the construction of a training center in Ust-Kamenogorsk. The general director of the “Directorate of Education and Science Objects under Construction of the Republic of Kazakhstan” Alexander Pak, the former general director of the “ZAK Service” company Roman Kireev and another former director of the same company, Alexei Tutubalin, were charged with embezzlement of budget funds. However, already in February 2014, the criminal case was sent for additional investigation. Sayat Shayakhmetov's lawyer Nurlan Beisekeyev informed about it. But he did not name the details and the reason why the prosecutor's office sent the case for additional investigation. The trial began on July 16, 2014, but already on July 21, the defendant Sayat Shayakhmetov asked for the trial to be open. And in September 2014, the case again, for an unspecified reason, was sent for additional investigation. Of course, at the request of the lawyers. In September 2015, the court case against Sayat Shayakhmetov was sent for a comprehensive additional examination, since then there has been no news. And only on March 15, 2017, the trial of Shayakhmetov was resumed. The proceedings lasted more than four years. On May 2, 2017, a court in Nur-Sultan sentenced former Deputy Minister of Education and Science Sayat Shayakhmetov to seven years in prison on charges of embezzlement. The same term was given to another person involved in this case - the former head of the directorate of facilities under construction, Alexander Pak. It was announced on May 20, 2013, that Sayat Shayakhmetov was under house arrest in connection with the investigation of the alleged waste of budget funds. General Dzhulamanov's case The former director of the border service of the National Security Committee, former lieutenant-general Nurlan Dzhulamanov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison on March 6, 2015, on charges of accepting bribes on an especially large scale, as well as creating and leading an organized criminal group. Another defendant in the case of ""General Dzhulamanov"", the former commander of military unit 2458, Kairat Balmagambetov, was found guilty of creating and leading an organized criminal group, as well as accepting a bribe on an, especially large scale. However, he was released from criminal liability under Article 65 of the Criminal Code on the so-called active repentance and assistance to the investigation. Unlike former General Nurlan Dzhulamanov, who was under arrest and held in a pre-trial detention center from the moment of his arrest, Kairat Balmagambetov was under house arrest. According to the prosecution, from the summer of 2013 to October 27, 2014, an organized group created and led by the former director of the border service of the National Security Committee, Nurlan Dzhulamanov, received more than 173 million tenge (approx. 401 thousand dollars) and 436 thousand dollars as bribes. Former lieutenant general Nurlan Dzhulamanov headed the border service of the National Security Committee for about 22 months and was arrested on October 27, 2014. Anti-corruption efforts Kazakhstan's history of the fight against corruption in the country can be conditionally divided into two main stages, which to one degree or another characterize the evolution of anti-corruption activities in Kazakhstan. The first stage considers the period from 1998 to 2015, when the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated July 2, 1998, No. 267-I ""On the fight against corruption"" was in force in the country. During this period of time, special attention was directed to measures to eliminate conditions conducive to the commission of everyday corruption, which citizens most often encounter when receiving public services at the local level. Most of all, Kazakhstanis faced the facts of corruption while obtaining various certificates and accelerating the receipt of public services in educational and medical institutions, as well as in law enforcement agencies. To prevent bribery among civil servants and eliminate human contacts, the country began to actively introduce the principles of ""one window"", where any citizen could get the service he needed in a matter of minutes. After the lapse of time, other types of public services were also transferred to the online format within the framework of the ""e-government"" program. With the beginning of the second stage (from 2015 to the present day), the basic principles and methods of combating corruption in Kazakhstan were revised, the main regulatory document of which was the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan dated November 18, 2015, No. 410-V ""On Combating Corruption"". The new law made it possible to move from a strategy of struggle, which inevitably leads to the domination of repressive methods and punitive measures, to a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the causes and conditions of corruption. The main object of confrontation remains everyday corruption among the population, but at the same time, a start was made to counteract business (business) corruption in Kazakhstan: facts of bribery, bribery, and kickbacks by officials at the time of public procurement. It should be noted that previously the functions of identifying, suppressing, and preventing corruption offenses were held accountable within their competence to the prosecutor's office, national security, internal affairs, state revenues, military police, anti-corruption service, border service of the National Security Committee. Whereas, with the entry into force of the new Law, a specialized authorized body, the anti-corruption service, was attributed to the main subject of anti-corruption. At present, the Anti-Corruption Agency (hereinafter the Agency), which is directly subordinate and accountable to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, deals with the facts of bribery. Subdivisions of the Agency - ANTIKOR - are represented in almost all regional centers of the country. Today, the key priorities of the Agency are such concepts as integrity, partnerships, and prevention. Such changes will have to contribute, firstly, to rid the state and society of the criminological aspect of corruption, and secondly, to the formation of an anti-corruption culture and the widespread involvement of citizens in combating corruption in the country. Corruption in local government The first president of Kazakhstan has been repeatedly accused of corruption. And his family was embroiled in a series of money laundering, bribery, and murder investigations by Western governments. Among these investigations is the so-called Kazakhgate, as a result of which the US Department of Justice did not confirm the guilt of the Nazarbayev family and closed the case in August 2010. The grandson of the first President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, Aisultan Nazarbayev, asked the British authorities for political asylum in February 2020 and said that he had data on corruption in Russia and Kazakhstan. After which, on August 16, 2020, he died, presumably due to cardiac arrest in London. Also, reports of the detention of officials suspected of corruption offenses and the initiatives of government agencies to combat corruption in Kazakhstan appear quite often."
18,"Two white girls, tender love is in the air",social-issues," ""I like your shoes,"" one of the girls said to me as I walked past after shooting some hoops at the park. ""They match your cap,"" she added. Delightfully surprised, I lifted my head and smiled. ""Thank you,"" I replied, ""they are my soccer shoes."" Then I continued going my way, walking toward the edge of the basketball court where the two girls were playing. They had arrived about two hours before me and took up a game on one of the adjacent courts, and I pretended not to notice them. But for some reason, one of the girls decided to say something about my shoes as I was leaving. Maybe she wanted to cheer me up after reading my gloomy face glued to the ground. I don't remember my exact inner feelings at the time I walked past them. Until she said that she liked my shoes, I did not even notice that the sky-blue color of my soccer shoes matched the color of my hat. Dressing to match is something I consciously stopped doing years ago. However, now and then lightning strikes, and that day my dress colors matched like the winning numbers of a Mohegan Sun slot machine. Of the many times I put on those shoes and hat, that was the first time I received a compliment. Where did this teenager learn to cheer up a black middle-aged stranger? It seems that every time the world spins with mayhem and racism, any act of kindness across the racial line becomes magnified. Martin Luther King, Jr. talked about how a little white girl wrote him to express how happy she was that a blade-wielding assailant missed his neck jugular veins by inches. A slash through the big vein would have killed him. Thank goodness the assailant missed, the little white girl wrote to Martin Luther King, Jr. In case you have not noticed, there is a fight between evil and good in this world. Every time evil men and women spit out fires of hatred, good people fight back with arms and love. As such, acts of violence in one part of the world evoke generosity from other parts of the world. Acts of hatred from one pathetic soul evoke acts of love from many souls. When Hitler invaded France, American soldiers went after him. When Gowon bombed and starved Biafran Igbo Children during the 1967-1970 Nigerian civil wars, mercenaries and humanitarian organizations from across the globe countered his efforts to kill us. With the death of George Floyd and the mistreatment of Asian people, whites, blacks, and all races have escalated their benevolence. I can sense it; tender love is in the air at this moment around the world. Without what is going on in the United States and around the world, I wonder whether that teenage white girl would have been so nice and gifted in wisdom."
19,What is a chat room?,social-issues," A quick search on the internet will turn up millions of links to chat rooms. Where do they come from? Many people would be surprised to learn that these rooms are called websites. While it is possible to find similar-sounding names like chat rooms, they are not all necessarily the same. There are dozens of different types and sub-types of chat websites. To simplify things, the term chat room refers to any kind of virtual synchronized online conversation, sometimes even fully synchronized offline. The term chat room can thus imply any number of things, ranging from real-time chat and online conversation with strangers, to fully immersive virtual visual environments where everyone appears in front of a similar screen. This is one way of thinking about them, but they can also be multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) games, discussion board, or social networking website. Some rooms are multiplayer free for all, where all the players are in the same room, while others are restricted to a small group of specific friends. There are also chat rooms that use a hybrid model, where some rooms are separated from the main server and populated only by a handful of regular players. When you talk about what is a chat room, you have to be careful about the terminology. Often, they are used interchangeably. Chat rooms are not always separate platforms; sometimes they are part of the same website or used in conjunction with other online services. One example of this is a forum, which is essentially a site where people can talk to each other about a specific topic, often with the option of signing up for an email address in case they have questions or comments. The same type of online chat is often used in social networking websites. A typical chat room has multiple visual display panels for showing chat messages, such as the message boards and forums. Sometimes the message boards are combined with video displays or images. Often, text chat boxes appear below these graphical displays. In some cases, a small number of chat clients are connected to a single visual display panel, and sometimes there are separate chat clients and chat rooms for each different type of media. Since the advent of online user groups or chats, chat rooms have become much more than a place where people talk about their pet. There are now professional groups with regular meetings, game groups with monthly leagues, and even religious groups with daily prayer sessions. There are professional networks with hundreds of thousands of members. And these groups are very visible to people who search for chat rooms on the Internet. So the question ""What is a chat room?"" Another popular use of a chat room is online game-play. Virtually every major online computer game has chat rooms, as well as individual chat rooms for individual players. Dozens of these multiplayer games have elaborate and entertaining chat menus, which allow players to communicate and interact with one another. These social networking sites make it possible for many people to share their hobby and recreational activities. Some of these websites, such as Facebook and MySpace, offer entire chat rooms, or a single conversation area, for users to interact with one another. On the Internet, the term ""chat room"" can also refer to an informal chat that happens between Internet users in which no real monetary compensation is exchanged. These can happen all the time, on chat boards, message boards, and forums devoted to particular interests, subjects, or other subjects. What is a chat room? It's a new term, that may not be familiar to you. But the Internet has changed the way we do business and perhaps will change the way we do communication in the future."
20,6 Simple & Easy Ways To Help The Environment: At Home & At Work,social-issues," Many of us are looking for quick and easy ways that we can help the environment. We know the planet is precious and want to find ways to help, but also may find it easy to become overwhelmed or discouraged. That’s where these handy tips come in! Whether you are at home or at work — wherever you spend the majority of your time — there are small ways that you can still make a big impact. If everyone makes a small change, we will experience big results. Read the tips and suggestions below and see how many environmentally friendly changes you could make, whether at work or just around the house. AT HOME: The cleaning products we use can have a profound impact on the environment and even our health. While some products have been specifically designed to be sensitive or hypoallergenic, others that achieve great results can still come with a heavy cost. They may aggravate skin conditions, respiratory problems, or cause toxicity in the water supply and oceans. Switching to greener alternatives, such as those that are natural, recycled, or at the very least do not use additional toxins or microbeads (particles of plastic) is a better choice. Composting can be one of the simplest and most effective ways to make food waste environmentally friendly. There are now compost bins in a range of styles and sizes, meaning that they can be kept indoors for ease of use. They no longer have to interfere with your decor, cause a bad odour, or be kept outside and thus less likely to be used. Compost bin designs have evolved to fit a more modern eco-conscious lifestyle! They work by breaking down your food waste in a way that means it can be used to greatly enrich soil, or be disposed of more safely. Food that goes to landfill not only increases waste but can also lead to heavy emissions. Composting is a great way we can help at home! Food waste is one of the largest areas of waste in the household — and beyond. You can contribute positively to the environment by making use of your leftovers and reducing your food waste. There is now a great range of delicious recipes that are specifically intended to use up common leftovers, as well as affordable storage solutions that keep food fresher for longer. You can also extend this approach to other materials such as electronics and clothing, reusing, recycling, or repurposing them rather than simply throwing them away. You could share with family and friends, sell online, or transform a fabric into something new. Get creative! AT WORK: The daily commute can be a significant contributor to pollution and harmful emissions worldwide. So much so, that many governments have discussed alternatives such as incentives to use electric cars, building new cycle routes and more. But you don’t have to wait for them! You can get started straight away by assessing your own commute. Is there a way you could make it more environmentally friendly or even beneficial to your health? Perhaps walking or cycling to work is an option, even just a few times a week. You may also consider switching to an electric car, or group travel options. Many businesses are even supporting and encouraging company-wide remote working. This is for a variety of reasons, but it also happens to be more environmentally responsible as it greatly reduces the number of people commuting. Investigate what would be the best option for you and take action even in small ways! If you are running your own business, you may have the option of purchasing key materials, supplies or appliances that are second hand. This reduces the number of items that go to landfill, as well as often coming at the fraction of the cost of brand-new items. It is more cost-effective — and greener — for your business! If you do not work for yourself, you could encourage your colleagues and boss to purchase second hand where possible or switch to items such as recycled paper or reduced plastic. Where it is only possible to make small changes, even implementing a recycling system or a recycling bin can be a great way to start. When you and your colleagues are out of a room, be sure to reduce the energy expenditure by turning off light bulbs, water, electricity sources and anything else using unnecessary energy. It may also be possible to make the switch to more energy-efficient bulbs and alternatives. With small but effective changes and a proactive approach, you can make a positive difference to the environment whether at home or at work!"

1,The Foundational Edict of Respect,social-issues," This story entails the measures I believe one should take when relaying their respect for others. It has been written in the manner of a person speaking to his past self; conveying to his past caricature the foundational edict of respect necessary in order to lead a pleasant life and have fulfilling interactions with individuals. His former self will be referred to by the alias Saul. While his present self will be referred to by the alias Paul. Paul is a man with integrity. He tries his best to relay his respect to others as often as he can. Although he isn’t perfect at it; through many unfortunate occasions he has learned the value of respecting others. His former self who goes by the name Saul is the embodiment of a man who has positive intentions but makes negative decisions. Saul understands the importance of respect, but doesn’t understand the effect it has on those he chooses to disrespect due to conflicting views, social norms, and trauma. On a quiet Monday night Paul was fast asleep. When all of a sudden he found himself in a dream; he see’s Saul from a distance approaching him. They take a seat near a flock of ducks by the pond. It is a bright Friday morning; the cool summer breeze is blowing across the pond and past the vibrant trees when Paul asks Saul “how has life been going for you?”. Saul laughed while shaking his head and said “you know how my life has been.” Paul laughed as well and replied “well you are right about that; you aren’t just a figment of my imagination.” Saul fakes a smile. Paul knows that the person he is now is the manifestation of Saul’s worst nightmare. He can tell by the look in Saul’s eyes. They spoke for the next half hour. It got to the point where Saul’s irritation of Paul’s presents became obvious. Paul asks “what happened? Why are you giving me that look?” Saul replies with a stern tonality saying “you! That’s what happened. You have strayed away from your purpose; you’ve become soft.” Paul looks to the side; giving Saul’s claims some thought. He replies back to him saying “what was my purpose? I thought my purpose in life was to become the best person I can be to myself and those around me.” Saul quickly replies and says “yes; of course that’s your purpose. How can you be the best version of yourself when you have relinquished your position of power? How do you expect to help others without some grasp of authority in which you can use to extend your good well?” Saul is a man with power. He has authority; he oversees the manufacturing and distribution of propaganda to influence foreign relations. He understands the importance of the individual’s mind but yet believes that the collective and their action is what’s needed to ensure change in society for the good. In other words; he believed his work is a necessity, so he lives by the noble lie. Saul doesn’t hesitate to hinder other people’s views when they conflict with his; regardless of it being in his personal life or in his line of work. Disrespecting and shaming people along with their families, disrupting a whole nation's way of life. Believing he is doing good; blinded by the noble lie. “Extend my good well you say…” said Paul. “answer this for me Saul, is there something you can unequivocally say is good in this world? Since if my past endeavors were genuinely good they would have not caused harm; even to the most undetectable extent.” Paul understands in the most ideal sense there is such a thing as unequivocal goodness; everyone wants to end world hunger, but when implementing the actions needed to end the food shortage we base our judgment on which action is the lesser evil. If there was enough food to feed 3 million people; we have to pick out the people suffering the most and feed them first. We always have to pick from the lesser evil. Paul goes on to explain this mannerism to Saul. Since Paul knew that by disrespecting and limiting other peoples views for what Saul interpreters as his contribution to the greater good; not only brought more harm because he didn’t choose the lesser evil which is to respect all people, nation, and lifestyles but also caused residual resent towards him from those people and nations he chose to disrespect and from those people and nations he chose to limit his respect from. Paul understands that when dealing with people; the lesser evil is to show respect. Even if his values, social norms, or trauma he had to deal with in the past conflict with whatever that person is saying or doing. A key thing to remember when showing respect is. Respect is not the same as agreement. Saul is a man that instigated and participated in mass genocide. Saul is a man who had positive intentions but made negative decisions. Unlike good and bad; positive and negative can coexist. Since the lesser evil is the action in which the positive implementations outweigh the negative. Good isn’t truly good if it has a bit of bad in it; bad isn’t truly bad if it has a bit of good in it. Inevitably regardless of how selfish or selfless one might be they are always the center of their world. Paul explains that  acknowledging people as the center of their world will ensure that he can provide the foundational amount of respect to those around him regardless of how vile their actions and words may be or have been. This is done not only because every individual is the center of their world and should be treated as such; but because the greater evil is to refrain from giving respect while the lesser evil is gladly giving respect to all."
2,Economic Recovery: The Homestead Act of 1862 VS the Economic Democracy Act of 2021,social-issues," The largest economic expansion in American history by far occurred in the wake of the Civil War after President Abraham Lincoln signed The Homestead Act of 1862 into law. This legendary piece of legislation GRANTED citizens 160 acres of public land with the understanding that they live on it for 5 years, improve it (i.e. build a home), and pay a small registration fee. In all the US government GRANTED more than 270 million acres to 1.6 million homesteaders who collectively opened up America west of the Mississippi. As brilliant and impactful as it was however, the Homestead Act of 1862 had its limitations. For example, land was and always will be, FINITE. That is to say, there’s only so much of it. Second, the act explicitly excluded Native Americans, people younger than 21, and those who had taken up arms against the Union army in the recently concluded war. It also excluded people who lacked agricultural/construction skills/knowledge or the financial capacity to endure several years of the almost income free existence required to develop the land being offered to them. But interestingly enough, there’s currently a small, not for profit group of “outside the box” thinkers who are really excited about the all-new technology frontier and the similar, but MUCH LARGER OPPORTUNITY that it presents to Americans today. Yes, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to hear about The Economic Democracy Act proposed by the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ.ORG/headquartered in Arlington, VA). CESJ contends that, unlike land, technological developments are relatively INFINITE! Yet these developments can be approached in much the same way that Lincoln approached land back in 1862. Furthermore, they invite people of all races, genders, religions, and political persuasions (330 million people) to become owners of wealth producing capital assets. Nobody picks up and moves anywhere. And because their developmental strategy is based on FUTURE EARNINGS not PAST SAVINGS, the financial constraints that prevented many people from participating in1862 are ELIMINATED. Check out the following FACTS and see for yourself the almost unlimited potential for economic expansion built into the Economic Democracy Act of 2021. $4 Trillion Dollars Annually… On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the capital credit loan to be repaid via PRE-TAX, FUTURE EARNINGS /DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Production and consumption (supply and demand) would be systematically balanced. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream residual of income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help democratize our free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And yes, pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented immediately, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying out dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Talk about a win/win! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (probably a full decade) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
3,Trust Fund Babies VS Economic Freedom in America,social-issues," I’d like you to take five minutes, sit back, and imagine that you were born a trust fund baby. That is to say, starting at birth, imagine your parents were wealthy enough to invest $10,000 on your behalf in a qualified, tax-exempt trust fund with your name on it, ANNUALLY. By the time you reached your 18th birthday that investment (with all the appropriate costs subtracted out) is generating at least $18,190 of residual income (from dividends) every year. That figure translates into a little over $1500 every month without you lifting a finger. In other words, when you turn 18 you won’t need to accept a demeaning job (sell yourself) flipping hamburgers, waiting tables, stocking grocery store shelves, or delivering pizza in order to have a little spending money. You can count on at least $1500 dollars-worth of residual income walking in your door every single month, all year long. Now obviously that’s not a whole bunch of money in today’s economy. But for an 18-year-old who just graduated from high school, that goes a long way toward paying your bills. And presuming you’re still living with your parents, that $1500 goes directly into your back pocket every month. Money is WORKING FOR YOU instead of YOU WORKING FOR MONEY! What Happens When You Turn 30? Now let’s take this little scenario one step further and say that age 30 your parents’ annual investments were generating at least $36,190 of residual income annually ($3015 per month.) Now once again, this kind of money does not have you hanging out with Bill Gates or Elon Musk. But over 3 grand of residual income every month would be enough income to allow you to avoid HAVING TO SELL YOURSELF to some dictatorial autocrat (a.k.a. corporate CEO) who sees you as little more than a means to corporate profit. But if you did accept his job offer, this autocratic gent had best make it worth your while and treat you with RESPECT. And if he failed at either you could afford to tell him to take his job and shove it. By the way, if you were married to someone the same age, and whose parents were similarly inclined, that $36K instantly becomes $72K. And at the age of 30 you’d be light years from being poor. You’d never have to choose between taking a shlock job with an idiot boss and being unable to take care of your family – which is the choice that over 90% of Americans face every day of the week. You could actually explore your potentials/talents and choose to do something with your days, weeks, months and years that make your life meaningful, fulfilling, and worth living instead of having to focus on buck chasing all the damn time. And What About Age 40? 50? 60? And 65? In this particular scenario, at age 40 your residual income would have grown to $51,190 annually. At age 50 you’re looking at $66,190 in residual income. At age 60 it would be at least $81,190. And at age 65 your residual income would be at least $88, 690. And if you’re married that $88K becomes almost $190,000 coming in the door. In other words, when you retired you and your spouse would have no need of pensions, Social Security, Medicare, etc. You wouldn’t be billionaires. But you’d have more than enough to cover all your bases without depending on anyone including the government. You could call that economic independence or freedom! But What if Your Parents Are Not Wealthy? But what if your parents aren’t members of the 1% and are unable to invest $10K annually – like 99% of Americans today? How would this improbable scenario described above apply to you? If you’re interested in the answer to that question, consider the FOLLOWING FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth.

4,Are You Using The Best Soil For Bonsai?,social-issues," Well Draining Soil for Bonsai Trees Are you using the best soil for bonsai? The answer lies in the soil’s drainage. While a lot of plants love dense, rich organic soil, bonsai trees need a mix of good soil and grit to allow water to be helf BUT also drain away without the roots rotting. What does that look like? Let’s break this down in this article. In this post, you’ll learn the perfect bonsai tree soil recipe and where to buy the components. I do most of my bonsai gardening in containers, both indoors and outdoors, rather than in the ground. Selecting soil for these containers can be a challenge. Over the years, I’ve done a lot of research about the best type of soil for bonsai tree container gardens, I’ve tried quite a few approaches, and found that some of them work much better than others. In fact, I’ve learned that, while improper watering of bonsai trees is a major cause of bonsai deaths (learn how to water properly here), the correct soil is a much bigger contributing factor than people realize. What Is “Good” Bonsai Tree Soil? Let’s start by talking about what you should be looking for in bonsai soil. The best soil for bonsais in pots will hold enough water for them to absorb what they need but still dries out quickly so the roots won’t rot. Bonsais absorb water from the air around them, not through direct contact. Constantly sitting in wet soil causes their roots to rot, because they get too much water–eventually, the cells in the roots and leaves fall apart, causing the plant to die. Several environmental factors can cause soil to dry out, so different types of soil will be best-suited for different growing areas. The area where you live, as well as the location where you keep your bonsai trees, will play a role in determining what type of soil your bonsais need. The Perfect Indoor Bonsai Soil As mentioned earlier, I grow a lot of bonsais indoors. Since indoor environments don’t offer as much air circulation around indoor pots, I’ve found that using the right soil is extremely important for the health of indoor bonsais. I highly recommend using soil with large particle size, roughly 1/4″ or 6mm. I learned all about particle size, and the role it plays in well-draining soils, by reading various forums. One article gave a recipe for soil that works extremely well for indoor bonsais. I used to make the soil myself (since it was not available pre-mixed). The recipe combines: 1 Part Pine Bark Fines 1 Part Turface (an absorptive rock) 1 Part Crushed Granite Why it works Bonsai trees will grow in a variety of soils, but I want to go over why this soil works and why you should use it. The pine bark provides an organic element and holds water–but it has air pockets for ventilation. As a bonus, it takes a long time to break down. The Turface absorbs some of the water and slowly releases it. Crushed granite allows the water to flow among all the particles in the pot. Since the mix is very porous, water flows out easily. Plus there’s plenty of air, which means the roots are not left sitting in soggy soil or pool water like traditional potting soil. The really crucial part of the recipe, though, is to make sure all the particles are roughly 1/4″ in size. It’s a lot of work to screen gallons of soil to get uniform-sized particles! Pre-mixed option Mixing this soil recipe myself was time-consuming and quite a challenge. But you’re in luck! You can now buy a ready-to-go bag of this soil from Bonsai Jack. He’s an expert when it comes to soil, and this mix in particular is amazing for bonsai trees. The particle size and consistency of the Bonsai Jack mix are exactly right for indoor bonsais.  For example, while Turface is usually only available in 1/8″ particles, Jack has been able to get a 1/4″ size, specifically to use in this mix. I highly recommend using this Bonsai Jack Bonsai Soil for your indoor bonsai trees. Especially if you tend to overwater, this soil will help your bonsais thrive! However, if you’d rather not purchase this “gritty mix” online, it is possible to make it yourself.  You should be able to find the ingredients at most nurseries. Turface is also found at most auto parts stores as a product called “Oil-dri,” which mechanics use to clean up oil spills. If you don’t have access to these exact materials, you can substitute other ingredients. Just keep in mind the ratio of inorganic to organic material needs to stay the same. For example, if you use another type of bark, make sure you mix in another type of rock (such as pumice) as well. The really critical piece, as I mentioned above, is to ensure that the particle size is always roughly 1/4″ or 6mm. Soil for Outdoor, Potted Bonsai Trees If you’re growing bonsa trees outdoors, on the other hand, the Bonsai Jack Bonsai Soil may or may not be the right fit for you. Since most of my bonsai experience has been in Queensland, where the weather is generally quite dry and hot in the summers, I found that using the Bonsai Jack mix worked fairly well outdoors, but it required me to water my bonsais more regularly, sometimes in a hot summer, this could be every other day. I’m not great at remembering to water, so this mix required too much maintenance for me. Instead, I’ve been using a mix of Coconut Coir and pumice (or Turface, or crushed granite, depending on what I have most easily available). 1 Part Coconut Coir 1 Part Pumice I wouldn’t use coir indoors, as I discovered it didn’t dry out fast enough for most of my bonsais. However, it’s great for outdoors in warm, dry climates. The added pumice, which is also lightweight, allows the soil to drain a little faster without drying out too quickly. What about the bagged boxed mixes at hardware stores? If you aren’t able to find any of the soil components listed in the recipes above, the next best solution is to pick up a bag of “bonsai and miniture tree mix” at your local Bunnings, Home Hardware or Mitre 10 store. This soil works fairly well for bonsais. However, it doesn’t drain very well, and it tends to repel water when it’s completely dry. I highly recommend adding in a rock material such as pumice, crushed granite or even perlite. Do I need to repot my bonsai trees right now? If your bonsais are currently doing well in the soil they’re in, don’t repot just yet. As I said in the beginning, the right soil for your bonsai tree depends on your climate, as well as the location in which you keep your plants. In other words, if it’s working… stick with it. On the other hand, if you’ve found that your bonsais are frequently dying, and you can’t quite figure out what’s going wrong, the soil is a great place to start. While replacing your soil mix may not solve all your problems, your bonsais will be much happier in a soil that drains well and has plenty of airflow around the roots. Repot new bonsai trees in new bonsai soil As soon as you bring home a new bonsai, repot it in new soil as soon as possible, removing most of the soil from the store pot. Many common problems with bonsais come from keeping bonsais in their original store/plant nursery-bought soil. Soil from the store poses two main problems. First, bonsai trees purchased locally tend to be root bound (meaning the roots are filling up most of the pot). If you simply remove the bonsai and place it in a new pot, the roots will have a hard time spreading. Second, most nurseries sell bonsai trees in soil that is not designed for long-term growth. Or at least not long-term anywhere other than a greenhouse. This is because large nurseries and growers generally use the same soil for all their plants. They want a soil mix that will work for almost anything. When bonsai trees are small, they need more water, so dense soil (like regular potting soil) works at that stage. But leaving bonsais in this soil for too long can quickly cause a bonsai to rot–or in some cases, prevent it from getting the water it needs. Peat moss is the primary ingredient in most potting soils. When the moss dries out completely, it tends to repel water. If you don’t let the water soak on top of the soil and start to penetrate the peat, the bonsai won’t get any water. The water simply runs down the sides of the pot and out the bottom. So please, for the health of your bonsai, replant them as soon as you can after purchasing. They will greatly appreciate the healthy new soil and room for their roots to spread. Conclusion The soil you use for your bonsai is just as important as the frequency of your watering. Take a moment to examine the soil you’re using for your bonsai tree, and see if you a change might be in order."

Secret Text That Makes Men Obsessed A text message has become extremely common for men and women to communicate with each other when flirting. It’s actually how deep a love connection is made. Because, text messaging is a convenient, fast, and reliable way to stay in touch. But if you fail to manage how you texting with your partner, it could seriously damage your relationship. Frequent texting is not an assurance to develop a positive relationship. Well, it’s true that texting is a quick way to communicate with your partner, but it’s not so useful to share deep thought and develop a deep connection without proper execution. Text communication also can easily be misrepresented. Usually, when we communicate, we rely a lot on nonverbal cues such as facial expression and body language. And this is not happening in texting. When you communicate through texting, there could be a high possibility that your joke may come across as an insult or offensive to your partner. Especially at the early stage of the relationship. Most women find it challenging to make their men stay interested in them. This is when text chemistry will guide you. There are many effective ways to make your man commit to the relationship, and this program will teach you how to implement that.

I also have the same thought when I read about this program. Read on, I will try to explain to you how this program works. Basically, there are a few important keys that make this program work. This program focus on capturing men’s full attention, so they constantly thinking about you, what are you doing, what are you thinking and etc. It teaches you how to use men’s “psychological triggers” which is called the Attention hook to help you grab men’s attention. The power of attention hook will tap in directly to your man’s focus and make him think about you. As a result, it will create excitement and a desperate feeling of love, care, and also an obsession for you. Text chemistry also highlights the science proven step for love and attraction.

The Foundation Of The Text Chemistry Okay, before we go through what you will learn from this eBook, let’s take a closer look at their table of content. As you can see, in the early phase, this eBook focuses more on the basic things of texting. The author Amy, wants you to have a strong foundation about texting. That is why she explains in detail the texting mistake that people always make and how to overcome those problems. As a man, I totally agree with what has been highlighted in the texting mistake section. Especially on the essay over-texting part and an ambiguous/confusing text part. Because I believe that, when you are texting with your man, you need to send him messages that make sense. Men did not interested in half-assed communication. If they got an impression or sensed that you just mindlessly messaging them, they will not keep that conversation running. So in order to prevent you from making the same mistake and ruin the relationship, it is important for you to pay attention to this part. R.U.L.E.S of Texting This is another part that catches my attention. In this guide book, Amy shares her theory about R.U.L.E.S of texting. Which is simple and very interesting. R – Review and revise U – Use visual language L – Leave him wanting more E – Excite him S – Stay positive As you can see above, each of the alphabets carries different meanings. Starting from the top, Amy emphasizes that you need to think about what you really want to say. Practice this will make your message be more clear and not overload with excitement. Getting excited about your future partner is good, but you need to be able to control it. If not, your enthusiasm might scare him away, because sometimes, excitement can make you look like a desperate woman. And if you are interested to learn more about the R.U.L.E.S of texting, please check my other article, what to text a guy you like.

And personally, I think some of the techniques are very powerful. If you use it correctly, you can develop and strengthen the chemistry between you and your future partner. But, there is no guarantee that every technique that you learn from this program will produce positive results. It is important for you not to think that all the techniques from this guide book work as magical spells. For me, you need to learn the theory behind the technique. So that you will get a better understanding of what you will going to use when you texting your man. In real life, you should learn how to read the situation and be creative.

It gives you the confidence to test the product. Whenever you feel like the product not worth your money, you just need to email them and ask for a refund, no question asked! The Cons This program is not for everyone. This is based on my personal opinion, some of the modules may not work with you. It depends on what type of person are you. Some of you may dislike the method and not agree with the author. It’s totally your call. If you dislike the method, just proceed with the other module. Overall this is still a good relationship guide. It can be perceived as ‘toying’ Some of the methods can be perceived as toying with men’s emotions. Which is needs to be extra careful. You can relate back to my first point above. So it’s important to wield this knowledge carefully, because any positive effects that you get from this program may be undone if your partner feels like he has been played. Digital product This program is for online purchases online. Without access to the internet, you may not suitable to buy this product.

As a man, I could say that this guide is definitely hit close enough to how men’s brain works. But one thing that may cause problems for certain users is, there is a lot of reading that needs to be done in this guide book. Because Amy explains her ideas and opinion in detail.

That said, you must spend your time to focus on the theory about men’s psychology, don’t rely on the text examples. Their examples are only to give you the basic ideas, but understanding the whole theory will make it easier for you to mixed and matches the methods. I believe, by using this program as your guide, you can light up the darkness that surrounds so many relationships. Don’t allow yourself to continue to follow the same broken relationship patterns.

9,Abolishing Wage Slavery in the Land of the Free,social-issues," If you own enough wealth producing capital assets such as land, buildings, machinery, patents, copyrights, stocks, or bonds YOUR MONEY IS WORKING FOR YOU and it’s probably producing a stream of residual income from which you benefit. On the other hand, if you own nothing more than your own labor (your ability to perform work) like over 90% of Americans, YOU ARE WORKING FOR YOUR MONEY. In this case you’re faced with the dilemma of either selling your labor (talents/time) to someone else (an employer) in exchange for a paycheck or starving on the streets. When someone buys your labor/talents (hires you) they effectively own the most productive percentage of your day, week, month, year, life. As such, they can dictate what you can do with that percentage of your life. If you fail to do what’s expected, you’ll lose that paycheck and the means to the physical necessities of life such as food, shelter, and clothing. In some circles this latter condition is known as WAGE SLAVERY. The person who is working for their money is economically enslaved (dependent on an employer) by their lack of viable economic alternatives. To repeat, your alternatives are either to sell yourself and your talents in exchange for a buck, or find yourself homeless and begging on the streets. Ironically, in this land of the free and the home of the brave, over 90% of all Americans experience life working for an employer, and they’re FREE TO STRUGGLE WITH all the pressures that accompany economic dependence/enslavement. When they finally retire and take Social Security, they are re-enslaved by (dependent on) the government for their survival. For fear of the economic ramifications, they’re never truly financially free to explore and to develop the potentials they were born with. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Let’s Start With These Facts On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term, not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. That $4 Trillion (on average) is destined to happen. The only question is, will it be divided among “we the people” or among “the few” who can afford to participate on the ownership side of the economy? What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will systematically democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Most people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO CONSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
10,The Economic Democracy Act: Frequently Asked Questions,social-issues," Where does the $4 Trillion dollars come from? It comes from NEW WEALTH/ VALUE (from a naturally expanding American economy) created (on average) annually. It’s destined to happen! Someone will have access to and will benefit from this predictable, newly created wealth. The EDA suggests the many (as in we the people) should have access to the means required to participate in the ownership side of the economy - NOT just the few. Won’t the EDA be inflationary? No, it won’t. Notice this strategy does not add one dime to the projected annual growth of the American economy. It’s going to happen anyway. So, the EDA does not dilute or devalue existing currency levels. The only question is, who gets to participate and benefit? Will it be we the people (the many)? Or only the 1% (the few)? Isn’t the EDA socialistic? No, it’s not. Capitalism is all about PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. Socialism is all about PUBLIC OWNERSHIP. In that light, the EDA is all about private ownership. But it systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/power. It also democratizes our free market economy. In the process it UNDERWRITES POLITICAL DEMOCRACY. Won’t the EDA increase my taxes? No, it won’t! What it will do is create tens of millions of NEW TAXPAYERS who will in turn help current taxpayers shoulder the tax burden. This will actually REDUCE taxes for most people who currently pay taxes. It even offers the potential of PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT. Let me calculate. A family of 4 would receive $48,000 (4 X $1,200) of capital credit annually. And a family of 10 would receive $120,000 (10 X $12,000) of capital credit annually. Right? So, doesn’t the Economic Democracy Act effectively pay for a couple to create lots of kids in order to get lots of money? The short answer is that since the line of credit is non-transferable, parents have no access and do not directly benefit from it. But more importantly, research shows that as income increases childbirth frequency decreases. So, on both counts, the EDA will not encourage the overproduction of children. How is Economic Democracy different from Universal Basic Income? UBI simple and it’s relatively immediate. That’s its strength. It’s consumer oriented and it remains relatively constant in size over time. It’s also secured/collateralized by increased government debt. UBI is therefore a SHORT-TERM FIX and creates DEPENDENCE on government. In contrast the EDA is more complicated and it requires some time (5 to 7 years) before residual incomes are actually being generated. The EDA is investment oriented, which means it accumulates and grows over time. It is also backed by insured, wealth producing capital assets that collateralize/secure every transaction. By doing so it creates NO long-term debt for either consumers or government. Therefore, the EDA is a LONG-TERM FIX that must be gradually phased as it creates more people who are INDEPENDENT from government. Is Economic Democracy similar to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan/ESOP? Yes. But instead of covering just those who work for employee-owned companies and who have access to an ESOP, Economic Democracy uses the same strategy to COVER EVERYONE (regardless of age, gender, race, religion), most of whom lack the required means to participate in the (predictably profitable) ownership side of the American economy. Has Economic Democracy been tested in a pilot project to see how it performs in real life? Yes and No. The basic mechanics of this strategy have been thoroughly tested in the roughly 8000 employee-owned companies that have been created over the past 50 years. As we said in the previous question, the EDA is really just an expansion of the of the ESOP strategy that aims to give all Americans an equal opportunity to participate in and to benefit from the ownership side of the American economy where all the new wealth is being created. However, it has yet to be formally tested in a national setting. What percentage is used in order to calculate an average ROI and payoff potential? Using very conservative estimates, we chose 15% as the PRE-TAX ROI. Historically, before the recent wild swings and grossly inflated share values of today, a POST-TAX ROI ran in the neighborhood of 9 to 12%. The payback period is calculated by dividing one by the rate of return and rounding up to the nearest integer. Thus 1/.15 = 6.666 (round it up to 7 years). How does Economic Democracy reduce wage slavery in the US? By giving everyone (as opposed to a few) legitimate access to the ownership side of the US economy (where almost all the new wealth is generated) and creating residual incomes for everyone, Economic Democracy reduces the need for anyone to sell their most productive hours of the day (week, month, year, life) to an employer in exchange for a pay check. How will the EDA impact the bust/boom character of America’s economy? It effectively eliminates the imbalances that are responsible for the bust/boom dilemma. Does the EDA appeal mostly to conservatives or mostly to liberals? To be honest this is a strategy that appeals to BOTH SIDES of the aisle. It appeals to the fiscally conservative Republican who wants to reign in spending and live within our means. It also appeals to the liberal Democrat who wants a level playing field where everyone has an equal opportunity. And since it systematically promotes independence from the government (i.e. freedom) the only people who disapprove of the EDA are autocrats who want to control we the people. Why would the mainstream media fail to inform “we the people” about such a revolutionary economic strategy? Quite simply, the entire mainstream media (including CNN and MSNBC) is owned and controlled by the one percent. And the one percent prefers to keep “we the people” under control and in the dark about revolutionary ideas that threaten to undermine their concentrated wealthy/power. We’re allowed to see and hear what media owners allow us to see and hear. In other words, America’s mainstream media delivers little more than profitable propaganda that, in the long run, supports concentrated wealth/power. Why doesn’t academia introduce this strategy to all their future economists? To be honest, most economists have never been introduced to Economic Democracy. They can’t teach what they don’t know. But in the 21st century, academia is largely dependent on corporate funding (i.e. the one percent) for their existence. So even if they are familiar with Economic Democracy, academicians can ill afford to introduce this revolutionary strategy to future economists without risking their own employment in the process. Bureaucrats (conventionalists) hardly ever rock the boat. Who’s the primary proponent of the Economic Democracy Act? That would be the Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ.ORG), headquartered in Arlington, VA. What are the three big questions that the CESJ wants to ask about any legislation that gets run through Congress? Who owns it? Who controls it? Who benefits? In the case of the EDA, every individual person in the USA owns and controls wealth producing assets, and benefits from this strategy."
11,The Pros and Cons in a Sugar Daddy Dating Relationship,social-issues," Sugar daddy dating is considered to be the best type of relationship for older men and younger women. Due to the immense wealth that sugar daddy has, it is possible to enjoy all kinds of fun no matter how expensive it seems to be. Every relationship has gotten it positive and negative side. The two sides are worth being considered before hooking up with the wealth man you have seen for a while. Pros: Money is always for any given use. The younger women become the receiver of the man’s money and determine what is required in their house especially when they are living separately. This kind of girl just needs to have a genuine reason for asking any money which her man is willing to give out without further questioning. Sugar daddies could buy everything you like. Therefore, lots of girls are willing to date sugar daddies on sugar daddy apps for paying their bills. There is enough time to do extra activities. Where the girl is doing studies or business, a sugar daddy will always give her time to make sure that all is going well. Thus, the woman can climb the ladder academically and as well meet more in other fields. All these developments will be made possible by the funds from the man. Sugar daddies are romantic and know how to treat their women. They have many experiences in relationships before and they know how to please a girl. The age difference does not mean anything to a sugar daddy. He will always show up whenever he is free to make sure that his woman is doing well. Cons: It is hard to know every single detail of any wealthy man. It is not easy for a girl to know whether a sugar daddy has a wife and children in another town. Moreover, some of the wealthy men consider hiding the some sources of wealth. Having met at a club somewhere or on sugar daddy dating apps, you are not entitled to know all about your man. Most of the sugar daddies are extremely busy. They have tight schedules starting from Monday to Sunday. Most of their free time occurs at random and hence a girl must be flexible to go out with her man. She has to fit the schedule that her man is having each day. The man could be unfaithful. This happens particularly when a girl becomes dull with time. The sugar daddy may start eyeing at a new woman who seems better to him more than you. For a girl, it might be hard to question her man especially when she learns about it. When any exchange of words happens, sugar daddies leave a woman without a signal. Lastly, a woman status might be short-lived. If woman solely depends on a man to offer all her requirements, difficult times might be faced especially when a couple parts ways. Thus, a lady should practice saving any extra money that she gets from her man so as to be able to meet her financial needs in the event of a breakup."
12,For BBW Admirers: How to Choose the Right BBW Dating Apps,social-issues," Some men are BBW admirers because not only do BBW look beautiful but also they are fun to hang out with. Due to this reason, the demand for BBW hookup apps is increasing. However, you must be aware of key points before choosing a suitable dating app: Consider the brand of the BBW app People always trust brands having name and fame. Due to this reason, choosing branded BBW hookup sites or apps is the most important aspect to consider. You will come across many BBW dating apps online; however, choosing the right one can be quite tricky. Thus, it is better if you search online for some of the best names in the world of BBW apps. It will help you to restrict your search area. Brands play a significant role while searching for dating apps to avoid fake users. With a good brand, you will get quality assurance, uncountable profiles to choose from, and more.

When searching for BBW dating apps, check the user comments and reviews in App Store or Google Play. It will help you to find out the best and the most popular BBW hookup sites. If the app appears on the first page of the search result, you can go for it. Sites appearing on the second or the third page of the search results do not have enough traffic. Hence, it is better to avoid them. Choose an app having many users If any apps have millions of users, it means; that it is one of the genuine BBW dating apps. However, you must be aware of whether the site opens up about its user database, in case it is a paid app. Alternatively, if you do not want any paid app, you can opt for the free communities. Look for apps that suit your choices and preferences. Make sure to read the app details, especially the user database, if you want to be safe. Since you will share your personal data and pictures, it is necessary to ensure that the site is genuine.

If you do not feel safe, you can report the app regarding the safety of the users. Otherwise, hackers might misuse your personal information or even your card details. Hence, BBW dating sites are becoming extremely popular. However, you must be aware of certain aspects so that you do not face a security breach."
13,Winter Proposals Reach Record High Due To Lockdown,social-issues," Did anyone else notice that our social media feeds were packed with couples taking their relationship to the next level? Even celebrities like Ant McPartlin and Stacey Solomon were in the news after their winter engagements. Reports have been published from the 2020/21 Engagement Trends from a popular jewellery chain stating that proposals throughout winter at the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 have soared, which they believe is due to happy couples spending more time together during periods of lockdown. Taylor & Hart, one of the leading jewellery shops in the country said that they have seen a 60% increase in engagement ring sales in comparison to the same period the year prior. The person responsible for designing these beautiful rings is Kate Earlam, who is the Design Director at Taylor & Hart. She is quoted as saying: “2020 has bought more time for people to contemplate and have spent more time with their partners to fall further in love.” “People get engaged at Christmas because you’re surrounded by friends and family. The festive season is a happy feel-good time and what more of a perfect way to end the year, and begin a new one, than telling your partner that they are the only one for you. New Years bring new possibilities and exciting things.” The report examined internet searches, analysed engagement ring trends and what impact the pandemic had on the wedding industry to identify which areas are on the rise at the start of this year. From a personal perspective, it is fantastic to see that during a challenging year, positive changes have shone through. The results of the pandemic has filled us with uncertainty, but one thing is for sure, and that is one day we will be able to enjoy weddings once again."
14,Hedonistic Calculous – Mental Mayhem Wrath,social-issues," In the realm of Gonzo Theory, an extremely complex multidimensional framework of thought, the historic ideation of hedonistic calculous lurks in the shadows of criminological theory. Today, such a notion is exceptionally relevant, especially in the ego-filled halls of academic. For that matter, the self-centered bastions of government, commerce and industry and every nook and cranny of human habitation. As to that suggestion, discussion is multifaceted. While there are always exceptions to any generalization, the focus here in on human selfishness. From that self-pleasing volition of willfulness, criminality unfolds in conspiracy and practice. With regard to Gonzo Theory, where one major aspect is classical criminology, the immediate assertion is that of free will. In the timid yet tumultuous torture of psychic revulsion, the emotional reaction is a cavernous gasp of “oh my god”, the curse of free will unleashes the horrors of Pandora’s Box. Screams from many dominions in academia, primarily the schools of “social studies”, echo the vehemence against self-determination. Instead, to favor deterministic domination by “demonic forces”, modern day supernaturalism wears the many disguises of “mental illness”. For that, the pseudosciences pretend to be “scientific”. In the vast influential reaches of the “social studies” philosophies, including criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, nearly every aspect of American society has been “infected”. At this point in time, it is too late to turn from the arrogance of mental mayhem and transcend to higher planes of reason and rationality. Mainstream society reached the tipping point of persistent and intentional “dumbing down” barely twenty years into the 21st century. Real scientist, as in several prominent astrophysicists, suggested the human species has less than 100 years to work out all the problems humanity creates. Willful choices are freely made and very real. In consideration of such speculation, several scientists predicted human extinction by the end of the century. Some of them alleged the barbarity, aggression and selfishness of humans to live and work together foments the devolution of a dying species. With that, the realization that the “pursuit of pleasure”, hedonism, for maladaptive and disruptive intentions, colludes to hasten social regression. To that issue, a glance at national politics offers ample evidence of the perpetration of stupid and contentious “polybabble” for the sake of public pandering. As to the previously mentioned cosmological efforts to study human behavior, spheres of the pseudosciences invite a range of speculation. A good story telling can really mess up a normally quiet day when the subterfuge disagrees with the status quo. The “four horsemen of the intellectual apocalypse”, criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, present conjecture offering both good and not so good possibilities for further analysis. In the not so good range, contrived stupidity often confounds the social spectrum with outright foolishness. On the other hand, in the probability of the good range, reasonable commentary offers creative speculations as to cause and effect. Within the schemes of the not so good strata, the psychobabble is baffling. Nonetheless, all is vanity and all is allegory for the amative satiation of cracking the ultimate code that explains the human species. By fable, metaphor or even analogy of sorts, the anecdotal nature of contrived consensus is brutally reactionary. Yet, finding the key to the dungeon of thinking, going through the keyhole into wonderland, the quest reaches an unachievable stalemate. The mission continues. Not for just primal understanding, nor even an elevated enlightenment, but the deep darkness of the black hole in revealing the universal eternity of human consciousness. However, given the devolving state of the human species, across every aspect of society, the regressive tendencies forsake the essential efficacy of intense intellectual ascension. Finding the answers may be futile. One author for example, writing about cultural masculinity laments the “pussification of America”. As the argument goes, modern America faces a critical dilemma in which men act more like women, with a loss of profound psychosexual identity. Accordingly, if the thesis is reasonable, on or about 1960 and forward, a downward educational trend began which emphasized and promoted male weakness. In an era where the proverbial playing field defaults to the lowest common level, by which there are no winners or losers, self-centeredness flourishes. In the “pussification” of the American culture, self-gratification replaces self-reliance. Individuation in personal evolution became abhorrent for many, in the fearful collectivist thinking of status quo divisiveness. A condescending sense of entitlement switches places with rugged individualism and learning how to deal with the harsh realities of life. Further, the aforementioned article points to a study related to parental overindulgence and protectiveness to promote unrealistic expectations in their children. As a result, younger generations accept the simplicity of their over-valued sense of pretentious validation. Narcissistic regression festers widely. As though a fairy tale of imaginative frivolity, festering deep in the folds of organic neural activity, the illusion of “mind” foments every torture one can find. Self-interest is extraordinarily an individual proclivity, forsaking the interests of others for the individuation of egoistic satiation. Yet, there is the cry of the holy adherent proclaiming their reinvention of social justice. In reality though, there is nothing new under all the planets and stars of the universe. To that, lurking just below the surface, the human element knows its own deception. Many will gnash their teeth, rent their attire, anoint with the ash of burnt offerings and wail to the contrary. For the hard-core, “X-rated”, and cynical criminologist, the superficiality of unscientific conjecture of modern times is quite entertaining. In addition, along with this suspiciousness of typically the classical criminologist, the viewpoint scoffs at the hypocrisy of contemporary sociological speculation. Of this, there seems to be a paradox within the vast “flat earth” realm of the “social studies” arena. Picture for the moment a huge colosseum just for the playful fun. Consider something like a Roman gladiator showground. Upper class elitists love this kind of stuff. They always have and they always will enjoy being spectators for the kill. Nonetheless, image the competition among the various schools of thought. Entering the arena of portentous expectations, each fights to insist their perspective is the correct one. So, academically speaking, or politically seeking, even socially tweaking, the diversity of philosophical pontification claims the immediacy of definitive explanation. In reality, up against real science, there are no absolute final and complete singularities. Obviously, in this contest not many are skilled in the arts of war, or the tactics of physical combat. No, instead, the various factions, kind of like cults, close ranks around their particular “language”. That is their weaponry, jargon is the sword, and anecdote is the shield, while the regurgitation of unscientific babble is the spear. Imagine if one had to defend their pretend “science” against the real point of a razor-sharp blade. And so, absent serious challenge and serious questioning, the theoretical hyperbole, across mainstream infotainment, gets away with fraud, fiction and often clever con artistry. So well accepted in a devolving culture, where the average level of literacy is in the realm of middle school, “psychic magicians” can get away with anything. As the “stadium” of intellectual regression continues, the faux combatants contrive their various psychosocial schemes to perpetuate what might be viewed as a paradox. While some fortune tellers read their crystals balls, there emerges a paradox. Many of the psychics will admonish the confused proselytes to “stop blaming others, or other things” for the necessity to grow up. That is a curious point to ponder. If, as one article from a famous magazine on “social studies” suggests, a “consumer” should stop blaming externalities his or her poor choices. Responsibility for personal accountability remains a hallmark of at least one school of thought in the vast reaches of the “social studies” arena. In particular, this is in reference to the previous notions of the classical school of criminology. As to that consideration, and by extension or application in a broader spectrum, correlation from externalities of blame is irrelevant to the actual causation of self-determination. Subsequent harm, degradation, invective, torture and so forth, are intentional, premeditated with malice aforethought, for the purposes of personal gain. In article from 2012, by a mainstream “social studies” researcher, the admonishment to society suggested fessing up to the pursuit of personal pleasure at the expense of others. As people so often do, blaming something or someone else for the purposeful dysfunctions that occur. Self-indulgence, assumption of “victimization” as a perpetrator, or scapegoating others, is part of playing the dangerous game of blaming. Irresponsibility is easily justified as a pattern of rational self-indulgent behavior that serves the interest of the perpetrator. In a devolving cultural context, a collapsing society, accountability becomes more difficult to achieve. Social media, mainstream infotainment, news media and political processes do not often encourage mature growth and development. Likewise, a profound sense of maturity in the effort needed to become a well-differentiated more enlightened individual is challenging. It is not only a significant affront to the psychic senses to become an ascended personality; such effort defies the imagination at every option. Seemingly, a person is at war within. Perpetrators of illicit and counterproductive activities seek to avoid answerability. When cornered, they claim all manner of unsubstantiated excusatory conjecture. To minimize culpability, the “anarchistic” thought processes easily conclude that matters of liability are not applicable to him or her in question. The shifting focus becomes convincingly one of a gambit of self-seeking mitigation. Meanwhile, as observers often observe the bias of their observations, pundits usually accept the sleight of hand tactics for “plausible deniability”. Some externality is responsible and not the guilty party who perpetrated the incident in question. People, places and things, in general, are used as the “real causative” factors for the misconduct. In the process of over-generalization and lazy rationalization, a cover story cleverly masquerades for the reality of intentional perpetration. Fictional thinking for self-serving seduction replaced factual reality. Confusing and counterproductive are the myriad philosophical speculations asserting the specificity of hasty generalizations. Unraveling the mysterious intricacy of human thinking, and subsequent motivations, is akin to making sense out of weather related “spaghetti” models. Yet, that is overly simplistic in the notion that meteorology is probably more predictable than human behavior. Although in response, many behavioral analysists might disagree. In the self-assured arenas of “academic jousting”, and other forms of theoretical “pugilism”, some schools of thought are very defensive. More than a few academicians, particularly those who write textbooks, frequently conclude a sufficiency of anecdotal citations in spite of scientific validation. With regard to human behavior, and particularly criminality in the study of criminology, theory often collides with the real world of the “criminal justice” practitioner. Outside the safe confines of academia where many theorists conduct their studies, the harsh reality of human conflict presents a deadly contrast. Likewise, the mention of something called “criminal justice” is frequently contentious, confusing and confounding. For instance, politicians sometimes understate, misunderstand and mislead the public and the press on issues related to things like “criminal justice reform”. Similarly, the implications of mentioning something called the “criminal justice system” does not clarify the reality as to how the U.S. systems function. Since the focus here concerns that which relates to the United States, there is a lot of misperception regarding crime, criminals and criminality in American Society. As to that, in the U.S. there are criminal justice multi-system operating at the federal, state and local levels of government. This presents an additional complexity to analyzing the full scope of criminality and criminology in general. For the police, prosecutors, defenders, probation and corrections officers, and associated first responders, they operate in this real world of human interactivity. For a politician or celebrity pundit pretending to report news stories, there is an assumptive tendency to suggest one size fits all. That is, one system one nation and one easy fix for everything. However, the realty of the multidimensional intricacy defies quick cure-all simplicity. Counting the federal level, adding states and counties and special jurisdictions, the American “criminal justice system” is vast and diverse. One size does not fit all. With jails, holding facilities, prisons, courthouses, police agencies, etc., unique features culminate at the local levels. There are many organizational features, both public and private, interacting on a daily basis. Therefore, to suggest the notion of a politician’s posture to fix the “criminal justice system” is to proclaim a shallow self-serving and hedonistic need for personal validation. Which system gets fixed? Aside from the digression, the concept of hedonistic calculus likewise reflects the essential necessity of individual “gain minus risk” assessment. For the “felicity calculus”, previously proposed by Jeremy Bentham in the early 1800’s, espoused an algorithmic notion for calculating pain versus pleasure. As some might assert, sometimes people reverse their view of that which is pleasurable contrasted with painfulness. Of course, the actual measurement of human thinking processes by an observer is highly speculative, theoretically abstract and provisionally subjective. Yet, the philosophical interests are intriguing to the field of criminology. Nonetheless, assessing costs and benefits of actions relate to the willfulness to engage in, as well as freely commit, an illicit or illegal breach of public civility. Historical investigators within the framework of classical criminology, asserted the standpoint for the potentiality of purposeful and premeditated behaviors. Maximizing pleasurable experiences and avoiding or minimizing the painful ones, reside within the thinker of the pre-calculated eventualities. As anything of value, that which is considered by the individual, to be relevant and subsequently of necessary gain. For this, the rationality of choice is a matter of serious individuation. While a certain person values a particular perspective, another may have a more diverse viewpoint. Regardless, behaviors are very rational to the proclivities of the instigator involved. Others may find associated behaviors morally repugnant, disturbing, and unethical and so on. Yet, from a counterpoint, the behavior is extraordinarily rational. The notion of “antisocial” behaviors stemming from some mysterious externality of alleged “cause and effect” is not only laughable, but also absurd. Social issues arise as “hope springs eternal” that one school of thought, or another, pretends human behavior is easily quantifiable into simplistic explanations. Far too long, the “social studies” arena of academia wields too much power of influence over political policymaking. In this pseudoscience realm, certain schools of thought in criminology, psychology, sociology and theology, perpetrate myriad mitigations to excuse illicit behaviors of every category. From the perspective of “demonic possession”, or causative factors doing evil and residing outside the person, perpetration is peculiarly otherworldly. As such, in post-modern America for instance, everyone is a victim and responsibility conveniently rationalized. Regardless though, erroneous conjecture, more prevalent socially than ever, falsifies the underlying motivational factors contingent upon willfully choosing to inflict harm on others. From the “social studies industrial complex”, after the fact, most explanations are not even close. In the malaise of discontent for a “single bullet” theory to explain everything about human nature, the frustration surfaces in superficial conjectures. For some, preferring unlabored persistent ignorance instead of strenuous critical analysis, mythologies will find refuge in false cause pretentiousness to the reality of scientific authenticity. Ideologies of every kind, absent evidentiary substantiation through skeptical scrutiny, with hidden motives, derail serious investigative discourse. In the social mainstream, the confusion runs deeper than ever. Serious investigative analysis devolves to quick fixes and easy answer, which foster dangerous consequences. Of such concerns, examples reveal themselves in the divisiveness of modern politics and the subsequent shallowness of public policy debates. Corresponding examples reflect the narrow and divided perspectives in electoral processes, religious interactions and social media, becoming increasingly prone toward debasing selfishness. Regardless, the fundamental notion of motivational persistence is that of freely choosing certain courses of action. From the classical criminological viewpoint, people engage willfully in the con of their self-gratification. The proliferation of “selfie” oriented personal promotion demonstrates the regressive self-centeredness of each successive generation. From so-called sit-coms to reality shows, or late-night variety shows to cable network talk hosts, there is an abundance of condescending invective. To look better than another, poke fun at institutions, and point out another’s shortcomings degrades the social mainstream. In the meantime, such derisive antics promulgate bullying negativity that makes one feel good at the expense of others. These are intentional unethical behaviors. Hedonistic intentions often promote illicit activities, or become the basis for committing crimes that gratifies the perpetrator. Whether the con job is an outlandish television commercial, or the stupid commentary of a politician, it is a matter of probable gain in taking advantage of someone else. The bullied person will likely suffer. For the instigator, when challenged, the “criminal mind-set” quickly embraces easy rationalization in fabricating convenient excuses. Entire industries willingly promote mitigating “diagnoses, in quickly blaming someone else. Nonetheless, the bottom-line is that people freely pick their courses of action for the self-flagellation of themselves. Speaking in a metaphorical sense, the “self-stroking”, “spanking”, or “psychic flogging”, services the satiation of personal validation. The debauchery of arrogant intemperance hastens the regression of the human species toward its contrived eventual extinction. People are adept at their own deceptions and greedily embrace manipulative gambits of alleged “magical sciences”, as hope springs eternal for mystical salvation from themselves."
15,"Wanted: One Billionaire Who Will Actively Support A Government of the People, by the People, and for the People!",social-issues," I’m part of a small group of people who wants to form a new political party here in the United States. It will be called the Economic Democracy Party and it will be based on the recognition that a POLITICAL DEMOCRACY IS IMPOSSIBLE when so much wealth and power is so concentrated in the hands of so few at the expense of so many. The EDP supports a free-market strategy that systematically counters the tendency for wealth to accumulate in the hands of a few. We recognize that both major political parties are currently owned and controlled by big money interests. But we also recognize that in 2021 getting our message out on the street and fully understood by John Q. Public is an expensive proposition. That’s why our group is in the market for one billionaire WHO HONESTLY BELIEVES IN equal opportunity for all, a level playing field, democracy, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and who is willing to stand up to his contemporaries and bankroll this new political party. So, what would our billionaire get in return for their support? First and foremost, they’ll get a system that gradually levels the economic playing field, NOT BY TAXING THE WEALTHY, but by giving every single man, woman, and child in the USA (regardless of race, gender, religion, age, or political persuasion) EQUAL ACCESS the ownership side of the American economy where most of the new wealth/value is being generated. In the process of systematically leveling the playing field, or democratizing America’s free market economy, our billionaire will also support… •	Creating NO long-term government debt •	Creating NO long-term consumer debt •	Creating tens of millions of NEW TAXPAYERS while… •	Diluting and LOWERING TAX RATES for Americans who still pay taxes •	Creating a realistic possibility of PAYING OFF OUR NATIONAL DEBT •	ELIMINATING POVERTY AND RELATED PROBLEMS •	INCLUDING STRUCTURAL RACISM AND •	FAMILY INSTABILITY WITHIN A DECADE while… •	Dramatically reducing, if not eliminating the need for all social safety net programs •	Creating a degree of economic freedom never before known in this “land of the free and home of the brave.” So how does Economic Democracy work? Let’s have a quick look at some specifics. Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING because all loans are instantly collateralized (by private sector assets instead of government debt), self-liquidating, and insured. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and/or NO CONSUMER DEBT because all loans are systematically paid off! And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized/secured) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. In other words, it would not dilute or devalue existing currency by introducing newly printed, unsecured, debt backed dollars into the system. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. So For Example... Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education and all the benefits that follow in its wake. And in retirement nobody would have to depend on Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, because retirees would have plenty of income to live on! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama or Trump administrations (or any of their predecessors) had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVID 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. The Biden/Harris administration has a golden opportunity to make history. Let’s see if they’re up to the challenge? Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. In the meantime, any billionaires in the readership who might be interested in exploring the possibilities inherent in supporting the Economic Democracy Party please contact Dr. Norm Kurland at your earliest convenience. Frequently Asked Questions: Where does all the money come from? The money comes from NEW WEALTH/ VALUE created annually (on average) by the American economy. It’s destined to happen! Someone will have access to all this predictable, newly created wealth. The EDP suggests that the many, (as in we the people) should have access (i.e. the means) to participate in the ownership side of the economy - NOT of just the few. How is Economic Democracy/ED different from Universal Basic Income/UBI? For starters, UBI is consumer oriented and it remains relatively constant in size over time. ED is investment oriented, which means it accumulates and grows over time. UBI is backed by increased government debt. ED is backed by insured, wealth producing capital assets that collateralize every transaction. By doing so ED creates no long-term debt. Is Economic Democracy similar to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan/ESOP? Yes. But instead of covering just those who work for employee-owned companies and who have access to an ESOP, Economic Democracy uses the same strategy to cover everyone (regardless of age, gender, race, religion) most of whom lack the required means to participate in the (predictably profitable) ownership side of the American economy. How does Economic Democracy reduce wage slavery in the US? By giving everyone (as opposed to a few) legitimate access to the ownership side of the US economy (where almost all then new wealth is generated) and creating residual incomes for everyone in the process, Economic Democracy reduces the need for anyone to sell their most productive hours of the day (week, month, year, life) to an employer in exchange for a pay check with which to pay their bills. Who will pick up the garbage, harvest the produce, wait the tables, and flip the hamburgers? Who will do the dirty work if everyone has a steady residual income to depend on? Good question. Since robots are quickly replacing repeatable/mechanical jobs across the nation, the bloody robots should be able to answer that question for us. Why would the mainstream media fail to inform “we the people” about such a revolutionary economic strategy? Quite simply, the entire mainstream media (including CNN and MSNBC) is owned and controlled by the one percent. And the one percent prefers to keep “we the people” under control and in the dark about revolutionary ideas that threaten to undermine their concentrated wealthy/power. We’re allowed to see and hear what media owners allow us to see and hear. In other words, America’s mainstream media delivers little more than profitable propaganda that, in the long run, supports concentrated wealth/power. Why doesn’t academia introduce this strategy to all their future economists? To be honest, most economists have never been introduced to Economic Democracy. They can’t teach what they don’t know. But in the 21st century, academia is largely dependent on corporate funding (i.e. the one percent) for their existence. So even if they are familiar with Economic Democracy, academicians can ill afford to introduce this revolutionary strategy to future economists without risking their own employment in the process. Bureaucrats (conventionalists) hardly ever rock the boat. What does Copernicus have to do with economics? Nothing. But he caused a seismic shift in the way people thought about the shape (flat vs spherical) of Planet Earth. If implemented, Economic Democracy will cause a similar seismic shift in the way people think about economics."

The origin of sending roses on Valentine's Day All along, roses are the common language used to express love all over the world. On Valentine's day, people choose to send valentine roses to express their love. In fact, the origin of sending roses on Valentine's Day is related to an ancient myth. According to the myth, people gradually get used to the custom of sending roses on Valentine's day. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite, the God of love, is so beautiful that it is sought after by countless admirers. Zeus is one of them, but they are all rejected by Aphrodite. Zeus held a grudge and married Hephaestus, the ugly and disabled God of fire. But Aphrodite did not love the God of fire, but the human Adonis. Adonis is a young man who loves hunting very much. Once, when he went out hunting, he was suddenly attacked by a fierce wild boar. Unfortunately, he was bitten off the main artery of his foot, and Adonis fell to the ground in pain. Aphrodite heard Adonis scream from afar. She was so anxious that she went to save her lover. The valley was covered with white roses. The thorny roses cut her feet and legs and spilled blood all the way. At the end of the story, Adonis dies, and the white roses in the valley stained with Aphrodite's blood turn into red roses. People are very moved by this fairy tale. The red rose stained with Aphrodite's blood has been regarded as a symbol of love since then. Usually on Valentine's day, a red rose will be presented to express the feelings between lovers. In today's Valentine's Day customs, flowers and chocolates have become indispensable for Valentine's day. They are also the most classic gifts given by men to women, showing their concentration, emotion and vitality.

We all know the origin of sending roses on Valentine's day. Now let's continue to understand the real meaning of sending valentine rose. The answer is still very surprising. The earliest true meaning of sending valentine roses In ancient Greek mythology, the meaning of sending roses on Valentine's Day is love, but in fact, there is another completely different explanation about the meaning of sending roses. In fact, Valentine's day is a festival commemorating a monk who marries young people. The king of France chose a son-in-law for his daughter on Valentine's day on February 14. The son-in-law he chose was a noble son. Because the marriage was appointed by the royal family, he had to agree. But in fact, there are many admirers around him. Now that he has become the son-in-law, in fact, he is also very uncomfortable. So on that day, he held a large bunch of roses and took the girls who were present at that time and had pursued him, one rose for each, saying that we should not go out with each other in the future. So the custom of sending roses on Valentine's day comes from this day, so what is the earliest real meaning of sending roses? In fact, it's ""we're over. I'll get along with others. We're out of business."". After reading this answer, do you feel afraid to send roses to the people you like? This is just a suggestion. After all, roses are the best flowers to express love in most people's eyes. If you really care, you can not send roses on February 14 White Valentine's day. Valentine's Day is coming on February 14. Valentine rose is the best choice for your lover. Red rose, pink rose and blue enchantress are all very good flowers to express your love."

20,Everything You Need To Know About Wind Turbine Technicians in the United States,social-issues," Introduction: Wind turbine service technicians also called Wind Tech’s maintain and install wind turbines. Wind turbines are massive mechanical gadgets that convert wind power into electrical energy. They are electronically monitored 24 hours a day and 7 days per week. When one thing goes wrong, a wind turbine technician is notified and they find yourself doing the repairs. That signifies that most of their days are spent way up high in a turbine performing maintenance or troubleshooting the turbine’s electrical, mechanical or hydraulic components and changing or fixing malfunctioning components. How is the job marketplace for wind turbine technician? Wind turbine technicians held about 7,000 jobs in 2019. The largest employers of wind turbine technicians had been as follows: As you can see in the pie chart, major employment opportunities for windtech’s professionals come from electric power generation(28%) followed by repair and maintenance(25%) sector companies. Pretty a lot all of these statistics are from the Department of Labor and sadly, they do not observe the earnings of business owners. One actually promising facet of turning into a wind turbine technician is that 14% of them are self-employed. To evaluate this to a number of the different occupations, 9% of HVAC techs are self-employed,9% of plumbers, about 6% of electricians and about 6% of welders. There positively are some tales of wind turbine technicians incomes far above the bottom salaries. Another factor from them to spice up their earnings is through overtime. This is a comparatively new occupation and really, the Department of Labor has solely been amassing statistics on them since 2012. Here are the job statistics numbers going again to 2012. There had been no labour statistics for this occupation earlier than 2012. In 2012, the federal government had 3,200 jobs after which by 2019 the federal government recorded 7000 jobs. So, in simply seven years, the variety of wind turbine technicians has been greater than doubled and it’s been rising in a short time. Also, the federal government is extraordinarily optimistic concerning the future job marketplace for wind turbine technicians. They are forecasting a 61% job progress from 2019 to 2029. This is a reasonably small occupation right now of solely about 7000 jobs. However, that is actually promising. The average occupation is anticipated to rise by around 5%. There is plenty of the reason why they’re anticipating such excessive job progress. Wind turbine towers with massive blades have decreased the price of wind energy and over time, it has been getting extra aggressive with coal & natural gas and other power generation. Here’s the major factor each single wind turbine throughout the nation requires upkeep. Hence, since increasingly more wind turbines are erected, increasingly more wind turbine techs might be wanted to keep up them. Skill standards for wind turbine technician: Skill standards are performance specifications that determine the information, abilities and talents a person wants to reach the office. They are important to bettering workforce abilities, elevating dwelling requirements and improving the competitiveness of the U.S. economic system. To be efficient, skill standards should indicate the consensus of trade professionals. Skill standards present measurable benchmarks of skill and benchmark achievement. They reply two important questions: What do employees must know and have the ability to do to reach today’s workplace? And how do we all know when employees are performing properly? Without this basic info, employers have no idea whom to hire or where to focus their restricted training dollars. Employees and new entrants to the workforce have no idea what they should do to enhance their performance. Educators have no idea how to prepare students for the challenges of the workplace. Wind turbine technician job descriptions: Maybe accountable to carry out a mix of the next duties primarily based upon the project: Troubleshoot and diagnose electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic malfunctions. Work with complicated wind-related directions and procedures in addition to diagrams. Perform mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical part service on wind turbines. Carry out repairs and prognosis of turbine operations issues within the service space. Execute vital guarantee and scheduled service work in accordance with the turbine provider specifications. Identify and report present and anticipated issues with the wind farm. Performing different duties as associated with the place.

Scenario: Daily Routine The single most routine and most essential job there may be on a wind plant is scheduled to service. After the turbine has been put in it’s sometimes scheduled for service one to 3 instances a year relying on the turbine manufacturer. Performing thorough service on a constant schedule prevents or considerably reduces future upkeep and restore work. Service is usually scheduled out from the beginning updates or by the variety of run hours. The first scheduled service is the start-up service, at 500 hours of operation. Each manufacturer writes a selected service guideline, or protocol, which needs to be adopted. This is to make sure the perfect operation of the turbine and to not void any warranty obligations of the manufacture. There are also different service guidelines for the start-up, semi-annual (or six months), and annual services. These scheduled services are systematic check and repair of the turbine components and operations. This sometimes consists of: Stretching base bolts (start-up services). Torquing bolts from the tower to the blades. This could be executed with hydraulic powered torque pumps or handheld torque wrenches. Visual inspections of elements (from the ladder through the hub). Verifying appropriate operation of components (hydraulic and mechanical). Greasing bearings and verifying fluid levels (Gear oils and hydraulic fluids). Replacing oil and breather filters. Verifying proper operation of brushes, slip-rings, and different electrical/digital elements. Another issue to bear in mind is that after the start-up service, project managers will attempt to work their service schedules round annual weather patterns. In the perfect case, these companies can be carried out in anticipation of the windy and peak demand seasons to be able to guarantee high performance during inclement weather and peak demand intervals. Other weather factors which might be thought-about embrace lightning, snow, freezing rain, and so on. Some of the core abilities that a service technician needs includes: Ability to learn, perceive, and comply with maintenance/service protocols. Knowledge of electrical and mechanical tooling, together with function. Knowledge and understanding of electrical energy (AC, DC, high/medium/low voltages). Know-how and understanding of hydraulics (brakes and/or blade/tip pitching). Knowledge and understanding of gearing. Comprehension and understanding of fasteners and torquing. Knowledge and understanding of lubrication (oil & greases). Learning and comprehending of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). Knowledge and understanding of weather patterns. In 2012, the nationwide base salary was recorded at $ 48,320 per year. By the year May 2020, the nationwide base salary was recorded at $53,111 per year within the United States. These are base salaries which can be boosted with overtime. You can anticipate $8,250 in overtime per year. This is a comparatively small occupation now. However, it’s anticipated to develop by leaps and bounds. On the other hand, you need to bear in mind that this is a very regional occupation. Certain states are utterly off-limits. Here’s a map the place all the roles are Texas, California, Illinois and Iowa are nice states for this occupation. All the white areas on this map have only a few or no jobs for wind turbine technicians.

1,Low desire and lack of intimacy epidemic,social-issues," This time of year, and specially with everything that’s going on, we might be feeling raw, sensitive, antsy, edgy, anxious, stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, unmotivated, lethargic, detached numb, and such. These feelings are more compounded when we are feeling disconnected, might be experiencing a bout of low intimacy, and have fewer opportunities for fun. This doesn’t help the low desire and lack of intimacy epidemic of the modern-day couple… A challenging trifecta: Feeling disconnected from our partner is usually accompanied by low desire and intimacy. We need connection to be physically intimate (usually women, female energy) and/or we need physical intimacy to be connected (usually men, male energy)… This creates a conundrum for couples. This conundrum has a tendency to create an impasse for couples, for the partners might need the opposite of what the other needs to become intimate and feel connected… Made even more challenging by physical intimacy also depending on the partners’ desire (libido, sex drive) and their ability to be intimate... You’d think it’d be easy to enjoy the benefit and gift of physical intimacy in our relationship! There is so much that gets in the way of desire and intimacy for partners… The 5 culprits of low intimacy (totally exacerbated with the ongoing pandemic!). In a nutshell: Exhaustion – you are too tired, your libido is dead Domesticity – your roles are squashing your male/female attraction energy Expectations – the noise in your head doesn’t allow you to get in your body Enmeshment – you are too together to experience the allure Boredom – there isn’t enough positive stimulation in your life and relationship Your desire is at the mercy of your physiology and psychology: Hormones which regulate energy, drive, motivation, mood and even your arousal Self-esteem Body image Your desire and intimacy are at risk with any actual physical or medical conditions: Cardiovascular disease Diabetes Prostate cancer Breast cancer Childbirth Menopause/Andropause To name a few Stress has a huge impact on your wellbeing, lifestyle and coping choices which in turn also affect your libido. We all have our stresses, and our current world is just heaping it on. And no comment on the impact on lifestyle… And of course, then we have the actual couple dynamics, and most likely your power struggle, at play to boot! Not for nothing the modern-day couple (and specially during this pandemic times) has difficulties sustaining consistent and satisfying intimacy in their relationship. There are a ton of entry points from where to address your current low desire and lack of intimacy. Addressing any (or combo as needed) of the items mentioned above will make a difference in your current state of affairs. But I want to offer you the most direct path for more immediate relief… You see, your libido, sexuality and physical intimacy with your partner is what you make of it… At the end of the day, desire and intimacy is an inside job… You have control over your own desire… When you focus on what your partner is doing, how they look, how they are showing up, what they contribute and such, you are extinguishing your desire… Desire is not about your partner. Desire is about you! Desire as an inside job has to do with How You Choose To: Create health and vitality Look at your partner (get out of their circle!) Interact and bring Swag Be available and have energy Ready yourself for sexy time Relax and show up Be grace-full, grateful, and generous So, you see, desire and intimacy are not something that are happening out there and that depend on your partner. Desire and intimacy are something you create… When you shift to looking at desire and intimacy as something you create, then you can create as much of it as you want! ASSIGNMENT: Watch what scripts came up for you as you read this post, and as you percolate with this concept… Victimize yourself Get in your partner’s circle Entertain your limiting believes Sabotage intimacy Have a hard time trusting and letting go Are stingy giving, receiving, allowing Are not fully Being… Make a commitment to Be in your relationship… Select the item that resonates the most as something that gets in the way of your intimacy and decide to address it full on! Create health and vitality Look at your partner (get out of their circle!) Interact and bring Swag Be available and have energy Ready yourself for sexy time Relax and show up Be grace-full, grateful, and generous Taking charge of your desire and intimacy is super empowering and exhilarating! What better time to embrace this as we continue to be impacted by the pandemic, are starting a new year, and are right around the corner from Valentine’s Day… Make a commitment to reset your relationship and your marriage.

2,American Express Company (AmEx),social-issues," AmEx is the American based multinational company that offers financial services. It was started in 1850 but was not incorporated until 1965. So, it has been operating for almost 160 years. This company is usually known for its credit and charge cards. This company is vital for analysis since it accounts for almost 25% of the American’s credit card market, revenue and transactions. The company has approximately 52 million cards in circulation in the US alone, and 51 million cards in the rest of the world. From these statistics, one can deduce the number of customers the company has. The company offers its financial services to businesses and consumers worldwide. In order to attract its customers, AmEx has good offers on the most of its credit cards. For example, their Premier Rewards Gold card facilitates purchases in groceries, travel, dining and retail. It further charges credit card annual fees of as low as $0 in their Blue Sky credit card. Most of their credit cards have bonuses, rewards and online purchases possibility. The Blue card for businesses enables the retailer to reward customers and employees. In customer reviews, there are complaints about their high interest rates in some of their cards and failures to recognise customer loyalty and reward them accordingly. Furthermore, customers claim that most of AmEx’s representatives are rude. Despite this, some customers are satisfied with the creditworthiness rewards by AmEx with some reporting that their credit limits increased with the scores earned at every purchase. AmEx, with its numerous credit card portfolio, is unbiased on income group or age it mostly supports. However, most of its purchases are made by the Premier Rewards Gold card which indicates that its customer portfolio is mainly consumer driven. The interest rate of the Gold credit card is $0 for the first year of use and $175 thereafter. Thus, apart from the first year of use, the interest rate is fixed. In this particular card, AmEx has a late payment fee of $25 per month. One earns two miles for every dollar spent on Delta purchases and is awarded up to 25,000 membership rewards for spending $2000 in the first 3 months after obtaining the credit card. Other bonuses include 15,000 points if one spends $30,000 in a year. For the new users, the credit limit is set at $2000 but increases as one’s score increases. Based on my current situation and future forecast, I will opt for the Premier rewards Gold card since it is the one that will suit me as I move to the college in the next five years. If I am to start building on points and scores right now by the time I am doing my purchases for the college, I will be able to utilize their rewards such as: Purchase protection: Any product I shall buy with the credit card, for my college, is reimbursed if it gets damaged or stolen in my initial days. Return protection: If the seller would not accept my item back, Amex will cover the same amount I used to purchase the product. Warranty extension: Given the college situation, any electronics I purchase using this card will have an extended warranty. The card offers exclusive access to the concert and sporting events tickets. I intend to attend concerts and sporting events while at college. The card offers are great since they allow purchases before the actual ticket sale begins. It is prudent to use the credit cards wisely. In order to use my credit card positively, I shall reserve it for purchases that are extremely necessary and if they happen to be expensive. Furthermore, I shall use it sparingly when purchasing concert tickets, laptop, radio and personal effects being in the college.

3,Bridging the Deep Political Divide of 2021…Economically,social-issues," What if, in the midst of this unprecedented 21st century health/economic crisis, we could systematically reconfigure America’s free market economy in such a way that would… Balance the budget, minimize the need for and the cost of the social safety net, eventually pay off the national debt, and in the process satisfy the small government, fiscal conservatives on the right, all while… Leveling the economic playing field in such a way that every American, (regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, political or religious orientation) has an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY to participate and to live a meaningful life in the USA, which would satisfy the liberal, progressives on the left…SIMULTANEOUSLY? With America reeling in the wake of the recent white nationalists sponsored, terrorist attack/ insurrection in Washington, DC, and in a moment when we’re currently more divided than we’ve been since the Civil War, such a unifying possibility sounds like pie in the sky, wishful thinking at best. But consider the following “outside the box” scenario and see if you think that it just might bridge America’s deep political divide of 2021, beginning with the economy? Starting With the Facts… Let’s start with a couple of important FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. With a current population of about 330 million people that translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the pandemic, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks” ($1,200 with more on the way from the new Biden /Harris administration)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the American ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which theoretically should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Strategy That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology, which generally EXCLUDES WE THE PEOPLE. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that would predictably generate enough future profits to pay for the purchase and create residual incomes for their owners •	And then insured every single transaction in case it fails to pay off? This strategy is called ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading). Because each transaction is instantly collateralized and insured, it creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and costs American taxpayers NOTHING. Because each transaction is instantly collateralized and insured, it creates NO LONG-TERM CONSUMER DEBT. And since it does not dilute the value of existing currency with government debt backed dollars (it just gives everyone equal access to the ownership side of America's economy) it creates NO INFLATION! What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help democratize/stabilize America’s free market economy •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who still actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	PAY OFF OUR MASSIVE NATIONAL DEBT! •	And potentially bridge the deep political divide of 2021 starting with the economy! One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. And the retirement benefits would at least minimize if not eliminate the need for Social Security! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As a result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, etc.) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration (including Obama/Biden) had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Frequently Asked Questions: Where does all the money come from? The money comes from historically predictable GROWTH. That is to say it comes in the form of NEW, FUTURE EARNINGS/ DIVIDENDS (not from tapping into one’s current savings or putting a second mortgage on the family home). Does it raise taxes? No! It lowers current taxpayers’ burden by creating millions of new tax payers who will help carry that burden and eventually pay off the national debt. Is Economic Democracy similar to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan/ESOP? Yes. But instead of covering just those who work for employee-owned companies and who have access to an ESOP, Economic Democracy uses the same strategy to cover everyone (regardless of age, gender, race, religion) most of whom lack the required means to participate in the (predictably profitable) ownership side of the American economy. How does Economic Democracy reduce wage slavery in the US? By giving everyone (as opposed to a few) legitimate access to the ownership side of the US economy (where almost all then new wealth is generated) and creating residual incomes for everyone in the process, Economic Democracy reduces the necessity for anyone to sell their most productive hours of the day (week, month, year, life) to an employer in exchange for a pay check with which to pay their bills. Who will pick up the garbage, harvest the produce, wait the tables, and flip the hamburgers? Who will do the dirty work if everyone has a steady residual income to depend on? Good question. Since robots are quickly replacing repeatable/mechanical jobs across the nation, the bloody robots should be able to answer that question for us. Why would the mainstream media fail to inform “we the people” about such a revolutionary economic strategy? Quite simply, the entire mainstream media (including CNN and MSNBC) is owned and controlled by the one percent. And the one percent prefers to keep “we the people” under control and in the dark about revolutionary ideas that threaten to undermine their concentrated wealthy/power. We’re allowed to see and hear what media owners allow us to see and hear. In other words, America’s mainstream media delivers little more than profitable propaganda that, in the long run, supports concentrated wealth/power. Why doesn’t academia introduce this strategy to all their future economists? To be honest, most economists themselves have never been introduced to Economic Democracy. They can’t teach what they don’t know. But in the 21st century, academia is largely dependent on corporate funding (i.e. the one percent) for their existence. So even if they are familiar with Economic Democracy, academicians can ill afford to introduce this revolutionary strategy to future economists without risking their own employment in the process. Bureaucrats (conventionalists) hardly ever rock the boat. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax, future earnings generated from secured, wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT, NO COMSUMER DEBT, and NO INFLATION! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
4,Small-Souled Bugmen,social-issues," Not to be confused with the gigantic insect — the alienated man — of Kafka’s Metamorphosis, the small-souled bugman is very much a ‘well-adjusted’, fully integrated neuron in today’s neoliberalist techno-corporate hive mind. A consequence of a perilously overpopulated, brutally capitalistic, shamelessly hedonistic, morally decaying society, the humble bugman has come to define an age of technological dystopia in which everyone has everything — their gadgets, their fast foods, their fashion accessories — but somehow everyone also has nothing — no community, no natural spirit, no substance of mind. He is a zombified consumer, an emasculated wage slave, a vessel emptied of meaning and refilled with plastic, pixels and silicone. He is what a sterile corporate wasteland spews out. Millions of him, almost exact replicas who are relentlessly told they are unique by clever marketers, and who believe it. He is a personality defined by brands, a blue-checkmarked Twitter user. Bugmen are what we get when a culture is infantilized, watered down and stripped of the very intellectual, philosophical and honourable fibre that once made it great. Totally dependent on the compromised support of his nanny state and high-tech devices, the bugman has been reduced to the status of a domestic animal. A 200-pound child. And like a child, the bugman’s shallowness keeps him malleable to the fleeting whims and fads of a degenerate, smartphone-addicted, dopamine-hooked society. He bases his identity on passing trends that to him appear profound, priding himself on being a ‘step ahead’ of his peers — an ‘early adopter’ — not realizing it’s the marketer who’s always a step ahead of him. He is the millennial test subject, the lab rat brand loyalty experts are paid $20,000 an hour to pigeonhole. First in line for the latest Apple iPhone, he actively supports the unchecked rise of AI and notions of planetary relocation. Things didn’t always look so bleak for the bugman. He grew up in fortunate circumstances. Middle-class parents who raised him well, sent him to a good college. Oversocialization afforded him effortless acceptance into a mentally sick civilization, but sorely missing, unbeknownst to him, was the lack of any meaningful struggle; the grueling initiations that turn boys into men. His mental development had been stunted in the real sense at the expense of engineering a successful and painless assimilation into a clown world fueled by idiocy, deception and frivolity. The bugman now occupies one of two living situations. One, the city bugman lives atop, beneath and besides his fellow bugs in what is an actual human-scale bug colony, hence the name. Two, the suburban bugman living just as unnaturally and miserably, lined up in careful symmetry among neighbours he will never know and trees that will never grow, house by house, street by street, as far as the eye can see. The deliberate draining of purpose and passion from the bugman’s soul made it easy to assign him without complaint to a vapid, good-boy ‘job’ and a ‘career’ that does little but prop up the demented corporatist structure. He is a willing cog in the grinding bullshit machine — a marketer, an analyst, a ‘project manager’ — or has perhaps handed his life over to preserving the insanity of the state by becoming a lawyer or a bureaucrat. Worse yet, he gobbled up the STEM dream sold by grubby toy merchants, dooming himself to an existence of zeroes and ones. Zero purpose. One sad bugman. So cowed by his masters, the bugman is fiercely loyal to faceless corporations in what appears to be a society-wide occurrence of Stockholm syndrome. Terrified of being exposed as the fraud that he is, he hands over his mind to be reshaped like putty until it fits the robotic cubicle farm mould. Before long he is sending out 150 emails a day in which he promises to “touch base” and “leverage the data”. He’ll climb the imaginary ladder, all the while nagged by a vague sense of emptiness and a dormant rage that might see him off to an early grave. Failing to find fulfilment in his work, the bugman has become fully immersed in Content, Digital Socializing and Entertainment. Facing the monumental task of salvaging his soul, he has instead resorted to seeking escape at every turn. He upgrades his 60” 4K TV to a 75” 4K TV. He buys more video games and a virtual reality set, finds a pot dealer and gets a prescription for anti-depressants. An avid Netflix binger, cinema goer and Spotify subscriber, he echoes pretentious magazine reviews by referring to mediocre works of popular culture as “urgent” and “life-affirming”. Blinded by his inability to consume anything beneath the surface of spoon-fed, easily-digested, created-by-committee mainstream productions, he will never come to know the transcendence of actual genius — towering authors, musical virtuosos or glorious artists — stuff that might make his soul bigger. The bugman’s diet is in equal parts nutritionally inadequate and inexplicably expensive. He has made eating an unnecessarily complicated act by falling for the mutually-marketed falsehoods that food can be improved with technology — see ‘health food’ snacks sold in recycled cardboard — and that preparing food properly is a waste of time and effort. Thus, everything he buys comes in packaging, produced in a lab, deviously salt or sugar-laden. Physical exercise is not part of his life, so the result is an atrophied muscular structure, formations of fatty tissue insulating his vital organs, and pale, flaky skin. The bugman is intensely focused on making his life more ‘efficient’. If he outsources every chore and foregoes starting a family, he will have more time to consume and more time to whittle away on his pointless job and fashionable hobbies. He has his groceries delivered and asks Alexa to update him on the day’s news. Gamification via $3.99 apps has taken over virtually every aspect of his life. This, to the bugman, is progress. When it comes to sports, bugmen can be neatly divided into two distinct groupings. Sports is either not part of his life — the nerdbug — or it is one of his defining characteristics — the jockbug. The latter, once a promising athlete, now watches on beer and betting slip-in-hand as blaring, sanitized SPORTS! is beamed into his retinas, relieving his brain of any signs of life that might have otherwise surfaced. Jockbugs have been known to spend as many as 30 hours a week consuming SPORTS!, and even more reading/talking about it. Social media is the bugman’s public square. This is where he ‘debates’, makes jokes and flaunts his status and moral virtue to the hive. This is where he seeks respite from the alienation of modern life, but never quite seems to find it. He flicks through his Twitter feed aimlessly, chuckles along to Jimmy Kimmel clips on YouTube, and smugly describes himself as “socially liberal and fiscally conservative” in New York Times comments sections. The bugman’s severe paucity of skepticism has led him down a mainstream media-saturated path of tech adulation, social justice fallacies and “progress”-at-all-costs morality. The dearth of historical, rational and spiritual context in his mind leaves only the possibility of suffering in the panicked bustle of the present day, antenna twitching in response to the prevailing Bad News. The bugman cares little that the world has been irrevocably corrupted and damaged by Machiavellian technologists and shady bureaucrats. If he is not in fact one of them, he whole-buggedly buys into their UN-endorsed missions to bring about ‘world peace’, to ‘end poverty’, and other such feel-good nonsense. He is oblivious to the toxic impact of the corporations and globalist think tanks that exist purely to feed his consumerist impulses and create the economic artifice that sustains such behavior. He’s the archetypal useful idiot, keeping everything he thinks he stands against in perfect working order. He conceals his intellectual cowardice amid ideological rhetoric and Orwellian newspeak. Cogent debate and the search for truth are challenges to his dominance of public discourse, so the bugman must become masterful at distorting arguments in a desperate attempt to portray himself as the well-reasoned and righteous party. Beware of his powerful toolkit, including but not limited to virtue signalling, cries of “hate speech”, straw man arguments, and ad hominem attacks. This all sprouts from his fear of countering the ‘correct’ views of the day. If he simply parrots mainstream commentary, he can be sure of being on the right side of history. Despite all the inhumanity and misery of a bugman’s life laid before you, be assured it is no mean feat to come across one in person who reveals his trauma. He will present himself invariably as polite, gentle, happy and ‘nice’. He is remarkably non-confrontational, avoiding controversy at virtually any cost. PC culture has him shaken, terrified of being ostracized for wrongthink. This is the bugman’s tough outer shell, and it will never be penetrated. Underneath this shell lies his small soul, searching fruitlessly for subsistence. While he may carry himself with an air of intellectual and moral superiority, the bugman has stopped asking the big questions. He can distantly recall the sense of awe he felt as a child, those times looking up at the stars and the moon; those times reflecting on his ancestry, where he came from, the history and traditions of mankind and the wild beauty of Earth. Now his mind is so distracted by pixelated inanity, trash culture and his ridiculous job that he cannot, for the love of god, simply sit and think. He can no longer be at peace or derive joy from nature and blissful simplicity. He feels frustration over his powerlessness to bring an end to the mysterious forces chipping away at his soul day by day, but does nothing about it. And so he remains, indefinitely and emphatically, a small-souled bugman. Read my free novella Under-Toronto, set in a dystopian 2080 where bugmanism reigns supreme.

6,What are the Irresistible Charms of Mature Women?,social-issues," Time takes away the youthful face of a woman, but it cannot take away the mature charm that a woman has accumulated during her growth. The charm that a mature woman exudes is the carving of time, the gift of time, and the unique light that young girls don't have. Therefore, women do not have to fear of aging; letting your hearts mature is the best way to resist the invasion of time. Cougars are mature women older than 35 years old. Therefore, what are the irresistible charms of cougars? Extreme tenderness, downplay all conflicts When they are young, many women have more radical personalities, and they are prone to conflicts in life. Young and beautiful is the most precious treasure of these girls, but they are often too dazzling and lose their tenderness. For mature cougars, gentleness is their most precious treasure. The extreme gentleness that downplays all conflicts makes middle-aged women exude unique charm. Super strong communication skills, transform all contradictions into invisible Disputes and quarrels cannot solve any problems, but only intensify the conflicts between the two parties. Mature women have seen this through and they have mastered good communication skills. No matter what kind of conflict they encounter, they can sit down and talk calmly and calmly instead of arguing. Those seemingly insoluble contradictions become invisible under their superb communication skills. Exquisite life, exude the fragrance of life Mature women have more refined requirements for their life. The exquisiteness exuding from them is not expensive cosmetics or jewelries, but the little exquisiteness of life. With a little care, a beautiful arrangement and an exquisite dish convey the exquisite fragrance of mature women and make them more attractive. Reasonable quality, never entangled Cougars have a mature worldview system in their hearts. In their minds, what happened is not just to be arrogant, but to show truth and reason. They don't want to use their female advantages to win a debate. It's their rule of life to persuade the others with reasons, to let others be convinced, or to be convinced by others without any resentment. The glory of motherhood, the most sacred power Mature woman exudes the radiance of motherhood. Some mature women are married and have children; some women are single moms.  Their love for children exudes the most sacred power. A woman is weak in nature, but she is strong when she is a mother. Good qualities such as tenacity and kindness will gradually accumulate in the mother because of the appearance of the child. This mature temperament reveals a sacred maternal brilliance and is a bright aura of mature women. Independent self, never yield to anyone Mature women know that their parents will get old, their partners may not be able to accompany them for a lifetime, and their children have their own lives. Therefore, they do not rely on anyone and never give in to anyone in life. Economic independence and spiritual independence make mature women appear more radiant. In this world, all people who rely on others can only be beautiful, but not charming. Real mature and charming women must be independent, so they don't need to give in to anyone. Emotional message: time is fleeting, time is in a hurry, and even the perfect face will gradually grow old under the devastation of time. It is better to work harder on your soul than to take care of your appearance. Let yourself have these radiant advantages of mature women. No matter how fast the time goes, it will not take away your charm after all. Your charm will only become more and more fragrant as time goes by."
7,How to Turn Your Passion Into a Career,social-issues," If you don't love your work, you aren't alone. According to Forbes, more than half of Americans are unhappy in their jobs. You don't have to stay in this position for the rest of your life, however. If you have a hobby you are passionate about, why not transform it into a business or career path? MJW Careers helps people find satisfaction in their professional lives, offering services like coaching and resume writing to help you find a path that doesn't just pay the bills but also makes you happy. Services like these can get you off on the right foot when transitioning to a new career. This guide provides more tips and tools to help you make the move to a more fulfilling profession. Prepare your mind to conquer career change. A career change may be just as nerve-wracking as it is exciting. Prepare yourself mentally for the transition. Psychology Today recommends breaking down major life shifts into smaller pieces so that you don't become overwhelmed. Don't expect to complete your transition from employee to entrepreneur overnight. Write down a step-wise plan of what you need to do, from establishing a business entity to creating a website. Get your surroundings ready for change. The majority of entrepreneurs (69%) start by working from home. Set up a space where you can pursue your passion in peace with minimal distraction from kids, pets, and spouses. Stores like Best Buy have all the basic office equipment you need, like a laptop, printer, webcam, and smartphone. Save money by looking for a Best Buy coupon or two online. Hang on to your receipts for tax season. You may be able to write off such business expenses. Define your passion. Before you quit your day job, take the time to clearly define your passion, and consider how you can parlay it into a career or business. For example, say you love to bake. That's great! How do you want to make money out of it? Do you want to open up a bakery or establish an eCommerce platform specifically for baked goods? Consider your background to further consider what job title best aligns with your goals. For instance, if you currently work in online marketing, opening an eCommerce shop allows you to tap into the skills you already have. Do your research. To make your business or freelance endeavor a success, you need to identify an unmet need in the marketplace. Research what consumers want as well as what products and services similar to your concept are already out there. The entrepreneur has a guide to different types of market research you can conduct, such as primary interviews with your target consumer and data collection via the internet. Alternatively, if you are looking to remain employed but shift to a new field, figure out what skills and credentials you'll need. Get the needed certifications. Once you've defined the niche your product or service will address, ensure you have the qualifications and capacity to deliver on that need. Say you're passionate about cars and even build them as a hobby, for example. You've decided to open an auto body shop in your town. However, to work as a mechanic, you should get a certification. Check local community colleges for these kinds of professional and technical education programs. Create a plan. A business plan summarizes the financial and operational objectives of your business. It's basically the blueprint you will follow for success. Northeastern University offers an overview of factors to consider as you draft your plan, from finances to management. The U.S. Small Business Administration is another fantastic resource and provides handy business plan examples. If you aren't planning to start a business but want to transition to a new field, write down the steps to get there, such as starting with an internship. Making a career transition is both exciting and intimidating. Follow the steps above to make the process easier. While it will be stressful at times, it will be worth it when you end up with a new job or business of your own that you are truly passionate about.

8,"In a relationship, does age matter?",social-issues," This may be a pity for most people who are deeply in love. Is age really that important in love? Let’s talk. In “The Garden of Words” by Xin Haicheng, the hostess is a teacher-student relationship, and there is an age difference between them, but it triggers love. Perhaps in the eyes of most people, this is destined to be a fruitless relationship between teachers and students. Although the final result was indeed a pity, the people who clearly loved each other did not come together. This also makes us think about the influence of age on love. In “The Garden of Words”, men and women do not know each other when they meet, although after several contacts and chats, their relationship seems to have become closer. Before they really understand each other’s feelings, they don’t understand each other at all. Name, age, occupation, etc., neither party knew anything. After chatting for a few days under the same pavilion, the buds of love grew quietly. However, as a result, the 12-year-old age gap eventually killed the relationship in its budding state. It seems that the world always cannot tolerate two lovers together smoothly. If the age gap is too large, the experience and experience of the two will be different, which will lead to a lack of common topics between the lovers. Because one party is busy with a business, there is no time to spend together. These objective problems can hinder the relationship between lovers. From these perspectives, age does bring troubles to relationships. After all, there will be no generation gap between people of the same age. Under the same social experience, they supervise each other, make progress, and are full of positive love. Two people getting better together is undoubtedly the greatest affirmation of this relationship. The age gap may prevent two people from being together, but he cannot prevent the birth of love. When two people fall in love, they are either attracted by the other’s charm or fight for the other’s sincerity. The process of love will not be hindered by age differences. The ancients also said of forgetting the year. However, to love a person, appreciate his character, fall in love with his heart, and be deeply immersed in his tenderness. If you really meet such a person, his words and deeds are in line with your wishes, why don’t you pursue them? In this mutual heartbeat, does age still matter? Do we have any taboos against the one we love? Definitely not! It’s not easy to meet people you like each other, and you can’t miss it because of the age difference! What the age gap brings is nothing more than a generation gap in thought and accusations from people around us. We must live for ourselves, and we must fight for the love in our hearts. At this time, readers believe that age is not important in the face of love! If you two truly love each other, be together. Nothing can separate you, money is not good, public opinion is not good, and age is not good! If you meet someone you are destined to, and chase it bravely, in the face of love, age is never a problem."
9,An Open Letter to President Elect Biden and Vice President Elect Harris: On Democratizing the American Economy,social-issues," Dear Joe and Kamala, Please consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE-TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY (a.k.a. Capital Homesteading) would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And yes, pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Economic Democracy would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Now imagine the retirement benefits!! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution Has Been Totally Ignored!!! If any previous administration (including Obama/Biden) had implemented Economic Democracy, today’s COVID 19/Unemployment crisis would not be such a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. But to date this Copernican revolution in economics has been completely ignored. But then, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s high time we seriously consider innovation! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Economic Democracy, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy."
10,"LGBT Statistics: How many people are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender?",social-issues," As the LGBTQ+ population moves to become more accepted in the United States, many are wondering just how many people are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender? Simply put, 4.5% of Americans identify as LGBT. However, this percentage can be continued to be broken down based on how these LGBT individuals identify in specific, as well as based on location, age, race, gender, and more. Before exploring these LGBT statistics, it is important to understand how we will define ‘gay’ in this article. Often times, the word ‘gay’ is used as an umbrella term to cover every individual identifying as LGBTQ+. In this case, however, we will use it to explicitly define male homosexuality, as this will eliminate confusion when designating gay population vs. LGBT population. LGBT Statistics (Top Picks) 1.7% of individuals in the US identify as being either gay or lesbian 1.8% of individuals in the US identify as being bisexual An estimated 19 million Americans (8.2% of US population) have engaged in same-sex sexual behavior An estimated 25.6 million Americans (11% of US population) have acknowledged same-sex attraction. 63% of Americans reported that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This was a 123% increase from the same report in 2006. 4.5% of adult Americans (about 11 million people) identified as LGBT. In 2012, 3.5% of adult Americans (about 8.3 Million people) identified as LGBT. 5.1% of women identify as LGBT. Only 3.9% of men identify as LGBT. 0.6% of adults (1.3 million people) in the United States identify as transgender. 0.7% of adults ages 18-24 identify as transgender. 9.6% of youth ages 18-24 identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 12% of Millennials identify as transgender or gender nonconforming 0.6% of adults age 25 to 64 identify as transgender. 0.5% of adults age 65 or older identify as transgender. 58% of LGBT individuals are white, 21% are Latino(a), 12% are black, 5% are more than one race, 2% are Asian, 1% are American Indian, and 1% are pacific islander. 42% of LGBT individuals are male, and 58% are female. Article Contents What percentage of people are gay or lesbian? What percentage of the population is LGBTQ? How many transgender people are there in the US? What percent of youth are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender? What percentage of Americans are gay by age, race, and gender? Due to the lack of LGBTQ+ specific research, it has always been difficult to estimate the size of the LGBT population. Oftentimes, the reports that do attempt to determine these statistics are inaccurate or outdated. That is why we decided to dedicate our team to research and compile a list of statistics that are both recent and from reputed sources. In doing so, we created a list of everything you need to know about the LGBTQ+ population. Gay Population Percentage in the US What percentage of people are gay or lesbian? Based on LGBT specific population research in America, it is estimated that the percentage of gay and lesbian people in the US is 1.7%. However, this only includes those individuals that specifically identify themselves as gay or lesbian. Key Statistics: 1.7% of individuals in the US identify as being either gay or lesbian An estimated 19 million Americans (8.2% of US population) have engaged in same-sex sexual behavior An estimated 25.6 million Americans (11% of US population) have acknowledged same-sex attraction. 63% of Americans reported that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This was a 123% increase from the same report in 2006. Results from similar research show that 8.2% of the US population (19 million Americans) has engaged in same-sex sexual behavior, and 11% of the US population (25.6 million Americans) has acknowledged same-sex attraction. If you are wondering what percent of men or women are gay in specific, this data is a bit harder to find, and the results are scattered. Though the identified gay and lesbian population makes up less than 2% of the population, 63% of Americans have reported that homosexuality should be accepted by society. What is especially interesting about this statistic is that it is a 123% increase from the same research ten years prior. This statistic illustrates the rise in acceptance of the LGBT community as a whole. LGBTQ+ Population Percentage What percentage of the population is LGBTQ? The LGBT population in the US as a whole makes up 4.5% of adults or about 11 million people. This is a significant rise from the same report 5 years prior in which 3.5%, or 8.3 million people, identified as LGBT. This rise has been consistent over the years, and it can be assumed that the numbers in the near future may be at least a full percentage higher. Key Statistics: 4.5% of adult Americans (about 11 million people) identified as LGBT 5.1% of women identify as LGBT 3.9% of men identify as LGBT. 1.8% of individuals in the US identify as being bisexual When breaking down the LGBT population based on gender, there is a significant difference between the number of women who identify as LGBT vs. the number of men. 5.1% of women identify as LGBT, while only 3.9% of men identify as LGBT. These numbers can be broken down further based on whether the individual identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. As listed in the previous section, the number of people identifying as gay and lesbian is 1.7%. 1.8% of American adults identify as being bisexual. The statistics for transgender individuals can be found below (0.6%). The LGBT population statistics also vary by location within the United States. The area with the highest concentration of LGBT individuals is Washington D.C. An estimated 9.8% of the Washington D.C. population identifies as LGBT. The area with the lowest amount of LGBT individuals is North Dakota. Only 2.7% of individuals in North Dakota identify as LGBT. Transgender Population Percentage in the US How many transgender people are there in the US? Of the LGBT population as a whole, we have broken down the specific percentage of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals. The percentage of transgender people in the US is an estimated 0.6% of the adult population or about 1.3 million people. As with the LGBT population as a whole, this varies based on location within the United States. California has the highest percent of transgender individuals at 0.76%. Nebraska has the lowest percent of transgender individuals at 0.39%. Key Statistics: 0.6% of adults (1.3 million people) in the United States identified as transgender. LGBTQ+ Youth Statistics What percent of youth are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender? With the large difference in LGBT identification among age groups, many may wonder what percent of youth are LGBT? LGBT youth statistics are difficult to measure under the age of 18, so these youth statistics are based on the ages of 18-24. 9.6% of youth ages 18-24 identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. This is more than twice the amount of the entire adult population. Key Statistics: 9.6% of youth ages 18-24 identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 0.7% of adults between the ages of 18 and 24 identify as transgender. 12% of Millennials (individuals age 18-34) identify as transgender or gender nonconforming Millennials are most likely to be Allies (63%) When it comes to identifying as transgender, there is also a noticeable increase in identification. 0.7% of adults between the ages of 18 and 24 identify as transgender. This is over a 16% increase in identification when compared to the entire adult population. When it comes to generations, Millennials (individuals age 18-34) have a large amount of LGBT identification. 12% of Millenials identify as either transgender or nonconforming. In addition, this generation is overall very supportive of the LGBT population as a whole, with over 63% of Millennials identifying as allies to the community. LGBTQ+ Population Demographics in the US What percentage of Americans are gay by age, race, and gender? LGBT statistics vary based on population demographics, including age, race, and gender. As discussed in the previous section, the population of youth has an increased LGBT identification. In fact, 20% of the LGBT community as a whole is between the ages of 18 and 34. This is especially high compared to 35-51-year-olds, which comprises 12% of the LGBT population. As the age increases, this gap widens, with only 7% of the LGBT population being 52-71 and 5% of the LGBT population being 72+. When it comes to race, the majority of LGBT individuals are white. 58% of LGBT individuals are white, 21% are Latino(a), 12% are black, 5% are more than one race, 2% are Asian, 1% are American Indian, and 1% are pacific islander. This makes sense, as the majority of individuals in the United States are white. However, whites are somewhat less likely (3.6%) than blacks (4.6%), Hispanics (5.4%), and Asians (4.9%) to say they are LGBT. In terms of gender, the majority of gender-specific individuals who identify as LGBT are female at 58%. Women are also more likely to identify as LGBT among the population as 5.1% of women as a whole identify as LGBT, as opposed to 3.9% of men. Key Statistics: 20% of LGBT between 18-34 (2017) 12% of lgbt between 35-51 (2017) 7% of lgbt between 52-71 (2017) 5% of lgbt 72+ (2017) 58% of LGBT individuals are white, 21% are latino(a), 12% are black, 5% are more than one race, 2% are asian, 1% are american indian, and 1% are pacific islander. 3.6% of whites identify as LGBT 4.6% of blacks identify as LGBT 5.4% of Hispanics identify as LGBT 4.9% of Asians identify as LGBT 42% of LGBT individuals are male, and 58% are female. 5.1% of women identify as LGBT. Only 3.9% of men identify as LGBT. Conclusion Though the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender populations have previously not been researched, this community is a sizable amount of the population, with 4.5% of Americans identifying as LGBT. This article has attempted to gather trusted research of this population and analyze the demographics, breaking down this community based on age, race, gender, and location. Our favorite statistic is that a reported 63% of Americans believe that homosexuality should be accepted. As an LGBT company, we are especially excited to learn that the majority of Americans are LGBTQ+ Allies. This is an encouraging message that supports our vision of a world where the global LGBT community can travel freely without prejudice, hate, or discrimination."
11,Why is N.O. So Important for Erection Quality (EQ) and Sexual Performance?,social-issues," If you are on this page, chances are that you are looking to find out more about the importance of nitric oxide for sexual performance and erection quality. In this article, we are going to get a deeper insight into this department. After you have gone through this article, you will be in a much better position to make the best choice as there are a lot of these supplements. Read on to find out more. Most men want to boost their nitric oxide levels naturally. The primary reason is that natural products and techniques are safer for performance enhancement. As a matter of fact, common treatments for erectile dysfunction, such as Cialis, Levitra, and Viagra can help you maintain your nitric oxide levels and push them into your penis for stronger erections. Nitric Oxide (N.O.) Although nitric acid performs a lot of functions in your body, we are going to talk about a specific function that it performs. When it comes to sexual performance, N.O. relaxes the blood vessels of your penis. As a result, you can experience a stronger erection that will last much longer. As soon as you feel sexual arousal, your body gets the signal to boost the production of N.O. So, this is how it works. Although there are many causes of erectile dysfunction, decreased production of nitric oxide is one of them. If you want your body to produce nitric oxide, your body should have a lot of required precursors and nutrients. Although the list of these nutrients and precursor is quite long, nitrates are quite popular. You can get nitrates from a variety of foods including leafy green vegetables. Apart from this, you can get N.O. from NOS, which stands for Nitric Oxide Synthase. If you maintain your testosterone levels, you can increase the efficacy of NOS. But the million-dollar question is, how can you increase the efficacy of NOS? An easy way out is to go for L-arginine, which is a popular supplement. When you take these supplements, they get converted into N.O. with the help of NOS. Your erection depends on the amount of blood in your penile vessels. There is no doubt that arousal is important for proper erection. And arousal is dependant on many factors, such as a healthy balance of estrogen and testosterone. It is important to keep in mind that testosterone can help your body perform a lot of functions. For example, this compound is important to make sure that your blood vessels are healthy. If you have low levels of testosterone, your arteries will get hard. On the other hand, if you maintain your testosterone levels, you can enjoy a firm erection. As said earlier, NOS enzyme supports testosterone. All of this helps produce more nitric oxide. Long story short, this was an introduction to the importance of N.O. for your sexual performance and erection quality."
12,How to Slow Aging (and even reverse it),social-issues," If you want to reduce those wrinkles on your face, you can adopt some lifestyle choices. In other words, if you follow the 7 lifestyle choices we are going to talk about, you can slow down your aging. Read on to find out more. Some good sources of omega 3 fatty acid include flax seeds and fish. Omega 3 fatty acids are important for your brain function. They reduce inflammation and stress in addition to repair your cell membranes. Therefore, you may want to have different types of fish, such as herring, tuna, mackerel, and salmon, just to name a few. As an alternative, you can eat seeds and nuts, such as walnuts, chia seeds, and flax seeds. The oils of these seeds and nuts may also work. You may want to keep yourself hydrated by drinking at least 8 glasses of water on a daily basis. According to experts, the minimum daily amount is 3.7 liters for men, and 2.7 liters for women. The reason is that hydration may cause constipation, headaches, brain fog, and fatigue, to name a few. Apart from this, keeping hydrated is important if you want to maintain your brain health. As you get older, it becomes harder for your body to absorb nutrients. So, your gut should remain healthy. B-vitamins are important for your cognitive function. The good news is that you can get your required amount of vitamin B12 from your regular diet. But the problem is that people over the age of 50 struggle to maintain their B12 levels. If you are looking for some good sources of these vitamins, you may want to check out grain products, fortified grains, breakfast cereals, beans, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Animal sources include dairy, eggs, meat, poultry, and fish. According to medical science, your brain shrinks by 5% every 10 years after the age of 40. However, if you want to maintain this volume, you may want to go for aerobic exercises. What happens is that your body produces a specific chemical that helps slow down the deterioration of the brain. So, if you are over the age of 40, you may want to perform exercises, such as walking, running, cycling, and running on a treadmill. According to researchers, you want to follow some brainy activities. With these activities, you can boost the generation of new cells in your brain. Apart from this, it will also slow down the process of cell loss in your brain. So, what you need to do is keep your mind active by solving math problems and playing word puzzle games. Apart from this, you can engage yourself by adopting a hobby, such as painting and drawing. The strength of your immune system depends on the lining of your gut. Therefore, you may want to try your level best to maintain the health of your intestines. For this purpose, you can have bone broth, as it is easier for your gut to absorb. Apart from this, it is full of minerals, protein, and collagen. Long story short, if you want to slow down your aging, you can adopt the lifestyle choices described in this article."
13,Pheromones FAQs,social-issues," Most people think that pheromones are a type of magical compound that can help them attract a partner. There is some scientific research going on to find out if these types of perfumes really work. In this article, we are going to talk about what exactly this thing is. Apart from this, we are going to answer some frequently asked questions related to this matter. Read on to find out more. What Are Pheromones and How do you release them? According to many reputable sources, pheromones refer to chemicals produced by many animals, which includes humans as well. Basically, they are like hormones. What makes them different from hormones is that pheromones have an external effect on another person. Therefore, they are also known as external pheromones. Most people are interested in finding out about the effects of this compound on sexual arousal. How does it work? First of all, you need to understand that pheromones come out of several glands. For example, in mammals, the glands are found in various parts of their body. These compounds found in the internal organs of many animals. After their release, the signal is detected by the other creature. This is when the desired effect is created. Unlike animals, the vomeronasal organ (VNO) is responsible for this type of function in humans. It is interesting to note that the vomeronasal organ is found in your nose. And this organ sends a signal to the hypothalamus the part of the brain. Many research studies concluded that pheromones from the male may cause a psychological occurrence that is difficult to explain. Research still going on to find out if these compounds can have an impact on human sexual attraction. How do your Habits Affect Pheromones? Even if you release pheromones, your personal hygiene and modern hygiene may have a greater negative impact. Just like sweat, your skin glands may also release pheromones. Therefore, you will get rid of these natural chemicals if you wash more frequently. Should you shower less often? If you think you can make produce more pheromones by taking a shower less frequently, you need to think again. Modern hygiene tells us that the release of these chemicals won't play a significant role in attracting your partner. Can you Amplify your Pheromone Levels? As said earlier, you can amplify your pheromone levels by showering less frequently. But this trick may not work for everyone. Some researchers suggest that the use of pheromone perfumes may have some indirect benefits as well. The thing is that pleasant sense may trigger a positive emotional response, which may help attract the attention of the opposite sex. If you want to attract someone, experts suggest that you go for a nice perfume and keep yourself clean by taking shower more frequently. Although pheromone perfumes work, the effectiveness is not backed by scientific research studies. Therefore, you may want to do your homework to find out how you can improve your communication skills. In other words, depending on the pheromone perfume alone may not give you the desired results."
14,Property Ownership: The Cure for Voter Apathy and a Key to Responsible Citizenship,social-issues," When you own a home, odds are you’ll take care of it in a way that you would not if you were just renting it. After all, when you have “skin in the game” you’ll probably be the one who makes sure the grass is mowed, the snow is shoveled, the leaky faucet is fixed, and the old water heater or roof are replaced when necessary. The buck stops with you…the property owner! So, since property ownership encourages responsibility taking behaviors, what would happen if every single American (every man, woman, and child, regardless of age, race, religion, or political persuasion) was able to become an owner of wealth producing capital assets (a.k.a. property) WITHOUT GOING INTO DEBT? Would voter apathy decrease significantly? Would American’s political awareness improve? Would we elect more capable leaders? Would family stability and sound parenting increase? Would homelessness disappear? If these possibilities sound intriguing, consider the potential of an economic strategy known as ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY. On Average the US Economy Grows… On average, the US economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, reduce voter apathy, and increase responsible citizensip •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVID 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 70 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
15,A Systematic Antidote to Concentrated Wealth/Power and a Myriad of Related Problems,social-issues," Concentrated wealth/power in the hands of a few at the expense of the many, is a MALIGNANT CANCER that undermines and destroys any possibility of a genuine political democracy in America or any other nation. But when America’s mainstream media (which is owned/controlled by the 1%) limits its conversation to conventional monopoly capitalism (private sector concentration) or conventional socialism (public sector/bureaucratic concentration) it actively prevents the only legitimate solution (Economic Democracy) from even being considered In that light, check out the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.

16,"Climate change, what we can do to reduce effects of global warming",social-issues," Climate change and global warming are huge and fast changing environmental issues that humanity is facing today. Climate is changing and has a lot of effects which impact people around the world in different ways. It affects the poor much more than rich. The level of impact on the climate depends on the area, and the wealth of the country. Climate change effects very often add even more to already existing problems. In 2007 report published by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that climate change due to human activities is happening with serious consequences. In coming decades we will witness changes such as: •	fast disappearance of ice sheets and melting of glaciers as a result of global warming. •	increased need for natural resources due to rapid urbanization, economic and industrial development •	loss of biodiversity in ecologically rich regions, •	different wind patterns affecting storm tracks and temperature patterns, •	increased level of saline in fresh water •	increased amount of hot days and reduced of cold days may cause insect outbreaks, •	around 30% of species are at the risk of extinction, •	changes in vegetation such as reduced fertility in soil, •	changes in ocean circulation patterns, and atmosphere, •	changes in frequency, and intensity of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, and hurricanes, •	lots of people will be exposed to increased stress due to water levels. These are just a couple of examples of what is already happening, and will continue to happen in the future due to ongoing and increasing rate of emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. We can’t stop these things from happening completely, but we can all try to do our bit to help the planet by trying to control the emission of greenhouse gasses. Start with simple things like to reduce your waste, reuse, and recycle. These are effective ways to decrease the production of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane. Save energy needed for producing and processing of materials for consumer and industrial use. For example production of recycled paper need 65% less energy than the production of fresh paper from new materials. Recycling is a very effective weapon against climate change. It is easy and requires minimal effort and time but has huge impact. 25% of global greenhouse gas emission annually is due to deforestation and landfills. For example, if you are owner of medium to small business and need to clear the office make sure you do it properly. Instead of trying to get rid of the big amount of rubbish yourself often in incorrect way by dumping  them on the landfill, get help. The easiest thing is to call rubbish clearance company in your local area. They will deal with all aspects of office clearance or house clearance for you, and they will prioritize reusing of old furniture and appliances, and recycling of what’s not usable. Professional house clearance companies promote recycling and reusing as it is one of the most important weapons against global warming and climate change. Let’s care about climate change and the environment by making smart choices."
17,Do You Really Know About Bisexuality? – Break the Rumors,social-issues," Bisexuality is a sexual orientation that is interested in both men and women. To some people, it may sound like a superpower - double the romantic option means double the chance, right? But in reality, bisexuality can be regarded as a somewhat embarrassing identity. Bisexuals are not straight, so it's hard to think that they are the majority in terms of sexuality. On the other hand, they are often considered to be heterosexual, especially when they have heterosexual partners, which sometimes makes it difficult for them to feel their connection to the LGBT groups. Most importantly, bisexuals are prone to serious misunderstandings. There are a lot of rumors and stereotypes surrounding bisexuality, some of which even contradict each other. Both heterosexuals and LGBT may hold these stereotypes, which makes it more difficult for bisexuals to integrate into these two groups. Fortunately, in recent years, more and more researchers have become interested in bisexuality, and research has improved our understanding of bisexuality. Here are three examples of how science can combat the misconception of bisexuality: Myth 1: Bisexuality doesn't exist I found this rumor particularly ridiculous: how can you tell a group of people that they don't exist? But the idea that everyone is either heterosexual or homosexual is widespread, especially among men. It's frustrating that even in the most tolerant circles of LGBT, you can sometimes hear the saying ""there's no such thing as bisexual men at all"". In a recent study published in “archives of sexual behavior”, researchers have completely dismissed this myth. They gathered some heterosexual, gay and bisexual men to show them a number of pornographic movies. The subjects were asked not only to assess their subjective feelings aroused by the fragments, but also to connect physiological devices to measure changes in their penile circumference (that is, sexual excitement). As expected, when heterosexual men watched movies performed by women, their subjective feelings and sexual excitement were significantly higher than those of men who watched movies performed by men. The opposite was true for gay men. However, the extent to which bisexual men are aroused by male and female images is relatively close. They were also more aroused by bisexual videos - videos starring two males and one female-than the other two groups. Importantly, these differences are reflected in both their own reported arousal and fairly objective data on sexual excitement. Therefore, it is clear from this study that these people are not ""pretending"" to be bisexual. Myth 2: Bisexuality is just a stage This rumor portrays bisexuality as an experimental phase or a state of confusion - usually in college. Afterwards, bisexuals will still determine their ""real"" identity. Lisa Diamond has done some very complicated work on this topic, during which she has been observing women's gender identity for a long time. In a paper published in “Developmental Psychology”, Dr. Diamond reported on a group of women she had followed closely for more than a decade. The results clearly show that bisexuality is not a transitional period: only a small number of women who were identified as bisexual in adolescence changed their status to heterosexual or homosexual (only 8%) at the end of the study. However, the orientation of bisexual women is always changing over time. During the ten-year research cycle, their interest in both sexes has been changing. Myth 3: Bisexuals will not be loyal to their partners This rumor is probably the most vicious. It comes from the idea that a partner cannot fully satisfy someone who is interested in both sexes. Some people feel that sooner or later they will crave someone who is not of the same sex as their partner. For example, people tend to believe that bisexuals are more likely to cheat on their partners than heterosexual and homosexuals. A part of people are looking for their partner on bisexual dating sites, these platforms offer people more chances to find like-minded partners. In fact, many bisexuals have a happy one-on-one relationship with their partner. For example, by the end of Dr. Diamond's 10-year study, 89% of bisexual women were in long-term monogamous relationships. In addition, for bisexuals who wish to have multiple sexual partners, studies have shown that they tend to achieve this goal by negotiating with their partners and establishing an open relationship, rather than going around in private behind their partners. I can't find any research to support the idea that bisexuals are less loyal or honest than people with other sexual orientations. All in all, bisexuality, a small but growing field of research, has a bright future. It not only dispels a lot of rumors and misconceptions surrounding bisexuality, but also provides interesting insights into sexual activity in general. Unlike other sources such as popular culture or media, scientific research believes that bisexuality is a relatively stable and lasting sexual orientation. We recommend people to find bisexual partners on reliable bisexual dating apps or websites. More researches are needed to better understand the similarities, and perhaps uniqueness, of bisexual and unisexual."
18,Will Remote Working Become the Norm after COVID-19?,social-issues," As COVID-19 wreaks havoc globally, most people have had the option of remote working from home for their jobs.  By the start of April 2020, about 35% of US employees started working from home. At the time it was a temporary situation, all you needed was an internet connection and a laptop/smartphone.  For companies, it has become more desirable to keep the wheels in motion by having employees remotely working from home as it also mitigated the virus’s spread. Businesses can benefit from employees remote working at home: Technology – When it was apparent that the Coronavirus was not going away, small business owners invested in the newest technology by installing new digital tools. Zoom application has become the highest in demand due to business meetings and conferences with employees. Other technologies that are used are monitoring software that will track the time you punch in and out on the computer, counting the keystrokes, and other measures to make sure that employees are using their time efficiently. Financial– Companies that invested in the latest technology are in it for the long run as there are economic benefits. According to a survey by software maker Atlas VPN, “monitoring a single employee working remotely costs about $7 a month and having an employee work from home half the time can save an employer $11,000 a year in increased productivity”. Although not all businesses and companies will prefer employees working from home, some companies are willing to take that risk. The shift in mentality –Most managers were skeptical in the beginning because they thought remote working was not going to be effective. After seeing the results of other companies, managers have embraced the idea and now most businesses have shifted their mentality. After the coronavirus, working from home will be a part of our lives because it has proved it can be productive in many ways. Work/Life Balance– Working from home for months has given employees the flexibility of spending time with family while attaining their objectives or goals for their company. It is easier to encourage employees to work from home to utilize the available digital technology and spend time with their loved ones. Ultimately getting the best of both worlds. Challenges that arise with employers for the “new” remote workforce: Structure– Every company or business has its own structure for the office place, however; working from home can be stressful at times if a company does not have a clear guideline about what needs to be done. Having a zoom meeting can be effective about discussions or goals but the managers have to re-structure the workplace. Stricter guidelines must be put in place so that everyone is on the same page. Miscommunication is a huge deficit even in the office workplace so imagine how a situation might play out with everyone remotely working from home. Isolation– Physical contact is a human necessity even in the office. Working at home without the company of co-workers can be debilitating. No more one-on-one meetings, no power lunches, chit-chat at the watercooler, or comradery. Believe it or not, these things are important to an employee as the teamwork will be watered down. Some workers may feel isolated, and not motivated enough to get the job done on time. Trust– This is an unspoken pact between an employee and manager. Can a supervisor trust that the worker will be using his time efficiently or get the work done and not be a slacker? Many companies are not used to employees remote working and have very restricted guidelines. They will more or less “micro-manage” remote workers which can put on more stress ending in feeling resentful. No one likes to be overly managed and is often compared to being “treated like a child”. Starting a new chapter for remote working: Many workers have been laid off and were not given an option to work from home- alas the huge spike in unemployment. This is an ongoing issue as many retailers, and offices have a shutdown. It’s time to be creative and decide that you may want to assert your skills into unchartered territory- working for yourself. It is a new world out there and no one is sure what can happen. The focus is to not shy away from opportunities that we have never done but to embrace them and try something new Good Luck with the Job Search! Kathy T."
19,Why do Women Like to Date Older Men?,social-issues," For men and women of the same age, women seem to be much more mature than men. This is why normal men like dating women younger than themselves. Mature men have made some achievements in their career, so they can attract young women easier than young men. Meanwhile, they do not have the impulse when they were young in their feelings, and they have become more tender and considerate. Therefore, it is reasonable for women to like mature men. And there are the main reasons why women like dating older men: Mature men have experienced several relationships generally. In every relationship, they will sum up their own shortcomings and correct them. There are several women who have taught these men to grow up, so most of the mature men tend to be more considerate to women. All women like warm men, while mature men are not as impulsive as they were young. They are more rational and they can take care of women's emotions. Women like to be spoiled by their own men, and naturally they have no resistance to these men. Good men are like red wine, the longer the age, the better the taste for women. Considerate men tend to think more than younger men. This can make women feel safe, and they don’t have to worry about anything. Mature men will make everything goes well. Time teaches men not only to be considerate in love, but also how to become more stable in life. In young people's love, a quarrel always becomes to a cold war, while mature men know women's emotions, and they will not do childish things. Compared with young men's personality, older men are more stable and mature. They are very considerate, they will think about the causes and consequences, and then come up with the most appropriate solution to deal with the major and minor matters in life. Mature men will not hesitate as much as they did when they were young, and will be more stable and decisive. Women want their men to have their own opinions. If you need a woman to decide everything, then she will feel that you are not worth it. What a woman needs is a man who can rely on. Mature men have a certain financial strength after hard work, so they can offer women what they want. They will not hesitate for a long time to buy something like young men do. It's not surprising that some women like to date or marry a rich man. Just like the sugar daddy and sugar baby relationships, most of young girls join some sugar daddy sites in order to look for some rich sugar daddies to pay their bills. And there is nothing wrong for a woman to find a rich man, because money is the basis of life, and the scope of life is very wide, including food, clothing, housing and transportation. Rich people can live in luxury villas, wear high-end clothes, own luxury cars, and travel around the world at any time. Ordinary people can hardly live such a life. So there is nothing wrong for women to prefer rich men. Being realistic is good for some women. Characteristics of Mature Men Every woman wants to be the one to be spoiled, and has a boyfriend who can share the sorrow and joy for herself, so a mature man becomes the best choice. Therefore, there are some college girls join sugar daddy apps to search for sugar daddies. Mature and steady men have always been the most fascinating poison for girls. So what are the characteristics of mature men? They do not treat feelings like children. Mature men know how to face every decision that disappoints them. Even if their girlfriend told them to separate, they will accept it without hurting or harassing their ex-girlfriend, and strive to build their own value. What girls want is a feeling, and this feeling is produced by the temperament of a man. Whether it is emotional responsibility or work responsibility, mature men always maintain full marks. For simple chatting, some boys pester girls to chat every day, which gives girls a feeling of ""you seem to have nothing to do"". But mature men won't reply to messages in seconds, because they are really busy. Girls can feel that such men are serious about their work, which reflects that they are very motivated men. We always meet people who are very steady. No matter what happens, they are very calm and will not let out their emotions casually. For example, when it comes to love problems, boys will be all kinds of anxiety, fear, and even more timid than girls. But mature men will not, they have their own opinions and principles, and they will not easily change their ideas for girls. The expression of this emotion can be seen by girls easily. They will feel very safe even just standing beside this man. This is a kind of steadiness and can be seen from temperament."
20,Africa Has the Potential to Lead its Continent's Humanitarian Response,social-issues," International news reports recently highlighted Africa’s success in containing the pandemic in several countries. Officials attribute the relatively low numbers to planning, technology, and the willingness of its citizens to follow recommended protective guidelines. These successful outcomes are pivotal, underscoring the continent’s ability to leverage resources to overcome a crisis in the region, such as utilizing support from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and coordinating large-scale collaboration. Africa’s Response to the Pandemic Wear a mask and stay home. These are two main actions Africans follow to achieve fewer Covid-19 infections and deaths per capita than most developed areas in the world. Despite reaching one million cases in August, Africa has countries that have followed the recommended guidelines and successfully contained the disease. For instance, the Republic of Rwanda’s 12 million population had 2200 cases and eight deaths in total by August. The country’s response was swift. By following the news of the virus in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, officials prepared for the possibility of its transmission to the continent. After the first few cases, Rwanda implemented a total lockdown, closing airports, and schools. The country’s digital infrastructure also helped by allowing citizens to purchase products remotely. Reducing physical interactions and implementing contact tracing were vital steps. Officials also integrated technology and innovation in the containment process, which is pivotal to minimizing risk. For example, medical professionals in Africa used drones to transport Covid-19 samples. Young nationals in Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo created ventilators with local supplies and materials. The continent of Africa has experienced close to 18,500 deaths in nearly 875,000 cases. Comparatively, India has 8.9 million cases and 131,000 deaths. Hand washing points, masks, and education are necessary for continuing containment and recovery. The debate over the viability of masks in containing the virus has given way to clear data, which confirms that areas enforcing mask mandates have fewer virus infections per capita than areas not requiring masks. The crucial role of non-government organizations (NGOs) in the battle to save African lives may cause officials to rethink the role of these groups in a coordinated response to Covid-19 and other humanitarian problems on the continent. Some areas such as Nigeria have large populations in close proximity, exacerbating risks for higher infection rates. Those nationals without proper sanitation or clean water need help. In developed countries, citizens wash their hands frequently. In other areas, some nationals cannot even take a weekly bath. Experienced relief groups are ready to step in and assist by constructing water tanks, digging wells, building hand-washing areas, and distributing supplies. However, funding is necessary to support local and national NGOs in addressing widespread, systematic problems in Africa. The impact of meager resources and closing missions is a less robust pandemic response, which affects trade and employment, rendering many areas of the continent unliveable for the residents who call Africa home. NGO Role in Africa Humanitarian groups in Africa provide support in several ways, including affording access to clean water, increasing educational opportunities, and improving health care outcomes. NGOs are key to combatting widespread poverty and misfortune on the continent. For more than 25 years, these organizations have supported the population with money from aid dollars. This rapidly growing sector receives donations to support the work they perform. Competition for money is steep, as countries such as South Africa have more than 100,000 NGO groups registered. More than 125 international NGOs operate in The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Covid-19 is one of many concurrent challenges faced by the region, which includes DRC, Southern Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR), Nigeria, Kenya, and other countries. From natural disasters to genocide, multiple issues highlight the need for monetary support for humanitarian groups. The survival of NGO intervention is crucial, as these organizations also play a vital role in combating systemic civil and human rights abuses by fighting to bring about radical change through the courts. Unfortunately, some hard-fought victories against evictions, systemic racism, and unfair employment practices are short-lived against the tide of unrest and conflict, which forces citizens to grapple with how to survive in the current system. Some critics call for a change to the NGO system, which sometimes gives more power to outside groups instead of government organizations or the people. However, NGOs still have an important role to play in the continent’s struggle against injustice and poverty. Economic Impact In 2019, a report on anti-NGO legislation noted that 11 African nations have already implemented measures to curb NGO activity, seven countries are considering such legislation or have policies pending, and six countries have had measures to restrict NGO activity tossed out by courts, rejected by politicians, or abandoned by the government. These measures seek to reverse civil rights gains, which hold the governments accountable. This trend is a part of a larger global withdrawal from democratic policies. Veiled attempts to restrict NGOs also come in the form of legislation relating to finance, cybersecurity, and money laundering. By requiring mandatory registrations and, in some cases, frequent renewals for NGOs, countries may restrict the freedom of assembly that is inherent in a democratic society.  Further, restrictions and limitations on funding from foreign sources render many NGOs incapable of meeting the overwhelming needs of African nationals. NGOs are combating such policies by meeting with legislators, protesting, and forming coalitions. If successful, these anti-NGO policies and laws may severely impact the ability of international and local NGOs to help those in collapsing states and areas of extreme turmoil. Lack of assistance is forcing many African nationals to leave home, migrating to other countries, and continents. African Expatriation Expatriate numbers from DRC and other areas are staggering. According to the UN, more than 900,000 DRC refugees are living in other African countries, and more than five million are displaced within the country. In 2016, a new wave of violence and human rights abuses caused a loss of life, destruction of schools, and closure of businesses, leaving DRC citizens struggling to survive. This outmigration trend is not new. Since 1960, the region has experienced violence and economic challenges, which prompt nationals to migrate from Africa to Europe and other continents. The post-colonial era brought immigrants from Belgium, forcing displacement from conflicts. In 1970, a strong economy in the region was sparked by exporting natural resources, such as copper, diamonds, and uranium. However, the global commodities collapse in 1973 adversely impacted the region’s economy. In 1980, the situation was dire. By 1990 genocide, war, and violent conflicts led to the forced migration of 1.2 million nationals of DRC. The region’s economy has shown steady improvement since 2003. However, challenges in the area remain. Resurging violence, epidemics, racism, and unemployment fuel mass displacement. Refugees from DRC, Sudan, CAR, and neighbouring regions find support from NGOs. Yet, funding for international and local humanitarian organizations is limited from efforts to curtail NGO activity in Africa and struggles to control the money flowing to humanitarian organizations in the region. Solutions to the Crisis Major reforms require in-depth planning and focused execution, allowing nationals to offer input on the process. A five-part plan that includes collaboration among fiscally responsible national governments, investment in human development, job creation, and full integration of responsible NGOs is vital to securing a healthy, democratic, and successful region. Investment in Human Development Education is the key that allows global citizens to advance in the human experience. Tapping into each person’s potential begins with elevating the way that the individual views the world and his or her place in it. Preparing the region’s children and adults for professional and trade opportunities is an investment in the future of Africa. Job Creation Globally, employment is fueled by small businesses and large corporations. The region’s rich commodity resources are substantial incentives for large corporations to invest heavily in the area. Partnering with large businesses to bring jobs to the region will help to stabilize employment, opening possibilities for nationals to prosper. As the economy improves, small business development is essential to ensuring a robust economic outlook. Small businesses fuel growing economies by allowing creativity and innovation to thrive. International Collaboration Halting the violence is essential to drawing citizens home and immigrants to the region. By collaborating with international bodies and governments, DRC, CAR, Sudan, and neighbouring regions may find support to thwart terrorism and develop armed forces capable of combatting bad actors and protecting citizens. Africa’s future rests in the ability of its citizens, government organizations, and international leaders to rethink the humanitarian response. The violence that grows out of discontent with an inability to survive must be overturned by planning major reforms, such as job creation, education, and safety.  Front-line NGOs play a vital role in combating the challenges that face African nations. Experienced groups with direct access to the people hold the best chance of providing immediate support to address dire humanitarian challenges. However, in the long-term, grassroots organizing and robust response are needed to catapult struggling nations into a new era of progress. If African nations can use technology and innovation to contain a pandemic, the continent has the capabilities to overcome its growing challenges. From raising funds to creating change, Africa’s technology, planning, and population buy-in are the seeds that may spark economic and humanitarian progress beyond national borders, through remote areas, and across the continent to usher in a new era of health and prosperity."

Look at our online gay hookup and let your desire be your guide in the cutting edge dating scene. Best Cam Girl Sites I desired to join as a cam girl in the best cam girl sites. It occurred through a companion of a companion of mine. That is normally how these things go. She had found, through an organization of young ladies, a site that paid good cash for cam girl on the off chance that you put the work in. I joined, presented my name, ID, bank subtleties and some photographs and inside 24 hours I was endorsed in https://www.hookupscout.com/best-10-cam-sites-for-camgirl as a bona fide Cam Girl ­with no ridiculous thought of what I was doing. For my first show I applied some make­up, did my hair and put on a profound slipcover leotard. It was the center of summer and bubbling blistering even in that. I sat on my bed, set my webcam looking toward me and sat doodling in my sketchpad, hanging tight for benefactors. In the long run they came. My visit room started to top off and I began conversing with a couple of folks in the gathering talk. I just composed of the outset: At the time, I lived in a share house with just folks my age, and truly wasn't keen on their getting some answers concerning my twilight propensities. I made $20AUD in 'tokens' (how installments were recorded by means of the site) my first night. 20 bucks for six hours of lounging around in my clothing, net flirting with fellows. It wasn't a lot, yet, it was more than I'd make looking through Tinder searching for somebody I really needed to bone IRL. I realized the best approach to bring in genuine cash was either by going 'private' (opening a private show chat room that costs the client a specific sum for every moment) or by spending numerous months on the web page developing a following,­ simply like some other chaser of web work/acclaim! The first occasion when I went 'private' with a person I cracked the fuck out. All he composed was 'get exposed'. Thus far everything I'd done in a talk room was streak my boobs for a convergence of tokens. I solidified up in stage ­fright and shut the room. In my gathering visit I expressed: ""Sorry, cam solidified."" And I logged off for the evening. In the long run, I got somewhat more daring. I hula­-hooped in my clothing while at the same time tuning in to the Arctic Monkeys. I likewise did yoga, live painting with my back to the webcam in just a strap. I piled up a few hundred bucks over a couple of days and liquidated the check sent the following month. At this point I'd jerked off on-camera for a couple of folks, however I was beginning to get somewhat distrustful about my face showing up in an advert on another site some place and somebody I knew seeing it. I don't have anything against sex work, having worked in the business multiple times now, However, I don't care for state my beau's sibling or housemate or one of my own relatives opening a page to a moving picture of my face mid-­orgasm absolutely in light of the fact that well, I don't figure my family would uphold that choice. It sucks, since Cam Girl was pretty fun: I had the opportunity to pick my own hours, what I wore, what I did and who I needed to converse with. The suspicion that accompanied the information on the disgrace joined was the main disadvantage. That and the irregular twelve savages that would show up, and compose: 'Your face is glossy' in the remarks. Definitely mate, it's 40 degrees. Wouldn't you be able to peruse the profile that says, 'Australian'? I have considered opening up my profile again a couple of times since, and may once I get over the 'what will people think?' paranoia, and remember the counter I have arranged in regard to the administration youth joblessness in Australia: With youth joblessness right now lounging around 13%, making your own occupation utilizing the assets you as of now have (for this situation, web association, webcam, studio lighting and adorable pants) turns into a significantly more feasible choice than sitting tight for callbacks from the 20 resumes you conveyed a week ago. All things considered, the possibility of my future possibilities of employ ability could be harmed if this was found, and I do ponder about the level of cash the site makes versus the rates the models make. Here and there self-­regulation with respect to funds is the most ideal alternative for certain individuals: I've been dealt with better and all the more reasonably as a Cam Girl in https://www.hookupscout.com/best-10-cam-sites-for-camgirl and bare model than I was in my last retail work where I, no expression of an untruth, got terminated for 'looking pitiful.” However,, in spite of how much control one can have over their profession as a Cam Girl  there are positively disparities inside the business, including well-being issues, and issues of future employ ability, just as what is viewed as a reasonable installment and no assurance on an essential the lowest pay permitted by law for quite a long and a time put in. It surrenders a great deal to risk. Would I suggest it? It's up to the individual (clearly), simply ensure you do your exploration and find other ladies in the business to go to counsel."
2,This is the World We Live in,social-issues," We have all encountered some kind of discrimination, whether it be religious, gender, age, sexual orientation, and so forth. What most people do not realize, however, that racial discrimination is actually the most common and we as a nation need to be aware of this. I had a recent incident, not necessarily directed towards me but someone had said to me that they would not use public restrooms because they “don’t like using the same restroom as a negro”. This person was stuck on the idea of segregation because they had this stereotype of people with a different race. I have seen a lot more of this happening lately, like the riots, hate crimes, white supremacy movements, and more. We have gotten out of hand and people talk about it but no one really does anything to make it stop. Discrimination has been around for hundreds of years and it has changed a lot. We went from white supremacy and “blackface” all the way to killing people and creating products that use racial advertisement. Although discrimination has been around for so long, not many people even know about it. Brent Staples from The New York Times stated that “In the 19th century, minstrel entertainers spawned a racist caricature that endures to this day when they darkened their faces to portray black people as grinning, dancing, simpletons”. I have spoken to many people about this and I have come to realize many younger people have no clue about who or what “blackface” is. “Blackface” is a racist depiction of a white person with black makeup covering their face, simply used to undervalue black people. The caricature of “blackface” has not yet gone away though, because over several months Gucci, Prada, and Katy Perry were forced to withdraw several items from the market because they were revealing designs that showed how the caricature of “blackface” manifests itself through people who are blind to what it connotes. When it was still a huge part of the white community it embodied blackness as “grotesque” in itself because it could never achieve the mythical ideal of whiteness. Commercial advertisements were a huge thing back then and most of it belittled blackness to sell everything. The “best-known” Jet-black commercial icons were the Gold Dust Twins who appeared naked except for their trademark tutus and black makeup - they represented a popular brand of washing powder whose motto was “let the twins do your work.” Since the twins are “black” it makes it seem like slavery is a positive thing in the normal, everyday American household. In 1899 a children's book titled “The Story of Little Black Sambo” helped solidify the “derogatory caricature of dark-skinned children.” “Sambo” was a term used to describe black people during slavery, which soon became an insulting name for black communities. White actors in blackface were featured in D.W. Griffith’s rabidly racist silent film “The Birth of a Nation” - Hollywood's first blockbuster, released in 1915. The movie “valorized the Klan” and depicted African-Americans as “buffoons” and “incipient rapists”. These events still carry on through the idea of white supremacy, though not very many people pay attention to it. On October 25, 2018, multiple members of a far-right group were arrested for violently attacking counter-protesters. A mother, Shirley Hardrix from Fort Wayne, spoke to police about how her son Samuel was stabbed to death by a white supremacist in 2016. Aaryn Snyder admitted to killing her son because he was black and said he received a patch from a “white organization” for doing so. In 2018 two white men beat a black man to death in a state prison dormitory in Putnamville, IN. Because of white supremacy, a black American is likely to get a 20% longer sentence for the same offense as a white American. These are horrific hate crimes that have happened because of white supremacy and because some people see it as justified to hate someone just because of their skin color. Indiana officialized the hate crime bill on April 3, 2019. The Indiana hate crime bill is said to have covered bias-motivated crimes based on things like race, religion, sex, gender identity, and disability. Even though we passed the hate crime bill it has been said to be watered down and not very specific on what we are trying to accomplish. Despite having the hate crime bill going into place the rates for hate crimes are on the rise. According to the FBI report released in 2017, hate crimes increased by about 17% compared to 2016. In 2018, the FBI report revealed more than 7,000 hate crimes were reported in our country. Race and ethnicity made up about 59.6%, religion was 20.6%, and sexual orientation was around 15.8%. Of these, 50.7% of the offenders were white and 21.4% were African-American. These incidents have been going on for hundreds of years, and the ideas and actions of segregation, hate crimes, and white supremacy have just continued to get worse. Still, nothing we have done to stop it or slow it down has worked. We have tried so hard and made many attempts to stop it but nothing seems to work. The way people are raising their children and the things they are saying to them and teaching them has affected the outcome of everything us as a nation has tried so very hard to stop. People read things and see things and then they get this idea in their head about how to think about a certain thing or person. Now, this obviously is not the case with every person; some people respect differences no matter the race, gender, religion, or anything else. The violent crimes and hatred among people of different races is all because hundreds of years ago these people put this idea - this stereotype - of how to treat or think of people with different skin colors. Is this really the world one should want to be living in? That said, not all people think like this; there are really more people that think positively and see the good in everyone. But it is that small amount of people that refuse to see things that way that is making a huge impact on our communities. If we could learn to respect people, not for their skin color or their religion or themselves, our community would be much stronger than it is now. Right now, our nation is on the verge of breaking and we need to come together and fight for what is right. Not all people will agree with this but we need to be aware of what is going on in the world right now. It is also not always white supremacy taunting our societies, black supremacy is another thing happening and we need to fight against it all. We cannot just sit in our house and try to hide the truth about what the world has really become. No matter what it is - white supremacy, black supremacy, hate crimes - we need to know that it is not right; after all, we are all human."
3,School Epidemic (The Guide to Bullying),social-issues," Every day there is a child somewhere being bullied and harassed at school. Most schools say they ensure your child's safety. Yet, they are only protecting them from people on the outside. What about the students inside the school? 20% of the children, ages 12-18 experience bullying all across the U.S. 31% of people reporting it, said they thought their bully had more money than them. 40% said they thought their bully was physically stronger than them. Children should not have to go to school scared that they are going to be made fun of or harassed. 19% of students grades 9-12 reported being bullied on school grounds. 43.3% said it happened in the hallway or stairwell. I have had my fair share of bullies and I still do. It’s not only at school though. I get bullied and made fun of at work too. I don’t want to talk about myself though. I want to talk about someone else's story. In November 2019 I was sent to Community North for inpatient therapy. While I was there I met a seven-year-old girl. She was the sweetest little thing I had ever met. She and I shared a room and I got to know her a little. She had told me that she was there for trying to commit suicide. At first, she wouldn’t tell me why. Later after she started to trust me a little more she told me it was because she was bullied at school. No one should be bullied to the point where they want to end their life, let alone a seven-year-old. It made me sick to my stomach thinking about how this little girl was treated so badly at school she didn’t think she deserved to live anymore. Rumors and lies are actually the most common type of bullying. 13.4% of children ages 12-18 said that's how they were bullied. Research shows that constant bullying can lead to or worsen feelings of isolation, rejection, exclusion, depression, and anxiety. All of those things can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors. No one should have to put up with being bullied. Schools just don’t do anything about it. Unless the bully physically harms you, all the school can do is talk to the bully and tell them to stop. Most of the time that just makes the situation worse. Parents shouldn’t have to be scared to send their children to school. Parents should know that their children will be safe at school. Schools are often called a safe place for children. I could argue that it definitely is not a safe place for most children. About 46% of students ages 12-18 who were bullied reported it to an adult. There are things you can teach your children to help them prevent or deal with being bullied. You can show them how to be aware and pay attention. You have to be aware that there is a problem and pay attention to warning signs. Parents should teach their children to recognize bullying is a problem and they shouldn’t just ignore it. Bullying is happening everywhere and it is getting worse. Children should know how to stay calm and in control. Students should intervene but they shouldn’t get involved. They also shouldn’t try to sort things out on the spot. Bystanders should be held accountable if they just let it happen. All parents should teach their children what to do in a situation with a bully whether it's them being bullied or someone else. For anything to be counted as bullying though it has to have these three things, unwanted and aggressive behavior, an imbalance of power, and the behavior has to happen more than once. Most children talk behind each other's backs but if it becomes repetitive and aggressive it is then bullying. Bullying can happen for so many reasons. Some children who bully others sometimes lack their parents' attention and guidance, some just want to feel powerful and look cool, others might be getting bullied too. Bullying can happen to anyone but bullies usually seek out certain people who are usually less popular and seem weaker than them. LGBTQ youth are more likely to be victims of bullying. A study by the Center of disease control and prevention (CDCP) found that 33% of LGBTQ students reported being bullied, compared to 17% of students identifying as heterosexual. There can be many different roles when it comes to bullying. There is the bully and the victim being bullied. Then there is the kid who assists and the kid who reinforces. Lastly, there is the bystander and the kid who defends.  The bully is taking their aggression out on others. While the victim who is being bullied may seem less popular or weak. The kid who assists isn’t necessarily bullying the kid; they are just encouraging the bully and empowering them. The kid that reinforces is similar to the kid who assists they create crowds by cheering the bully on or laughing at the kid being bullied. The bystander just watches as they don’t try to help. They might act like they aren’t paying attention to it. The kid who defends is the complete opposite of the bystander the kid who defends intervenes and comes to help the victim that is being bullied. There are so many different ways a child can be involved in bullying. There are also many warning signs. The child can withdraw, which is one of the earliest and most common symptoms of being bullied. Children can also become reluctant to go to school. They will say they don’t feel good or that they are tired, to try and stay home. You may notice a decrease in self-esteem. They might become more worried about how they look and what they are wearing. Teachers and parents should watch out for these warning signs. If they notice them they should talk to their child and figure out what has been happening. There are so many different types of bullying. Most people just think bullying is just a physical thing. Now yes physical bullying is common but there are many other types such as verbal, cyber, relational, and reactive. Verbal bullying kind of says what it is. It’s calling them names and saying mean things. Cyber says what it is too. It can be many things though from posting fake or private pictures to texting them mean things. Relational bullying is basically just excluding people from something in a mean way. Reactive is when someone who used to be bullied starts to bully others. If you are being bullied there are things you can do to try and make it better. You can just pretend they are invisible. Bullies thrive on attention. They want to know that what they are doing is bothering you because it makes them feel powerful. Instead of thinking of the bully as powerful and mean think of them as silly. If they do something and you laugh they’ll get confused because they expect it to bother you. Stay with friends, bullies are less likely to bully if you are around other people. Think about positive affirmations whether you say them or a friend says them. There are so many things you can do to try and make it stop or to keep it from getting worse. Just remember bullies thrive on power and attention if you let it bother you they’ll keep doing it. School should be a place where children can go learn and make friends. They shouldn’t be scared that they are going to get bullied at school. School is the one place people say ensures your child's safety. Parents shouldn’t have to be worried that their children aren’t going to be safe at school. Children shouldn’t be bullied anywhere whether it is school, the bus, work, or the playground. It’s not always the bullies' fault that they act the way they do. You should never just assume things about other people because some bullies do it because they are being abused at home. They just take their anger out on other children. People who are being bullied and people who are bullied usually don’t know how to correctly express their feelings. People who are bullied hold it in and don’t talk about it. The bullies don’t talk about it but they let it out, just in an unhealthy way. Parents and teachers should watch for warning signs whether it's warning signs of being bullied or being the bully. If they notice them they should have a conversation with the child and try to figure out what's going on. We can’t put all of this just on the schools the bullies parents are mainly at fault they should have taught their child how to act properly. Parents need to teach their children that everyone is different and just because they don’t look like or act like you doesn’t mean you should bully them. The media has a big influence; it tells children that everyone should act and look the same. There is really no law for bullying. It is not illegal until you start to harass them. Most parents and teachers can do is teach children how to protect themselves and others. Also how to prevent it from happening in the first place. Parents should also teach their children it is okay to stand up for yourself. It’s not all the schools' fault they don’t have enough power to really do anything about bullies. The most they could do is expel the kid and even that would take extreme actions from the bully. It wouldn’t even help long term because the next year that kid would be in the school again. Parents just need to be positive role models and show their children how to treat others respectfully."
4,Economically Empowering Every Single American While Creating No Debt!,social-issues," Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVID 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 70 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO CONSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
5,4 Reasons Why Young Men Prefer Mature Women,social-issues," Many people think that most young men like young girls, but the fact IS often contrary to imagination. In fact, most young men like mature women. Why? With the development of society, science and technology has brought great changes to life. Many mature women pay attention to their own maintenance, reasonable diet, and healthy nutrition, and they will never be reduced to the point of ‘old age’. On the contrary, they will exude more mature charm, and this charm is often what young men yearn for. So the attractiveness of this kind of mature women is much stronger than that of young women. In the workplace, women and men have similar places. For example, with the growth of age and rich experience, women in their forties generally have small achievements in their careers. After several years of working life, they have transformed from an immature little girl into a capable female white-collar. For them, they usually have their own clear life plan and can have their own thoughts. And at the same time, some young girls are usually still in the willful period. In addition to thinking about how to dress, they think about how to eat, drink and have fun every day. Then let’s compare mature women with young girls, we will see that men usually like mature women. Speaking of the most realistic problem-money! Perhaps most mature women do not drive luxury cars or live in luxury houses, but one thing is for sure, after so many years of hard work and life, they have formed the habit of self-demand and self-reliance. Mature women have experienced more than young girls. They are independent. You will know that from some milf hookup sites. When you are reading the profiles of these women, most of them are single but independent. They know what to do and how to do things. Therefore, everyone is carrying a load, but the gentleness of mature women is like a safe haven. You can let go of all your disguise and move forward hand in hand with them. Mature women have a charm. They will not attach themselves to men and they will actively develop their self-worth. Just like Priscilla and Zuckerberg, Zuckerberg is a billionaire on the Forbes list, but even so, Priscilla has never given up her career dream, contributing her own strength to the world and not being a dependency of Zuckerberg’s career. And let’s see some young girls? Either rely on their young, idle time; or rely on the good conditions of their parents, gnawing old at home. What do you think you would like as a young man? To be honest, people live in their 30s or 40s, most of them have experienced things. Their mentality is more mature and they are more stable when they encounter problems. Unlike some young girls, who only ask their boyfriends: ‘What should I do?’ Young girls just ask for it. They urgently need company and need you to add even more exhaustion when you are most stressed and helpless. Nowadays, people always find mature women on specific websites or apps. So choosing the best hookup apps will be a good way to find and date a mature woman. Mature women will accompany you peacefully and quietly. They will forgive your concealment, contribute her strength silently, remove the list from you, and will give you unlimited power of security and comfort. Therefore, to some extent or angle, mature women are more popular with young men, which is inseparable from their own efforts."

8,Youth Unemployment in Somalia,social-issues," Unemployment is a global challenge in which many parts of Africa and other developing countries are dealing with, Somali youth are no exception as the country is dealing with one of the highest unemployment rate in the world. Young people represent a majority of Somali population and now estimated that over 70% of population is under the age of 30. Over 67 percent of youth are unemployed, and this rate may be even higher for young women (Human Development Report.2012). What has contributed to the unemployment situation in Somalia is the decades of anarchy and statelessness followed by one decade of post conflict state, and because of the civil war the situation deteriorated in all sectors. The civil conflict problem and lack of effective government affected more in the public sector and role of the government. However, there was some recovery in the private sector in some parts of the country. The situation of the youth is drastically affected by the decades civil conflict and absence of the effective government.  Generations of youth and children missed education opportunities nor they have skills. The conflict affected many young people while some take part in fighting, gangs, piracy and other dirty business. One reason is that uneducated children and young people have little choice in life and can be exploited. As mentioned in UNDP Human Development Report, Somalia now faces the prospect of two “lost generations” with little or no education and training to take up productive roles and leadership. Losing this “human capital” has enormous costs both to individual households and to a society, especially while the country attempts to rebuild its shattered economy. It also poses an enormous challenge to local efforts to demobilize militiamen, whose lack of education makes it difficult to be absorbed into a peacetime economy. It is an impediment to the establishment of a viable, participatory political system and deprivation of the right to basic education and the opportunities it affords (UNDP Somalia, HDR, 1998). Furthermore, just under one fifth of the population is literate (19.2%), and access to basic education remains extremely limited. The country has one of the lowest school enrolment rates in the world (18.8%). Most children cannot access a school or to pay the fees, particularly in the rural areas. Due to the civil war, an estimated one-and-a-half million ‘youth’ missed out on any kind of educational opportunities so could not develop their potential for their own benefit, that of their societies or their country. (Millennium Development Goals Report of Somalia. UNDP) In Somalia, youth without education, marketable skills and access to the labor markets have been enticed to make a living through the use of the gun by joining militias, while others may also immigrate to Europe illegally and through risk routines for the goal of finding better livelihood and opportunities, not necessarily by choice but lack of other survival options. The low prevailing wage rates have also made many other to immigrate outside of the country. Unemployment is a major challenge facing youth in Somalia because of a multiple factors. Among these common factors for the unemployment are insecurity, poverty,  lack of basic education, limited skills, corruption, limited public jobs available in the country,  and most importantly limitation of programs supporting youth employment. Because of the higher unemployment rate, young people join dirty activities where they are exploited and sometimes become criminal. Large number of youth become drag addicts like Khat chewing due to idleness and with a limited choice in life. Approaches to Tackling Unemployment and Enhancing Youth Employment : Despite of that, there is a great hope among young people who are optimistic about their future as they believe that the current administration in collaboration with the international community is taking different approaches in tackling the high unemployment rate in the country. Having said that, it is important to realize the impact of achieving youth empowerment and providing them the opportunity to participate in the community.

10,Why Men Snore More Than Women,social-issues," According to many research studies, men tend to snore more than women. Maybe your husband is also a habitual snorer. Snoring can be quite annoying, especially for those who sleep next to a person while sleeping. In this article, we are going to find out why men snore more than women. We are going to take a look at the scientific reasons behind this phenomenon. Without further ado, let's go into the details. First of all, there is a biological reason why women are less likely to snore. According to medical science, men have bigger upper airways. But they have lower larynxes. Therefore, there is a lot of space in the back of their throats, which amplifies snores. According to Ellen Wermter, the upper airway anatomy of men is one of the main reasons why men tend to snore more than women. This is one of the primary medical reasons behind this phenomenon. If you look at statistics, you will come to know that around 4 out of 10 men tend to snore on a regular basis. On the other hand, only 24% of women have this habit. These statistics were published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Basically, snoring happens because of the position and size of the airway. What happens is that when you are asleep at night, your pharynx muscles tend to relax. Besides, your tongue goes back in order to fill this gap. The loudness of your snoring depends on the gap in your throat. The airways of men change more than those of women when they change their positions while sleeping. And this increases their likelihood of snoring. Apart from this, men carry a lot of their weight on their thorax, neck, and chest. Therefore, they have a relatively thicker neck and more fat deposits and tissues. This extra weight exerts more pressure on the airways of man. This is another main reason why men snore more than women. At Harvard Medical School, Noah Siegel, a sleep specialist agrees that the theories make sense. However, he explains that some women have fatter necks and larger airways than men. Apart from this, women are less likely to suffer from sleep apnea. However, as women reach menopause, their risk for sleep apnea goes up. The reason is that two hormones found in women offer some protection against sleep apnea and snoring. These hormones are called progesterone and estrogen. Just because we cannot blame men for their annoying snoring habits does not mean they cannot take some steps to minimize it. You can take a lot of steps if you want to get rid of your snoring. For example, you can follow some weight loss exercises and make some necessary changes to your diet. According to many studies, if you drink a lot of water, quit smoking, and reduce your reliance on alcohol, you can control your snoring. Apart from this, sleeping on your side while you are sleeping can also help. Long story short, these are some of the scientific reasons why men snore more than women. If you are a habitual snorer, we suggest that you follow the tips mentioned above to control this habit. Hope this helps."

In nature, male cannabis sacs release plant pollen to pollinate female plants in bloom. The outcome are seeds, which enable the plant to create a next generation. As a cultivated plant, marijuana still reacts to light adjustments. Depending upon the strain you're dealing with along with your ecological needs, your light-to-dark proportion will vary a little bit. If you're brand-new to the pressure (or growing), talk with experts about when to end the vegetative stage and also cause your plants' flowering stage. That timing is vital to maximize your yield. Right here are some even more specifics. Just How Much Darkness is Required? The Vegetative Stage of Marijuana Cannabis in the vegetative stage (when it is expanding at a rapid speed) requires at the very least 13 hours of light each day. In fact, interior cultivators generally make use of a 18/6 light to dark ratio to urge faster growth. (Note that a lot of interior cultivators vegetate their plants 4-- 8 weeks.). The Flowering Phase of Cannabis. When you await your marijuana plants to flower, a 12-hours of light and 12-hours of darkness schedule is common. Evening gives darkness, keeping cannabis on somewhat of an all-natural clock. This is why interior growers require to make a calculated effort to not only produce long, bright days, yet likewise emulate dark cycles in order for marijuana to grow huge complete buds. Maintain to Your Chosen Arrange. If you decide on the timeless 12/12 light dep timetable where you cover your plants at 7 p.m. as well as uncover them at 7 a.m., stick to that routine. Keep in mind that this timetable calls for great ventilation, so some growers select to discover their plants during the night once the skies is entirely dark. Continuous Darkness. What many cultivators do not understand is that cannabis requires an uninterrupted dark cycle. Equally as your excellent REM sleep would be disturbed if a light popped on at 2 a.m., cannabis does not fare well when any type of light disrupts it throughout its dark ""sleep"" cycle. The moon and also celebrities never mind marijuana, yet any artificial light can quit its bud development. As a matter of fact, light interrupting its dark cycles can make cannabis so stressed out and also cranky that it can result in hermaphroditism. That can cross-pollinate ladies and destroy your plants."
2,Psychic Terrors – Mirrors of Psychological Errors,social-issues," The word psychic has several applications depending on the nature of the particular discourse. From cognitive and mental capacities to emotional reactivity and supernatural eccentricities, the inference can be diversely applicable in a number of encounters. In reference to early seers and fortunetellers, “psychic”, and by inclusion, “psyche”, refers matter of the “mind”. Both references culminate into the philosophical expression of “psychology”, or the “study of the mind”. In this episode, “psychic terrors” and “psychological mirrors” culminate in an expression to suggest confusion, misunderstanding and misdirection in human behavioral studies. As to the essential reliability of various inquiries, particularly associated with the various schools of thought, scientific validity is called into question. Of the value for the greater good, serious concerns arise with regard to overall credibility of conjecture, claims and commentary. In reference to “scientific validity”, a foundation should be prepared at the outset to delineate terms and applications. From this, it is meant that claims of cause-effect reality ought to meet the standards of real hardcore science, as well as admissibility in a court of law. Once again, one might ask what a science is.  Here that reference is made toward those fields such as astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, forensic pathology, etc. Or, evidence to prove organic existence. A distinction often made between what some call a “hard science” and a “soft science” is that with a hard science, such as physics, a researcher attempts to disprove or disconfirm his or her hypothesis. Rigorous analysis, testing data, examining the evidence, and so, are submitted to critical analysis from a number of perspectives and subsequent actions. More often than not, the inquisitor strives to ensure control over preconceived notions that might interfere. On the other hand, various philosophical schools of thought, like the three more traditional attempts at scientific inquiry, criminology, psychology and sociology, tend to focus on theoretical construct affirmation. Typically, this apparent standard mode of inquiry becomes a matter of subjective validation in the quest to ensure an entitled perspective of theoretical sufficiency. For the sake of preconceived notions, specious conjecture and observational bias, the reflection of subjectivity makes prejudicial the hastily drawn conclusions. Whereas anecdote is not evidence, and correlation is not causation, the nebulous nature of the simplistic inference comes close to the edge of trickery. If that’s too strong a word, maybe deception is more acceptable, or perhaps sleight hand as in magic. Then again, myth, magic and metaphor often translate into reality for a lot people. Emotional reactivity replaced logical analysis. Fiction overrides facts on many occasions in social discourse. Social media and infotainment disguised as news, have become gossipy, rumor oriented grapevines of disinformation. Ignorance runs rampant from classrooms to workplaces, as I.Q. levels continue a downward trend. Not only that, but the debate about the philosophies of pseudoscience, and which one is more fraudulent than the other, is more entertaining than actual problem solving. It’s too late to change the course human devolution. Fallacies of inference that devolve to hasty and inadequate generalizations fill the mainstream every day. While no one knows what anyone thinks, or is thinking at any given moment, many think we can think about what another person is thinking. Some even go into think tanks to think about what another might be thinking. To perpetrate the metaphorical inadequacy of understanding human ideations, fortune telling applications conjure something called the “mind”. Of such, and barely a means of definitive explanation or specificity of human brain activity, the figurative illusion is a simplistic representation. Yet, many a pretentious and arrogant adherent of cannon, doctrine or ideology will invectively argue in opposition regardless of the evidence. Images flash in the mirrors of daily reflections in contemplating the echoes of hidden meanings for devious leanings. Cognitive bias insists upon proving the conjecture in spite of probable evidence to counter the observer’s observation of that which is observed. Bias always arrives without invitation but by instigation to the scene of the incident to be explained. To see what one wants to see reflects the deception of intentional provocations for erroneous perceptions. Continued perpetration of subjective validation sometimes produces disastrous consequences. Nearly an entire society enamored by each one’s own self-interests competes for notice, attention, and validation in an ever-spiraling descent from anything imitating perfection. In wiser discretions, by humble contemplation, what manner of divisiveness is claimed from the posture of a preconceived notion? Outside hard-core scientific validation, no one can say for certain exactly and comprehensively what a person is thinking and why he or she does certain things. As to human behavior in general, there are no specific delineations. For the disciplined and well-principled adherent to one philosophy or the other, the act of humility is in the preface that says one does not have all the answers.  In addition, rigorous analysis, applying at least in theory a working utilization of scientific methodology, strives for consistency of valid replication in every possible instance. Scientific validity finds provability in the crime lab. Outside the practices and principles of hard science investigative processes, absent the physical evidence, most iterations descend to an opinion-based framework. As such, challenges can be countered as to the authenticity of the claim. And with that, the follow up should consistently be that which emphasizes the viability of continual uncertainty. That is, there are always exceptions, and disagreement as to cause and effect hinges on evidentiary artifacts. An advocate for a school of thought may insist that his or her perspective is authoritative. In the fields of criminology, sociology and psychology such is not the case. These are philosophical points of view driven by a self-serving state of “mind” that is subjective. Warnings are constant whenever a particular viewpoint asserts the “evidence shows”, or “it turns out that”, and so on, where a rebuttal can be mounted contrary to the alleged claim. Such admonitions, especially when a perspective is purely from an academic point of view, versus a practitioner’s experienced perspective, regress to adverse consequences. In the disciplined life of the career investigator, one who has ventured into realms both fearful and debasing, a practical inference regards suspiciously any broad generalizations. In pseudoscience, that is to say, those areas outside the hard sciences such as physics or chemistry, subjective validation in perpetration of cognitive bias, foments a kind of intellectual heresy that is dangerous. Making claims that result in egregious consequences, not based on biological evidence, organic disease or physiological deterioration, are a form of “psychic terror”. Added to the complexity is the public, politicians and journalists who have limited understanding of the controversial implications. In the fallout and fallacies of imperfect theoretical provocations, dangerous afflictions perpetrate infringement on personal freedoms. Overall, little is accomplished to enhance greater understanding of human behavior and hastens social deterioration. By perpetration of pseudoscientific standpoints, with easy acceptance by a gullible and misinformed public, deceptions continue from one generation to the next. For the sake of argument, “pseudoscience” should not be offensive to any particular segment of the non-scientific community. On the contrary, the conception ought to be embraced, as a bold act of honesty, and a spirit of brave humility in that one does not have all the answers regarding the nature of human behavior. Yet apparently, especially in the halls of academia, the word “pseudoscience” is scary. Even though adherents to one school of philosophy or another might be prone to overreact, such terminology should not cause fainting spells. Particularly, some will babble about how the field of psychology uses something called the “scientific method”. Okay, and so what? Regardless though, pseudoscience is a vast realm of inquiry that delves into the mysteriousness of human being. From beliefs to practices, there is a mystical notion about cause and effect that remain inconclusive. To chase ghosts, goblins and gremlins for the self-satiation of carnal proclivity speaks loudly of hidden selfishness for cognitive assurances. For the astutely trained perspective, the never-ending pursuit of rationality, gifted by the logic of investigative skepticism, the quietness, in the tranquility of detached intuitiveness inspires ascended creativity. Of that, rather than the smug piety of self-importance in the redundancy of anecdotal conformity, the cynical skepticism of serene introspection needs the consistent practice of meditative exploration. There is a universe of ideations to be considered. For the academic, non-practitioner, and domain biased viewpoint, the human species argues by its very nature from its evolutionary nurture the opposition to a precise equation. No singular scheme or lone precursor gives way to the consummate definition of deterministic or predictive evidentiary sufficiency. To suspend cognitive bias for the quest of higher meaning and ascendancy to enlightened prospects, requires the maturity of uninhibited and open-minded self-liberation. Selflessness in humble credibility and intellectual authenticity suffers the onslaught of serious personal introspection. However, most fear the folly of their perceptions. Unfortunately, advocates, adherents, gurus and proselytes of one philosophy versus another, clamor the superficial efficacy of their hallowed ground. To the contrary of proof beyond doubt by scientific validation, the terror of inconsistency and simplicity clouds the reality. As a result, specious conjecture quickly masquerades as “scientific”, and spreads psychic terrors that hide in the reflections of psychological mirrors. Such arrogance of narcissistic infantile constructs, bear no more than the weightlessness of mere opinion, yet rely on gullibility of a dominion. So well contrived and infused with societal acquiescence, not much can be done to change things. Ideological fallacies pervade the spheres of academia, as well as ecclesiastic and other institutional enclaves.  Likewise, oligarchic political bastions collude wherever possible to safeguard their sense of entitled entrenchment. To look into the reflective imagery of shimmering pools with bottomless inconsistency, and insufficient proofs, invites the collusion for the fallacies to be covered up and hidden. Freethinking individuality is the line of defense against such tyrannies of thought and subsequent oppressions of conformity. Psychic security countermeasures against the ambush of deadly oppositions to personal differentiation includes vigilance for bias and prejudice, selfishness of self-validation.  Of this, immaturity reinforces foolishness. In the horror story of shallow biased commentary, where ideological demonic possession demands an intellectually honest exorcism, most will prefer the demons. In the pseudosciences, the divisive admonitions are relentless with ruthless condescension to dissenting viewpoints.  Once again, the global perspective regarding pseudoscience, inferring open mindedness here, concerns claims and conjectures regarding statements or beliefs that claim scientific factually provable authenticity. However, this suggests the assertion that such positions can meet the test of scientific validation, as in a court of law, beyond any reasonable doubt and to the exclusion of other proofs to the contrary. Psychic/Psychological opinions cannot stand up to real science. Any pretense to science by a pseudoscience, or fortune telling or paranormal investigations, arguably invites skepticism. Every attempt to prove an initial hypothesis wrong, faulty or inauthentic is essential based on compelling evidence. In the hard sciences, the investigator tests the limitations of the physical universe by way of the scientific instrumentation of the laboratory. In the criminal justice field, hard-core science is found in the crime lab or the medical examiner’s office. In academia, among the “social studies”, anything can be called scientific. Regardless, vigorous intensive investigative capacity is essential to safeguard the efficacy of provable solvability for every proposition. From a practitioner’s perspective, logical deduction of well-reasoned analysis insists upon the application of reliable replication in any setting or environment. The proof comes in the evidentiary artifacts that eventually substantiate the truth of any assertion. Whereas therapeutic intervention involving “talking cure” antics is one thing, or drug pacifications for mental health “diagnoses” is another, predictability of future criminality, or cause-effect mitigations, remain specious speculations. Yet, hope springs eternal, as correlation often becomes causation for the erroneous satiation of subjective validation. Of recent lament for the practitioner, at least three generations have allowed themselves to be influenced by the “sacred holiness” of theoretical conjecture unsubstantiated by scientific validation. For the non-practitioner post-graduate theoretician, dutifully regurgitating the replication of previous research on human behavior, the redundancy safeguards the particular philosophical viewpoint. For the pseudoscience “psychic”, fearful and even terrified of opposing viewpoints, much effort is undertaken to ensure opinion becomes fact. In reality, pseudoscience is best considered a work in progress and not scientific confirmation as to any semblance of predictability concerning human behavior. Broad sweeping generalizations are counterproductive where exaggerated claims attempt to define every human being. While pseudoscience often represents commentary, belief systems and practices not necessarily in keeping with the scientific community, anyone can proclaim anything. That is the wonderful attribute of living in a democratic republic that espouses the precepts of inalienable rights. Likewise, the First Amendment is critical in reinforcing the inherent constitutional safeguards. Beliefs in such things as astrology, ufology, crop circles, creationism, faces on Mars, and so on, concern a range of viewpoints. For many people, these are very serious issues. Of these, all manner of subjective claims cover the gamut of earth sciences, energy, physics, medicine, etc. In the realm of the social studies, or so-called “social sciences”, there should be no embarrassment, resentment, territorial protectionism, fearful defensiveness, jealousy or animosity to admit that criminology, psychology and sociology fall into the same categories. These associated pseudosciences are connected to the non-scientific realm of assorted ideologies. They are philosophies that remain a work in progress over time, yet lack the rigorous authenticity of the hard sciences. Each shares its complicity by way of unsubstantiated evidentiary proofs that are countered by opposing points of view. Characterized by conflicting claims, oppositional counter-arguments, confirmation prejudice and subjective validation, claims are inconclusive. In addition, there is nothing lost in accepting the reality that, when it comes to human thinking, human nature, or getting “inside the mind”, there are no absolute and no final answers. Such things are extraordinarily complex. To take the high road, the mature experienced ascendancy to higher level of self-evolution and enlightenment, requires exceptional personal transformation. Unfortunately, few are willing to rise above the mundane stifling of the status quo. At the end of the day, it is all a matter of opinion. Regardless, adherents will react viciously, for example in the field of psychology, to challenges that question the validity of a particular perspective. For self-serving validation, personal self-interests, and related egoistic fears, maintaining the status quo of persistent ideological regurgitations, is the path of least resistance. At the same time, protecting mainstream consensus ensures the simplicity and security of cognitive bias. For these reasons and more, so many in the social studies environment want to be viewed as scientists. With that, there is a sense of solving the mysteries of the “mind” and attaching some type of “laboratory experimentation” of some sort. But, the crime lab, the physics lab and the morgue, are places where real science tests the serious applications of scientific validity. Unfortunately, for the PhD in the “social sciences”, there is not a lot of science. Outside to the surreal world of academia, the “soft scientist” pretends to be a “scientist” by way of wishful thinking."
3,Bad Driving Habits,social-issues," Bad driving habits are the main causes of accidents on our roads. Firstly, drinking and driving is a worldwide bad habit that contributes to a larger percentage of accidents on the roads. When driving under the influence of alcohol, or any other substance, it is indeed an awful combination. Despite the effort to hunt down drivers under the influence of alcohol, many have not taken heed. The Federal Bureau of Investigation shows that about 1.4 million drivers were arrested in 2010 while driving under the influence of alcohol. Out of these, 28% of the drivers were involved in fatal accidents. The second reason is the use of mobile phones while driving. This involves holding conversation or texting. In reality, one cannot be texting and at the same time concentrating on what is ahead. In fact, the US Department of Transportation states that 1.6 million accidents are related to the use of a cellular phone. In addition, Virginia Tech Driving Institute stipulates that those individuals who use mobile phone while driving have about 23% higher risk of being involved in an accident. Driving while the fog lights are on when it is not necessary is mainly done by inexperienced drivers, who may even forget when to turn on or off the lights. They forget that these lights communicate much to those either behind or ahead and can easily cause accidents. This ignorance habit can cost one’s life. This is coupled with the habit of not observing traffic lights. Most drivers ignore traffic lights and assume that people will understand they are in a hurry. This is a habit that can cost one’s life and endanger others. Eating while driving is another bad habit since some drivers think they can do many tasks at a time. This puts one into a higher risk as one may not be able to concentrate on the road effectively. This is because one may be taking hands off the steering wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, when a driver is eating on a highway, there are higher chances of being involved in an accident by 80%. Therefore, food and drinks on a highway can be more alarming than texting. Another bad driving habit is lane hogging and jumping queue. This is a major cause of distraction and traffic jams on major highways. This is caused by bad habits possessed by drivers of not being patient or considerate of other drivers. They just want to reach faster not considering their safety or that of others. They may be knocked by standers or even an oncoming car. Arguing, holding serious conversations or even fighting while driving is another bad habit that causes accidents. These actions release one’s emotions and influence one’s actions simply because someone may distract one’s attention off the road. Indeed, an individual’s mental state is crucial. Therefore, when one is not calm and concentrated, he/she is likely to be involved in an accident. It is advisable that the battles should be taken off the wheel. Improper indication while on the highway is another bad driving habit. Indication is mainly done using rear lights. However, some drivers do not understand the essence of such indication before taking an action such as turning right or left. Some go to the extent of moving their head out through the driver’s door and shouting to other drivers while may be taking a turn. In fact, such a habit can be very disgusting to others. Other major bad habits in driving include overspending and failure by drivers to check and adhere to road signs. In conclusion, from the above analysis, millions of accidents around the world are as a result of bad driving habits. Although most drivers are always aware that they are not doing what is right, they ignore and never give heed. The result is that they end up losing their life and endangering other road users.

5,How To Choose Righteous Friends,social-issues," “A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out.” – Walter Winchell. Building a healthy friendship is important in your social life. Friends are the bodies that you need to be around in your life - who stand by your side in all circumstances - good or bad. Those who will help you achieve your mission, support you, encourage you in performing act of goodness, loyal and truthful persons. However, you should be so mindful and wise in selecting them, since being in relationship with good and righteous persons is a genuine issue. And would be a means for your total change into a new world of correctness. Moreover, there is a fact saying: you would be defined - who you are - through your friends. Besides,  righteous and virtues Muslim, is a necessary means of keeping you on the right path. And the issue of having right companions is essential to our Deen - which says: ""A believer is the mirror of his brother,"" and if he sees any faults in the other believer, he draws his attention to it in an acceptable manner, helps him to give it up and to wipe away any evil that he may have. Thus you are recommended to: • Choose knowledgeable friend, and want to share his knowledge with you. • Choose the one who is obedient to his Lord, adheres to the teaching of his religion ; is keen to please Allah. • Choose the one who reminds you of your Lord, whenever you become heedless of his remembrance. • Choose the one who doesn't look for or seek out the fault of his brother; rather he seek excuses for them - easy going person. • Choose anyone who will enhance you. In an authentic Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: ""A person is likely to follow the faith of his friend, so look whom you befriend."" [reported by Abu Dawood & Tirmidhee In addition, don't worry about the few numbers of them you have, rather the qualities. To be sure that, goodness is not necessarily lies in number, but in quality. so no worries even if you have few friends. Furthermore, there is a vast difference between an individual who involves in social affairs - being around good peoples - and the one who deprives himself from social environment. Because, staying away in good social gathering is contrary to normal life. As a human, you will need persons that you get along with. In the same way, it's encouraged to be socialized, and be good to anyone comes along your way. Interact nicely with them, accept their invitations for permissible events, and help them solve their problems. POINTS: CORE OF THE MATTER : ° Numbers don't matter, but quality do. ° Righteous friends can have influence on your feelings, thinking, and activity positively. °Avoiding negative friends, can maintain goodness in your manners. ° Be friend with righteous persons who will guides you to right path -  faithful believers . Faith is very important. ° Bad company will corrupt your character, while good ones rectify. ° Friends that Islam unite you, are the best friends. ° Spending time with wise people can lead  you to wisdom. Likewise,  being with foolish people. ° A friend in need is a friend indeed. Friend who stand for you in tough time is the right friend. ° Befriend righteous people despite of their races or nationalities. ° A loyal friends are the friends in real but not double-faced - who praise you at your sight, and deform you behind your back. ° Don't join an easy crowd: Envious,   gossipmongers, backbiters, fake news spreaders....... etc ° You will be with whom you love in the hereafter. So a companion of righteous in this life and you would be with righteous companions in the hereafter also. In conclusion, Dear brother/sister, pause a while and reflect on this issue. Be your own best friend, in selecting righteous friends. Therefore, you wouldn't regret in long after. However, good friends could be a ladder to you _ to help you reach your goal -  and lead you to success, such that even some of your family members couldn't do.

6,World of Religions: Hinduism,social-issues," In the course of centuries, Hinduism has been considered the prevailing religion in India and other countries, bearing increasingly powerful spirituality. It is unusually diverse, distinguished by community, caste, language, and territory, which creates challenges for strangers to understand it. However, this diversity did not prevent this religion from becoming one of five major world religions. Currently, the major essence of Hinduism consists in the understanding of different philosophies and paths of life (Narayanan 9). It also includes an array of philosophies which are as well called Sanatana Dharma, which refer to the eternal path, which is taken by a person. All these concepts and ramifications create a balance between faith, religion, and philosophy of life which are presented in a synergetic combination. Specific attention should be paid to the meaning and functions performed by Hinduism, should it be viewed as a religion or a single set of beliefs and philosophies. Some theories state that the idea of Hinduism as a single, unified system of beliefs was initiated by the British imperialists. Nicholson introduces an alternative perspective on the concept. Despite the fact that Hindu identity is not as ancient as the religion identity itself, it is based on the ideas of South Asian philosophy since fourteenth century (25). Now, for almost two centuries, the researchers have believed that such schools of philosophy as Yoga, Samkhya, Vedanta, Siva, and Vishu belong to one system of knowledge. However, more and more theories emerge, assuming that there are different understandings and beliefs, creating a versatile Brahman, the universe’s ultimate reality. The author, therefore, introduces a new vision of Hinduism focusing on the fact that this religion could be developed and advanced similar to the way the philosophy of life is developing. In fact, nowadays, there is an idea that all world religion could reach common understanding and unify one day, which would be logical due to the similarity of specific events, principles and values described in their sacred writings. In conclusion, it should be stressed that Hinduism is considered one of five major world religions and the oldest of all religions. Due to its long history and diversity, numerous beliefs, systems of knowledge, philosophic schools and spiritual and self-development practices have emerged on the basis of this religion. Nonetheless, Hinduism should still be perceived as the path chosen by an individual with faith in the divine force as it is its main meaning and mission."
7,A Free Market Strategy That Systematically Underwrites Instead of Undermines American Democracy!,social-issues," A legitimate political democracy and an economy that’s dominated by concentrated wealth and power are inevitably at odds with one another. Concentrated wealth/power is a cancer that owns and controls the government at the expense of we the people. It undermines democracy. If we really want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people we must change the current economic system. In this light the question becomes, how can we most effectively democratize America’s free market economy? Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it helps to DEMOCRATIZE the market and the POLITICAL PROCESS •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 70 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
8,Sexuality of Violence and Other Human Predations – Part 2,social-issues," In the last adventure in the pseudosciences, the exploration of human behavior considered the sexual impetus to act out in certain ways. Sometimes, the behaviors become illicit forms of anti-communal deviations, and other times, unlawful actions result in harmful inflictions. Deviance can be described as that which violates duly constituted codes, regulations and statutory provisions as instituted by lawful governmental constituted authority. Otherwise, if a particular act is not defined by statute or code, then who defines what is deviant? As a side note in the exploration of Gonzo Theory and subset topics referred to as “cryptocriminology”, it is offered for either mindless or meaningful discussion, that “pseudoscience” applies to the murky and mysterious realms of criminology, sociology and psychology. Organic, material, or biological substantiation by laboratory specificity remain elusive in these academic areas. Yet, social media, movies, news reporting, politics, etc., continue to perpetrate associated mythologies and metaphorical misunderstandings. As diehard adherents run screaming, ranting, and gnashing their teeth into the court of political correctness, filing one complaint after another, inquisitors must beckon the inquiry as to scientific validation. If one challenges the “sacred doctrines” of hollowed sanctuaries of academia, there are dire consequences of sure and swift ostracizing.  What physiological substantial hard science proof is there for any theoretical claim, no matter how much anecdotal references one cites? For every assertion of mental affliction, what is the biological test for this or that? Gonzo Theory asserts a standpoint of skepticism with a healthy dose of cynicism. An investigative process should insist upon doubt, disbelief and suspicion regarding any claim of certainty when it comes to human behavior. It is a presupposition from this posture that behavioral analysis follows a path of idiosyncratic appraisal. Likewise, “cryptocriminology” strives to overturn long held theoretical notions that can be attacked for their lack of substantive evidentiary sufficiency. And, within the field of criminology issues remain controversial. “Cryptocriminology” is a reference to that which remains mysterious, unknown, hidden or secret, and mostly speculation. This applies as in the multidimensional complexity of human thinking. By contrast, when a question arises as to what is “normal behavior” a variety of responses can be heard echoing all manner of belief system. Regardless of ideological viewpoint, or philosophical doctrine, neither dogma nor doctrine can dictate normalcy. Communal constraints as accepted by social conventionality are choices to be made on an individual basis. There are always exceptions and consequences to choices one or more people decide upon. In an unevolving society, which faces probable extinction, authenticity and openness about serious contemplations regarding human sexuality is frequently discouraged. Previously it was stated that the amazing nature of human sexuality seems to frighten, intimidate and embarrass most people. At least that’s the public expression, or what might be portrayed in a collegiate classroom setting. There are exceptions of course to every issue. For a few, among those more prone to mature, wiser and more creatively inquisitive discoveries, the vast array of imaginative sexuality is an exceptional quest for self-evolution. Not only does one study after another extoll the extraordinary health benefits of sexual activity, but the subsequent healthy effects on the brain are exceptionally positive. In the individuation of personal freedom and liberation, psycho-bio-sexual differentiation is a life-long transformation to productive self-discovery. Independent individuality is a deeper search for more profound levels of understanding and intuitive insight, and sexual vitality is critical to the process. However, one study suggests younger generations are experiencing less sexual activity than an older generation. A growing sense of naiveté, gullibility and misinformation appears more prevalent than ever. Whatever the multidimensional factors, most will shun a personal exploration of sexual discovery, and avoid keeping an open mind as to the vast range of human proclivities.  As a result, serious investigative analysis will be stifled. As one older generation flows into the next younger generation, fearful notions about sexuality become evident. In spite of vast information resources, ignorance and immaturity flourish. Human existence is an amazing expression of sexuality. Likewise, narcissistic infantilism and grotesque expressions of selfishness suggest a regressive and devolving species. This extends analysis into to what one author calls the “diabolis sexualis”, or when sexuality is used in dysfunctional and maladaptive ways. Primarily this regards the darker side of humanity when people do harm to others. The infliction of pain and suffering on another is a product of choice, malice aforethought, premeditated and intentional this perception stems from the criminological school of thought sometimes called the Classical School in criminology. People purposefully make rational choices to perpetrate illicit and unlawful afflictions from others, of which, sexuality is the primary drive and force behind their behaviors. One can select options to be productive and creative, or prefer the opposite, and cause destruction. From the healthy sense of the sexual nature, one can provide the basis for a more uninhibited framework of transformation. For the bolder inquiry, on the trek of human sexual behavior research, as related to the scheme of so called anti-social behaviors, a different philosophical standpoint diverts from mainstream canonistic or dogmatic ideological belief systems. Whether one agrees or disagrees, is arguable to a particular point of view as regards manifestations of human behavior. Here, the “philosophical viewpoint” infers that outside the realm of the “hard sciences”, the pseudosciences are matters of opinion based on belief system. Even among those who claim “expert opinion” status, in a court of law, everything is debatable. To that point, who is an “expert” when it comes to a non-science school of thought, particularly in the trinity of pseudosciences, criminology, sociology and psychology?   Two critical aspects surface. One, by what experience, or investigative process does an expert claims expertise? And two, is the level of competence measured purely from the “classroom” setting by recitation of anecdotal or observation analysis? This would be an exercise in an appeal to one’s “authority” by way of limited interactions of interpersonal engagement. Unlike hard sciences like chemistry, biology, physics, or astronomy, the “pseudosciences” as mentioned earlier, focus around philosophies of diverse perceptions. With respect to criminological applications, such is a matter of one opinion versus another. By contrast, as in the crime lab, the forensic sciences apply scientific validation to authenticate the viability of credible evidence. Beyond any doubt and to the exclusion of all other possibilities, by rigorous technical analysis, and experiential competency, authenticity reaches a higher certainty. Yet, on the contrary and in opposition to molecular frameworks of the physical world, the realms of conscious to unconscious thinking processes continue to define absolute degrees of certainty. Nonetheless, social, political and institutional contrivances remain entrenched in the dogma of one ideological viewpoint vying with another, to ascribe a scientific basis to a philosophical school of thought. In that regard, such debate presupposes one theoretical foundation is more scientific than another. Some viewpoints have become “cult—like” and territorial in academic turf wars. In many institutions of so-called higher learning, subdivisions within academia are designed with titles such as the “school of social and behavioral sciences”. Other educational institutions changed those identifiers to the “college of arts and letters”. Minor points, but relevant. As opinions vary in regard to the nature of criminality, relevancy is important in terms of distinguishing what can be proved or disproved by way of the essentiality of evidentiary criteria. Even though one may claim the application of scientific methodology in researching an issue, looking under a microscope is more critical than conducting a survey, or doing an observation in a controlled setting. This raises issues of preconceived notions as to observer’s influence upon an observation. To control bias, and otherwise control subjective validation, absent defensiveness and negative retribution, a mature investigative inquiry requires significant fortitude. Most people are not capable of insisting upon the discipline of their emotions, feelings and personal beliefs, particularly ideologies of a supernatural perspective. For instance, an analysis of human sexuality, and specifically the relationship to intentional violence, invites fearful resistance due to prejudicial inclinations on the part of the investigator. The inquiry is predisposed to subjective inclination given a particular belief system. Naturally, there are always exceptions, but unfortunately, that is an exceptionally eccentric group who strive to self-evolve and transform in a well-differentiated mind-set. For the few who aspire to be different, such effort is demanding. Frequently, however, the mere suggestion of libidinous motivational factors conjures a wide range of self-focused misdirection in relation to the necessity of an open-minded analysis. In addition, an important query is to ask what the evidence shows, and would any claim or assertion with stand the rigorous serious scientific validation. As to human behavior, that is to say thinking processes, there are no certainties, absolutes or anything else pretending to be indisputable. Seemingly, as time goes by, and generations come and go, it is likely openness in public discourse becomes more challenging. To circumvent the possibilities of offending, “victimizing” or otherwise “violating” political correctness, much discussion overly simplistic. In avoiding the presumed trespass upon subjects deemed taboo, bizarre or deviant, relevant debate, analysis and insight are often reduced to a mundane sophomoric level. Nonetheless, matters of human sexuality are extremely important aspects in the totality of human behavioral intricacy. Not only that, but what most researchers and investigators choose to overlook is the extraordinary relevance to the variety of illicit human actions. In a framework of pretentious “normality”, human sexuality is at the core of being human. As the most important compelling force in human action choices, there is every reason to believe the criticality of such in illegal motivations. Particularly in terms of violent behaviors is the significance of sexual proclivities as essential is analyzing the incentive and subsequent consequences. Unfortunately, due to self-interests of one aspect or another, there is an effort to downplay the issue of amative instigations. Sometimes it’s political correctness and sometimes its intellectual fear. On other occasion such is a matter of ignorance and avoidance of more in-depth analytical application. Frequently, for one prejudicial notion or another, as well as mythical beliefs, as in religion, seem to carry out regressive oppressions toward a free exploration of the individual sexual considerations in a particular act of violence. Conventional status quo regurgitation of the same old worn out doctrines and dogmas stifle greater leaps of understanding. Avoiding the general significance of amative and salacious instigating thought processes, other than for criminality, is not fundamentally a simple course of investigative inquiry. Whereas the popularity of the so-called “serial killer” excites many theorists, academics and practitioners alike, fostering many theories, speculation as to this excitation on the part of investigators is fascinating. Could it be the sensuality of the investigator at work in the darker aspects of one’s personality? Of course, we are affected by our thinking processes, the inspirational factors stimulate from deeper psychosexual components that are intricately of “mind” and body interactivity. Unfortunately, this depth of psychic dimensions is beyond our current capacity to completely define precise distinctions. However, within the pseudosciences, criminology, psychology and sociology, rational and productive speculations are a beginning point. With diverse and varied schools of thought, discussion should foster open and candid considerations of the motivational factors leading to illicit commissions of “anti-social” behaviors. Sometimes, immaturity does not allow openness. Immaturity can be viewed here as referring to “egos too big” for in-depth discussions, as reflected in “academia”, arrogance at to exclusivity of one’s field of study, and stupidity as to scope of topical areas. Similarly, fear that a particular school of thought might be exposed as “pseudoscience”, is frightening to sacred belief systems. As such, investigative inquiry cannot overlook the trend in deliberate ignorance across the vast reaches of mainstream social interactions. Emotional defensiveness is dangerous. According to several surveys and research efforts recently, a growing inclination tends to devolve toward an increasing “anti-intellectual” atmosphere in American society. In reaction to scientific validity, supported by evidence, as found in real sciences, such as physics, chemistry and biology, intentional stupidity is often preferred. In a devolving culture, wiser levels of maturity wane, as emotional reactivity relishes in the condescending interactivity of purposeful ignorance. From the classical view, or rational choice perspective, willful selectivity of particular course of action are purposeful and premeditated. For some practitioners, this motivation is extraordinarily sexual in content and format within individual ideation. Yet, a consistent worldview remains challenging in that each investigator brings his or her bias to the investigative and reasoning processes. As maturity in self-evolution toward more enlightened spheres of thinking interact across a diverse spectrum, theoretical applications vary. As ascendency toward a civilization filled with an enlightened species grows dimmer with each generation, the likelihood of interpersonal violence increases. Nonetheless, from the classic assessment of behavior, other schools of thought might bring to bear a range of fallacies of inference. Spurred by specious conjecture, skewed by ideological doctrine (e.g. religious beliefs, supernatural and metaphysical inclinations), based on questionable theories and nonscientific validation, are often given wider influence in mainstream society. Often for the sake of subjective validation encouraged by “magical thinking” in simplistic solutions, errors are overlooked. The mention of homicide here refers primarily to the diversity of human killing contrary to matters of law. In particular, the attendant bias suggested is that humans have a special affinity for killing, as a result of subjective validation for the sake of self-assurance within the scheme of personal thinking processes. This in turn is offered as a critical and elemental aspect of one’s personal sexuality, in addition to the perception therein, from fantasy to reality. It might be referred to in the sense that killing reflects a dysfunctional sexual framework of a highly personal nature. Nonetheless, the complexity is multidimensional as no single factor or specific component explains definitively the nature of human destructiveness within his or her species. Illicit and perverse ideations translate into murderous behaviors, but no solitary theory can suffice every potentiality. As thinking skills diminish, tainted by cognitive bias, the selfishness of human arrogance portends seemingly limitless possibilities.  Unfortunately, in the aftermath of a killing, the media, politicians and a host of others, typically espouse a socio-political agenda. In doing so, the real issues as to the unfathomable depths of human thinking, in the darkest reaches of the psychic abyss, will never be understood. Social psychobabble for the satiation of a diversity of special interests will overshadow and otherwise stifle efforts to expose the reality. Collusive efforts work to ensure simplistic notions that fit the mainstream agenda of a particular narrative. For which, many succumb to the most naive explanation palatable. Easy acceptance of a trouble free superficial claim strives for the safeguarding of status quo consensus. To ponder the problematic reaches of unlabored conjecture challenges the imagination, providing a process of imaginative thinking is actually practiced. Take for instance a particular ideology or belief system, from which absurdities might unfold. Is it constructed on the superficiality of faith or the authenticity of fact? Do claims meet the rigorous pressures of intense investigative analysis? Or, is the inquiry merely driven by opinionated speculation? Most often however, if it sounds good, feels good, pampers the bias of subjective validation, and supports consumerism, political agenda, etc., then it must be okay, right? Entire careers, cottage industries, sales and marketing, dissertations, grant funding, and so on depend on the acceptability of the consumer. Consumption in a bloated and bigoted consumer society can mean many different things to different people. Belief in a product, or ideology, which might be a “school of thought”, as in one of the many fields of psychology, sociology and criminology, belief is critical to the pretentions toward alleged behavioral solvability. Yet, not so fast. Imperfect humans, with deceptive and self-oriented intentions, misuse data and ignore evidence. The pretense of solvability, such as pseudoscientific claims, is essential to a theory that suggests or pretends to suggest the reasons why a serial killer killed the people he or she killed. Essentiality relates to the “salesmanship” of the so-called “expertise” of the “expert”. Where humans are concerned, not much changes over time. The same old arguments, claims, and allegations, based on interviews, surveys, statistics, group observations, prison cell interviews, and so on, regurgitate the never ending recycling of the same old story tales. Younger generations come and go, and the same questions asked beg for want to new answers. Meanwhile, every effort is generated to pacify the public, politicians, and pundits, so that the social consensus of the status quo feels better about having an answer. If for example “criminal profiling” is accepted in the mainstream, due to the mysticism and mythic framework of a particular organization, then a unique fabrication can become the folklore of “legendary insight”. If many people, without serious inquiry buy into the conjecture, then absent serious scientific validation, the theoretical construct becomes believable. Additionally, if based on a particular psychological school of thought, then lots of books, articles, movies, medications, and consultations can promote a range of consumptive processes. As a result, the mainstream realm of communal consumption is filled with illusions contending to be “solvability factors” easily accepted at face value. At the same time, the mention of sexuality scares people. Since most people find it comforting to believe in the supernatural (80% according to several studies), along with associated myths, magical fascinations, dogma, ritual, fallacies of inference, hasty generalizations, or other worldly illusions, unsubstantiated conjure is easier to accept instead of scientifically validated evidence. Such over-simplification and exaggeration should not come as a surprise. Yet, looking back about 200,000 years, it would be nice if the human race had actually advanced much more than it has. Unfortunately, it has not. For the seasoned and experienced investigator, academia is not very convincing either. After all, alleged “expertise” from the hallowed halls of ivory towers does not necessarily infer greater perspectives of “knowledge and wisdom”. Primarily, that is partly because viewpoints stem from belief systems. As such, ideology reflects philosophical views connected to, or otherwise influenced by, metaphysical points of reference. Bias influences conclusions, observer additionally influences observations, and research design often affects the outcome of the research. On an intellectual level, this might suggest that preconception already plays into the shortcomings of any conjecture. Following that, an inference could be implied that subjective validation has already predetermined the outcome of particular theoretical construct. Additionally, preconceived notions of behavior could be erroneous. Not only that, add to the conjectural prejudice the feeling and emotions linked to any serious discussion about sexuality. Any mention of sex causing many to suffer a range of anxious reactivity. Scared, fearful and embarrassed about self-doubt, inhibitions, beliefs and so forth, and the issue becomes taboo. Unless of course, the subject matter can be fit neatly into an inoffensive template, such as say for instance “lust murder”. Once categorized as such, the ideations surrounding a human psychobiological function can be held at an intellectual distance. Aside from that possibility, other troublesome data suggest the woeful ignorance of the American population regarding “sex ed” in general. Not only that, from one generation to the next, studies show a severe deficit in terms of critical analytic ability. If so, then simple and uncomplicated is easier to accept. Added to that is the unreality of non-practitioner inferred reliability as to the formulation of a simplistic generalization. By “non-practitioner”, reference is made about someone claimed to be an “expert” who has little or no experience in the real world of criminal behavior. To the theoretician, belief system of a dogmatic inclination further complicates matters. Typically, this is the academician who has gone from classroom to faculty office with a narrow perspective. More often than not, they appear on news shows to offer their alleged “expertise”. As such, given mythical belief systems, non-science “validity” based on opinion, regurgitation of philosophical points of view by anecdotal citation, and bias of personal agenda for subjective validation, with pretense to causation is questionable. As to criminogenic factors, preconceived notions based on specious conjecture is skewed toward the viewpoint making the claims. Likewise, added to this complexity is the influence of degenerative interpretation of cause and effect. Assertions based on devolving intellectual capacity ought to be viewed as suspicious. That is to suggest that subsequent generations demonstrating sometimes display an inability to ensure rigorous investigative processes reinforced by scientific sufficiency. Following the typical status quo accepted consensus, erroneous fallacies of inference manufacture misleading and misguided generalizations. This reflects across society as symptomatic of human interactivity that is devolving. In this regard, the primal descent to rudimentary frames of reference, in terms of social interaction, become increasingly regressive. Social discourse becomes degenerative. Likewise, in this schematic of human interaction, the fear of sexuality is commonplace and reflects a complicated mix of conjecture, opinion, misinformation and immaturity. Important among this is immaturity. Some investigators might delight in the prospect of having a seriously mature conversation about sexuality, and particular deviant sexuality, without the usual defensive juvenile reactions. Fundamentally, when it comes to malice aforethought, premeditation, and intentional infliction, the generalization here is that all violence reflect primordial sexual desires. As state laws tend to define destructive aggressions of a “sexual nature”, with terms as sexual assault, sexual battery, forced sexual intercourse, rape or forced penetration, etc., the classical view here is that “sexual violations” are of a broader context. To take this further, the inference is that all behaviors have a profound driving sexuality behind them. It can be argued that the sexuality of an individual can be “weaponized” to harm others. Immediately, some will react defensively. However, in the pseudosciences, like criminology, sociology and psychology, toss in theology as well, very little science is at work. Instead, anecdotal conjecture is very prominent, as opposed to hardcore scientific sufficiency. Within these competing fields of philosophical inquiry, opinions are diverse with regard to malicious premeditated intentions of the criminal. Similarly, depending on the belief system of the claimant, as well as level of expertise, a variety of mitigations, sometimes called excuses, are claimed for the perpetrator. From an investigative standpoint, aside of the legalities of a lawful criminal investigation, the bias of a belief system influences the conclusion of an inquiry. In a recent online publication describing paraphilic labels designated by the psychological industry, researchers listed various sexual paraphilia. Of these, erotophonophilia for instance depicted the deriving of pleasure from murdering another person. An expression of sexual arousal in murdering or imagining the killing of a human being, within the academic community, is called “lust murder”.  That phrase generally relates to what some describe as a linkage between “lust” and “desire” to bring about the death of another person. In the sexuality of human behavior, and by connection to homicidal actions, it is appropriate to have a general descriptor. Typically, as with all the pseudosciences, the challenges remains in the broad realm of speculation for better or for worse. Terms like lust, desire, sadistic, and sexual are difficult to quantify with compelling specificity. While such words may describe a certain range of behaviors, they fall short in delineating exact description of human thinking processes. Of these themes, as noted by other inquiries, there are numerous variations regarding a general designation described as a “sexual killing”. However, in attempting to identify cerebral activity that results in the killing of another, diverse schools of thought used terms like “lust murder” or “sex murder”. One word or phrase should suffice in the expression of violent behaviors perpetrated against another person. Perhaps the term erotophonophilia could be utilized in the broadest manner possible. Unfortunately, the word depicts a narrow connotation and applies primarily to the perception of a yearning to kill for the pleasure of achieving a sexual arousal. Yet, such a delineation remains insufficient in the totality of defining in particular all forms of murderous behaviors. From assassination for instance, to sexual battery and subsequently killing another human, ought to have a word of phrase that is applicable in every situation. In short, violence in general is a manifestation of maladaptive sexuality. And, in spite of techno advances in society, by invention of the few, criminal activity remained an ageless matter of choice. The selection of violence as a means of problem solving, by way of assessment of personal gain, emanating from the nature of individual sexuality, permeates all societies across the planet. Regardless of the pretentious conjecture of arrogant propositions, human beings continue to imagine, fantasize, premeditate and otherwise inflict horrendous acts. Whether actual physical harm, or more covert contrivances of bullying instigation, people will harm others in diverse and sinister ways. Cowardly acts of political intrigue, to manipulation of financial resources, to straggling a partner to death, stem from an intimate connectivity of diabolical sexuality. Times pass, but doing harm to others is a weaponization of carnality. Regardless of the label, or the attempts to downplay the motivation, the salacious impetus to harm another falls within a humanistic framework. Some may narrowly adjust the focus to something range of behavior called “lust murder”, while others assert a frame of reference referred to as “sex murder”. Typically, this is the perspective often found in most criminal justice related college textbooks. A scan of the contents in the standard reference source generally concerns topical areas as “sexual abuse of children”, or “sexual assault”, meaning rape, or something called “sexually based murders”, etc. Terminology tends to be definitively narrow. A more encompassing approach toward the long arduous journey of attempting to understand human behavior ought to allow for the realization that sexuality is of primary importance. That is to say, instead of continuing to infer restrictive definitions to fit particular situations, a broader perception is essential. To that realm, and more specifically, sexuality of violence could considered in a much wide-ranging spectrum of human thinking processes. Mindfulness imagines the behavior that is to follow. Making choices in response to the surrounding environment depends upon the imaginative capacity of the individual. Much complexity comes into play. On an individualized basis, the extent to which a person, and in particular, a criminal, desires to deal with the confrontations of life, evolves or devolves in a range of expressions toward others. Regardless, the contention here is that the very essence of human activity, no matter what form that takes, emanates from a very personalized nature of bio-sexuality. Taken in the totality of the person, the translation from ideation to fruition is intricate, diverse, and multidimensional. No single explanation can perfectly depict or describe the complexity of the manifestation. To some, the satiation of sensual gratification or in the context of sexual pacification, the balance between pain and pleasure explores a variety of options. Aggressive behaviors become the means by which immediate personal gratification can be achieved. Such is a complex of means to an amative end to ensure inner validation for the desire necessity. In the view of some researchers, the motivational factors conclude, or at least culminate, in an “existential rage”. As to personal proclivity, “sexual frustration” translates into aggression based on sexual motivation. Other investigators cite ongoing studies into the neurological implications associated with sexually aggressive actions and human deviations from normal behaviors. In furthering the study of the sexuality of violence, along with other human predations, tentative assessments point to a metaphorical balance between pain and pleasure. Pain is the violence from the essential hunt to gratify the pleasures often oppressed or otherwise inhibited by the mainstream society."
9,HOW TO GET YOUR EX BACK: PROVEN METHODS AND TIPS,social-issues," To return the ex - we all thought about this possibility, but is it worth it? In this article, we have sorted out all the pros and cons, highlighted all the time-tested, psychologists and people advice, as well as made the content so that it is convenient for you to navigate through the article. CONTENT: List of pros and cons Top tips to help you get your relationship back Is his return really necessary? What can you do to get him back? What to write to your ex to get him back What if he has another How to get a guy back if I left him myself LIST OF PROS AND CONS Before you decide whether to return your boyfriend, you should weigh all the reasons why you want to do it, and the reasons why you broke up with the boyfriend. The main questions you should be honest with yourself are: Is it worth your attention and trying to get it back? What has he brought into your life? Are you better off without it? What mistakes have you made in your relationship? What led to your breakup? If you honestly answer the questions, you can understand how to get a person back into your life and if you really need it. TOP TIPS TO HELP YOU GET YOUR RELATIONSHIP BACK TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF It is your attention to yourself, without looking back at the past, that will help the ex to understand that everything is fine with you - and such a mood will definitely not go unnoticed and he will definitely want to know why everything is fine with you: through acquaintances, mutual friends and photos in social networks. DON'T EXPECT ACTION FROM HIM Obvious advice, but rarely used. Do not wait for his calls, do not go to his page, do not put ""likes"" in the hope that he will pay attention to them. You are not a victim. You are a self-sufficient girl who does not need the attention of her ex. Perhaps, looking at yourself from the position of the queen of this situation, you will understand that returning to the past is not the best fate for you. And remember, if he calls or writes, you do not need to jump around the room with joyful cries - let him think that you are fine without him. DON'T RUSH IT If a pause in your relationship occurred on his initiative, re-read the previous paragraph and understand that the man should take a break from you and miss you. If you find it difficult to contain yourself and not text him, put your phone aside and do something that will not leave you free time. By the way, dancing and sports will not only make you not think about your ex, but also make your figure fit and sexy. NEW ME"" Now you need to create a new self. Change your haircut, dye your hair in a color that you have not dared to for a long time, change the style. Do everything to make him understand - you are ready to meet a new love. The guy, if he still has feelings for you, will not remain indifferent. TRAVEL When we go on vacation, our body realizes that something incredible is starting and increases the amount of endorphins. Resting, you immediately kill three birds with one stone - put in order the state of mind, temporarily leave the field of vision of the former young man and get a beautiful tan. WRITE A LETTER An old psychological method that still has no analogues. Write about what good happened to you, how grateful you are for it and ... let go. If your former love does not return to you, you will be able to be grateful for the relationship and the willingness to start new ones. And if you come back, then together you will remember all the best moments. These tips will help you start living anew, improve yourself and your mood, and understand what needs to be done to get it back to you. IS HIS RETURN REALLY NECESSARY? Give yourself time. The easiest thing is to rush into the pool with your head and use everything to return it, but this way it becomes possible to again make all the mistakes that you went through. If your relationship was toxic - there was physical and psychological pressure on his part, in no case should you return to him. His words that he will change are heard every day by thousands of girls around the world. He will not change, such people never change. If you are tempted to return to the abuser, visit a psychologist, he will help you solve the problem and not ""get stuck"" in the same relationship. If your day started or ended with tears, tantrums, quarrels, and accusations, don't come back. It was not love - rather, a desire to feel acute emotions. You can feel adrenaline without a relationship - skydiving, diving, skiing. As I said above, thousands of girls face the problem of abuse and not all can leave on time. Understand that by returning to a mentally unstable person, you endanger not only your psychological health, but also your physical health. This relationship will destroy you, your life, and your personality. You will lose your friends, loved ones will turn away, and you yourself will fall asleep and wake up with fear. I know this firsthand and advise from the bottom of my heart that such a relationship should not be returned. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO GET HIM BACK? If you have definitely decided that you only see him next to you, let's discuss the moments that will help bring your ex-husband back. STOP LIVING ON AUTOPILOT People get used to being around a loved one and forget that they need to change. Routine consumes - home-study / work-cooking-dinner-sleep. Think back to the last time you were interested in something other than what groceries to buy home and what kind of skirt your hated colleague will wear today. Read an interesting book, go to the solarium - stop living life, live it. BE INTERESTING Top models, despite their appearance, are of little interest to anyone in real life, but erudition, education, the ability to maintain a conversation and cook something other than borscht are much more appreciated. You should look neat (remove from your wardrobe the old stretched T-shirts that you use instead of home clothes) and you should have something to talk about. INVEST IN RELATIONSHIPS Relationships need to be worked on, even if everything seems to be fine. Men stop giving women flowers, women do not try to look good at home - the relationship of a loving couple turns into a relationship between neighbors. Work on the relationship and the relationship will be enjoyable. FIND THE REASON WHY YOU BROKE UP If it seems to you that all of the above does not concern you, try to understand why the gap occurred. Who was to blame for the coldness of the relationship and what to do to bring it back. Example: I like attention, he likes to sit at the computer. As a result, no one gets what they want, gets angry, and, instead of reaching a compromise, disagree. The conclusions from this chapter are as follows, in order to regain and maintain a relationship, you need: Take care of yourself (both externally and morally) Engage in self-development Appreciating your partner and working on the relationship Don't be silent about insults Respect each other's interests Spend time together at least a couple of days a week WHAT TO WRITE TO YOUR EX TO GET HIM BACK If the breakup initiative came from you, you need to write first. Apologize, tell us why you came to this decision, that you miss and want to return everything. Give him time and do not press, remember that you must very delicately, but very authentically, talk about what problems led to the breakup. Don't appeal to his feelings. Do not blackmail, humiliate or humiliate, do not manipulate a man. Address not what he feels, but his personality, be polite and correct. No need to press and swear eternal love. Consider his character. So you will understand what to write to him and how to bring him to emotions: If a guy is sensitive, the best thing you can do is write to him “thank you” for all the emotions, for the days spent together, for making your life better: “thank you for what you did for me. I was really happy with you and grateful for every minute we were around. "" A calm and pragmatic young man will rate messages like, “You've done so much for me, but now I can't even fix the tap. Can you tell me the number of a good plumber? "" And when talking about relationships, write messages with analysis, why do you think your breakup happened and how to return your old feelings. He doesn't like being in one place - tell him that you are planning a vacation and you will be grateful if he advises you on which hotel to stay and which tour operator to use. Tell us that your best vacation was together and ask if he wants to repeat it? A bright personality will respond to the story of how he made you feel, how you loved your sex and that you will never forget him, standing in a towel after a shower and making coffee for you. WHAT IF HE HAS ANOTHER If he found a girlfriend right after your relationship, there can be two reasons: He tries to forget about your relationship, distract himself from memories. He left you for her and has no feelings for you. You need to figure out what not to do to get it back: Do not read in the clouds: ""he went to her, but he still loves me, even if he cheated on me with her"" Do not make up excuses: ""yes, he cheated on me, but this is only because I had a headache too often."" Do not hope for a relationship recovery If you are looking for how to return to the family a man who left for another, the answer is one: no way. Keep your pride, take care of yourself, create an atmosphere of warmth and love at home. Remember: most often men do not leave for beauty, but for emotions. HOW TO GET A GUY BACK IF I LEFT HIM MYSELF It's easy enough to bring back the guy you left yourself. Dress nicely, invite him to a cafe and tell him that you still have feelings for him. If your emotions are mutual, nothing will be difficult. The longer you have been together, the easier it will be to get everything back. He is offended. Yes, and he has the right to do so. After all, it was you who decided that it was time for your relationship to end. If you left him ugly, then he may try to take revenge on you. In addition, his attitude towards you after parting and the appearance of resentment may have changed, so do not forget about his right not to continue the relationship with you. Come back and only return people who have not been hurt by you and who have not hurt you. Better yet, open a new chapter in your life and enjoy freedom - love will find you on its own."
10,Perspective in the middle of chaos,social-issues," Nowadays, the world is faced with a pandemic case of chaos. People lose their jobs, healthcare coverage, savings go into bill payments, the administration of schools and colleges are uncertain if they should teach in person or purely online, racism is more apparent than ever and everyone is confused and fearful of the unknown future. Fear turns into frustration and social media turns people into “keyboard cowboys” with outbursts of anger and calling people out; in many ways the unveil of true passion and beliefs which would never be dared to be spoken directly into the face of the person. I get it. We can all relate to other peoples’ frustrations, losses and sadness. And while we have little control of certain federal and statewide rules and guidelines, we can certainly adjust our attitude towards them. Why? Well, we all believe in certain rights and wrongs, but that doesn’t necessarily mean our perceived side is the correct one. When we step outside of our own heads and truly listen to others, including taking in a full 360 view of the subject matter at hand, we become to realize (if we are truly honest with ourselves) that nobody can make Everyone completely satisfied and happy with a solution provided. We can only assume that the decisions made are in the best interest of the majority of the population; not the majority of our direct environment and small circle of people we are in contact with. In times like this, we often solely focus on the things we lose, fear to lose or have to give up. Of course, this is a very human reaction and also very egoistic. Instead of concentrating on the things we need to give up, what about zeroing in to the things we actually gain? For instance, how many times have you wished for more time with your immediate family, got annoyed by people in traffic, were frustrated because the subway or bus was late (again), got stuck in construction traffic, sadden by the time wasted commuting to work and back home, missing your favorite group workout at the gym due to being stuck late at work, not seeing your child take the first step but rather it be described to you by the daycare worker, not having time to try out the family pasta recipe, or wishing you could enjoy the outdoors more often? Instead of commuting, you can enjoy extra time in the morning and evening by yourself, with your partner or kids, use the time to build your own business or work on your passions and dreams or learn new skills online to spruce up your resume. You always complained about needing extra time to do “XYZ”? Now you have it. Personally, I am tremendously grateful to work for a company that allows me to do my job from home; which has worked out quite well besides the occasional slow internet connection (such a first world problem!). My children had to finish the 2019-20 school year at home with a somewhat mess-up virtual class schedule that was not always congruent with the communications sent out to parents and students. However, we all made it out alive to tell the stories. The summer was not at all what we normally would experience. Instead of a graduation party with friends and family, beach visits, tourist attractions and big city adventures, we spent our weekends hiking trails in our state we did not even know existed. We had more in depth conversations, got to truly assess our points of views and perspectives and therefore, got to know each other on entirely different levels. Let’s be real, they can hide in their rooms for only so long before they get bored and want to talk to another human being or have to address the “elephant in the room.” While I was able to work remotely (I know this is a privilege & I genuinely appreciate the frontline workers of all professions, as my son is one of them), I got to spend the ENTIRE summer with my kids! This has never happened before and even though it might have been disruptive or slightly annoying at times, I cannot even describe to you how grateful I am for this precious time.  Parents know, kids grow up too fast. It’s a proven fact; once they start school the years just keep flying by. Instead of complaining and focusing on the indecisiveness of colleges and public schools, how about being appreciative for having your kids around?  This coming school year is basically a cluster of uncertainties, but the good news is that we are all in the same boat. This means, we need to stop acting like our kids were singled out to be made an example of. Both of my kids will attend school virtually; one college freshman and one High School student. Will it be challenging? You better count on it. Will the current decisions made by schools change? Of course! It will require a new routine and workflow around the house, but will teach us compromise, flexibility in our approaches, assessments, re-assessments and dealing with any direct conflicts right on the spot. We will exercise real-life skill building activities and can only grow wiser from them to take on the outside world in the future. If you can handle your own family with all its quirks and weirdness, you can handle anything in the years ahead. You can look at the glass half-full, half-empty or you can keep reminding yourself that the glass is refillable. It is all up to you and the mindset you want to bring to the table. But remember one thing, “Complaining about a problem without proposing a solution is whining” (Teddy Roosevelt). We will all get through this, because chaos often provides an opportunity of growth, change and improvement. So, you can either drag your feet or jump in and participate to create a better future of human kind."
11,Future Earnings: The Key to Understanding The Capital Homesteading Act,social-issues," Passing the Capital Homesteading Act would require the Federal Reserve, through local banks, to loan $12,000 annually to every single American citizen (every man, woman, and child) at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST annually. These funds could ONLY be used to purchase wealth producing capital assets (such as stocks, bonds, machinery, land, buildings, and technology) that would PREDICTABLY PRODUCE FUTURE EARNINGS in the form of dividends. The loan would also be fully insured and designed to be paid back with pre-tax, FUTURE EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS and NOT from individual savings or placing a second mortgage on the family home. Once the loan is paid off (in 3 to 7 years) the DIVIDENDS CONTINUE to be paid out and they become passive, residual income that ELIMINATES POVERTY, stabilizes family life, creates tens of millions of new taxpayers, which in turn dilutes and lowers the tax rate for all those who still pay taxes, and in the long run it pays off the national debt. And all of this can be achieved without creating a dime of consumer or government debt. But IF YOU MISS THE CONCEPT OF FUTURE EARNINGS, you’ll miss the revolutionary potential of this ingenious idea whose time has not only come, but is actually long overdue. It essentially gives every American access to the ownership side of the American economy which is where almost all the new wealth is being generated. And by doing so it systematically democratizes the free market, counteracts concentrated wealth/greed, and it creates an American economy in which a political democracy (a government of, by, and for the people) is actually possible. Now let’s dig into the idea of Capital Homesteading in a little more detail. A Systematic Solution Based on Facts Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Trickle-Up, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 70 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
12,SALVATION BY RELIANCE ALONE,social-issues," SALVATION BY RELIANCE ALONE An Informal Book Review Helping to Clarify the Essence of the Gospel by Randy Rector Copyright 2018 by Randle Ray Rector of the United States of America. Omissions, additions, or changes to the text are prohibited, but the copyright holder grants to everyone in the world the freedom and encouragement to translate, copy and distribute this review as much as he or she may wish. A very strange informal book review is this that you are about to read. Strange because it is customary to give the title and the author as well as the publication information at the beginning of the review, and I don’t intend to do this. Those who have read the book will probably recognize it; those who have not will get its most crucial elements here. I admit that this is a very unscholarly approach, but I have a reason. The subject is the Good News of our Lord and Rescuer, Yeshua of Natzeret, the Messiah, and I am concerned for those who are unfamiliar with the issues involved. I don’t want them to look for the book and then become more confused than most people already are. Throughout the review I have provided references to the Bible. They are not exhaustive, but should be sufficient for you to check to see if I have spoken the truth. I’m discussing a book that has many good points, such as showing that the goal of the Gospel is to hail Yeshua as the ascended King of the universe, co-reigning with His Father from His Father’s heavenly throne. (I would include that at His Second Coming King Jesus will express this shared cosmic throne through additionally reigning in tandem on the earthly throne of David--Luke 1:32-33; Acts 15:16; Revelation 3:21.) In spite of the good points of the book, however, it seriously distorts the way the Gospel is received. By exhibiting how it does this, I have no desire to discredit any man or woman, only our wrong ideas; so I will simply refer to “the author.” On pages 92-93 under “Dimensions of Allegiance” the author states that “what follows in the rest of this section is particularly vital to the whole book.” It is, he says, “a deliberate alternative to classic definitions of ‘faith.’ ” He then discusses the analysis of faith developed by a colleague and best friend of Martin Luther, the Reformer Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560). In Greek, faith is “pistis,” and in Latin “fides.” Out of a general silence a few scholars, including the author, assume that Melanchthon made a threefold analysis of “pistis” or “fides” in one of the four main editions of his well-known compendium “Loci Communes Theologici [Commonplaces (that is, Common Topics) Theological]” of 1521, 1535, 1543, and 1559. I read the 1521 edition translated into English by Christian Preus (copyright 2014, ISBN 978-0-7586-4445-9), the edition that was mentioned in the author’s footnote and bibliography. Since Martin Luther himself enthusiastically endorsed this book, I highly recommend it to study early Lutheran views. In it Melanchthon excellently discussed faith, but I couldn’t find his threefold analysis. This has been said by others about the later editions, too. After searching, I ran across the place in Melanchthon’s “Enarratio epistolae prioris ad Timotheum [Commentary on the First Letter to Timothy],” 1550 to 1551, where Melanchthon gave Latin names to three simultaneous ingredients of faith. It can be found in the editor Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider’s “Corpus reformatorum,” Volume 15 (Halle, Germany: C.A. Schwetschke and Son, 1848), page column 1312 [available on Google Play]. Here is the exact quote with my own single quotation marks for emphasis: “Certissimum est fide in hac doctrina non tantum significari noticiam, quam et diaboli tenent, sed significari simul ‘noticiam’ historiae, et ‘assensionem,’ qua promissionem tibi applicas, et ‘fiduciam’ acquiescentem in mediatore et in Deo, iuxta promissionem...” Based on her knowledge of medieval Latin and this field of study, Dr. Mirela Avdagic of Serbia has graciously provided me with an English translation of this sentence as follows: “It is certain that in this doctrine faith does not only mean knowledge, as devils deem, but it also means knowledge of history, and ascension, as promised to you, and growing trust in God and Mediator, according to promise…” In classical Latin, Melanchthon’s second term “assensionem” indicated “approval, approbation, or applause.” A variant meaning arose in medieval times signifying “ascension.” Consequently, Melanchthon may have meant that faith comes from hearing the proclamation through the Gospel of the salvific historical events--the life, death, and immortal life of Jesus, which includes our ascension and session (that is, seating) in Christ Jesus at the right hand of God (Ephesians 2:4-7). Those saving events made certain a promise to us of future ascension (“going to heaven”). Both the history and the promise are activated and applied to an individual by a living confidence in the word of God, Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead as the Mediator between God and humanity (Romans 4:22-25; I Timothy 2:3-6). Other scholars see a classical Latin nuance in the Renaissance humanist Melanchthon’s analysis of faith. As described by the author, its three simultaneous ingredients are “(1) ‘notitia’--the content [of the Gospel] to be intellectually apprehended; (2) ‘assensus’--intellectual agreement that the content is true; and (3) ‘fiducia’—trust or a disposition of reliance (rooted in the will/affections as variously defined).” The author wants to replace these with (1) “ ‘intellectual agreement’ that the eight stages of the good news correspond to reality”; (2) “ ‘confession of loyalty’ to Jesus in recognition of his universal reign, and” (3) “an ‘embodied fidelity’ as a citizen of his realm [good works, also known as good deeds].” He rejects Melanchthon’s analysis because, he says, “it imposes faulty dimensions of ‘interiority’ (speculations about psychological states interior to the individual) on ‘pistis’ with respect to the ancient evidence.” The Assyrian Church of the East, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox churches, and the Roman Catholic Church have all canonized a book written by a Hellenistic Jew sometime between 220 B.C. and A.D. 50 called the book of “Wisdom,” also known as “The Wisdom of Solomon.” Protestants, Anabaptists, and Jews do not spiritually discern it to be God-breathed and authoritative in the same sense as the books of the Bible, but many of them do regard it as a good philosophical treatise to read for edification, like a sermon or a book of devotionals. It is also useful for research. As an example I shall quote Wisdom 14:5 from the usually now separately-published section called The Apocrypha in the Anglican Authorised Version (AV) of 1611, also known as the King James Version (KJV). Wisdom 14:5 reads, “Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.” The “small piece of wood” refers to a thin plank of an ancient ship whose hull was only four fingers thick. The Greek word here translated “commit” is “pisteuousin,” a “pistis” verb that is also used in the New Testament for “belief” in Jesus. The “men” who are sailors “believe” in the plank in the sense that they trust it and get on board the ship; and just as a sailor commits his life to a ship’s flimsiest plank, so a Christian commits himself or herself into the sure hands of Jesus. This kind of commitment is not “promising to be loyal”; it is “handing over for safekeeping.” It is trust combined with acting on that trust. The name for active trust is reliance. Relying results in rest. Because most scholars agree that the book of Wisdom was written by a Hellenistic Jew between 220 B.C.E. and 50 C.E., Wisdom 14:5 provides evidence for Melanchthon’s analysis of faith even more ancient or at least as ancient as what scholars have studied about “pistis” in the Roman Empire. “Pisteuousin” is also used in James 2:19 for the faith of the demons, but they only fearfully rely on God as their Judge, and not as “God our Savior.” For humans, God is both Judge and Savior. A certain scholar has said that the Gospel is best described as “The Story of How God Became King.” Our author says this is another reason he rejects Melanchthon’s analysis: by many Christians “the climax of the gospel has been misidentified within “notitia” as forgiveness rather than as acknowledgment of kingship that leads to forgiveness.” It is true that the climax of the Gospel is to confess that Jesus became the cosmic Lord of all that exists (Matthew 28:18; Romans 10:9). This is one of the author’s good points, and it is supported by the list of resurrection appearances in I Corinthians 15:1-11. That list reaches an objective climax described in The Acts of the Apostles when Jesus appeared from the heavens to the man who would become Apostle Paul. Paul’s subjective response was to confess Jesus’ kingship by calling Him cosmic “Lord,” and “Son of God.” Nevertheless, the grace of God involved is usually garbled in the minds of most people. We see this as the author goes on to put a works-oriented spin on the Gospel by saying that “fiducia” “does not foreground the lived reality of ‘embodied fidelity’ sufficiently.” On the contrary, reliance IS “embodied fidelity” and is also the source of works of “embodied fidelity.” This means that first of all, because Jesus is “both Lord and Christ [the Messiah, the Anointed One]” (Acts 2:36), humans acclaim Him King apart from works by relying on His wonderful love and the free gift of salvation which He alone has provided. The thief on the cross did this, so he said to Jesus, “Remember me, Lord, when You come into Your kingdom” (Luke 23:42). On the cross he could do no good works, nor could he be baptized by the disciples of Jesus, as in John 3:22-4:3. He simply rendered “obedience of faith” (the literal Greek of Romans 1:5, 16:26). “Belief” and obedience may be also parallel in John 3:36 as translated in the New American Standard Bible (NASB) of 1995: “He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” The Greek word rendered “does not obey” is “apeithohn,” which can also mean “does not believe.” Considering it only a possibility that “does not obey” is more exact, it is in opposite parallelism with “believes”; so it is not saying that good works of obedience are required to receive or maintain eternal life, or that they are an inevitable result and evidence of having received it. It is saying that reliance alone is ITSELF obedience. This is the true faithfulness and the true allegiance. I John 3:23 proclaims, “This is His (God the Father's) commandment: that we should rely on the name of His Son Jesus Christ [for eternal life], and [for discipleship, which is to] love one another as He (Jesus) gave us commandment [John 13: 34-35].” I call the author's analysis of faith “The Case of the Missing ‘Fiducia.’ ” I do this because his (1) “intellectual agreement” contains both “notitia” and “assensus,” but his (2) “confession of loyalty” and (3) “embodied fidelity” shift the saving focus away from Christ to ourselves. This resembles the self-confidence of the Israelites at the inauguration of the Law of Moses. From the days of Enosh son of Seth son of Adam, God had been worshiped as “Yahweh” (Genesis 4:26). In Hebrew “Yahweh” is third person singular, and means “HE IS.” Insight into this meaning is given in Revelation 1:8: “I am the A and the Z, the Beginning and the End,” says the Lord God, “Who Is and Who Was and Who Is To Come, the Almighty.” After the global Flood the human race forgot the Living God by paganizing His memory, and this came to a head at the Tower of the city of Bahbel. Its tower may have been what is called a “ziggurat,” which is thought to have been considered a man-made mountain whose top intersected the realm of the gods and the realm of humans. In addition, one scholar has said: “The ziggurat was a structure that was built to support the stairway (‘simmiltu’), which was believed to be used by the gods to travel from one realm to the other. It was solely for the convenience of the gods and was maintained in order to provide the deity with the amenities that would refresh him along the way (food, a place to lie and rest, etc.). The stairway led at the top to the gate of the gods, the entrance to the divine abode.” The meaning of the Semitic name “Bahbel” is given in Genesis 11:9 from the Hebrew word “balal,” “confuse,” “because there Yahweh confused the language of the whole Earth.” It was a center for confusion of religion which resulted in the confusion of languages. “From there Yahweh scattered them abroad over the whole face of the Earth.” The city was unfinished and abandoned, paving the way for other completed cities to be remembered in pagan civilization as the first city. (To read a very interesting article on this subject, visit the Answers in Genesis website and search for ""Where in the World is the Tower of Babel?"".) Bahbel was a turning point for the human race. It was the birth of what the Scriptures call “the World system.” There God was rejected, so He disinherited the nations. This is revealed in Deuteronomy 32:8-9 as translated in The Jerusalem Bible (JB) of 1966: “When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided the sons of men, he fixed their bounds according to the number of the sons of God [this is the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) reading, which the ancient Greek translation known as the Septuagint (LXX) paraphrased as the angels of God. It means the 70 fallen angels who took over the original 70 nations]; but Yahweh’s portion was his people, Jacob his share of inheritance.” “See, a people dwelling apart, not reckoned among the nations” (Numbers 23:9). God provided to raise up and Himself govern the nation of Israel, with the Angel of Yahweh (Yahweh Himself manifested on Earth) and also Michael an archangel standing guard over them (Exodus 14:19; Judges 2:1-5; Daniel 10:12-13, 21 with 12:1). This was in order that through Israel “the whole earth, from end to end, will remember and come back to Yahweh” (Psalm 22:27). Israel was to be “a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:5-6), a witness to His Name. That Name also has two short forms: “Yah” (as J = Y in “halleluJah [All of you praise Yah]”), and “Yahu” (as in “Benjamin NetanYahu [Yahu has given]”, English spelling Nethaniah). The pronunciation “Yaho” was used by the Jews of the Diaspora temple on Elephantine Island in the Nile River near Aswan, Egypt (which may have been a stopping place for the Ark of the Covenant on its way to Ethiopia. Visit the BASE Institute website to order the book or DVD or digital video download of “Search for the Ark of the Covenant” by Robert Cornuke.) Today the long form of God’s Name “Yahweh” is often mispronounced “Jehovah.” All three forms are obscured in the well-meaning but man-made Jewish tradition of guarding reverence for God’s Name by substituting “Adonai” [my Lord] when reading the Hebrew Scriptures aloud. That tradition is followed in most English translations by rendering “Yahweh” as “the LORD” or “GOD” with all capital letters, or a capital first letter with lowercase letters. Because Yahweh IS, this certainly includes the concept that He is Lord, but the meaning of His Name is broader than simply that. (All of these substitutions produce confusion because “The Lord” is used in the Scriptures as a separate title for God as well.) It was to this Greatest One (hallelu Yah) that the people of Israel “confessed their loyalty” at Mt. Horeb in the Sinai Desert of northwest Saudi Arabia (Exodus 3:1, 19:1-8, 24:1-8, 33:6; Galatians 4:25). It was there that “all the people answered together, and said, ‘All that Yahweh has spoken we will do!’ ” (Exodus 19:8, 24:3,7). Then over the centuries the Law of Moses exposed their lack of “embodied fidelity” and their need of a Savior (Matthew 1:21). This was a purpose of the Law (Romans 5:20; Galatians 3:24). At last the prophet John the Baptist revealed that a major function of “the Messiah, the Son of God” (John 1:34, 11:27, 20:31) was to be “the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Look to Him! To believe that “Jesus is the Christ [the Messiah, the Anointed One]” is to rely on Him apart from works as “the Savior of the world,” Who guarantees the free gift of unending and unforfeitable life in the present, with future bodily resurrection (John 4:42, 11:25-27). Both the Jewish verse John 1:29 and the Samaritan verse John 4:42 intend that you should substitute your own personal name where it says “the world.” The Gospel: As According to John was written to persuade people to rely on Jesus as the Christ in order to receive everlasting life (John 20:31), and to enter into an abundant experience of that life (John 10:10). The Synoptics (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) were written to edify those who continue as disciples. The Synoptics show us that during the earthly ministry of Jesus His commandments and teachings which were prior to the Cross included expositions of the Law designed to smash self-righteousness and prepare people for His coming great salvation. Those expositions serve the same function today, only pointing us back to the Cross and the indwelling holy Spirit. On pages 10-13 the author rejects this interpretation of Christ's subtle technique. For example, in the passage where the Rich Young Ruler asked what he must do to inherit eternal life (Matthew 19:16-26; Mark 10:17-27; Luke 18:18-27), the author says Jesus told him he was keeping the Ten Commandments and only needed to add selling everything, giving to the poor, and following Him. Rather, Jesus was showing him that he was breaking the Ten Commandments by having an idol in his heart (James 2:10). When this dawned on him, he could receive the salvation revealed in the Gospel. “A person is not declared righteous by doing works prescribed by law, but by relying on Jesus Christ” (Galatians 2:16). In the beginning was “the Logos,” the Word, the Wisdom of God, Who was with God and was Himself God (John 1:1; Isaiah 41:4; Revelation 1:8, 17-18, 2:8, 22:13). He created symbolic Lady Wisdom of the book of Proverbs to represent Him as His agent, a real inherent principle throughout the universe (Proverbs 3:16-19, 8:18-31). “In her right hand is length of days, and in her left hand are riches and honor.” Millennia later, the Wisdom of God Himself became Jesus. Jesus did not become God; Yahweh the Creator became Man the creature while yet remaining the Creator (John 1:14; Isaiah 44:6; Revelation 1:8, 17-18, 2:8, 22:13). In Jesus’ right hand is the free gift of everlasting life; in His left hand are riches and honor in the future manifestation of His Kingdom. On pages 108-109 the author mocks those who believe in a distinction between the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Great White Throne of the Last Judgment. The Judgment Seat of Christ occurs before the beginning of the Millennium, the 1000-year prelude to the New Heavens and the New Earth (Isaiah 65:17-25, especially verse 20; Revelation 20:1-6). This judgment is to evaluate only the works resulting in either loss or great rewards bringing riches and honor to joyfully serve Jesus the King of kings (Matthew 5:12; Romans 14:10-12; I Corinthians 2:2 with 3:10-15, 6:2-3, 9:24-27; II Corinthians 5:9-11; II Timothy 1:16-18; James 2:12-13, 3:1; Revelation 3:11, 20:4-5, 22:12-13). The Great White Throne after the Millennium is to reveal the eternal destiny of the lost (Revelation 20:11-15). In his argument against this distinction the author appeals to Romans 2:5-8. Like many translators, he doesn't recognize that there is an “inclusio” (a passage bracketed or bookended by related words and themes) beginning in Romans 1:18 and ending with a period or a question mark after Romans 2:5. The subject of the inclusio is the revelation through the Cross of God's present wrath against all sin. Romans 2:6-7 then does say that works will be brought up at the Final Judgment, but that passage is only describing the “operating principles” of God's way of judging. If at the Great White Throne anyone can be found who always without fail sought for “glory and honor and incorruptibility,” they will be given eternal life. But no one will be found. In John 5:24 Jesus says that those who hear His word and rely on God the Father as the One Who sent Him do not come into judgment, but already have crossed over out of death into eternal life; so they will not be judged at the Great White Throne. There the books will be opened and the works of the lost will be entered into evidence to prove that their works could not save them. Every mouth will be shut by each one being shown to have been guilty before God. Yet, because Jesus is the objective Propitiation (appeasing satisfaction-of-justice sacrifice) He has redeemed (paid for and set free) every one of us. He took away the past, present and future sins of every individual of all history of the entire world! (John 1:29; I Corinthians 1:30; II Corinthians 5:19; I John 2:2). Ezekiel chapters 2 and 3 tell us how God informed Ezekiel up front that even though He was sending him to prophesy to the Israelites, they would not listen; yet Ezekiel would not be a failure, for “they shall know that there has been a prophet among them” (Ezekiel 2:5). In the same way at the Last Judgment, the lost shall know that there has been a universal Redeemer among them. They will have tragically ignored Him, but He did not fail in His great work. His death on the cross insured that the lost will not perish because of the guilt of their sins. Instead, the Book of Life will be opened, which contains the names of all those who, through faith, have been born again from above with the resurrection life of Jesus (John 3:3,7; II Corinthians 5:20; I Peter 1:3). By God’s foreknowledge their names were written in the Book of Life from the founding of the world (Revelation 13:8 word-ordered with Revelation 17:8). Those who have remained in a condition of being spiritually dead will reap the specific thing they have sown. They will not perish because of the guilt of their sins, but sin killed them by cutting them off from God’s kind of life, and they neglected to receive that life from the One Who freely gives it (Ephesians 4:18; Revelation 22:17). Consequently, they cannot dwell with God among the living. There is only one place to go; they will share the fate of the Devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41). Whoever will not be found written in the Book of Life will burn forever in the ultimate horror, the Second Death, the Lake of Fire (Matthew 25:46; Revelation 14:11, 20:14-15). Only the blood of the Messiah is sufficient for the kind of justification (status of righteousness pronounced by God) which leads to life (Romans 4:2, 5:8-9, 5:18). This first kind of justification is by faith alone. In I Corinthians 1:30 it is bodily crucified, bodily resurrected and bodily exalted Christ Jesus Who gave Himself to us as our only righteousness. As a result, He also gave Himself to us as eternal life (Colossians 3:4; I John 1:1-2, 5:20). Therefore, it is only faith that lays hold of the Christ. Simple faith has Christ Himself within it, so that He is our righteousness and faith is credited to us as righteousness (Romans 4:22-25). The author's book is one more effort to make justification before God the result of faith PLUS good works. This is “Galatianism”—“another gospel” and “accursed”! So says the Lord through Paul, Galatians 1:6-9. James 2:14-26 uses the ancient philosophy-classroom format called the diatribe (James speaks, verses 14-17; an Objector objects, verses 18-19; James replies, verses 20-26). Teaching Yahweh’s inbreathing of Wisdom in the manner of a practical moralist philosopher similar to the Stoic Epictetus, James says that even though his students have been born again from above (James 1:17-18), faith without works is “dead” in the sense that by itself it cannot “save” them from losing the experience of their daily lives for God. An imaginary student objects: “The day you can show me faith “without” works will be the day I can show you faith “from” works. Both are equally impossible, since there is no real connection between faith and works. Why, even the demons rely on God as their Judge, but they only do evil works!” James’ response is traditional diatribe rhetorical hardball: “You empty man! I will show you that the good works of Abraham did not take away his sins before God, but on a specific occasion they co-operated with his faith. Students, all of you see then that this is the second kind of justification, the kind by works [James 2:24]. It means that by faith expressed in good works not only the honored patriarch Abraham but even the Canaanite prostitute Rahab was justified (that is, declared righteous) in front of PEOPLE.” In the same way good works are essential for discipleship, the Christian lifestyle, as Jesus said: “Let your light so shine before others that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father, the One Who is in the heavens” (Matthew 5:16). Throughout my life I’ve felt hidden heartbreak that my light is often obscured by my dark side. If you have felt or now feel the same way, please allow me to recommend a little book that’s been a big help: “Six Secrets of the Christian Life,” by Zane C. Hodges. It’s published by the Grace Evangelical Society (GES), P.O. Box 1308, Denton, Texas 76202 USA. Their phone number is 1-940-270-8827. You can also order “Six Secrets of the Christian Life” on their website, or from other sellers online, where you may get either the first or the second edition. The content is the same, but the second edition has study questions. It’s copyrighted 2016, ISBN 978-1943399130. I’ve found it best to read it repeatedly, so I can meditate on its secrets and anchor them in my consciousness. We become disciples by continuing in Jesus’ word (John 8:31-32). Our baptismal washing in water is a public sign and seal that our physical bodies belong to Jesus (Hebrews 10:22; Romans 4:11). Apostle Peter says faith expressed in baptism “saves” us “from this twisted generation” (Acts 2:40), since baptism is an “answer” (a pledge of allegiance) of a discipleship “conscience toward God” (I Peter 3:21). We are then strengthened by the communion of the Bread and the Cup (I Corinthians 10:16), and are known as disciples by love received from the holy Spirit (John 13:35; Galatians 5:6, 22-23). In each of these things--by faith--something genuinely supernatural happens to increase our bodily experience of union with Christ. Still, that unbreakable union itself is turned on in the first moment of receiving everlasting-for-me, endless and nonforfeitable life by God’s unearned love and kindness through ONE ACT OF HANDING MYSELF OVER--to God’s promise of eternal life in Christ Jesus ALONE."
13,A Systematic Solution to Structural Racism in America!,social-issues," According to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, the solution to institutional racism is primarily about economic empowerment. “It’s really about economic empowerment because if people are lifted out of poverty, and they are given an opportunity to feel a stake in their own future, that goes a long way,” she said. “We are also challenging all kinds of institutions from corporations to community-based organizations to think about what they can do better to end systematic racism and make sure that we are uplift quality of life in communities, but also the voices of people that traditionally don’t have a seat at the table.” A Systematic Solution Based on Facts In that light, consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But generally speaking, the beneficiaries of this annual growth are currently limited to those people who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the opportunity to participate.  Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government has increased unemployment benefits for several months, and issued so called “stimulus checks ($1,200)” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course is to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse than they were several months ago before the virus. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Debt! Now let’s recall that on average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4 trillion dollars annually. Once again, that translates into about $12,000 annually for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this annual growth are those who can afford to buy stocks, bonds real estate, and new technology. This generally excludes we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where MOST OF THE WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks •	issued $12,000 of FULLY INSURED CAPITAL CREDIT LOANS •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or economic status) annually •	at 0% interest, and… •	allowed the loan to be repaid via FUTURE, PRE TAX EARNINGS/DIVIDENDS – NOT FROM PERSONALSAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could only be used to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for their purchase and to create predictable, stabilizing, residual incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Capital Homesteading,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. It creates NO GEVERNMENT DEBT! It creates NO CONSUMER DEBT! And, rather than government debt-backed currency, the purchase would be backed (collateralized) by real, productive, private-sector assets And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY. All money created would be instantly backed (collateralized) by the full value of private sector assets that citizens would receive insured loans in order to purchase. Citizens would actually be purchasing newly issued, full dividend payout, voting shares of companies that need new capital assets in order to grow. What Capital Homesteading Will Do However Is… •	Give every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where most of our nations’ wealth is being generated. •	Create a residual stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it will help to democratize the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And pay off our massive and ever-growing national debt, etc. One Simple Example Here’s one simple example of how Capital Homesteading would benefit the next generation of Americans. If implemented, by age10 every child would have had $120,000 (10 times $12,000) invested on their behalf and paying dividends. By age 18 well over $200,000 would have been invested and be generating dividends that would easily pay for a debt-free college education along with all the benefits that would follow in its wake. Absolutely a win/win for everyone! In this moment of political division and strife Capital Homesteading literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more residual income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. social security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. More people will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who still pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Yet This Free Market, Non-Socialistic Solution is Being Totally Ignored!!! If the Obama administration (or any of its predecessors) had implemented Capital Homesteading, today’s COVOD 19/Unemployment crisis would not be a crisis. We the people could afford stay at home and still have sufficient income to weather a much less severe storm. Yet we’re less than 80 days from the next Presidential election and Capital Homesteading has been totally ignored by Trump, Biden, Harris, Sanders, Warren, Booker, Klobuchar, Mayor Pete, etc. WHY? Capital Homesteading In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
14,"A Systematic Antidote to ""Greed"" in American Culture!",social-issues," Greed, the psychological (self-centered, narcissistic, and alienating) need to accumulate more and more material wealth at the expense of others, is itself a product of, and is DRIVEN BY INSECURITY and FEAR. Shylock in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, Scrooge in Dicken’s Christmas Carl, and Mr. Potter in This American Life are all self-centered, narcissistic, alienated icons representing the issue of greed in the annals of literature. Today’s poster boy for greed is currently occupying the White House. As Mary Trump’s new book, “Too Much and Never Enough” so clearly documents, Donald Trump has spent his entire life running on a treadmill in order to live up to his father’s expectations. But regardless of what he’s done, it’s never been enough. The emotional disease known as greed can never be satisfied! His insecurities and fears drive Trump (along with his billionaire pals) to accumulate more and more wealth despite millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, their health insurance, and any sense of economic security and family stability due to the COVID 19 virus. We Celebrate Greed in America But American culture in 2020 tends to celebrate greed. We now call it SUCCESS. People like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mike Bloomberg, and Mark Cuban (GW Bush, Mitt Romney, and Trump all inherited their fortunes) are considered celebrities primarily because of their ability to accumulate boatloads of material wealth. In the meantime, over half of all Americans are living on the brink of poverty – if not homeless and starving in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. Shame on America! Granted, most of these so-called American success stories donate millions of dollars to charity. It’s good PR. And their fellow citizens conventionally applaud such “generosity.” On the other hand, each and every one of these “icons” supports an economic system that PREDICTABLY PRODUCES BOATLOADS OF POVERTY each and every day of the year. The question that I want to pose here is, what can we do to systematically minimize (if not eliminate) poverty, economic instability, insecurity, fear, anxiety, as well as toxic greed that too often results from it? In other words, how can we systematically democratize America’s free-market economy? $4 Trillion Dollars VS $12 Thousand Dollars Consider the following FACTS. On average, the American economy grows at the rate of $4,000,000,000,000 (yes that’s 4 trillion dollars) annually. That translates into about $12,000 for every man, woman, and child in America.

So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the CAPITAL HOMESTEADING ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Capital Homesteading Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although the suggested annual amount of money issued ($12,000 annually) is the same as Capital Homesteading, that’s where the similarity ends. Check out the differences. Since it issues insured capital credit loans that are paid back via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Capital Homesteading creates NO GOVERNMENT DEBT and NO COMSUMER DEBT! UBI and stimulus checks create government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Capital Homesteading systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated through capital ownership. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically enables citizens to become economically independent of the government. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Capital Homesteading systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Capital Homesteading requires some time (usually a number of years) in order for benefits to accumulate. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Capital Homesteading."
15,Why China is Considered A Fashionably Advanced Country?,social-issues," China is one of the world's most developed countries. It is so advanced that most of the electronic equipment is supplied by china. China is also considered as a fashionably advanced country as well. Today we are going to share some important details about China's fashion sense. This article will provide for fashion Online Course Help. Different Types Of Street Fashion From the walkway to road design, China's style sense has developed and changed significantly in the most recent decade. From the present Mao time on current-day China, there have been numerous impacts on Chinese design. We will concentrate on the Chinese road style since it is pervasive in ordinary Chinese life. One significant impact on the improvement of the Chinese road style is the ascent of the working class. As indicated by China's National Bureau of Statistics, the yearly per capita discretionary cash flow of individuals in the urban areas rose by 7.2% somewhere in the range of 1978 and 2007. In 2008, the sun rose and ended up being in excess of 15,700 Yuan, which is around $2,300 U.S. dollars. This implies the more youthful age in contrast with their folks' age has more cash presently to spend on design. With more than 220 million young people between the ages 15-24, they are the fundamental focal point of Chinese road design. Additionally, this empowered the ""quick style"" showcase in China. Universal brands presently sell progressively reasonable adaptations of garments by prevalence and brand name architects. Include quick style in addition to the accessibility of extra cash and the result is the ascent of high school ""fashionistas."" More now than any other time in recent memory, Chinese young people need to be progressively individualized, stick out, and have their own style sense as opposed to mixing in with the group. This has offered to ascend to two of numerous sorts of Chinese road style today. Presently it is utilized to depict style, films, photography, and items. This kind of design includes light hues, canvas shoes, alongside cotton and cloth material, and pictures with vintage impacts. ""Xiao Qinxin"" style speaks to a new and heavenly kind of design in contrast with ""Zhong Kouwei."" Zhong Kouwei means ""substantial flavor"" and was first used to portray food with overwhelming flavors, for example, salt, garlic, pepper, curry, and so forth. This formed the design presently portrayed in books, manga, and motion pictures. ""Zhong Kouwei"" likewise speaks to whatever animates the faculties periodically with savagery, sexuality, or blood. This kind of design highlights dim intense hues, bolts, metal, high contrast, and furious postures Hairstyles The more youthful age are the individuals who change their hairdo more as often as possible than the more established age. The reason being is on the grounds that the more youthful age is presented to progressively western impacts from the capacity to get to the web and increase various bits of knowledge of the world. For example, Asian ladies are twisting their hair all the more as often as possible like western ladies in light of the fact that there is an alternate change in their looks from the customary straight hair. Contrasted with the customary dark straight hair that the greater part of the more established age has, youngsters are starting the precedents nowadays with various haircuts. Hairstyles For Women There is a plenitude of various haircuts for ladies in China. The absolute most famous hairdos would miss the mark (above the ear) medium (mid-length) and long which falls past the shoulders. For short hair, this is advantageous for ladies with slim and short hair. The typically trim their hair into ""bob cuts"" which have bunches of layers, and spikes. This kind of haircut gives volume to the crown and looks great with ladies who have oval and round appearances. Ladies with the short hairstyle which lengthens their face and gives a ""modest"" look and underscores their ""heavenly"" highlights Medium length hair and long hair are presumably the most well-known among youthful Chinese grown-ups. Medium length hair is thick on the crown with layers hanging towards the shoulders. This gives the chaotic look and the last details make the face look more youthful and more slender. Long hair is the least complex haircut the young ladies have. Very little goes into styling long hair in light of the fact that the vast majority of Chinese ladies have straight dark hair that needn't bother with much consideration and can be handily worn to class or work. Above are instances of ladies with medium length hair and beneath are ladies with long straight dark or earthy colored hair Haircuts For Men Men contrasted with Chinese ladies are less difficult and have restricted measures of various hairdos. Most men have short customary hair which can be thumped up a score to be considered ""cool"" and socially worthy. Working proficient men don't switch their haircuts frequently and as a rule, keep it straightforward. More youthful men have various sorts of hairdos which can extend from long and puzzling to short and spiky. An alternate rendition of the short hair is a bit of the false bird of prey which is an increasingly western adaptation. Asian men have taken a contort and made it edgier with chaotic spikes everywhere throughout the head with a strip down the inside or inclining in various ways one after another. Chinese men additionally have mid-length hair which is long and finished to extend a picture of somebody who is humble yet deals with his looks. This follows the lines of the ""preppy look"" and an alternate take of the preppy look is the razor-ed form which is an ""insubordinate"" look. This can be transformed into a razor-ed mullet that shows the man can be extremely confident and rebellious of power. Beauty In The Chinese Industry It is an idiom ""excellence comes in all shapes and sizes,"" yet as indicated by the Chinese, magnificence is characterized as pale white skin alongside an articulated nose and a delicate round facial structure. What is well known in the Chinese excellence industry are skin helping creams and BB creams or Blemish/Beblish Balms which are another type of establishment and sunscreen. Helping creams help the skin and BB creams give assurance to the skin and offer inclusion to give an even skin tone. These two kinds of skin cosmetics sound good to the Chinese since the perfect magnificence is viewed as pale without any imprints or imperfections. In antiquated occasions, a reasonable and light appearance said that you were rich and didn't have to work in the fields underneath the sun and that you could stand to live inside and not accomplish work to stamp or ruin your skin. Another large pattern in cosmetics today in China is eye cosmetics. One of the most concerning issues among Chinese ladies monolids. Monolids are where the eyelid has a solitary eyelid rather than a twofold eyelid. This happens when the eyelid overlaps in on itself rather than a little wrinkle to make the twofold eyelid. This is an issue among Chinese and numerous Asian ladies since it conceals the eye cosmetics that are applied. This condition can be remedied by twofold eyelid medical procedure which is the second most mentioned restorative method in China or with eyelid tape which is a noninvasive strategy that can address lopsided eyelids. This is some info about china’s fashion sense. After reading you might want to go on shopping to get to china fashion trends but it will take a lot of time.

16,IT'S OKAY TO BE SINGLE,social-issues," Surprise! Yes, it is! A common issue I come across from individuals transitioning from ONE relationship to ANOTHER, is that they completely SKIP the most important part! HEALING and SELF-PROGRESSION For starters, HEALING is essential to regaining emotional balance in your life. If you don’t PAUSE, CHILL OUT, and let time do its magic, then you will only transfer that suppressed PAIN to a new person. This is NOT fair to them, NOR YOU. MOST IMPORTANTLY, during this time it is VITAL that you work on your FLAWS, and your current process of seeking partners. Yes… we ALL have flaws. Yes… we ALL need a tune-up from time to time. Yes… you also FAILED in this relationship. Here’s why you’re equally responsible for the relationship’s failure; The selection process for how you seek NEW partners is clearly in need of some work. Which RED FLAGS are you pretending do not exist? What compromises did you make that ended up backfiring? Were there children involved? Did they have uncontrollable baggage from previous relationships/marriages? ANALYZE which areas fell apart, and WHAT lead up to the damage. Aside from your selection process, you undoubtedly have your OWN flaws in relationships. As I said, we ALL DO. But what are yours? How did it affect your previous relationship? What about your relationship before that? Is there a COMMON theme from each person you have split ways with? It’s quite possible that there are some underlying TRUTHS in there somewhere. Again… ANALYZE. Ask others what they think should be changed in regard to HOW YOU DATE. Lastly, begin to WORK on these things. You can only accomplish GROWTH in these areas while you are SINGLE. Otherwise, you’re guaranteed to transfer those issues to the NEXT relationship, and the next, and the next, and the next… INDEPENDENCE!!!!!! Yes, there are different types of people in the world, OF COURSE! Some are very self-reliant, while others DEPEND on leaning on their second half. There isn’t one type of person that is better than the other, HOWEVER, it’s imperative that you master your own INDEPENDENCE. When you’re capable of relying on your OWN emotions, and your OWN thought patterns, the hidden power of “breaking up” will affect you a lot less. How many men and women are UNHAPPY and EMOTIONALLY DRAINED due to their inability to be ALONE? How many men and women RISK long-term damage because they choose not to deal with short-term pain? It’s extremely DAMAGING, especially the longer that you are TRAPPED. At this point, the phrase “take a break” should have crossed your mind. Let’s pull that APART. I’m not a big believer in “taking breaks”. If you’re emotionally SPLIT enough to “take a break”, then it’s going to take a BIT longer to repair than you’re initially imaging. Furthermore, taking a break is only HALF of a decision. The decision, of course, is whether to call it quits or NOT. You’re using that cop-out to hit a PAUSE BUTTON on life. Well… there is no such thing as a “PAUSE BUTTON”. You’re either moving forward, or you’re moving backward. There is no in-between. …. and let’s get REAL here. Most people only present the option of “taking a break” to RAISE emotions from their partner. It’s a TEST, almost. “Let me see how much they REALLY care”. It’s unhealthy, and this attitude may be one of your biggest flaws. LET’S CHANGE THE SUBJECT FOR A SECOND…. Speaking of being “single”, there is a BIG misconception in the world that devoting your LIFE to another human being is a MUST, and is just another part of life. Well… that may be true for SOME people, but surely not ALL. Some individuals absolutely LOVE being alone. It’s where they’re MOST happy. It’s where they’re MOST productive. However, society is constantly jamming a specific ideology down our throat. They’re not ASKING you how you would like to live, they’re TELLING you. Do this>Do this>Do that>This is normal>This is not>ETC. NONSENSE. It’s quite alright to be DIFFERENT. It’s quite alright to be SINGLE. It’s quite alright to only DEVOTE yourSELF to yourSELF. So ASK, “what do I really want”? So ASK, “what makes me the happiest”? We can start to unravel the TRUE YOU by asking VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS. Start today. Start now.

17,The Commodification of the Idea of Love,social-issues," The nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate, but if I want to describe it abstractly, I would like to say that love is a less-sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, which has a quintessential function to keep both human and non human beings together against odds and facilitates the continuation of the species. Aristotle says, “Let 'loving' (to philein) be wishing for someone that he deems good, for the sake of that person and not oneself, and the accomplishment of these things to the best of one’s ability” According to Aristotle, love is a compassionate feeling that one has for the other without any self interest. And it's true that if we assemble all the different views on love, we will find views agreeing with this selfless nature of love. Ancient Greek philosophers identified five forms of love: familial love, friendly love or platonic love, romantic love, guest love and divine love; but nowadays most of these spheres of love have become commercial. Today’s love is a commodity, something that is sold, exchanged, bought, consumed in self interest, need, ego. Love has become a commodity to which men and women accept and allow their selves to accommodate to this selfishness, just like we have accepted the money system for the accommodation of humanity to survival in complete disrespect and disregards for life, we, consciously or unconsciously, are buying and selling love for our self interest. As Philip James Bailey said, “the sweetest joy, the wildest woe is love.” ; this love has become more 'wildest woe' and less 'sweetest joy'. The commercialization of love is interminably dematerializing the commercial and economical stimuli of our daily life. On discussing the commodification of the idea of love, I would like to compare it with Habermas' theory which is helpful to understand the discussion of the relationship between the market and love. From the model of a two-tiered society postulated by Habermas, comprising the sphere of the systems and the life-world, Frankfurt School found that when romantic stimuli made with commercial purposes enter the daily life of lovers, it causes an undesired colonization of the life-world, thus reaffirming the irrevocable contradiction between the economy and love, and that is the issue we are facing in our everyday modern life and we are also accepting this commodification. The theme of commercialization, or commodification of love, is well analysed in Consuming the Romantic Utopia of Eva Illouz, the professor of sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she described how capitalism has transformed emotional patterns and how romantic love has changed to the newly expanding mass markets of leisure. This change has led to the creation of a new process called romanticization of commodities, that is a process in which commodities play a crucial role in experiencing emotions, such as love or romance, and these commodities of any kind, such as jewelry, household appliances, and other expensive gifts are advertised in newspapers, magazines and also in movies as essential things that will enable people to fully experience romance; in this way love has become such a advantageous commodity for some specific group of people in our society. Throughout the book, Illouz also deals with another process: the commodification of love. She states that the practice of 'dating' replaced the practice of 'calling on a woman' and going to her parents' house and it has moved romantic encounters from the home sphere to the sphere of consumption, that is going out on a date, for example, to the cinema or to have dinner in a fancy restaurant, the fact which again proves that how love has become a thing to be sold and consumed. The American writer, Hochschild, in her essay “Love and Gold”, explains that the world is facing a particular global trend: care and love importation from poor countries to rich countries is increasing rapidly. It is seen that the upper class families invite nannies to displace their love towards their own children. The love that nannies express, once migrated, towards children, is partially produced in the richer countries, and it is mostly the outcome of money, ideology, loneliness and yearning for their sons and daughters. The suffering of these women is not visible to the nannies' employers; they just focus on the love that nannies show towards their children. Therefore, nanny's love becomes a 'thing' itself. By isolating the concept of care from the context in which is produced, we unconsciously separate the logic of nanny’s love from the economic and capitalist context in which is created. The predominance of monetary issues and selfishness in love has become the driving force even in our familial and societal life. Sometimes we find truth too bitter to accept, but we cannot deny the existence of such reality. It can be sometimes observed that even parental love is divided due to self interest, and Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis is the best example of it. In the novella, we can see that when Gregor Samsa, an active healthy man, transformed into a 'monstrous vermin', and found himself incapable of providing financial assistance to his family, his family began to neglect him and torture him and make himself confined in a store room. Finally, he ended up dying of starvation before sunrise, but he did not embrace his death before realising the truth that his financial inability has made him unwanted for his family. He was wanted as long as he could support his family. So, love is sold as a commodity in everywhere and we have made ourselves accustomed to such sickening idea of love. While going through this commodification of love, many lives on earth knowingly or unknowingly are lost due to profit and abuse. In contemporary societies, where economy dominates all the spheres of our lives, love is also judged on the scale of economic solvency and thus the lack of this created parameter often creates collisions between husband and wife, children and parents, individual and society, thus love is sold. If love is an eternal passion beyond any interest or profit, why is it necessary to buy expensive gifts for our beloved ones to make him/her happy, why is it necessary to be economically well established to be loved in a family, and why it is necessary to be a rich citizen to get the attention and love of a society? Recently I have come across a short poem named “Love is a Commodity” which I want to share, as this poem is so relatable to this topic and gives some ideas to comprehend how love is sold as a commodity and how the commodification of the idea of love has poured it’s hefty doze in our everyday life: ""Love is a commodity displayed on shelves and racks of grocery stores, purchased on cash registers with pennies coated with tears and bills made of souls."" -Liz Palana"
18,Logical argument about existence,social-issues," Question is part of human life. And from those questions some of them stand tall. The question of origin is one of the greatest questions in human life. This question have been a challenging experience in many lives. Dependence is one of human character. We cannot have it all at once or even throughout our life span. We are only capable of doing, knowing or experiencing particular things but not all. There is nobody who can say I have got it all. Because of this to fill the blank spots we have, human live in social pattern to survive the storm of life. We share the strengths of others to work out the puzzle of life. Questions about the origin of life or everything have been a difficult one to answer in a clear manner in any corner of assumptions. We got to admit that it is a difficult task to uncover. But it is doable. If we knew the question, then the other side of the story must exist. Other ways the question will never be raised or we would never know about such question. Earth is filled with many professionals in different fields of study. Doctors, engineers, philosophers, teachers, chemists, bishops, physicist, theorists… These professionals in one way or another help us in our needs based on their expertise. The question about the origin of everything is a lot rough though. Because this experts have not provided any information that all of us can take. This has created a big frustration and even divisions in man. But we are still asking questions and we are still looking for answers. The only option we have is to get it over with. So let’s start the journey with me. In my point of view in order to know the origin of everything, we first have to know what exists. We first have to identify the existing before talking about their origin. Then we can talk about origin. I hope we all agree that the universe constitutes three entities. The first one is time and then space and at last matter. The matter includes everything that we consider as everything other than space and time. This refers to atoms, particles, micro organisms, molecules, livings and the non livings, stars, galaxies planets and the things that exist because of the existence of these things like waves and light or even darkness. These are the things that exist in the universe we live in. There may be some confusion in the above about time and space. To explain why they are considered something, first we have to talk about existence. As a human we have special ways to define the existence of things. These ways are mostly based of the five senses we have. If something is visible, we cannot argue about its existence. The same case is valid for the rest of senses. This on the other hand implies that the way we define the existence of things is based on the effect they show us. If we take time for instance we can clearly see the effect it had on us in all of our moves. We can do nothing without it. Each of our actions are coded into it. To move we need time. To see we need time. To sleep we need time. To eat we need time etc… time is big part of human experience yet most of us do not know that. Time is not just something we tie on our hand or something we put on our night stand. It gives life chemistry. We can only have meaning or purposeful life in the function of time. Time uphold our chemistry in nature. This is more than we need to acknowledge the existence of time. Space is a battle ground, the battle arena, the football field, the theater stage where all the drama of life are filmed. Everything needs space. Everything comes with a location. Existence gives a full meaning when it is tied with location. Whether the entity is visible or not, everything has a location. This indicates and shows the undisputed influence of space of the whole universe. The universe we live in is a product of three things. Space, time and matter. The unique bond between these entities creates a gigantic system that we live in. The most beautiful and carefully detailed place we call home is formed by the perfect integration of the three teams of the universe. The quest we began to uncover about the origin of the universe continues…"
19,Child Protection Matters in Emergency,social-issues," The emergency is all about saving a life. children are not in the face of COVID 19 pandemic but being protected is the fundamental right of every child because they are susceptible and suffer excessively during a crisis. Whether it is a disaster, pandemic, or armed conflict all are emergencies, therefore, jeopardize them from physical, psychological, social, and cognitive protection. Hence, the protection of children is the prime obligation of duty bearers to safeguard right holders from all kinds of conceivable harm along with ensuring access to quality health service delivery to be safe from health hazards. The duty-bearers stand here for (state along with non-state responsibilities holders (parents, guardians, and caregivers, child protection actors) likewise, Right holders here means to those who are under the age of 18 and harm signifies to all forms of violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect. In response, the Nepal government has ratified and endorsed many international policy instruments in line to recognize, promote, and protect the rights of children and mainstream into development plans and policies. Among the international policy instruments, the Convention on the Right of Child 1989, Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 1979, International Conference on Population and Development 1994, World Conference on Women (Beijing Plate form for Action 1995), ILO Worst Forms of Labor Convention 1999 are in the front line as a national commitment to fundamental rights of the children and adolescents globally. In addition, the National plan of action for children, National Strategy for Ending Child Marriage 2072, Children Act 2075, Civil Code 2074, Criminal Code 2074, local Governance Act 2074 is in function with a special provision for protecting child rights. Besides these, almost all ministries are implementing child rights initiatives at the national, provincial, and local levels. Also, the provincial government is drafting their child rights act for the respective province and many local level governments with support from development organizations have endorsed or planning to endorse child protection and education policy, local child marriage ending strategy, complaint response mechanism in schools are in place. Regardless of these tremendous interventions at various level apparently, the gap continues between duty bearers, state, and non-state actors. All duty bearers, state and non-state actors including responsibility holders are accountable in feeble inter and intra- agency coordination, collaboration. Further, effective implementation of the law, existing policies, and adequate emergency preparedness, response, and recovery plan continue to fall back at all levels. Without urgent action, a health emergency is turning to the child's right crisis constantly. Moreover, transforming schools into quarantine facilities has directly impacted children's education. An entire generation of children observed education interrupted as the nationwide school has been disrupted. These circumstances could have a severe impact on school-age children even after resuming of school, since current quarantine facilities have not met standards set by WHO which can jeopardize children health as without any preparation government is planning to open school, children can be more vulnerable Especially female children of a vulnerable community are prone to child marriage in lockdown. however, the boy child is also prone to child marriage as they are viewed as a source of income prevailing illegitimate dowry practices. The data of boy child falling into child marriage are either under-reported, not recorded, or might be very relatively low.But, the practices are still widely common in many parts of the Terai community In between a new trend within adolescents falling in infatuation and flew away together is getting common constantly across the country. These situations are also outcomes of domestic disputes, of parents along with their poor economic background surrounded by a community with patriarchal ideals. The further inability of parents due to their own circumstances falling to understand their children, taking children as commodities (girl as burden and boy as a source of income). They do not realize psychological, emotional, and cognitive changes in children and treat them as adults. Some parent even views as a transgression of children and the only solution is to married to lessen the burden from the family. Meanwhile, getting into infatuation and engaged in the illegitimate relationships are often manifestations of failing parents to make understand the importance of relationship, lack of sex education. This can endanger girl child and stem in early pregnancy being exposed to early mortality because of the interruption of sexual and reproductive services as resources concentrate on the public health emergency and even become prey of physical, psychological abuse and sexually exploited within the family and after marriage by their husband if got wedded. Several research reports have shown that boy who got married at an early age is likely to be more violent and transform oneself into the perpetrator of domestic and gender-based violence. Also, the majority of children and adolescents who have access to digital media and phones are prone to pornographic videos i.e. easily available in social media. Thus, children are at heightened risk of violence, exploitation, neglect, and abuse both in the domestic and public sphere because schools are closed, helplines and social services are interrupted and movement is restricted. In this context, it is essential to develop and provide child-friendly services that address emotional unrest and anxieties due to school closures. likewise, IEC materials containing helpline information with social messages should be spread on social media and distributed in the community through the child right committee, the judicial committee, and other stakeholders extensively. Likewise planning of orientation and dissemination of parental technique in the local language, organizing learning sharing activities through, radio, television, social media should be continued. Radio talk program and public announcement on health and hygiene, protection from sexual abuse and exploitation, how to keep children safe online including sexual and reproductive health awareness related activities need to be held regularly. These activities will help to keep children and adolescents safe to a great extent. Many economists, sociologists globally already started assuming pandemic is expected to increase economic recession worldwide which likely to have a large impact on poverty levels in low-income countries where child marriage is most prevalent. Because poverty is the key driver of child marriage and education. As UNICEF states the ongoing crisis could increase the number of children living in the monetary households by up to 17 million by the end of 2020 worldwide. (UNICEF, July 2020). It is obvious that child marriage is likely to increase in vulnerable communities of Nepal since Nepal is still considered in low-income countries and child marriage is rampant in the Terai region and some rural districts of Nepal. Moreover, child marriage is regarded as the root cause of gender equality guided by patriarchal ideals of society. Since gender equality strongly envisages a more equitable world it cannot be achieved until child marriage persists. These adverse impacts of not achieving set target reach beyond Goal 5. Unless we make significant progress on ending child marriage, Nepal will fall short on eight of the SDGs including those related to poverty, food security, health, education, gender equality, economic growth, and peace and justice (Girls Not Brides,2019) As documented by INSEC leading human rights NGO in Nepal Total of 156 cases of child right violation was documented. Out of 156 cases of child rights violation, 105 were Rape, 46 Sexual abuse, and 5 child marriage. The data is recorded from 24 March to 16 May on 20 May 2020. Due to lockdown, there might so many such cases that could not be reported (INSEC May 2020). These children shown in data remain as hidden fighters continuing to be prone to further psychological and emotional disorders due to the inhumane act of perpetrators. However, the gravity of the offense committed by the perpetrator is often the outcome of societal silence sanction and facing other forms of gender-based violence as well.  Hence, quick, midterm and long term plan with collaborative intervention are needed to protect children at or tend to be at risk Activities such as legal measures, awareness on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), mental health with psychosocial support, livelihood and nutritional support including equal representation of clinical trials, to cope with the pandemic along with disasters. Furthermore, mainstreaming of child rights and protection in local-level planning, budget and development and implementation of child protection and education policy should be done instantly. In a midterm plan, initiatives i.e. are suggested in child protection and education policy should be implemented and I/NGOs along with their regular project should open a space for implementing developed policies at provincial, local level Moreover, replication of good practices with I/NGOs should be in practice and intervention and results should be monitored from the government at the independent level. The collaborative and integrated intervention allows multiple support mechanisms to act together towards a common goal based on protecting children in an emergency from all sorts of harm allowing them to enjoy their rights in the domestic and public sphere and finally contributing to achieving quality education and gender equality along with other 15 sustainable goals Further, humanitarian organizations require to invest in strengthening coordination and collaboration strategy, review executed intervention, and adhere ‘DO No Harm Principle’ that applies to all duty bearers while implementing their humanitarian action"

1,My Magical Text Message,social-issues," Just read this story about my friend Sarah, and I promise that you will be shocked by what happens to her at the end... “I want to be with you forever and always,” he whispered into Sarah’s ear. Her heart fluttered, her eyes widened, and her palms began to sweat… Could it really be? she thought. Could I really be...the one for him? Sarah’s entire life was filled with heartbreak and disappointment. That is, until she met her soulmate. His name was Mark, and he was perfect. He was tall, charming, and incredibly successful… every month he would whisk her away to some exotic Caribbean island or quaint European town. She couldn’t believe how magical their lives were... and she couldn’t help but giggle with glee every time he crossed her mind… Her best friend Jen even jokingly said, “If I could transplant my soul into your body, I’m sorry to say, but I probably would.” Nothing in her life could have been more perfect… that is, until SHE showed up. The stunning new intern at Mark’s office… She was 7 years younger than Sarah, she was thin, and had that kind of youthful flirtiness that most men go crazy for. At first, Sarah wasn’t worried because Mark was always intensely loyal… But this time, the whole situation just felt… different. And as time wore on, Sarah began noticing something deeply strange and disturbing with Mark and the intern… She noticed that they began spending more and more time together at the office… They’d always text each other late at night about work… But Sarah kept telling herself that “work was work” and tried not to think anything of it... Until her friend Jen told her something that made her mind race… “Please don’t freak out,” Jen said, “but I think I saw Mark and that new intern...together...holding hands at the park last night. But I’m not 100% sure…” The moment those words came out of Jen’s mouth, Sarah’s heart crashed to the floor… Was it true? Her heart began to pound wildly. It felt like all her deepest fears were coming true… She knew she had to confront Mark but the moment she did, he snapped... “Of course I’m not into her! I love you. Not her.” But after that, things just didn’t feel the same. Was he telling the truth? she thought to herself. She spent sleepless nights staring at the ceiling, wondering if Mark could really hurt her like that. Every single time Mark’s phone buzzed, she felt a burst of anxiety flow through her… Why is she texting him so late at night? Why is she always texting him…? The more she brought up the issue with him, the colder and more distant Mark became… And after a few weeks of unbearable anxiety… Sarah discovered something that made her want to laugh and cry at the same time… Jen was WRONG about Mark and the intern. It turns out that she had confused them with a couple down the street that looked almost exactly like them… But the damage was already done… and Mark was increasingly distant and preoccupied… And - most disturbingly - he wasn’t texting her back as quickly as he used to… Sometimes waiting for hours where he used to always get back to her in seconds or minutes. The uncertainty of waiting left a knot in her stomach. She didn’t know if he was mad at her… Or if he just couldn’t be bothered anymore... She was a mess of anxiety and started constantly worrying about when he was going to leave her… Until, one day, a few weeks later… It finally happened. Sarah got that fateful message from Mark telling her it was over… Which caused her to drop her phone… It was as if the bottom had dropped out of her life. Her vision blurred as the tears streamed down her cheeks... and she felt her knees weaken and stomach lurch... leaving her to doubt whether she’d ever find someone to love her the way Mark did. And as she sat there, feeling more alone than she had in her life… Staring blankly at her broken phone… She remembered the weird type of text message her friend had told her about... the one that claimed to make any man feel a deep burning obsession for whoever sent it... She’d thought it was ridiculous at the time... But typed it in and sent it off anyway, with no real expectation that she’d ever hear back from him... And almost immediately… he messaged her that one word: “Wait.” And as she stared at that one word, wondering how she should respond, the phone started ringing in her hands… It was him… It was weird to see his name came up like that… He NEVER called her… When she answered, she’d barely said ‘hello’ when he blurted out: “Sarah, I need to see you. Can we please talk?” She agreed to let him come over… And that whole night… Mark BEGGED Sarah for forgiveness… For ever thinking about leaving her… And for ever thinking that his life could be complete without her. The text had reminded him of everything good they had together… And had filled him with a desperate fear that he’d never find a match like her again. Finally, he said the words she’d been waiting to hear for months: “I’m in love with you… and I’m never, ever leaving you no matter what.” “I’m in love with you… and I’m never, ever leaving you no matter what.” So who was this mysterious friend that told Sarah about the most influential text messages ever? Well… drum roll pleeeeease…. It was me! Amy North! WINK For over 10 years, I’ve been studying the science of love and attraction and I’ve learned how simple words can make any man melt with purest form of desire for you… To infiltrate his mind with thoughts of romance and desire... And to make him love you unconditionally... Until he HAS to bend down on one knee and give himself -- completely -- to you and only you. So what is this text message and how does it work? And how does it make your guy feel a special kind of obsession for you that only 1% of women ever experience? In order for you to understand how it works, you need to know just three simple facts:"
2,Sex love and hard times,social-issues," The current times of the epidemic covid 19 have had a very negative impact on the operation of every country in the world. Societies in every country suffered financially but also many laws were limited by introducing restrictions. It was common to close borders between countries that are still closed in many countries today. Sex business has also suffered. To this day, the erotic industry cannot revive, and what is more, the government does not support financially such an industry as the sex industry. As reported by one of the portals in Poland of the country in Central and Eastern Europe, the erotic industry has stopped during the epidemic. To this day, the effects of the epidemic are visible in the entire erotic industry. Most prostitutes standing by the roads have not returned to work yet. Detailed information is available in the article 'Sex services in difficult times' on the site sexdupy.pl Many women in Poland stopped providing sexual services. Those that provide services do not perform all services. Most often, prostitutes don't kiss. Many girls do not provide sex services, only phone sex. Often, girls who provide sex services perform it only with regular customers. Often women report that they disinfect the whole apartment and wash towels at high temperature. Most Polish prostitutes advertise on the internet. The largest Polish sex sites have introduced new sex phone categories. Girls often report that they do not accept clients from abroad or those who have been abroad. As we checked during the highest incidence, the number of sex ads dropped by around 40%. it is easy to guess that many men had no use of sex services. What's more, many people lost their jobs, which means they can't afford the services of girls. As sexdupy.pl emphasizes, in another article during the crisis from abroad many attractive young prostitutes returned. At the time local girls left work, some were replaced by girls working abroad. Many of these girls worked in Germany where she earned several times more money. Escort agencies in Poland were closed during the epidemic and did not provide sex services. Girls standing by the roads for a long time disappeared, however, as noted, some are returning to work. In Poland, prostitutes standing by the roads are the cheapest and women from abroad often work there. Sex usually with such a girl costs 100 PLN which is about 25 USD. The oral service costs 50 PLN, which is about 12 USD. When we go to the apartment sex services offered in Poland usually start from 150 PLN per hour and usually are around 200 PLN per hour which is less than 50 USD. As you know, the main factor affecting the price is the age of the girl and the sexual services she offers. For girls standing by the roads that come from Eastern Europe they take 100 PLN. In this case, the service is performed in the car. As you know, the girl does not protect herself against the virus."
3,Create a picture with words to celebrate your friendiversary,social-issues," We have a lot of remarkable days that have a fixed date; valentine, Halloween, Easter, Christmas, your birthday has a date, and a new year celebration has a date. But some celebrations do not have a fixed time, and you can go on to do the celebration as long as you like. And this includes the celebration of people that are dear to you. The word “Friendiversary” is a popular urbanized slang used among young people. It is a term used for the celebration of your friendship. You can make a friendiversary worthwhile by giving them a gift. Making a picture to text for your friends will be a great way of celebrating your friendship with them. Ethan and Jeff were best friends; they have had so many moments together while growing up. Their friendship journey started while they were young, and they meant the world to each other. In the first fifteen years of their lives, they have never lived a day without seeing each other. From kindergarten, elementary, middle school to high school, their bonds of friendship were still strong, and you would always be sure that they are siblings each time you see them play together. One of the things that helped their friendship was the relationship between the families. And fortunately for them, Ethan’s father was a professional photographer, so most of their moments together were easily captured in photographs. A moment in their lives came when they had to leave for different colleges, it was hard to be separated, but it had to happen. When they were about to go to their separate schools, it was an emotional moment as they were feeling unhappy and close to shedding tears. To make the atmosphere more conducive, Ethan’s father gave both of them a gift, a very simple gift, but a memorable one. He made some of their photos to word and gave it as a gift to both of them. The reason for this gift is that they feel closer to each other even though they are apart from each other. Through their days in college, no single day ever goes by without them remembering each other. So, what should you learn from the story? Even though the gift did not come from a friend to a friend, it was from a father to friends, but the goal was fulfilled. As there is no fixed day to celebrate your friends, you can celebrate them every day. If you have the opportunity of having someone in your life that loves you without a string attached, you are lucky and must strive to keep them in your life. Your business partners will love you because you are into business together, your boss will love you because you work for him, your subordinates will love you because you are the boss, but a friend will love for who you are. A friend will know all your flaws and still go-ahead to keep loving you. Having such people around is the best thing you could ever have in your life, and so there is a need to appreciate them. Let them know you love them, cherish them, and respect their decisions to stay in your life. You can appreciate and reward their kindness in your life by creating a picture with words for them. You can either choose their best photos or choose a photo you both had together. Friendiversary does not always have to be a celebration of someone in your pair that you love most. It can also be a way of celebrating people in your life that are your friends but older than you. You can decide to celebrate your favorite neighbor with a picture with words or a photo to words. It can be your closest colleague at work or even someone superior to you as far as you have a mutual relationship. This idea may sound funny, but you can use a picture of your pet to do it, especially the one you cherish most. Put yourself into the shoe of someone being celebrated, and then you will understand how much a small gift can make someone happy. A colleague at work once gifted me a picture of mine with words on it last year. Initially, I wondered how she got my picture, and to help it all; she has a good eye for selecting Picture because she used the picture I love most. The picture with text was hung on the wall in my living room. And to be sincere with you any day I have my eyes on those pictures, what always comes to my mind was the colleague that gifted me the Picture with text. No day will go in my life ever since then that I will not remember her. The same thing goes for our friends and us. A friend that you turn his or her photo into words and then gave it to her as a gift will never forget you. You can buy them dinner, take them out to cinemas or buy them drinks with time they will forget. But a picture with words hanging around in their living rooms or on their phones will always remind them that they have a friend somewhere that cares for them. The ultimate goal of buying gifts should not always be the cost, but get a gift that will reserve a space for you in the hearts of your friends. You can buy an expensive gift for your friend, but it may not impact so much as buying a simple picture with words. So, how do you go about writing words on your pictures? Here at a photo to text, the process is simplified and straightforward to do. Upload your desired pictures and the words you want to use, choose your background, make necessary corrections. Complete your order by deciding whether you want it in JPG format or printed out."
4,https://articlebiz.com/submitArticle,social-issues," Over recent years tantric massage has literally exploded on to the alternative therapy scene in the UK and within Europe. This is mainly due to people really starting to appreciate the benefits of this sensual form of massage. Here we look at some of the tried and tested benefits of Tantra and tantric massage in general: Increased Relaxation - The relaxation aspect of tantric massage is two fold. Firstly one can expect to get a certain level of relaxation from any form of massage, due to the tactile nature of the therapy, and the kneading and various muscle and body manipulations involved. The added relaxation aspect that you get with tantric massage is of course the tantric breathing techniques, which help bring the feeling of relaxation to a whole different level than traditional massage. Better Sleep - Another byproduct of being more relaxed, is of course the ability to sleep easier. Many people report that not only are you able to get off to sleep easier, but the sleep is much deeper and more peaceful, which can be a godsend to many who suffer from lack of, or disturbed sleep. Enhanced Sexual Performance - This is perhaps one of the most unique aspects of tantric massage therapy over many other massages. The tantric breathing techniques and the increased focus and mental clarity that this brings, can allow people to not only enjoy the whole sexual process more, but also to perform better and longer. Through the use of tantric breathing techniques, men are able to last much longer, and this can be a great natural way to counter issues such as premature ejaculation, which can cause problems for many guys as they get older. Emotional Connection - On of the plus points of using Tantra and tantric massage is it enables couples to build a much deeper connection with their partner. By understanding your partner more and his and her needs, many couples report a much stronger and deeper bond within a relationship."
5,The Stress of the Orthodox Paths,social-issues," The contemporary ways of the world towards what is considered to be either successful or respectful for the individual to attain, are ones that usually cause a lot of stress along the way and even after their acquisition, making the issue of stress not only contemporary but also potential to haunt us for as long as we live amongst the civilization of today. Stress, while can be used as a form of motivation to either gain or preserve successful status or position, has proven to have a negative effect on our mental health, which in turn could lead to other problems such as mental illness, physical pain and a shorter lifespan. In other words, if we regard the stressing of the orthodox paths of the civilized life as existent, along with the long-term consequences of stress, we can conclude that the contemporary society at large can have an indirect, negative influence on our lives and on their natural extension, along with our health, both physically and mentally. Nonetheless, it can be claimed that the societal stress towards the success of attaining our potential, is one that had come from the natural circumstances of how the External World works today; fierce competition, the reasonable possibility of failure on more than one occasion, the potential have your hard years of work be put to shame by at least one scandal such as being blamed for sexual harassment or any other kind of shame-creating act from the masses -- all are examples of how our hard work towards whatever is defined as both successful and respected, can create a fragile path towards it while it can also cause us a lot of stress, whether we are aware of it or not, for the long-term. However, if we are to conclude that that's the way of which the External World works, even if it ultimately plays against our interests, does not entail we should necessarily accept its ways nor follow it and what it dictates to be societal success from the individual level. In other words, we do not have to accept the stressful ways of the world when we have the ability to resist the toxic effects of stress, even if it comes at the price of being appeared by others as less successful, or even be judged as ""wasted potentials"", especially given the fact that there are other, more esoteric ways to attain whatever we want in life, at the benefit of becoming less stressed along the way. Truth be told, I did not managed to get a degree in philosophy, even though I enjoyed the courses I took and even though I had the money to invest in academic studies. I eventually gave in to my ambition to reduce the overall stress in life, which in turn led me to stop my academic studies. My teachers at highschool who I last visited a few years ago, were a bit disappointed, because they told me that I am capable of much academic potential. This has led me to contemplating: is the path of satisfying others truly worth the toll of the stresses of the External World? Why is this world so stressful when we can try and reach healthier alternatives in the name of peacefulness, which is healthier than stress as well? Hence the problem of the orthodox ways towards success in this contemporary world; it is too stressful for people who have it harder to cope under pressure. This world rewards people who can be both stressed and productive at the same time, and not only on the academic fields, but on various of professions as well, while those who collapse under intensive pressure, are usually the ones that'll have it way harder in getting through life's many orthodox challenges. What is clear is that whether you are competent or incompetent under pressure, its negative effects on ourselves and on those around ourselves should be, in my opinion, more considered, especially due to the fact that pressure will ultimately take a significant toll on our lives' health and on their overall span. Should you have the ""privilege"" of going your own way and still manage to sustain yourselves and your overall satisfaction in life, then you should consider abandoning the orthodoxic stress-creating ways of life in the name of your wellbeing, even if you are to sacrifice, theoretically, your reputation among those who have higher expectations for you. That is, possibly, the exact reason as to why MGTOWs, minimalists and hikikomoris exist -- what is common among them is the belief that there is a better alternative in life to pursue, each within their own specialized area in the collection we call life. It comes from the logic that ""A"" can be reached without going exclusively through ""B"", even if we are taught otherwise by the socialization of society. Likewise, I believe that especially in our times were we have a greater individual freedom than ever before in human existence, thanks to values such as tolerance, pluralism and democracy, that we should consider more alternative ways to be living the time we have in the world, in order to either reduce or eliminate whatever we dislike in the orthodox ways the External World try to force upon us, whether or not they believe these ways to be in our best interest."
6,Workaholism As Futile,social-issues," One of the many flaws of our world is that it encourages us to be as much productive as possible, and which each advancement of productivity, we are often rewarded with either the good increase of our reputation, our own pride, or our motivation to maintain such productivity. However, with such promotion, a toll on our lives can come and make our own endeavours for productivity, to be counter-productive. It may sound like a paradox, that our very own efforts can to promote us can demote us, but in reality, that demotion is not a construct of demoting promotion, which does not make sense, but of mere obsession -- the obsession that regardless of what we do, nothing is yet enough, and hence the initial impression that it's a paradox. Therefore, our very own struggle for more productivity can make us not necessarily less productive, but counter-productive; productive against our own wellbeing, while we advance our works into something else, either by profession or by hobby. Workaholism shouldn't be praised by society, because it is an ill condition, even if we regard it to advance our efforts in whatever we're doing. Such words, in general, such as ""addicted"", ""crazy"", ""sick"" ""insane"" and so forth, seem to have taken an opposite direction than their original definitions, AKA, as if being ""sick"" or ""insane"" are good things that should be pursued. However, their counter-productivity seem to be in the deeper meanings of their consequences -- some of our efforts towards society seem to work against us, rather than for us. This is what we get when we completely abandon any sense of egotism, which in healthy doses (as we are also important, not only others), can be good for us. Workaholism, a condition of addiction that should be treated as such, is a construct of a world that doesn't always know when to take a break. More and more we are pushed to our limits, by family, friends, spouses and bosses, so we could please them as much as possible, but with it comes the price of not knowing when to regulate ourselves to lay back and just relax. Furthermore, this condition is not only a product of obsession, but of stress, of trying to get as much done as fast and as efficient as possible, so the requirements of whatever we're doing will be met and we will finally be left alone for the reminder of the day, until the next day of work comes, and its regular vacation at last. As written in my sixth book, ""The Rubinshteinic Teachings"" contemporary civilization, along with its many corporations, seem to benefit on the individual and make a deal off of them, by creating many ways to make them either addicted or stressed, in the name of optimal profit. It could be that because of this very reason the negative-turned-optimistic terms I mentioned earlier have originated; originated from encouraging us to comply to the demands of many bodies, individual and collective, so we will give them what they want from us, and be finally left alone, assuming we can be left alone. Hence, for example, the importance of free time, since when we have free time, we are liberated from the demands of the External World, at least temporarily, but I digress. Anyways, the problem with today's society is that it is too much stressful, and the encouragement and/or demand to make us productive more than we already are, could have, eventually, a serious toll on our lives, that could be translated to a long-lived sense of frustration, even after our duties to the External World have been met. And, the alleged ""horror"" of workaholism, like with many addictions, is that no matter how productive we will be, any amount of work wouldn't be enough to satisfy our passion for activity, since this addiction, again like with many others, is an issue of void; an internal void that is needed to be taken care of more deeply, in a way which continuous, short-term fulfillments, are not enough, because while said fulfillments might temporarily satisfy our emotions, they do not permanently answer the mentality, AKA, the mindset, that encourages said void to grow beyond regular proportions, and hence the futility of addiction-fulfilling, obsession-encouraging activities and consumables, from sex to drugs and even candies; activities and consumables which are widely encouraged to be done and to be consumed despite their long-term uselessness. This is how we as the subjects of the External World become a ""mental farm"" of which we can be used to gain profit on a regular basis. It's also a flaw that exists in the strive of the so-called ""full-life"". Therefore, if we are, for the relevancy of this article, to satisfy workaholism, no amount of productivity will necessarily fill the void created by ourselves and by those who influence us. No amount of candy, of coffee, of alcohol and of sex will ever fulfill our void as long as we don't fill this void not externally but internally, and if we are to do so instead of the former, not only we will save much money and our free time, but also become more free from the enslavement that is the spectrum of addictions. We thus have to let go of the suffer-creating, frustrating passions that seem to never go away; of the desire of more beyond its necessity, and of whatever might only create more void within our minds in the name of short-term gratifications. In other words, we ought to let go, if we want to be let go by the misery of our various frustrations, and by the temptations of the more-than-unnecessary things that control our lives and the way they encourage us to unnecessarily spend more and more of our time, our money and our mental health, ultimately. To take a look at the fruits instead of relentlessly work of rising new ones. Serenity, all in all, can only be achieved by the void of passion, for passion itself is a form of tranquility-halting emotion that stands in our way for a life that could be better well-lived; well-lived with less, instead of be less-well-lived, with plenty of more, whether that ""more"" is an activity or a consumable. This is the problem with today's world -- that many of us are not strong enough to admit the fallacy of any kind of obsession that is seen and accepted as good, almost if not entirely from a hedonistic perspective. The fallacy that any kind of obsession is a form of an incompetent replacement of a void within the ego; the ego that admits there isn't enough within itself."
7,Dealing with Dating Anxiety? 5 Steps to not be Shy & Timid,social-issues," The first time going on a date or you are someone who had a bad marriage and is now starting to date again, the experience each time is new. There are a ton of online veteran dating sites that you can start with to open up. Dating anxiety is common and is normal, but if it is putting pressure on you where you are unable to make conversations at the table, you need help. Veterans often suffer from dating anxiety as for them switching back to civilian life and look for partners is not easy. Post-traumatic stress due to the hardships they faced serving in the military are experiences that are out of the ordinary. You don't get to witness such problems and hardships in your life. Veterans deal through a lot, and their experiences can be quite ugly and hard to forget, which is why some veterans cannot find a place for themselves in civilian life. You can kill the dating anxiety where you will forget how to be shy and timid. But, you got to work on it! Learn the ways that can help you become confident and not be shy. These five simple steps can help you overcome dating anxiety: Self-disclosure is what you need. If you can practice being more open about your feelings, it can help you grow and be less anxious. People often feel constricted, which leads them to stress and anxiety. If not addressed in time, these issues can lead to depression. You can help yourself! Save yourself from going to a counselor or a psychiatrist later. If you can be open about your feelings, there will be less anxiety in your heart, and you will come out to be a confident person. Practice telling how you feel amongst your near and dears. If you don’t like something, speak up, and if you do, appreciate it. Veteran Dating is easy start by taking baby steps! But try and reciprocate feelings amongst your friends and family. If you can achieve this, you will feel more confident about your dates where you can speak about your likes and dislikes without having to think twice. Communication becomes stronger, and the other person starts to understand the wonderful personality that you are. Don’t be too worried about your looks. Acceptance is the key! You are wonderful the way you are, and there can be no other like you. Self-critical nature, too worried about the way you look, thinking from other's perspectives, and losing self-confidence is a regressing nature. Stop it immediately! Feel blessed every single day. Think of the wonderful people you have around you, and how important you are to them. Maybe in the past, someone might have let you down by talking about the way you look, if it did happen, that person is nor worth you. A person with a petty mindset can only think as low to humiliate someone of their looks. You are way above and beyond! Believe in yourself that you are sexy, good looking, and charming personality. So what if a date goes bad! Don’t let the confidence in you shatter. The person who is meant to be will appreciate the good in you! You cannot stop people from talking! People who are judgmental and too quick on talking behind someone’s back are anyway not worth keeping in one’s life. If you are someone who gets affected by what other people think of you, this is one characteristic that is pulling you down. No wonder you will have dating anxiety because of the fear of what the other person might think of you can drive you crazy. Why is it your fear? Why so apprehensive about the fear of getting rejected by the person on the date? If someone doesn’t want to pull off a romantic relationship, don’t think that they rejected you. Everyone has a list in their head on how they want their partner to be. You too have it, right? Don’t be anxious if someone doesn’t want to go out on a second date. Don’t be self-critical and hard upon yourself. The right person, you are still yet to find! Life is full of opportunities, but it is the unnecessary thinking and negative thoughts that turn one person to become a pessimist. Fear is mere imagination, overcome it, and you will see how light and fresh you will feel. If you become carefree for a little time, you will feel as if nothing is worth exaggerating anymore. You will become peaceful from within, and that will help you to be more charismatic and attractive to the person on a date. When there is no fear, you can express yourself better and that is what finding a partner is all about! Don’t cling on to your past. Let bygones be bygones and when you meet a person, think of it as a new moment of your life and learn to live in that moment. Sometimes it can happen that when we are on a date, some gesture or expression by the person can remind us of something awkward, we might have faced before. Overlook it and don't let it fog your mind. This person is not aware of your past life, you should not bring it on the table either. Give yourself and this person time to evaluate how things are between you two. That can only be if you let go of your past experiences and judgmental nature, and learn to live in the moment."
8,HAVING POST TRAUMA GROWTH?,social-issues," I’m hearing a whole range of experiences from people, depending on who they are, where they are and how much of an impact the lockdown had in their life for starters. Just know that whatever your version is, whether you are bogging out, are having a reaction, or are feeling guilty for being fine, it’s ok and you are not alone… We are all on our own Journey, and this includes what we make of and take away from this Pandemic… This is a collective experience that will have a long-lasting effect… We don’t know what that will look like yet, but we are beginning to experience the shifts already… Most have been dealing with the immediacy of the lockdown. Some are thinking of the longer-term impact. A few are thinking, What is the bigger picture here? What is the larger global and humanistic impact? What is the longer-longer-term impact? What are we deconstructing…? How do we reconstruct better…? I notice that the type of thinking and focus people allow themselves determines how they feel, how they show up, and how they embrace the good of this situation… And, yes, there is good! I challenge you to embrace a personal development approach, to entertain different perspectives, to engage in progressive conversations… To stretch yourself. To ask poignant questions. To shift your focus. To take charge of your wellbeing and your influence… To own your power, your gifts, your impact. We all have these… You have these also! How? One way is to think of this situation as traumatic… It has been traumatic in a global scale, albeit to different degrees for different people but non-the-less traumatic… This is a good thing. Because once you get in touch with your trauma, then you have the option to experience your Post Traumatic Growth.

9,HOW TO MANAGE THE FATIGUE,social-issues," We are slowly starting the reopening and easing up on the lockdown. Different areas have had different levels of lockdown, and people have taken it seriously to different degrees. Regardless, it’s been a long haul already managing the restrictions and their impact, and looking into what this means going forward as this pandemic won’t be over any time soon… Is the reality of the longevity of this hitting you hard? You are certainly not alone! People are fatigued, but we can combat this! First, let’s understand what the fatigue is about. It has to do with: Being in a completely different daily environment/context than our usual (being locked-in with loved ones ongoingly without respite) Creating and managing a different daily routine and workflow (adjusting to our days being different than the usual with all the new intricacies of restrictions to boot) Learning how to do our tasks in a completely different way (learning, working and managing life solely online) Having less support, amenities and services (having to do without childcare, cleaning and other services, personal care services and the like) Mitigating the current responsibilities to others, financial and otherwise (carrying expenses in the face of less income or revenue, having sick family members to tend to, having larger responsibilities at work, and so on) Taking care of our health if we get or are sick on top of everything else (feeling unwell or getting really sick where priorities totally need to shift) Experiencing trauma, loss and grief (getting triggered, losing loved ones, missing out on life milestones and celebrations) Having limited social and other interactions (having less opportunities for connecting outside our inner circle and having additional contact) Missing out on activities, events, outings and the like (being limited in our repertoire and opportunities to refresh ourselves and savor life) Dealing with the unknown, the uncertainty and being ready for what the future might bring (questioning ongoingly what’s up and what’s next, not knowing what to do or how to carry on) Phew! Well not for nothing! And, you might even have other stuff in your life to add to this list. Feeling fatigued totally makes sense. I’d like to give you a gold star for hanging in there to the extent that you have. Yes, it is hard, and it makes sense you are tired. But, at the end of the day how you come out of this pandemic is really up to you, regardless of the struggles and challenges. What you choose to focus on is up to you… How you end up feeling is up to you… How you choose to show up is up to you…  What you choose to do about anything is up to you… Watch the thoughts that might trip you up and not let you fully take this in and embrace it! Second, what do you do? It’s time to take the bull by the horns and take charge of your life. Even though it makes sense to feel fatigued, at the end of the day it doesn’t have to kick your butt! It actually doesn’t have to feel so bad… For starters: Don’t stack your thoughts against yourself, others, the situation – what you allow yourself to think will perpetuate whatever feelings you are feeling. Don’t think ugh, gloom and doom, disaster and worst-case scenarios. Focus instead on what is a lesson for you, what is your growth place, what opportunity this creates, how can you serve better, and the like… Think on how you want to Be… How are you Being that way already and how you can be that way more… Think on what you want to do the rest of the year… What philosophy will you embrace and how will you run your life accordingly? Approaching life from this angle is more empowering and relieves the stress and fatigue. It actually is inspiring and motivating… I promise. The key is to want to feel better. Sometimes we just love to wallow in self-pity… We love to whine, complain and entertain conspiracy theories. Listen, regardless of what is going on out there, you are in charge of what is going on in your mind… For that is where the perspective, feelings and decisions are generated, and actually where life is created… ASSIGNMENT: Decide to feel better, take charge of your mind, take charge of your life… Make a list of all the thoughts and scripts running through your mind, check them for logical validity and clean them up… Decide what values you want to live by and how you want to show up. Clean up parts of your routine that get in the way of this. Choose what is one accomplishment you want to have under your belt during the lockdown, and then one for the rest of the year. Focus on accomplishing the goals, share it with loved ones to infuse it with good mojo. The rest of the to-dos are secondary… Prioritize accordingly. That’s it. Don’t over think it. Don’t over complicate it. You can create what you want. Set your mind to it and do it. When you simplify your approach and shift your focus, you feel much better… You’ll be able to replenish, build community and enrich your life easier even under restrictions… You can do it!

11,Tips on how to maintain your love life while social distancing,social-issues," It is fair to assume that dating during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is not at the top of any one's list of priorities. In an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, Americans are going into self-isolation and hunkering down for an indefinite period of time. But those of us who live alone and are single face the bleak prospect of weeks if not months without in-person contact. And a long-standing lack of physical or emotional contact may feel pretty desperate when it comes to preserving our mental health.In the midst of the pandemic, learn how to keep dating in a fun, safe and responsible manner. Choose a select few individuals to spend your time. Often people click right on so many profiles of online dating that they end up never going on any dates at all — a simple example of the perils of the paradox of preference. But this brand-new socially distant world could serve as a good motivator to pick just a few people into whom you want to invest your time and energy and keep the conversation going afterwards. This is a situation in which sitting down and having a prolonged conversation with someone every few days could prove beneficial instead of only answering messages in one block of times. Set up the dates online. And if you're on dating apps, you might have noticed that more and more matches suggest ""virtual dates,"" where you're essentially FaceTime or Zooming with each other, and sitting in the candlelight of your living room while drinking wine.This might not be borne out of necessity as much as a cementing of an already existing trend in dating. After all, these days people are too overworked and exhausted to commit themselves to meeting someone in person, particularly if it involves a commute. It is fast, with virtual dating. You simply pick a time and press a button, and you're on a date. And make an effort to clothe and sweep your bed. Just because you don't meet someone in person that doesn't mean you're not going to set the mood. Putting the best foot forward by dressing up a little bit as well as setting some mood lighting and selecting a good camera angle.Digital dating also provides a useful opportunity to see how you see yourself on a date, from the way you wear your hair to the language of your body. Yeah, if nothing else, then showering is an excuse! See the long-distance courting romance. Doctors do not suggest that you be sexually involved with someone right now even though he is a friend with whom you reside. But this needn't always be a negative thing. For now, you can digitally send each other love letters or arrange FaceTime calls in the park in addition to the video dinner dates. Any time you have excitement and desire, when you see each other directly, it will always be so much easier."
12,Discover How Losing Weight Helps Improve Your Sex Life,social-issues," Are you a woman who is unhappy in the bedroom? If you are, there are likely a number of reasons for your unhappiness. Despite the possibility of a number of causes, do you think that your weight may be to blame? If you are overweight or obese, it may be. Since you now know that your weight may have an impact on your sex life, you may be curious what weight loss can do for you. It is really possible to improve your intimacy with weight loss? Unfortunately, the answer isn’t always the same, as it tends to vary. Weight loss and its impact on your sex life will honestly all depend on you and your own personal situation. For starters, many women make the mistake of believing that their lost weight resulted in better sex. It can, but did you know that many women are just deceiving themselves? Being intimate with your partner may feel better and result in more pleasure, but it honestly may be due to an increase your self-confidence levels.

It means that the sex may be the same old sex you have been receiving for years, but it just feels better now. Another impact that your ability to lose weight may have on your sex life is your ability to experiment in the bedroom. Experimentation is a key to keeping your relationship hot. One type of experimentation that you may want to try is a new sex position. Has your weight previously kept you from being creative? If so, now is your time to shine. Show your partner that you now have moves that you never even thought of trying before. In keeping with experimenting in the bedroom, it is important to know that experimentation comes in a number of different formats. One other format is that of role playing.

Unfortunately, this is not something that many women take into consideration. If you were to lose weight, there is a good chance your partner will like the improvement. Yes, your husband most likely loves and worships you now, but there is still something attractive about women who take steps to better themselves, especially in terms of appearance. If you do decide to lose weight, let your husband know that you lost the weight for them and to better your sex life. They will not only be proud of you, but they may also be turned on.

Studies have also shown that people with flat belly maintain good health condition with increased chance of longevity."
13,A Copywriter's Insider Secrets To Avoid Being Duped By Headlines,social-issues," If you’d like to know a professional copywriter’s insider secrets to avoid being misled by the media’s headlines, then you might find this brief article fascinating. You see, copywriters, like journalists, spend a lot of time breaking down, analyzing and learning how to write compelling headlines.  This puts us in a unique position to understand what makes them ""tick"". The first rule is simply to not be confused about a headline’s purpose.  Just like direct-response copywriters need people to read our sales offers, journalism is a business first and foremost.  Media outlets need eyeballs on their content. The headline’s job is not to inform.  Rather, the job of any headline is to capture attention with the goal of getting you to read, watch, or listen to the story or message, nothing more.  For this reason, there must be some important context which is left out; otherwise, why would you need to go deeper? When you remember that headlines deliberately leave out details which are explained in the body of the article, and that these details provide necessary context, you’ll read openers with a more critical eye.  The problem is most people don’t read whole articles; instead, they scan headlines, which can only give you an incomplete picture. It’s also important to note headlines that do their job well typically pack an emotional punch.  This often requires drama, a hint of the sensational, curiosity, wrenching on powerful emotions like fear and outrage, or some combination of the above. Let’s take a look at a couple of examples in health reporting: One is from The Toronto Star, Just 60 Seconds of Intense Exercise Can Boost Your Fitness Level.  Why is this a solid appeal?  The idea of getting fitter with such a small amount of exercise sounds counter intuitive, for one.  That contrast serves up a little curiosity already baked in.  It also speaks to the fantasy people have of getting fit more easily, or faster. In the article, the study compared 10 minutes of interval training with 45 minutes of traditional cardio for its effects on V02 max.  However, V02 max is but one narrow parameter of your fitness.  Even the study’s author said that ""60 seconds is all you need"" was not the right conclusion to draw, contrary to what the article’s headline implies. The second is a press release entitled, Exercise, More Than Diet, Key To Preventing Obesity.  The attention-grabbing features here are (i) ""Key to preventing obesity"" is a dramatic claim.  Most people know obesity is a big problem.  Also (ii) ""Exercise vs. Diet"" is an ongoing debate, so it’s topical.  For starters, the study wasn’t an even an obesity study.  It examined metabolic indicators in rats to determine the impact of exercise on metabolism…independently of weight loss. It’s also wise to inspect the source of the headline.  Do they have an agenda?  Truly objective reporting is an endangered species in today’s business and political ecosystem. Bottom line: there’s an art to writing headlines that seduce people away from other stuff they could be doing and effectively ""steal"" their attention.  With the tips in this article you’ll be better able to resist their subtle persuasion tactics. When a headline hits you in the gut, let that be your cue to have a peak beneath the surface and scan the article or content.  More often than not, you’ll discover some detail missing from the headline that can lower its impact."
14,Calling Yourself A Christian,social-issues," Having found Jesus is a beautiful thing.Your life seems to have meaning. You’ve seem to have found something that brings you great joy and happiness. Your loneliness and emptiness have disappeared. Praise the Lord. Anyone that has accepted Jesus in their heart is considered to be a follower of Jesus Christ. So, when anyone asks you, ""Are you a Christian?"", certainly you’re going to reply, ""yes, I am"". Now there is a big responsibility in calling yourself a Christian. One needs to know that in calling yourself a Christian, you are representing the ministry that Jesus started. Not any of the Churches that exist, but the ministry of Jesus Christ. The danger of this is, is that by not living up to the standards of what Jesus laid out for us to follow we could very well give God a black eye. Let me explain. People are going to be people, and if they see the opportunity to make themselves feel good about themselves, they will. What it is, is that people like to point fingers. And when it comes to religion, they will convince themselves of things like Christians are a bunch of hypocrites and why would I want to become one of them or look at the Catholic priests that are molesting little boys. What about the Muslims? Certainly they’re not all terrorists, yet have one come around and people begin to judge them without even getting to know them. Understand what I’m trying to get at. People love dirty laundry. It seems that the worse it is, the better for them. I’m definitely not denying that I haven’t been there myself pointing fingers. It seems like we need to do this, so that we can feel a little better about ourselves and not have to really see who we really are. We can be quick to judge others, but when it comes to ourselves, forget it. You have to remember that people are always watching you. Not so much as to be in waiting for you to slip up, but your conduct. If they see a mild mannered, polite, easy going person that is kind and considerate then that’s what they’re going to see. But if they see a rude, nasty, foul mouthed, angry person then that is what they are going to see. It’s not so much as to be concerned about you calling yourself a Christian, but it would be better that they call you a Christian. That is what brings Glory to God. The best thing that you want people to see in you is the good. No one wants to be considered evil, but who and what you are in Gods eyes is what is really going to matter. Here’s an example: I do alot of driving everyday at work. I see people with the fish sign on their car.To me they’re advertising the fact that they are a Christian. What gets me is the way they drive. Speeding, cutting people off and so on. Now I’m sure that there’s people that don’t know the Lord yet, saying things like, ""look at that maniac and he’s supposed to be a Christian?"" Whoops, there goes another black eye for God. I just basically want you to see what harm can be done. We really need to be cautious about how we represent ourselves. If you want to be humble and someone asks you if you are a Christian. Just tell them that your faith is in Jesus Christ, He is our Savior and that you try to follow Him as best as you can, but you are not without fault. Then when you do mess up, no one gets hurt. A Christian is a follower of Christ, a disciple. If you want to see what Jesus requires of one to be a disciple of His, look up these scriptures. Luke 6:46-49 – Luke 14:26,27 & 33 – John 8:31-34 – John 13:34,35 – John 15:8. May God Bless You All."
15,DISASTERS: What Did Jesus Say To Us,social-issues," What did Jesus say to do in a time of disaster? There were two disasters that The Lord talked about. The first one was about those who lost their lives because of Pilate, and also those who lost their lives because the Tower of Si loam fell on them. Jesus used these two instances, as an opportunity to teach those Galileans about what their attitude should be in response to these disasters. We are now being faced with one disaster after another, and we need to learn what Jesus taught about the subject. Jesus was quite clear in saying that those that were killed were not any worse sinners than the people that survived and lived. Jesus was saying to the people that when a terrible catastrophe occurs; it is a warning to all that survive the ordeal. Jesus not only tells the people that they are no better than the ones that perished, but He goes a step further, and He tells them that they should repent or they also will perish. When we see the disasters through the news reports; what do we do? First, and foremost; we repent of our own sins, and we turn to God. That is the most important response. After that, we need to pray, and The Holy Spirit will lead us and guide us. Those that have matured in the Lord; the real sons and daughters of God are those who inquire of The Lord before they do anything. They know that whatever they do; it is of small value unless it is in obedience and anointed by The Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will show us how to pray and what to do. Disasters are being televised in every area of the world today, and our first response is to humble ourselves, pray, seek God and turn from any and all of our own evil ways. It is a warning to us, and we must realize that it is only by the grace of God that we have not perished. Repentance is a wonderful opportunity to be refreshed, renewed, and revived in The Lord. The Lord went about saying, ""Repent for The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"". Why did Jesus emphasis this point? Because we do not know when our time to die will come, but The Lord Jesus was warning us to always repent in order to be right with Him. We are never to take our salvation for granted because we are told to ""work out our own salvation with fear and trembling"", and also that ""those who endure to the end will be saved"". We are told to ""take heed when we think we stand; lest we fall"", and we are not to think more highly of ourselves than we should. Presumption is something to be shunned. It is only by the grace of God that we will be saved, and all the works in the world will not usher us into The Throne of God. Jesus preached repentance all of the time because He loved all of the people, and He didn’t want even one person to perish without eternal salvation with Him. We here in these perilous times need to do the same. Each new disaster and tragedy is an opportunity for repentance, refreshing, renewal and revival. When we do what Jesus taught us to do first, then we will be greatly effective in whatever He leads us to do. Jesus only did what The Father revealed for Him to do, and how much more should we only do as He directs. Let us put The Lord Jesus Christ in His rightful position as The Head and Lord of The Church, which is His Body."
16,From The Kingdom Of Darkness,social-issues," From the Kingdom of Darkness. Col 1:12-14; Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the legacy of the holy people in light: Who hath conveyed us from the intensity of haziness, and hath made an interpretation of us into the realm of his dear Son: In whom we have recovery through his blood, even the absolution of sins: Numerous things have occurred in this world, demise goes to the individuals who pause, accidental when nor where nor even how it comes, yet it goes to all. Numerous Ministers, of Gods Testimony, of His Son Jesus, are crying with severe tears for the dead and the loss of numerous who have passed on with no expectation of Salvation through the dismissal of the Blood of the Lamb. Reparation for them is far proceeded to be not, at this point accessible to them, whom have settled on their choice to follow bogus divine beings into time everlasting. These Ministers of the reality of the situation are not to blame for the lost that have kicked the bucket, yet the issue lyes with those that picked haziness as opposed to light. The individuals who have passed on in wrongdoing must likewise be brought up in transgression to be partaker of the judgment of man. There is no flaw in the priests of truth, they have carried out their responsibility to God and man to convey reality. 2Co 4:5 (Wesley) For we lecture not ourselves, yet Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your hirelings for the well being of Jesus. The issue isn't in us, neither in the principle they get notification from us. We lecture not ourselves – As capable either to illuminate, or pardon, or bless you. Be that as it may, Jesus Christ – As your lone insight, honesty, purification. Also, ourselves your hirelings – Ready to do the meanest workplaces. For the good of Jesus – Not for respect, intrigue, or joy. The Father hath made an interpretation of us into the realm of his dear Son. ""Translated"" has two explicit implications, 1.The interpretation of the body, as noted in sacred text. To shoulder, convey or expel starting with one spot then onto the next. To expel or pass on to paradise, as a person, without death. ""By confidence Enoch was deciphered, that he ought not see demise. Heb 16."" Those hence made an interpretation of as to state, are likewise changed as to character. This is a change from the lustful psyche to the brain of Christ. A difference in mentality an adjustment in your points of view an adjustment in heart. There are numerous that trust Col 1:12-14, is expressing that Christians, who have been made an interpretation of, are safe to assault by Satan and the powers of Darkness, this is a confusion and perilous conviction. The interpretation referenced here is interpretation of the dead soul to a live soul and not the passing of the body. An interpretation from a realm of untruths and duplicity to the Kingdom of Light and Truth. From being a hireling to Satan to the Servant of the Lord God Almighty. From being a captive to sin to being the Sons of God. Insofar as the Body is alive, it is an objective for Satan and the realm of Darkness. Still don't accept? Take a gander at Paul for instance; 2Co 12:7-10; And in case I ought to be magnified above measure through the wealth of the disclosures, there was given to me a thistle in the substance, the dispatcher of Satan to buffet me, in case I ought to be commended above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it may withdraw from me. Furthermore, he said unto me, My elegance is adequate for thee: for my quality is made flawless in shortcoming. Most happily in this way will I rather wonder in my ailments, that the intensity of Christ may settle upon me. Along these lines I enjoy illnesses, in censures, in necessities, in oppressions, in bothers for the well being of Christ: for when I am feeble, at that point am I solid. Paul was an evangelist to the gentiles, of which we as a whole are. ""What's more, in case I ought to be commended above measure through the bounty of the disclosures"" this entry is expressing that Paul, to be kept Humble, as we may be, was given a bug, to keep Him in Humbleness. The Word ""disclosures"" was not the Book of Revelations, yet otherworldly understanding into reality of the Gospel. Paul expresses this twice, ""in case I ought to be magnified above measure."" Thou we have all insight and information into the sacred writings we are altogether despite everything living in this realm of murkiness. John 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 2Co 4:3-4 But in the event that our gospel be stowed away, it is covered up to them that are lost: In whom the divine force of this world hath blinded the psyches of them which accept not, in case the light of the superb good news of Christ, who is the picture of God, should sparkle unto them. I wish to take a gander at, 2Co 4:3-4, for a second, particularly the words,""In whom the divine force of this world hath blinded the psyches of them which accept not"" ""the lord of this world,"" "" is Satan."" If we look in the book of Revelations, after the letters to the holy places we see an example that is upsetting. Beginning with part 6 there is no notice of the Church until some other time in the prophecy's. This is upsetting provided that you saw, even thou the prediction's of disclosures are as yet available to all, nobody gives any consideration to them. The Bible is as yet available however man, not quite the same as today, who are fixated on prescience, won't hear any longer of Scripture, or overlooks it. Why? 1. The Church is Gone. The proclaiming of the gospel has changed course from the gentiles to the Jews, hence the 144,000 fixed Jews. The hours of the gentiles has been satisfied. Which isn't to state that the gentiles can't at present atone however that prescience must be satisfied as it is composed. Fire up 11:3 And I will give power unto my two observers, and they will forecast a thousand 200 and threescore days, dressed in rough clothing. The realm of murkiness has grabbed hold around the world. Fire up 11:10 And they that abide upon the earth will cheer over them, and make joyful, and will send blessings to each other; on the grounds that these two prophets tormented them that harped on the earth. Everybody is distracted with self protection. Fire up 6:15-17, And the rulers of the earth, and the incredible men, and the rich men, and the main commanders, and the strong men, and each bondman, and each liberated individual, concealed themselves in the caves and in the stones of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and conceal us from the substance of him that sitteth on the position of royalty, and from the fierceness of the Lamb: For the extraordinary day of his anger is come; and who will have the option to stand? Since man has dismissed reality, God has blinded them, so they can't see. 2Th 2:11-12 And for this reason God will send them solid daydream, that they ought to accept an untruth: That they all may be accursed who accepted not reality, however had joy in corruption. Fire up 16:9 And men were burned with extraordinary warmth, and reviled the name of God, which hath control over these infections: and they atoned not to give him greatness. In this statement,""Who hath conveyed us from the intensity of dimness"", ""power"" isn't in the Greek language but instead means, the capacity of, Faculty of the brain, as showed by a specific method of activity; as the intensity of reasoning, looking at and judging; the thinking powers. ""give commission"" That is to mean, the capacity to control our reasoning, our brain and soul. We have been interpreted from the control of the methods for murkiness to the methods for Jesus Christ and His reasoning. Exemplary nature and Goodness and Truth is the Kingdom of God. We have been conveyed from the ruler of haziness, [Satan] who, by methods for transgression and un-conviction, keeps men in numbness, bad habit, and hopelessness. Has humankind become so visually impaired that they can't see? Have you additionally gotten blinded by the passing and obliteration of the previous hardly any years that Satan has likewise blinded your eyes to reality of Biblical Prophecy? What are you looking for that Jesus can't supply? Consider it."
17,The High Cost of Energy and Water,social-issues," Waking up early to start the day, I gently breastfeed my infant and enjoy the peaceful morning light. In those beautiful moments I don't allow debt or financial burdens to cause me distress. Instead I thought it sensible to write an article that may or may not make a difference in society. If I cannot change these things at least I can raise awareness. We are a low-income family of three. There are bills from four cities ago we will never be able to pay. In 2017 my husband and I were married. We both were working as many hours as we could. We had a car payment, rent, electricity and water/sewer bills. In winter our power was shut off. In Missouri it gets fairly cold during winter. At that time we did not have our child so at least it was just us two. We bought tall candles from the Dollar Tree and left them burning through the night to keep us warm. We qualified for LIHEAP but because the power had already been shut off they could not help. I still remember seeing my breath and the condensation on the windows. Shortly after that our water was turned off. Although we were working we desperately needed to pay for and keep our car. Being in a binding contract with a ""buy-here-pay here,"" would leave us with garnished wages if we failed to pay off the loan. Even with EBT support for groceries we could only afford that car. We used supermarket jugs of water to wash or dishes and to bathe. Lastly, we couldn't pay rent. This went on for about three months before we were evicted. I had even switched jobs in hopes I would I would bring in more money. I had applied for many positions and could not find a second job. Then we were evicted. Thankfully, we have not been in a situation like that since. Yet even now, having moved to another state entirely, in comes the mail with a bill every month. Currently my husband is out of work as a result of the Covid-19 global pandemic. After weeks of waiting he got an unemployment payment. That has been a major relief. But I can't help but think there are many Americans who have experienced similar situations. It's very difficult to find happiness in poverty. Poverty takes so much out of you. It came to me this morning to tell my story. Maybe, just maybe someone somewhere can make a difference for the American people facing such financial hardship. I believe that the rate at which companies determine how much a residence owes in power and water/sewer usage should significantly be forced to lower or be based on income. Things have greatly changed in society. For some reason prices of everything keep rising! Sadly, that can only mean one thing for the poor, oppression. When the bills come in I can't help but think about how others are faring once they've paid. I'm sure, like us, they have little to nothing left. I know for a fact many, too many, don't have any savings to fall back on in an emergency like we're experiencing now. I'm grateful that in the terrible conditions of a natural disaster families can receive funds to aid their struggle. Because in modern society we absolutely need power, water and sewer, the cost of living should be lowered! Why should it continue that the rich become richer and poor, poorer? Why has it been allowed to exist this way? There is little opportunity because of the outrageous cost of living! Power companies have had their day. The people have had enough."
18,Examination is not a true test of knowledge,social-issues," ""Examination is not a true test of knowledge"" is a statement/mantra that one should have come across at one point or the other. Many people are too eager to mouth ""examination is not a true test of knowledge"" to rationalize their abysmal academic performance, lack of substantial academic effort/nonchalance, and sometimes, the education system. However, it is pertinent to EXAMINE this cliche itself. Is it true? Choose your answer and discuss it in the comment section. Yes Maybe I think not, Here are my views. While I agree that ""pen and paper"" may not be a perfect or circumspect test, it most definitely examines knowledge. It is also important to note that the statement/premise is fallacious since not all examinations are pure ""pen and paper"", there are practical examinations, oral examinations, a presentation text, etc. Another claim made by proponents of the mantra is that some people are able to score high in examinations simply because they are good crammers and not because they are actually knowledgeable. To some extent, this can be true, but cramming is not easy work (even though personally I am not an expert at it, and do not advocate it) and we need to give crammers credit for their effort. However, I doubt if none of the ""knowledge"" gained through cramming is committed to long-term memory. Einstein had a point when he opined ""Everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid."" But even in water, fish don’t survive effortlessly. Maybe the educational sector needs revamping in certain areas to make it more conducive and to give teaching assistance to those with learning difficulties. Yes. But going by the definition, an examination is to test the knowledge or proficiency of (someone) by requiring them to answer questions or perform tasks. In schools, examinations are almost always done after extensive periods of teaching, study and revision. In that wise, how can examination be a FALSE test of knowledge? On the other hand, I will use Finland as an example, A country whereby, There are no inspectors, no exams until the age of 18, no school league tables, no private tuition industry, no school uniforms. Yet since 2000, this same country, Finland, has consistently featured at or near the top of international league tables for educational performance, whether children are tested on literacy, numeracy or science. More than 60% of its young people enroll in higher education, roughly evenly divided between universities and polytechnics. According to the World Economic Forum, Finland ranks third in the world for competitiveness thanks to the strength of its schooling, which overcomes the nation's drawbacks, in the forum's view, such as restrictive labor market regulations and high tax rates. Lastly, the Examination is an organized and proven method to check your knowledge and obtain a grade an assessment on the extent of your knowledge. to check your memory power to recall what you learned. to reveal your understanding or skill. Key to Knowledge : K= Keep E= Educating Y= Yourself."
19,Water Removal Solutions for Building Sites,social-issues," Water removal is sometimes needed before construction can commence. Many construction sites have underground water or surface water that can influence the building process and the quality of the structure. And, this is why dewatering techniques are being used to get rid of as many water as possible before construction can start. But this is something that many people don’t know. And, it is quite interesting to know how people are getting rid of water on a site, so that the building process can begin. This is some of the information about dewatering techniques that you might found interesting. Proper water removal plays a key role in erosion and sediment control measures on a building site. What is dewatering? Firstly, what is dewatering? And, is this essential to get done? Water removal solutions for building projects is often required to remove excess water and moisture from the surface or soil of the building site. In some cases, there are construction sites that have water just below the surface or within the soil. This water needs to be removed before construction can start. If the water isn’t removed, there is going to be water in the foundation. Making the foundation weak. Meaning that the whole building will be weak at the end of the day. The dewatering is the technique that they are using to get rid of the water in the soil on the construction site. Why is this something that should be done There are many reasons why the soil should be completely dry, and that there isn’t any sign of water on the site before construction starts. It will influence the cement mixture that is needed for building the foundation of the building. Making the mixture watery and will cause the foundation to become weak and unstable. The moment that the foundation is unstable, it will influence the whole building and the construction process. Everything will need to strengthen and even somethings like the foundation will need to be redone, if the dewatering isn’t done, or isn’t done correctly. Things to consider when water removal is done When dewatering is getting done, there are a couple of things that need to be taken care of, so that it is implemented correctly, and that it doesn’t harm the rest of the environment. Especially, when it’s a lot of water that needs to be pumped out. The first thing that needed to be considered is that the water should never be pumped into or onto a slope. This will cause erosion and damage to the environment. You will need to make sure that with dewatering, that you don’t cause any erosion. If erosion is spotted, the dewatering should be stopped immediately. In cases where subsequent erosion does become an issue, gabion cages can be installed to help minimise the damage. Preventing water from coming again at your construction site Once the water and excess moisture is thoroughly extracted from the building site, it doesn’t mean that it won’t return. Especially, if you have to do with underwater rivers. Then, you need to make sure that you prevent water from surfacing again. The best way to do that is to ensure that you have a drainage system in place. That will be redirecting the water out of the construction site. This will ensure that the water isn’t getting wasted, but that it won’t influence the building on the construction site, and the quality of the building at the end of the day. Dewatering techniques and solutions for construction processes are really important. It makes sure that the quality of the building is correct and stable. Water removal is a process that might be needed at more construction sites than what you might realize. But, this is an essential part of the construction process to ensure a strong and durable building."
20,10 Bible Verses about Love and Trust,social-issues," God created humans by pairs. He created men and women that in the end they could be together and form whose name is family. What do you think about love and trust? The Bible verse itself applies as the best book that can help you make the right conclusion about love itself. God as the formation of the first family, Adam and Eve want all families can be happy. Unfortunately, the first family did not obey. As a result, they suffer. God tells us how we with a partner can be happy. Even though now you have a relationship as a lover or has become a husband and wife. In the Bible, there are so much practical advice and principles that can help associated with love loyalty. Especially if now you are facing unwanted situations like a distant partner (LDR) and when you miss someone. Let's align our way of thinking according to the Bible view in the Bible verse below. Bible Verses about Love and Trust ""Little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth"" Love itself according to the Bible is not only shown through words. But every word spoken must be in harmony with actions in the truth. God wants his people, especially couples to love each other in all aspects of life not only by boasting. ""that you may make sure of the more important things, so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ,"" What God commands in the Bible is the way so that we are happy to the end. Including the way to choose a life partner, the partner we choose is part of our lives. Does he also support the good attitude and help you develop the attitude of the fruit Spirit? A good partner will try to help each other not to be blameless before God. ""Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury"" True love must be based on love or Agape. Love itself covers many important attitudes that Christians need to be developed. It includes for generous, not jealous, not arrogant, not inactivity in disrespect, not selfish, not angry and did not revenge. ""Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech, as well as everything injurious. But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you"" How is the life of a Christian beloved? If they heed the advice of this Bible to their marriage or relationship can be happy. Each partner has a conflict or problem, but in this Ephesus book, we are warned to get rid of all anger and conflict. Instead, the pair must love each other and forgiving as God has been forgiving us. ""On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law."" The nature of the fruit of Spirit in the Galatians book is of the nature that needs to be developed to strengthen relationships with partners. Even though we are not perfect we need to exert efforts. Maybe with a step by step, we can choose one of the nature that you want to develop first. ""Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,But the tongue of the wise is a healing."" Our mouth is often supposed like small objects that can ignite the large fire. What we submit can affect the feelings of people who hear. Words in Proverbs, say the ""Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,But the tongue of the wise is a healing. so we all should be wise to use our tongue. This applies to strengthen relationships with your partner. ""Let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should answer each person."" what we do to other people also reflects who we are. If we always doing something with love for others, people will think of us as a loving one, like our God is love. Including the way you treat a partner, if you always try to give love then, your partner will increasingly love you too. ""make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind."" Love the pair according to the Bible is also mention through Philippians 2:2. The two of them will have the same think way, one soul and the same goal. Thus they can also strengthen each other in faith and spiritual until their relationship be successful because there is joy from our God. "" By consultation, plans will succeed, And by skillful direction wage your war.."" Before making a decision bible in proverbs mention the importance of careful consideration and thought. Whatever decisions affect your life especially with partners. Think and invite a partner to help in every decision you make. With decisions, any problem can be resolved with a shared mind to think better. ""And now, my sons, listen to me;Yes, happy are those who keep my ways. Listen to discipline and become wise."" In this verse,God says about the important lesson that he gives through the Bible and never ignores it. Thus, we can be wiser, especially the best ways to strengthen love relationships with partners. These are the verses of the Bible that may often hear some of them when they emphasize what love, strengthening love, loyalty, true love and so on. In addition to the popular verses above, you can also read directly in the Bible, the story of the servant of God related to this discussion. For example, the story between Isaac and Rebekah. Then there was Abraham and Sara whose story was recorded in the Bible. How they show the affection of each other can be used as a good example for couples today. So much of this information, hopefully, it can be useful."

2,Exercises that Stimulate Libido and Boost Sex Drive,social-issues," People who live sedentary lives and don’t get a lot of exercises are generally more likely to have a low sex drive. There are lots of reasons for this. If you don’t exercise, your circulation goes down, making it harder to get an erection. Your body won’t be as capable of producing hormones or neurotransmitters that are responsible for stimulating libido. And, you’ll be more likely to become overweight which can lead to self-esteem issues and low libido on its own. There are lots of different forms of exercise that are particularly effective at improving libido in males. Strength Training Strength training is quite possibly the most effective type of exercise for boosting male libido. You probably already know that testosterone is involved in the production of muscle tissue. Well, the opposite is also true: men with more muscle tend to produce more testosterone.

3,Five Facts About Renewable Energy That You Need To Know,social-issues," If we were to limit the speed of climate change in order to reduce the impact on the natural environment, then we have to start looking at clean and renewable sources of energy. Many of us think that we are far from switching to renewable energy but this is actually not true. In 2008 renewable energy accounted for only 18.5% of the energy production in the world. They were mostly coming from hydroelectric power. Since then, solar and wind energy has been pushed in the recent years increasing the world production to 25%. Researchers point that it could even reach 30% by 2022 which is 2 years away. Seven countries entirely rely on renewable energy but that is because their consumption is not as demanding as many of the top world nations. These 7 countries generate their energy through hydroelectric power. If you travel along the coast of northeast Europe, many of the countries have installed wind turbines and other sources of renewable energy on their shores. Currently the top 10 nations on the planet generate close to 30% of their electricity from renewable energy. These countries however account for 70% of the total world electricity consumption. Installing solar panels and relying on other renewable energy resources is a long term investment. Many businesses and even homes go with the renewable energy approach to cut down costs of electric bill. Not only its becoming cheaper to invest in the renewable technologies but they are also becoming more efficient allowing for lower costs. Renewable source is also a huge help to deal with power outages. These outages are reliant on the power grid but when your business can produce its own energy, you will not have to worry about power issues. As the climate change problem gets addressed more and more, European Union has made a major announcement that they will set targets for renewable energy usage by 2030. The initial proposition was for 27% of electrical power to come from renewable energy by 2030. This however turned out to be a low standard as EU is exceeding 20% already. The target of energy consumption is set around 34% but this might even still be low as the production costs of wind turbines are dropping allowing for extra budget to invest in even more renewable energy sources. Wind and solar energy have become the fastest rising energy source in our history. Wind power became the first step towards clean energy but the cost of solar panels has also been dropping quite fast. Traveling along the shores of Europe, we can witness how wind energy has actually been taking over most of the energy consumptions of EU countries."
4,Not just cheap energy – why should you consider installing solar panels?,social-issues," Cheap energy and instant gains. There a number of reasons why you should consider installing solar panels. Do you have a business or own private home? The benefits from solar technology are almost immediate, with a real, tangible effect on your monthly energy bill. The new generation solar panels might even allow you to ""sell"" the energy back to your provider. Have you ever considered buying into technology? If you live anywhere with a decent amount of sunlight, solar is more than a must. Governments and state agencies around the world are announcing new incentives, which payout generous benefits for anyone willing to invest in solar energy. Are you in the process of renovating your house? Now is the perfect moment to get them on your roof! In the US alone, the Department of Energy promised to roll out $125.5 million for solar energy, just for the year 2020. The funding is expected to cover different projects, as well as scientific research, which will popularize solar power in a residential, non-commercial setting. Read on why solar might directly benefit your household Did we mention that your house might go up in value, as a direct result of your investment in solar energy? Banks, mortgage providers, and real estate agencies consider solar panels as an upgrade to your property. Just like a live-in basement or attic, solar panels are an important add-on to your assets. In the last decade, buyers were increasingly willing to pay a premium for homes, which came with solar panels. The US Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which works on the subject of energy efficiency, first confirmed the trend in 2015. In fact, the Laboratory’s latest ""Tracking the Sun"" report broadly supports this tendency, pointing to the growing popularity of photo-voltaic modules (PV), across the whole country. According to some statistics, the property value after installation went up as high as $15,000, in certain states. But there is a whole lot of other advantages, which will make your investment worthwhile. Even if you live in a region, which is low in solar resources, such as Alaska or the Pacific Northwest! Thanks to advances in technology – an overall increase in the panels’ capacity to extract energy from the sun – even countries like Germany are leading the way in generating solar power. If you live in a sunny state, you can consider yourself to be lucky. Clean, self-sustainable energy, which will safeguard the planet for the next generation Unlike many other forms of energy, solar power does not need to be imported. Put it this way, it is entirely ""home-grown"". If we consider today’s complications and uncertain political climate, it is good to bet on self-sufficiency. In most cases, global warming will not substantially affect the hours of sunlight. On the contrary, many places will see an increase in temperatures and shorter, snap winters. At the same time, switching to solar energy will help the entire country in its efforts to go carbon-neutral. Do your bit for the future generations and install solar panels today. CNN Business reports that even manufacturers like Elon Musk’ Tesla are tempting customers with ""rock-bottom"" prices, for what used to be a premium technology. There has never been a better time to put your money on solar energy!"

6,Is Salvation Based On Grace Or Works?,social-issues," Some in the congregation in Galatia were hawking a principle of salvation by works. Paul asks and answers three sensation inquiries of those Galatians who were attempting to sell this precept. These three inquiries and their answers left their salvation by works message speechless. You recollect, obviously, that Paul accepted that Jesus' blood dealt with the transgression issue for mankind. Presently here are his three explosive inquiries and their undeniable answers. Question #1: ""Did the Galatians get the Spirit by crafted by the law or by the knowing about confidence?"" Galatians 3:2. At the end of the day, would you be able to work to get the Spirit or is that a result of accepting on Jesus and getting Him (by confidence) as your own hero? Obviously, getting the Spirit stops by confidence after accepting Jesus as friend in need. Works have nothing to do with it. Paul's rationale, at that point, powers the end that works of the law have nothing to do with the expulsion of our blame and sentiments of disgracefulness for our transgressions. This is exclusively through Jesus' blood which is God's incomparable demonstration of beauty. The blood of Jesus is appropriated by confidence and not by works by any stretch of the imagination Question #2: ""Since they began by the Spirit, what makes them figure they can change from the Spirit to the tissue to proceed with their Christian experience? What makes them figure they can change from the Spirit to the carnal works of the Law to complete out their Christian experience?"" Galatians 3:3. They can't. In this way, Jesus' blood, concerned us by the Spirit through confidence, will deal with our blame and shamefulness issue. Therefore, Christians who rest and trust in Jesus' blood will not be brought under subjugation for dishonor brought about by the blame of their transgressions. Subsequently, they won't let these sentiments of blame and disgracefulness meddle with God's endowments of recuperating, flourishing, family prosperity and salvation contained in the Abrahamic pledge for them. Question #3: ""Did the person who serves the Spirit to them and works marvels among them do these things by the becoming aware of confidence or by crafted by the law?"" Galatians 3:5. Obviously, he did these things by confidence and not by crafted by the law. Paul's rationale, here, powers the end that (1) since these Galatians got the Spirit by confidence and not by works of the Law, (2) since they can't change from the Spirit to works of the Law to keep up their Christian life and (3) since the ones serving the Spirit and works marvels among them keep on doing them by confidence and not by works of the Law, at that point neither can the Galatians self-assertively change from salvation by confidence in Jesus to salvation by works of the Law. Neither would they be able to endeavor to follow any blend of confidence and works. From the former, clearly Paul accepted that Jesus' blood dealt with everything. His blood was the finesse of God in real life. His blood dealt with the blame and sentiments of dishonor for every one of our transgressions. To add one thing to this superb recipe as any strict work that we should do to get our blame and shamefulness evacuated would void God's elegance and render Jesus' demise futile and negligible. Never let the fallen angel or his pack reveal to you that you can't have your Abrahamic gifts of recuperating, flourishing, family prosperity and salvation due to sentiments of blame and shamefulness."
7,Etiquette of Presenting Khata,social-issues," Presenting Khata is the most common Tibetan courtesy to show friendship and respect. In Tibet, it is customary to offer Khata for weddings, funeral, festivals, and receptions, for meetings with venerable elders, worshiping Buddha, and seeing somebody off. The action of presenting ""Khata"" varies from person to person. Generally speaking, it is necessary to hold the Khata with both hands, hold it high and level with the shoulder, then stretch forward and bend down to give it to the other party. At this time, Khata is level with the head, which shows respect to the other party and the greatest blessing -- good luck. The other party holds it with both hands in a respectful gesture. When presenting Khata to the elders, please raise your hands over your head, lean forward slightly and hold the Khata to the front of the seat or under your feet. For peers or subordinates, it can be tied around their necks. Offering Khata is so common in Tibet that even when people write to each other, they attach a small Khata in the envelope to express their blessing and greetings. It is particularly interesting that Tibetans take a few khatas with them for use when they go out, in case they meet relatives or friends who have been away for a long time. There is no historical data to find out which dynasty it originated from. There are many folk tales. One of them is that Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty went on a diplomatic mission to the western regions to pass Tibet and presented silk to the local tribal leaders. In this way, the Tibetan tribes think that this is a kind of etiquette to express friendship and blessing, and it is a great etiquette from the prosperous states in the Central Plains, so it has been used up to now. Later it was said that Khata was the ribbon of the fairy, and it symbolized holiness and supremacy. The people tried to imitate each other and gave Khata to each other, hoping that they would be happy. Offering ""Khata"" means to show purity, sincerity, loyalty, and respect to the other party. It means different things in different situations. On the festival day, people present Khata to each other to express congratulations on a happy day and a happy life. Presenting Khata at the wedding means wishing the newlyweds a mountain of love and growing old together; When greeting guests to offer Khata, to express a pious, pray for the blessing of the Bodhisattva; Offering Khata at a funeral is a sign of mourning and consolation for the deceased family. The Tibetan people entered the gate of the temple, first presented a Khata, and then visited the temples, and sat down. When you leave, put a Khata behind the seat you sat on to show that your heart is still there. Khata, transliteration of Tibetan. It's a kind of silk and cotton fabric. Most of them are white and blue. In addition, there are five colors of Khata, which are blue, white, yellow, green and red. Blue means blue sky, white is the white cloud, green is the river, red is the God of space protection, and yellow is the symbol of the earth. Colorful Khata is the most precious gift for Bodhisattva's and close relatives to make colorful arrows. It can only be used under specific circumstances."
8,Love: 7 golden rules to keep your relationship going,social-issues," Discover the golden rules in love to improve and optimize your pleasure, sexuality, confidence, and affection within the couple. Touch your lover to make your love relationship last The sense of touch releases endorphins in both the person who touches and the person who is touched. This hormone promotes well-being. So get into the habit of taking each other's hand while walking, touching each other's cheeks while kissing in the morning. Revive the little touching gestures you had in the beginning, such as a kiss on the ear, a hand in the hair, for example. Adding touch to your relationship will build a fortress of love that will make you more united and stronger in times of pressure. It is also proven that the closest the couples are, the more resistant they are to infidelity. To create this type of bond, start by supporting your partner as often as possible. You are a team. Keep his secrets as intact as possible, even if your friends in the office tell theirs. Except in an emergency, don't let anything interrupt your intimate moments with your partner. People will leave a message or come back to you later. Make a commitment together to spend at least 30 minutes a day talking about your days, goals and dreams. Build a real friendship with each other. Studies have shown that a couple who are also friends will make for a stronger, ""sexier"" relationship. Don't forget to make time for intimate moments, even if it means putting them on your calendar! Make small compliments or call your partner spontaneously. Be aware that it often takes several positive remarks to erase a single negative remark. So take the time to compliment your girlfriend on her new shoes or, conversely, make a positive comment about your boyfriend's new sweater. Take the time to call your spouse's office just for a quick hello and remember to thank often for the help you receive from your spouse and when you do, do it sincerely and look at each other in the eye. By doing so, you will not only make your spouse more attracted to you, but you will also make him or her happier. After all, your story probably began because you enjoyed these little things about each other. You will soon realize that it is nice to share these little moments of love. Work on yourself (don't blame your partner for what's wrong) It's easy to blame the other person when you feel angry, disappointed, betrayed or stressed. The danger is thinking that it is your partner who needs to change to make your relationship work. But the problem is not always the other person. Check to see if you are the toxic person in your relationship. Trying to get your partner to change puts him or her on the defensive mode and makes him or her see a negative version of yourself. The result? No one changes, no one takes charge of the relationship and everyone is unhappy. The real solution: change yourself. When you become aware of your own weaknesses and try to see the best in your partner, the magic happens and optimism takes over. Your partner will feel much better because he or she will feel appreciated and not punished. Both of you will feel more motivated to change the way you do things to bring more happiness to yourselves. Learn how to relax and change your attitude to help your relationship. The classic advice that all the experts give to singles looking for a soul mate? Be the one you want to attract. The same applies in the case of a long-term relationship. If you feel happy or fulfilled, your relationship will be a happy one too. The better you feel, the better your relationship will be. It will be easier to manage conflict. Find a relaxing activity that suits you. Whether it's 15 minutes of morning yoga, a new hobby that helps you let go, or cooking classes, positive emotions can only make you feel happier or happier and you'll have richer times together. Think about self-pleasuring on a regular basis - this is an aspect that creates much tension in relationships. Be fair and equitable during the quarrels to solidify your love relationship. Conflicts are a part of every relationship and are sometimes quite healthy. The important thing is how they are managed. A study conducted in Florida among long-term couples showed that being able to handle a conflict situation as a couple is a key factor in the success of 70% of the couples surveyed. With the right tools and the right attitude, arguments can become a path to deeper intimacy, a way to show yourself and the other person in their true light and to accept the other person in all their vulnerability and wholeness. Your union can only be strengthened by this. Stay away from criticism, confrontation and hostility. All these attitudes will only worsen the situation. Researchers at the University of California followed 79 couples for more than a decade and found that couples who divorced early frequently argued with each other and often did so defensively. Happy couples avoided verbalizing critical thoughts, kept discussions at a reasonable level, and did not use definitive terms such as ""never"" or ""always. When a fight breaks out, try to change the subject, use humor, empathy and show your partner your appreciation for him or her. Is it too late? Take a nap, go outside for some fresh air and come back to the discussion when you've both calmed down. Choose the right time to have a more serious discussion with your partner. Don't start a heated discussion if you are not rested or haven't eaten. Fatigue and hunger can cause you to make hateful remarks and let negative thoughts escape. Avoid drinking alcohol for the same reasons. Instead, wait until you can toast your reconciliation. Never try to resolve a conflict situation if you are distracted by something. Turn off the television, move your smartphone away from the room and turn off your computer. If you are disturbed by an outside factor, postpone the discussion. You won't be able to resolve anything while not completely focused on the problem. Listen more to your better half... and vice versa! What if there was only one thing you could do better to ensure a healthier relationship with your partner? Talk less and listen more. Blaming, insults, criticism, and blackmail never end well and create a difficult atmosphere to deal with. When the discussion turns into a fight, don't interrupt, wait before offering a solution or defending yourself too quickly. When it comes to emotions, they must be heard. Nod your head, rephrase what your spouse is saying to let him or her know that you are listening to him or her, and react briefly to what he or she says to show that you respect the feelings he or she expresses in words. Sometimes all we need to feel closer to someone is to listen to what they have to say. One last piece of advice in conclusion: did you usually wear something attractive in bed to please him or her? I Guess you keep wearing that old T-shirt with the holes in it? Feel free to spice up your look from time to time! Feeling good about yourself will brighten your looks and sparkle the flames in your partner's eyes. You'll start enjoying more intimate moments. You know how things work in men;s brains."

11,The major causes of yeast infections,social-issues," One may ask what yeast infection is? and what are the causes of yeast infections? Yeast infection, also called Candidacies is a fungal infection that ranges from superficial skin infections to life-threatening internal diseases. The most common type of yeast infection is caused by the yeast Candida albicans. There are numerous causes of yeast infections. Most people are prone to allergies from perfumed soaps and scents. It has been clinically proven that chemicals from such toiletries speed up yeast infections of vagina, mouth and penis. This occurs due to the moisturizing effect of these chemicals in combination with their restraining power on the germs that fight yeast infections. Diabetes patients are more prone to suffer yeast infection. The high swing in the levels of sugar in blood is highly likely to trigger an outbreak of yeast infection. For the same reason, diets with high amount of sugar and fat also magnify the risk of yeast infections. Similarly, pregnancy is a state of the body, when huge hormonal fluctuations continuously occur in the body. The composition of the blood chemistry keeps changing and this makes the body more susceptible to yeast infections. Although, Hormone Replacement Therapy improves one’s life by increasing the energy levels and quality of life, but this therapy highly increases the chances of yeast infections. Dependence upon antibiotics for a long time increases the chances of contracting yeast infections. Antibiotics have a dampening effect upon healthy germs in the body that control excess growth of yeast. Regular use of antibiotics results in an imbalance in the way different germs behave in the body and this can result in yeast germs to grow without any control. Other causes of yeast infections are bad personal hygiene and unprotected sex. A poor personal hygiene also prepares fertile grounds for yeast infection to set-in. irregularity in taking bath and wearing damp undergarments readily create an environment for outbreak of yeast infection. Yeast infection is highly contagious. One of the most likely ways of contracting this infection is by engaging in an unsafe sexual contact with a person already infected with it. The root cause of recurrent yeast infections can be traced to the presence of Candida yeast in our bodies from an early age. The natural defense of the body keeps this yeast from growing. But when due to some reason the natural defense fails to keep-up this control, it mutates into the infection causing fungus. Regular use of drugs to kill this fungus increases its immunity to the drug and this cycle of treatment and recurrence of fungus continues without any end. Hence, the effective way to cure this type of yeast infection is to eliminate the fungus completely from the body. There are many symptoms of yeast infections. In Oral Candidiasis, thick and white patches with red base are formed on the palate, tongue or inside the mouth. This symptom is accompanied with pain and makes it difficult to take food. Sometimes the infection appears on the skin in the form of small patches called satellite lesions accompanied with pain and itch. In vaginal yeast infection white thick discharge takes place along with irritation in the surrounding tissues. It is possible to cure yeast infections from their root. Although the process of completely removing yeast germs from the body takes a long time, but rather than continuing with present medication, consulting an experienced practitioner at any stage of the infection and diagnosing the causes of yeast infections is the best option. Otherwise, gradually with time the infection may take the form of chronic yeast infections."
12,Bullying in school,social-issues," BULLYING IN SCHOOL By Yakubu Umar Omede Bullying is an act that occurs through physical, verbal and in a situation where power difference is present. A situation where the individual bullying the other person is physically and mentally stronger than the victim. A person is being bullied when he or she is constantly exposed to negative actions on the part of one or more persons. Most children and adults are exposed to different forms of bullying due to the unequal balance of power and influence that is so common in youth relationships and peer groups. Bullying in schools has become an issue that has raised many concerns in the society. Typical school bully has become more nuanced in recent years. It could be that you are bullying me, and you are popular, and i am no popular, and that difference makes it difficult for me to defend myself. Bullying is about the wrong choice the bully makes, not some perceived fault from the victim. Often times, there are categories of children in school who are targets of bully. These are the type of kids that are::  Good at what they do, the creative and intelligent ones, ones with personal vulnerabilities, the ones with few or no Friends, the popular ones, the ones with illness or disabilities, people with different race etc. A lot of time, people in school will be bullied because they get lots of positive attention from people. This attention could be anything ranging from academic excellence, excelling in sports etc. Bullies target these type of people because they either feel inferior or they worry about being overshadowed by the target's abilities. As a result, they bully them and hoping to make them feel insecure. At school, these students go extra miles on school work, or they are fast learners and move through assignment and projects faster than the other students. They are often target for bullies. It has been noted that children who are disabled are disproportionately affected by bullying abuse. This can include children who has autism, down syndrome, dwarfism, asthma and any other type of health conditions are victims of bully Recently online, there has been a case of a 9 year old Australian school boy Quaden Bayles, who has been a victim of bully in his school because of his health condition(Dwarfism). His mother (Yarraka Bayles), posted a video of him on Facebook when he was crying because he was bullied in school. In my research, Quaden Bayles was diagnosed with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism when he was just three days old. He was seen crying uncontrollably in the video and in his mother's exact words, ""This is the impact that bullying has on a nine-year old kid that just want to go to school, get an education, and have fun, but every freaking day, something happens, another episode, another bullying, another taunt, another name calling"". While watching the video, i was so disturbed and was moved to tears seeing the negative impact bullying has on an individual. It could be seen and heard in that clip that Quaden made comments about taking his own life, asking for a knife to stab himself in the heart as he also tries to strangle himself. That is the effect bullying has. Bullying in school not only affects student's physical, emotional and psychological lives, it is also found to affect their academic achievements and their class works because children who are victimized experience negative emotional and psychological outcome that can inhibit their engagement in class and in turn affects their academic performance. Bullying can be associated with significantly serious problems. Children who bully are at greater risk for engaging in delinquent acts including violence inside and outside school, dropping out of school and so on. Research has shown that individual who are persistently subjected to bullying are at risk of stress related illness which can sometimes lead to suicide. Those who has been bullied can suffer from long term behavioral problems. It can cause depression, anxiety, low self esteem and can even cause illness. People who are bullied as children are at risk for having less of a supportive social network during adulthood and child victims of bully may have poorer physical health. Either being a bully or the victim of bullying increases the risk of engaging in self harm as well as having suicidal thoughts just like the Quaden Bayles case. However, the risk of suicide attempt seem to be higher for girl victims because they are emotionally fragile. Bullying has nothing other than negative impact on the person being bullied. In preventing this, parents who sense that their child is a subject of bully should take it seriously and encourage their child to talk about it. Remaining calm and reassuring them that he or she is not to blame for the victimization. For parents whose children bullies other people's children, they should talk to them and tell them about the effect it will have on the bullied kids and the consequences of their actions. Schools and individuals in the classroom should be supportive of all children to prevent bullying. Also, since low self esteem tends to be a risk factor for becoming a victim, interventions that promotes confidence and self esteem are important ways to reduce the risk of being bullied. It is important to build their confidence with activities ranging from sports, theatrical performance, engaging in discussion etc. Isolation is also a risk factor as a result of bullying, helping the person feel less alone by lending them a listening ear can go a long way towards preventing a person from being bullied. In conclusion, bullying in schools is a widespread issue around the world and no community is immune from this problem. Effective prevention bullying programs must define bullying in a clear way to the community, and include students, school staffs, and parents as its team. In order to have a peaceful and safe environment for students to learn, students must learn how to communicate with each other, resolve conflicts and learn to be empathetic to others.

14,Discover True Indulgence with Tantric Massages in Bayswater,social-issues," Bayswater is  one of the most cosmopolitan areas in the city of London. This area boasts of a  diverse population and it is a centre of non-stop activity. Bayswater has a  high concentration of hotels and restaurants.

It is also an  opportunity for you to get up, close and personal with the incredibly beautiful  masseuses that Bayswater is famous for. Here are some of the popular tantric  massage treatments that you can gift yourself. Classic tantric massage The classic  tantric massage therapy is one whose principles are deeply rooted in the  practices of tantra, which originated in the subcontinent of India. Traditional  tantric massage has a rich history and it goes back thousands of years. This  treatment is not like your normal massages, but with a twist. The therapy  starts like a regular massage where the masseuse concentrates on loosening all  the tight muscles in the body. She applies various relaxation massage  techniques in different pressure levels to help the muscles relax. But, she  does not stop there. She mixes relaxation techniques with arousal techniques so  that your body forgets all the stress whilst feeling sexually alive. The  tantric massage awakens the dormant sexual energy in the body and helps it flow  within the body. So, the occasional brush of the masseuse’s hands against your  genitals and balls is normal. The masseuse  will take you to the edge, but bring you back. However, finally, she will allow  you to release yourself and the feeling will be better than having sex. The  orgasm will feel like all your burden and stress has been let out of your body,  and you can finally take a deep breath and go to sleep. Roleplay tantric massage Ever since  tantric massage has made its way into the Western world, people have taken  liberties to experiment with it. Roleplay tantric massage is the result of one  of those experiments. By adding  the element of roleplay into a tantric  massage in Bayswater session,  the massage therapist will heighten your excitement. Even though sexual  intercourse is not part of the session, you can explore your other fantasies.  For instance, you might have fantasised being touched by your junior school  headmistress. Your chosen masseuse can dress like her and give you the massage. The  character that you would want your masseuse to play is entirely your call. She  can dress as a nurse, a policewoman, a French maid or even something out of a  superhero movie. Domination tantric massage All the  elements of a tantric massage mixed with a bit of BDSM is what domination  tantric massage feels like. The massage therapist will play the role of a  dominatrix and dominate you throughout the massage session. You will have to  give up control and allow her to touch you in ways that you have only thought  about in your dreams. She might even tie a blindfold around your eyes or tie  your hands to make the domination scene seem real. So, what  mood are you in? If it is only relaxation and a bit of excitement is what you  want, a classic tantric should be enough.

The list has a number of criteria and a number of other things that can help women to get rid of unplanned pregnancy and also help to avoid the complications involved in it. Women who do prefer to make use of the termination pills to get the pregnancy terminated can safely make use of the pills and get the pregnancy terminated. Women who do not wish to continue the pregnancy can opt to purchase online abortion pills and get the pregnancy terminated. Women who wish to have a medical abortion can simply opt to make use of Mifepristone and Cytotec pill. This termination pill works so that it can help women to get the pregnancy terminated. These pills are used as per the instruction and this helps the patient to get successful results of having an abortion.

The use of Mifepristone and Misoprostol pill are done one after the other and this helps the patient to get the pregnancy terminated effectively. Mifepristone is the first pill that is used and this is a med that can be used alone if the gestation period is up to 7 weeks and can be used in combination if the gestation period is up to 9 weeks. Mifepristone is an anti-progesterone pill which is used so that it can help to block the growth of the embryo. Once the growth of the embryo is been blocked it helps the fetus to get separated from the uterus. If women are prescribed to make use of the Mifepristone pill then she needs to use 3 pills of this med and if is used in combination then 1 pill of this abortion pill is required.

Even at times having sexual intimacy after having an abortion can lead to pregnancy. Hence most of the women are asked that they do avoid indulging in sexual intimacy."
16,3 Philosophical Questions We Should Ask Ourselves Regularly,social-issues," Specifically because our time here among the living is by default limited, we should examine our lives every now and then, question our current progress (if we're making any), and see for ourselves through contemplation, whether or not our limited time here is being wasted or is being well-invested. As a matter of fact, even, what drove me to become a philosopher is to increase my productivity as a writer, something which was a good choice, when I look at it retrospectively. Anyways, here are the questions. Feel free to memorize them and set a time once in a while to ask yourselves these questions, and check if you're making progress towards whatever one or more ambitions you've vowed to accomplish. · Take away everything you don’t need, and there shall be less unnecessary suffocating. · Some of your possessions could be used by people that actually need them and they are deprived of. · Experience is there for knowledge and development. If you know something without experiencing it, and contemplating on it have contributed to your growth as a person, then experiencing it can be discarded. · Wanting something you don’t have can create unnecessary frustration. Even if you may attain it, the frustration can potentially stay and be directed to the next thing you lack. It is a cycle of waste, and waste isn’t needed. · Learn to even your needs with your wants. In that way, fulfillment of needs can bring much satisfaction and serenity. · If you are to decide to discard one or more objects from your life, make sure to check if their discarding has really made any significant change in your lifestyle, beyond their visual disappearance. · To create something is to embody yourself in it. When you produce something of your own, it can ""extend"" your life after your death. It can stay for centuries and be consumed by others for their own development in the journeys of the living. · All people have talents, and talents are there to be used. When they are not used, they decrease in their potential, like a plant which hadn’t watered for a long time. You don’t have to use your all talents, and using one or two is enough to develop for your growth. · Being productive can lead to a satisfying and meaningful life. Humans are need to be doing things, to keep themselves occupied, and when this need is deprived, then harm comes forth, even if it is unseen at first. It grows like a virus. · Your time in your biological existence can be used otherwise than non-productivity. Be active and actualize yourself how much you are able and not feel exhausted enough to rest. · Even with all the potential and actualized productivity, rest should be embraced, for it can make one’s productivity with additional quality. · It can be in your workplace or in your time of leisure. You are more than your work like you are more than your free time. · Even basic jobs can be of the highest significance to the functionality of the workplace. This is why even jobs with less luxury are evenly, if not more, important than those that guarantee social admiration. · There are points in RPG games where once you arrive at some area, you cannot return to the previous places in the game. These are points of no return. Sometime they are predicted, and sometimes they come by surprise. Make sure you have done everything you felt or thought you needed to be doing, For death can arrive without caution, anywhere, anytime. · Your time is temporary. You cannot live the same days for eternity. One day, your character in the environment where you are being on a regular basis, may disappear from the view. Make sure you are aware of that even if you are young, because no one is completely safe from Death, not even the younger. · This question also applies to the deaths of others. Are you prepared for the death of those who are dear to you, older or younger? Are you prepared for the possibility one or more of them has a relative chance to permanently vanish from your life? Do you have a plan as to what to do afterwards, beyond your own rehabilitation? I hope I've helped you to better value your life and the lives of those who are dear to you, by taking the time to read this article. With enough determination and introspection, you too could change your life for the better by asking yourself these three questions."
17,On Honesty,social-issues," Honesty is a form of bravery; it’s the courage to speak up your truth while not being intimidated by what it that expression may lead to due to the response of others. It’s a risk that we take to either be more understood by others or as a form of catharsis, of relieving oneself out of a burden they have yet to confess about. Depending on what the content of the honest expression is, the response to it may change in accordance to the nature of the people and in accordance to how they receive and understand your honest words. Regardless, honesty is usually very appreciated trait in a person, because people usually appreciate honesty and disdain from intentional pretentiousness. There are, however, cases where honesty can work against your benefit if your honest words may make the environment cause you harm of any sort, depending of course on the environment at hand. Therefore, even if pretentiousness is disdained, there are, unfortunately, cases where it’s better to tell a ""white lie"" than the truth. North Korea, for example, forces its citizenry to admire and glorify the current supreme leader of the country, and whenever that leader dies, they are forced to cry, even if they don’t really admire the leader and even if they don’t really feel like crying. In such country those who are honest against what the system dictates to say and behave, they are likely to either be executed or be sent to a concentration camp. If I’m not mistaken, their families also receive punishment. And while most of us don’t have to suffer the punishment of honesty that is against the ""system"", there are still, unfortunately, cases where the honest person is either bullied, stalked, harassed, whether it’s online or in real life, and even be the victim of death threats from anonymous callers, simply for expressing their personal truths. Therefore there are some people who won’t go as far as expressing their thoughts and opinions in public, as they either fear or don’t want to be victimized and/or be put to shame by those who don’t want people that think differently than them in their own and their society’s lives. The various possibilities of consequences can indeed show in theory that honesty is a form of bravery, whether that bravery is smart or counter-productive. It’s an interpersonal bravery to put your words out there and risk being on the receiving end of a toxic treatment, whether you’re in a totalitarian dictatorship, in a democracy, or on the internet. However, as long as you’ll surround yourself with caring, tolerant and non-dangerous people, as much as you realistically can, you can increase the possibility that others will appreciate you for being honest with them and with yourself, rather than being cursed or bullied by those who dislike honesty that goes against their own, at least according to them."
18,Real Life Hero - Sabin Barto,social-issues," The fiery crash on a warm Florida evening on July 4, 2012 left an unconscious man trapped in his burning car. Seemingly out of nowhere, a figure plunged out of the darkness through a sheet of flames to rip open the door and carry the driver to safety just moments before the car exploded. Like a scene from a movie, the Independence Day hero retreated to the shadows of obscurity, but it wouldn't be the last time he would help someone in danger. A modest man, Sabin Barto, doesn't talk much about his 10+ years in the U.S. Navy. He spends his post-military career selling real estate in Florida, writing children's books, developing a website devoted to saving the Everglades' habitat, and getting kids engaged in environmentalism. He seems like a pretty nice, normal guy, but his neighbors and friends claim he is a real-life Captain America with superhero strength and courage. Captain America, because his heroics always seem to kick in on the 4th of July, or within a few hours thereof. On July 3, 2016, in Naples, Florida, Barto witnessed a car crash while driving home with his daughter from a fireworks celebration with some friends. As Sabin exited his vehicle to assist the driver and passengers, a lone female police officer who had been chasing them arrived on scene. Weapon drawn, she shouted at the passenger who tried to flee to get on the ground. Surmising that this was a criminal suspect, Barto saw the driver exit and run, to which he sprang into action, grabbed the driver and held him on the ground so that the officer could properly handcuff him after apprehending the passenger. Barto stayed with the officer until her backup arrived. Like a superhero, Sabin Barto seems to have a knack for being in the right place at the right time. That exploding car incident in 2012 took place right in front of his house. This all brings to mind the nature of extraordinary heroism, which often expresses itself in emergencies and difficult circumstances. While most of us flinch and flee from danger, a few, like the men and women who make up local police departments across the country, dash headlong into the jaws of possible death to save a stranger. At a time when we are compelled to remind people that Blue Lives Matter, it's bracing to know that American Exceptionalism also finds a home in the muscle, hearts and minds of Americans like Sabin Barto."
19,The Best Ways to Get a Job [Research-Based],social-issues," There is a stark difference between how most job seekers prefer to apply for roles and the way most successful applicants end up getting hired. Looking for a job can be overwhelming - especially if you were recently laid off, are looking for your first job out of college, or aren’t currently employed. Before you start aggressively sending out copies your resume, let’s stop to consider what strategy is actually the most effective in landing people jobs. First, we’ll look at what research shows about job seeker application preferences in more detail. Then, we’ll look at the statistics on how most applicants actually got hired. You may be surprised by the findings, and hopefully, they encourage you to think twice about your application strategy! PREFERRED WAYS TO APPLY FOR A JOB, ACCORDING TO JOB SEEKERS According to Glassdoor research, 51% of job seekers say they prefer to find opportunities online, and 35% of candidates say they prefer to apply for positions via their phone. These statistics make sense, as desktop and mobile are, after all, the easiest and most convenient methods! Jobvite’s 2019 Recruiting Benchmark Report shares interesting statistics on where job applications actually come from. Jobvite analyzed over 13 million applications and reported that ""from a pure volume perspective, 2019 shows that most applicants still come from career websites and job boards, followed by referrals."" Job boards and career sites accounted for 84.3% of all applications: 49.3% of applications came from job boards 34.9% of applications came from career sites Referrals were the third-highest source of applications, making up just 2.63%! WHO ACTUALLY GETS HIRED We know that most candidates apply for jobs online, but which applicants end up getting offers? Is applying to jobs online an effective use of your time? 212,875 of the 13 million applicants Jobvite analyzed were ultimately hired. Of these 212,875 hires, the following number originally applied via: Career Sites - 69,502 Job Boards - 45,928 Recruiters - 31,172 Referrals - 29,458 Internal Candidates - 19,242 Hiring Managers - 6,425 However, as Jobvite explains, ""looking only at the absolute numbers can be misleading if you are trying to find the most effective source."" The report confirms what we already suspected from anecdotal data: ""The sources that deliver the highest percentage of applicants don’t necessarily translate to the highest percentage of hires. After all, it’s not about the quantity of candidates, but the quality of hires."" Let's simply look at what percentage of applicants from each source were actually hired (the total number of hires divided by total number of applications for each category): Hiring Managers - 32.5% Internal Candidates - 25.9% Recruiters - 14.1% Referrals - 7.8% Career Sites - 1.4% Job Boards - 0.7% To put these figures into perspective, Harvard's acceptance rate for the class of 2023 was 5.3%. Your odds of getting into Harvard are higher than your odds of getting a job via a career site or a job board! WHAT THIS RESEARCH MEANS FOR YOU The Jobvite data clearly shows that you are significantly more likely to get hired if you apply for a job through a hiring manager or recruiter at the company. If you have been applying to jobs online and aren’t hearing back, perhaps it’s time to reconsider your application strategy! Instead of submitting your application online and passively waiting for a response, why not dig deeper? Questions to consider include: Who is the hiring manager (or leader) of the department that you applied for a job with? Can you find them on LinkedIn and send a quick introduction? Who is the internal recruiter at the company dealing with the job posting? Can you find their email address or phone number? Do you know anyone who works at the company who may be able to refer you? Due to the high volume of applications and low hiring rates for candidates who apply online, it's also important to optimize your resume for applicant tracking systems if you plan to do so."
20,Social Phobia,social-issues," My dad and his partner came over to visit yesterday. My dog grabbed something out of the bin (as he tries to do about 30 times per day) not long after they arrived so I shouted ""No!"" and he left it. My dad’s partner then said (talking to my dog rather than to me) that if my dog belonged to him and he went into a cupboard he would ""smack your a*** and you would never do it again"". I was really angered by this but was not sure how to respond. My dad then responded jokingly to his partner ""Hmmm, maybe I should try that with you then"", so I just said ""Yeah, I was gonna say…"" I actually wanted to say ""Well it’s a good thing he’s not your dog because he’d probably have some serious aggression issues"". I witnessed first-hand increased aggression in the beagle (i.e. one of the most placid dog breeds of all – hence why they were unfortunately used in animal testing laboratories) we had when I was a kid after he had been repeatedly hit/ mistreated by my dad, and this was a dog we’d raised from a puppy and knew the full life history of. I know things would be far worse with my rescue dog, whose puppyhood we know nothing of, and who seems from his behaviour to have been hit or mistreated in the past. I’ve witnessed an almost immediate increase in aggression from him after the few times that my mum has smacked him – he’s bared his teeth a couple of times after she told him off and once snapped at her (he didn’t bite her, he just snapped at the air in front of her, if you see what I mean). He doesn’t do this with me when I tell him off, but my parents apparently can’t see the connection. I’m just so fed up of my dad’s partner constantly undermining me. I worry that if I ever have children, he’ll make similar comments about my parenting. And what annoys me even more is that he has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about. His knowledge of dog training appears to have been taken from a few episodes of Cesar Millan (i.e. someone with no formal qualifications in canine behaviour and who backs his methods on long outdated theory). Unsurprisingly, my dad’s partner seems to be a big believer in ""dominance/ alpha dog"" theory*, which was based on behavioural observations of wolves in unnatural conditions and of which there has been no evidence in more recent studies of wolves in natural settings. Any dog trainer/ behavioural expert nowadays who actually has qualifications and uses an evidence-based approach will tell you much the same. Furthermore, although dogs are descended from wolves, humans domesticated them around 15,000 years ago and we have changed their behaviour considerably since then. The wolves from which dogs originated were also probably quite different from modern wolves. Honestly, I could write an essay on this but that’s not what this blog is for. I’ve included a bibliography at the end, on the off chance that anyone is as much of a nerd about this as I am. (I’ve included mostly web sources and haven’t done formal referencing because I think it’s more important that this information is accessible to everyone) Maybe you’re wondering why this topic is such a big deal for me/ makes me so angry. The answer is that so many people misunderstand their dog’s behaviour/ motivation as a result of outdated theory (popularised by certain TV shows) and think that they have to use aversive training methods to show their dog who’s boss. This greatly damages the dog – owner bond. The majority of trainers/ behavioural experts today are against the physical punishment of dogs for this very reason. *This was based on the observations of groups of unrelated captive wolves in Swiss zoos in the 1930s. Often only single animals could be obtained from the wild and these were then grouped together in captivity to form a ""pack"". This is very different from wolf packs in the wild, which simply consist of the ""alpha"" (breeding) pair and their offspring. Futhermore, zoos (especially in the 1930s) obviously restrict the movement of animals so they cannot run away/ form separate territories so the wolves had no choice but to interact aggressively with one another. I can’t remember how it came up but my parents and their partners then started talking about the London terror attack which happened a couple of days ago. My dad’s partner has been discriminatory towards eastern Europeans before and my mum mentioned that one of members of the public who confronted the attacker was Polish. So naturally he then went on a racist rant about Muslims instead. I’d had enough of him by this point and just did the dishes then went to my room to get away from him. In the evening, my mum and stepdad were pretty much having a counselling session at the dinner table, with my stepdad saying that his stepmum used to tell him he’d be a ""loser"", a ""waster"" and ""amount to nothing"" if he didn’t study and do well in his high school exams. My stepdad then said to me that my siblings and I should feel so lucky that we’ve had such supportive and encouraging parents who never said anything like that to us/ verbally abused us in any way. I kind of just ignored him and went back to my studying. I felt like screaming at them that I’ve tried to tell them before exactly how my dad treated me when I was younger, but they just brushed it off and in essence said that I was lying/ exaggerating things. I felt like I really wanted to say something about it but I didn’t want to say something I’d regret, so I said nothing. I’d like to say to them that I don’t think being called ""selfish"", ""pathetic"", ""fat"", unpleasant to be around, or being told that I’m so horrible it’s no wonder I had no friends/ that my own father will be glad to no longer be around my siblings and I, by my dad really counts as either supportive or encouraging! I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. Am I being the unreasonable one? It just feels that with my dad’s partner frequently undermining me and my parents and stepdad acting as if there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, and denying that the past (re: my dad) happened, I keep being worn down. On the one hand, I’m starting to feel like maybe I should just start voicing my own opinions/ knowledge (especially if my dad’s partner is just going to disagree with me no matter what I say) because I am absolutely sick of constantly biting my tongue and walking on eggshells around him. On the other hand, I’m hoping that at this point, it’s only a matter of months until I’m able to move out, though I don’t want to build up too much hope because something will inevitability come up and complicate everything. I’m starting to worry that if I ever bring it up, I will cease to have any kind of relationship with my parents and their partners, and then my siblings may also stop talking to me if I’m made out to be the bad person. Maybe I’m catastrophising a bit, but that’s the worry. I know there are people who have been through far worse abuse (I still feel weird calling it that) than I have (my own mother included), but I’m starting to realise how family dynamics are so often set up to protect the abuser and to discount or blame the victim."

1,Why Try a Tantric Massage in London?,social-issues," London is a  city of adventure where you can come to fulfil your secret desires and  fantasies. The streets of London are peppered with agencies and establishments  that cater to the cravings of men and women. One of the most popular activities  of people in this city is getting a massage and it is easy to understand why.  Life in the city is not a bed of roses and running the rat race quickly takes a  toll on one’s health. This is where relaxing massages come to the rescue. Now, if you  go around London, you will be tempted to try out a number of different types of  massages. There is the very popular Nuru massage that has gained importance  across the world after being introduced in Japan. This is a slippery massage  that might intrigue your imagination as this rubdown is performed naked by a  hot masseuse. The body to body massage also uses similar techniques, but B2B is  not a slippery rubdown treatment. However, if  you are a first-timer, you should start slow and get yourself used to the idea  of erotic massages before venturing to more risque treatments. The best place  to start is by trying a tantric massage in London. Here’s why you should give  this rubdown therapy a try and what makes this treatment so different from the  traditional massages. Tantric massage - a sensual approach In normal  massages, the focus of the therapists is only to soothe the tense muscles in  the back, legs, arms, chest and shoulders. These therapists do not take into  consideration one’s emotional, mental and sexual health. On the other hand, a  tantric massage is a holistic approach where the entire body is treated to  allow it to heal and rejuvenate. A tantric  therapist will ease out the knots in your body before stimulating your  erogenous zones. Titillating your senses is a part of the tantric therapy. The  massage techniques used during this therapy are gentle, long strokes and the  masseuse takes her time to get familiar with the body of the recipient. She  also teaches certain breathing techniques, which the recipient can use at a  later time, especially during an intimate encounter. Once a  tantric session ends, the recipient is expected to experience a full-body  orgasmic experience where not only his physical strength is restored, but he is  able to find mental peace and his sexual health improves manifold. This is  where tantric massage differs from normal massage. Tantric therapy eliminates inhibitions If you lack  self-confidence, a normal massage is not what you need. You need something  stronger like, a tantric massage in London. A tantric masseuse will touch  every inch of you in a sensual manner and make you feel confident of your body.  Her caressing touch will make you feel comfortable and give you the chance to  explore the contours of your body as she slowly takes her fingers along the lines  of your body. This will help you in creating long-lasting intimate  relationships. It will also make you more confident in bed and you will be able  to impress your partner with your newfound sexual prowess. Benefits of tantric treatment Unlike  normal massages, tantric therapy offers benefits that are not just physical.  Take a look below. Recipients  experience the ultimate relaxation and comfort Muscle pains  dissipate Self-confidence is  restored and stress is eliminated, which leads to the prevention of various  sexual problems like, immature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction The kundalini  energy within the body is liberated and made to flow throughout the body A new spiritual and  emotional enlightenment is attained through regular tantric massage So, these are some of  the reasons why you should consider getting a tantric massage when in London.  The most important reason is, however, the fact that tantric massages are  performed by massage therapists who are not just skilled in the art, but look  amazing and have salacious assets. This massage service is offered discreetly  and at affordable rates."
2,Reasons why Dating for Introverts Seems Like a Herculean Task,social-issues," Going out on a date send jitters to many. The constant thought in what way the date would go and how the person on the other end would be can be baffling for individuals. For introverts, it is even more difficult and cumbersome since these people take more time than extroverts to uncoil and be themselves or rather be social. Dating for introverts seems hard because they tend to keep to themselves and the thought of going out with a stranger terrorises their minds. They prefer staying indoors and indulge in meaningful conversations rather than going out and exhaust minds with small talks. Here is a brief introduction to the causes that elaborates why dating is hard for introverts. Reasons why dating for introvert appears difficult Introverts before giving a nod to date have to deal with multiple apprehensions in mind. These anxieties kick in only when they have had a bitter experience in the past or have been narrated similar stories of failed dating pursuits. Tendencies and fears among them that makes dating for introverts a problematic task are mentioned below: 1.Aversion towards small talks – Introverts if once starts exchanging conversations, that means he/she has started to develop interest and is keen to make a meaningful conversation. On the other hand, if the person on the other end is more into engaging in small talks, leaves an introvert with a feeling of unfinishedness. Introverts feel every short conversation leads to a dull ending, making them fatigued. 2.Shallow conversations – Chats and discussions that are dull and meaningless can turn out to be deal-breaker for introverts. They worship a conversation that encompasses diverse topics and thoughts, leading to the unravelling of ideas. An introvert takes a liking towards people who can talk about anything under the sun without any hesitation. 3.Lacks of understanding – Extroverts often fail to understand introverts and term them as self-centred or self-absorbed. They consider their unwillingness and arrogance and coyness as rude behaviour. Since introverts find their best match in a person who bears similar thinking, there are few introvert dating website who help meet their right counterparts. 4.Overthinking – The most persistent factor why introverts shy away from a date is the trait of overthinking. There is a constant conflict of ""If’s and but’s"" in their head arousing more confusion and self-doubt. They cultivate this firm belief that why ""would anybody like to date them?"" Furthermore, introverts are unpredictable; they are overly sensitive to things that can debar them from socialising easily. For a date to go well the introvert has to be in the right mood, only then they can be at the best of their self. However, with the introduction of the introvert dating website, finding like-minded dates for these people have now become more natural. Since introverts themselves conceptualise the policies, benefits and features of these sites, here people find allies with genuine and compatible connections."

5,What are the benefits of camping?,social-issues," There are many reasons to go camping and the reasons are not the same for everyone. Some people crave the opportunity to connect with nature and get away from the constant presence of technology. For families it can be a great way to reconnect with each other and revitalize relationships. For young people it's a great way of learning new skills, independence and resilience. Here is a short list of some of the main benefits of going camping: Connecting with Nature Camping is a completely involved experience, whether you're sleeping in a tent in the wild or just parking up your RV at a campground. When you're camping you'll feel all the elements, and you will witness the best wildlife in natural settings. You'll have the opportunity to see everything: forests, mountains, rivers, beaches and sand dunes, and one of the best benefits of all is being able to see skies full of stars. Many constellations only become visible when you get away from inhabited areas and into the wild. You'll also hear all the wonderful sounds of nature, like the hooting of an owl at night or the beautiful birdsong of a fresh morning. Health Benefits Camping is incredibly good for your mental and physical health. There's no doubt that there are plenty of physical demands that help you keep fit, like hiking and pitching a tent.

Sleeping outside under the light of the stars helps to re-establish the body's natural rhythms which can drastically improve health. A Break from Technology This is becoming increasingly relevant in modern times, and it has been called the 'Digital Detox.' Most places in the wild have little or no cell connectivity, and even many campgrounds are poorly connected. This presents the perfect opportunity to forget our devices and break our addictions to technology. This offers a great chance to enjoy other activities that we may have forgotten about, such as reading a nice book or writing a diary. Some people find that having the space to be with themselves in silence is immensely beneficial. Revitalize Relationships Following on from the digital detox, another benefit of being free from the usual routines and technology is that stagnant relationships can start to flourish again. Instead of being entertained and occupied by technology, people start to have conversations face-to-face and do real activities together. This enables authentic shared memories to be created, which is so valuable. Development of Skills Camping demands resilience and creativity from individuals as they need to perform rigorous tasks to satisfy basic needs. This means doing things like fire building, shelter construction and purification of water. On one level these are survival skills only, but if you look deeper it becomes evident that more profound benefits are occurring. Doing these things builds self esteem and confidence too."

7,Enter the World of Kink by Knowing What is BDSM,social-issues," You must have heard about BDSM or gained an idea about the kinky world  of domination through books, TV series and films. Fifty Shades of Grey is one such movie series that deal with this  subject. However, you cannot base your understanding of BDSM by watching this  movie series alone as it does not give a genuine depiction of what the kinky  world really stands for. This movie series, in fact, shows a fantastical  version of kink where consent and safety are given little importance. The actual world of kink is safe, consensual and responsible. It is  considerate towards the physical well-being of both partners and creates clear  boundaries between play time and the real world. It is a space where women can  dominate men and cuddle afterwards. If you are still thinking what is BDSM, below given is everything  that you need to know. What does BDSM  stand for? BDSM means bondage-discipline, dominance-submission and  sadism-masochism. Basically, BDSM is an umbrella term for various kinds of  sexual activities that are anything, but vanilla. This kind of power play  happens between two consenting adults and nothing takes care unless both the  partners agree. BDSM is a wide  range of activities Generally speaking, BDSM has two prominent roles - a dominant and a  submissive. It is the dominant who holds responsibility and power over a  submissive. They may have demands like, asking for a foot massage or proceed to  tie up and spank their submissive or sub. Meanwhile, the sub is the receiving  end. They are the ones who get beaten, whipped and forced into doing things  like, giving a foot massage or licking the boots. Submissives enjoy being  treated like trash and it excites them when they are humiliated. In a dominant-submissive relationship, there can be various kinds of  sexual activities. Majority of times, such relationships do not include sex.  For instance, slaves are simply happy to make their dominatrix goddess satisfied  and provided for. The smile of their dominatrix is what they crave for or maybe  the chance to lie down in the same bed as the domme. It is these little rewards  that push the slave to cater to every need of his mistress. In case your partner is not into BDSM and do not wish to explore the  world of kink, you can always turn to professional mistresses. You can get into  a relationship with them and in those few hours, you can explore the side that  you keep hidden. You can try out various activities like, orgasm control,  breath play, impact play and so on. The session can include a lot of hard  spanking and beating if you enjoy the pain. BDSM is always  consensual When it comes to BDSM, the most basic thing to remember is that BDSM is  always consensual. So, if someone is being put in a cage or has a dog collar  around his neck, it is because he has consented to it. Whatever happens in the  dungeon of the dominatrix is discussed and explained to the submissive before  the play begins. Whilst in the scene, the dominatrix will not listen to  anything that the submissive has to say. However, to ensure that the scene is safe, BDSM requires that both the  dominant and the sub decide on a safe word. Only the use of the safe word would  mean that the submissive wants out or wants the dominatrix to stop. Without the  use of this safe word, it is difficult for the dominatrix to know if the sub is  enjoying the session or feeling uncomfortable. But, make sure that the safe  word is something out-of-the-box and not common words like, stop or something. So, now that you know what is BDSM, it is time to put your  newfound knowledge to test. Book an appointment with a dominatrix and explore  the kinky world. Test your limits and find out what really turns you on."

9,10 Most Practiced Economic Activities in Vietnam,social-issues," Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing and largest economies in the world. Though the Vietnam war had crippled it, it's presently expanding at an excess rate of 7% annually. Reportedly, it is the 45th largest economy in the world based on the Nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), it comes to number 33 in the world. Here are some of the most practiced economic activities in Vietnam. Vietnam has abundant reserves of iron ore, chromium ore, barite, gold, and tin. Also, anthracite coal, lead, lime, zinc, and phosphates. Petroleum is Vietnam’s leading source of energy. Coal comes second, contributing approximately 25% of the country's energy. Coal production is presently a critical activity in the mining industry. There are plenty of offshore oil deposits on Vietnam’s southern coast. As a result, crude petroleum production has greatly increased. Also, there has been tremendous growth in natural gas production, especially since 1995. Food processing is the primary manufacturing activity in Vietnam's economy. Other key sectors are electronics, textiles, footwear, tobacco, and cigarettes. The availability of cheap labor has made Vietnam a manufacturing hub for Japanese and Korean firms. Agriculture is the backbone of Vietnam’s economy. Reports indicate that more than half of Vietnam’s population earn their living from agriculture. The main agricultural areas in Vietnam are Mekong River delta, Red River delta, and the southern terrace region. Rice is the primary food crop, and it’s mainly grown in the deltas. Other major food crops grown here include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and nuts. Agriculture is mainly labor-intensive, and water buffalos are still used for plowing. In the central highlands, the main crops grown are coffee and tea. Vietnam's land transport network is growing broader and better. The government is investing heavily in highways and railway lines. Also, in the delta regions, local transportation has been greatly enhanced for navigable rivers and canals. There are also significant improvements in seaports and international airports. There are great advancements to cellular phone services and the internet. The main seafood in Vietnam are shrimps, lobsters, squids, and crabs. The seafood is not only used for local consumption but also for export. There are plenty of freshwater fisheries on the plains of the Mekong river and also Champasak. Forestry, on the other hand, is a significant economic activity, mainly serving the domestic market. There are plenty of companies that produce plywoods, furniture, lumber, paper, and pulp. Charcoal production also has major economic gains in Vietnam. Vietnamese citizens and foreigners who have gained residence therein are mandated to progressive taxation. Also, non-resident foreigners pay a fixed rate of tax on any income they earn in Vietnam. Other forms of taxes are Value-added tax, corporate income tax, export, and import tariffs. In the mid-1990s, demand for electricity by the locals surpassed Vietnam’s ability to supply. However, after the construction of new hydroelectric plants, power supply stabilized. Currently, rural electrification has been well implemented, supplying very many households with electricity. Initially, the Vietnam government operated a monopoly bank, State Bank of Vietnam. Over time, there have been notable changes in the banking sector that have immensely boosted foreign trade. There are plenty of foreign commercial banks that are fully functional in Vietnam. The Soviet Union and eastern Europe communist countries are the greatest trading partners of Vietnam. Also, Vietnam is a member of the World Trade Organization. As a result, the country has had drastic economic improvements over the years. Formerly the service sector in Vietnam was neglected under central planning. However, it is now booming and accounts for one-fourth of the total employment. The main sectors under service area; tourism, marketing, processing, assembly, scientific research, and design."
10,9 Types of Economic Industries Found in Vietnam,social-issues," Having worked its way up, Vietnam is now in the game with other known big giants as a competitor due to the rising standards of their economy. The country has engaged itself in a variety of industries that have seen it reach where it is now. Among the many industries include the electronics industry, food processing and others. This article discusses the main economic industries in Vietnam. Electronics industry The need for electronics globally rises rapidly with each passing year. Vietnam has taken the opportunity to invest in this industry. Although other foreign giants like Samsung and LG play a huge role in the industry, Vietnam still has benefited from it as the companies employ the locals. Food processing industry This ever-growing industry has the responsibility of meeting the demands of both local and international markets. It consists mainly of agricultural and sea products that are processed, canned, then exported, or used locally. The industry contributes to an approximate 15% of the country's Gross Domestic Product. The abundant flow of the raw materials has seen Vietnam earn itself a place among the top food processing countries in the world. Construction industry In any country, the economy is characterized by the development of infrastructure. The increasing appetite for foreigners to invest in the construction industry has seen it thrive in Vietnam. The construction of offices, company warehouses, and apartments has led to this industry, contributing to over 39% of the Gross Domestic Product. Mining industry Natural resources are the stronghold of Vietnam. Responsible for over 8.1% of the country's GDP, the mining industry plays a crucial role in the economy of Vietnam. Under the Vietnamese soil lies over 5000 deposits of minerals that are of high demand globally, answering the question of why this particular industry is thriving. Service and tourism industry Vietnam is home to the top 25 tourist destinations in the world. By attracting an increasing number of tourists each year, the industry plays a crucial role in the development of Vietnam’s economy. The tourist and service industry consist of hotel and transport services. The industry contributes to over 38% of the country's GDP. Banking and Finance industry The government owns the largest banks in Vietnam, which has seen the sector play a considerable role in Vietnam's economy.

Textile industry This industry is on its way up, thanks to the agreements between Vietnam and several other countries. Today, Vietnam has over 6000 textile industries, which had resulted in the employment of over 2.5 million locals. Chemical fertilizer industry The chemical fertilizer industry has its place well marked in the Vietnamese economy. The industry is valued at over 1709million USD last year, and it is expected to rise in the coming years. It can be concluded that the industry also has a considerable share of responsibility in the country's economic development. Oil and gas industry The oil and gas industry has also been a pillar of the economy of Vietnam. Earning over 17 billion dollars since it's the first drill, the industry is rising each year gradually. The rise has seen it contributing 1 billion dollars in the country's budget each financial year. Apart from revenue gains, Vietnam’s economic industries have provided employment and development of social amenities in the country. Vietnam now sits at the table with other prosperous countries in the world."
11,5 Mineral Resources Found in Vietnam,social-issues," A country that is known to be full of life, vibrant energy, and profound exquisiteness Vietnam has seen itself earn a seat among the best countries globally.  Vietnam minerals have also played a key role in the country’s growth. Stuck in the heart of South Asia, Vietnam has an abundant flow of natural resources that, as a result, see its citizens being spoilt for choice when it comes to employment opportunities. Among the five primary natural resources include coal, bauxite, oil, petroleum, and gas. The mining activities overseen by the country's Ministry of Natural resources and Environment has mostly contributed to it's Gross Domestic Product's (GDP) over the years. The war in Vietnam prevented these resources from being fully exploited. However, the government, in alliance with countries like Japan, is seeking to realize the full potential of these resources. Let us take a closer look at each of them. Research shows that Vietnam is home to the third-largest amount of Bauxite ore in the world. Mainly found in Tay Nguyen, Bauxite is responsible for the production of aluminum. Although Vietnam has these vast amounts of the ore, it produced only an approximate 30,000 tons. However, this has progressed impressively thanks to the implementation of mining plans drafted by the government. Vietnam now produces 600,000 tons of Bauxite annually in its two stations at Dak Nong and Lam Dong provinces. Coal is one of the most available among Vietnam’s mineral resources. Home to almost 43,715 million tons of coal, the country mainly used it in domestic power plants. It also exported it to the countries within the Asia Pacific region. The country had been lagging in terms of exploiting coal fully. It is this that led to the drafting of a plan that would see the 1, 351 square miles of coal at the Red River Delta exploited. The implementation of this plan has seen over 31% of the employed population working in the quarrying and mining section. Known as one of, if not the largest producer of oil and gas, Vietnam has seen itself thrive with these resources. Producing more crude oil and natural gas each passing year, Vietnam has attracted foreigners to begin engaging in the business of exporting these resources. As a result, the Vietnamese government has acquired revenue of over $22 million annually. Being the center of commercial energy in Vietnam, petroleum accounts for over a quarter of the percentage of the energy used in the country. This natural resource is exported in the form of crude oil due to the deficiency in the refining capacity. It's located in Cat Hai near Ho Chi Minh city. Over the years, the government has set out to improve the amount of crude oil production.  Vietnam can now produce 44 billion barrels of crude petroleum compared to the 0.4 billion barrels produced before. These minerals are widespread in Vietnam, especially the Northern part of the country. There are nearly 400 deposits and occurrences. Out of all these, 50 of them have already been investigated. Most of these are of hydrothermal, skarn and weathering geneses. The skarn type found in the carbonate terrigenous formations across the Northern part of the country is the most important. In conclusion, mineral resources have catapulted Vietnam’s economy to great success. With increasing revenue each year due to the rising level of job opportunities in the mining and quarrying sector, Vietnam can comfortably see that it has provided a little heaven on earth for its citizens."
12,Climate change: It is happening right here and right now.,social-issues," Today, more and more harmful human activities around the globe have become a threat to the natural environment, its biodiversity and the longevity of human generation. Therefore, as humans, we have to find global solutions to overcome these environmental problems. Hence, in my first post, I would like to bring you through hot topics on global environmental problems. They are Global warming, depletion of the ozone layer, Acid rains and Desertification. Global warming This is due to the rising temperature of the surface of the earth and is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Hence, this is the Greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect The earth normally receives sun rays of 0.2-4 micrometer wavelength. However, only 50% of them reach the earth. The earth absorbs these rays to generate heat. After that, these heat rays are emitted to the atmosphere as infrared radiation of 4-100 micrometer wavelength. Because of that, it helps to cool the surface of the earth. What are the causes? However, an excessive amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapors (H2O(g)), methane(CH4) and ozone(O3) in the atmosphere interfere emitting infrared radiation from the earth. As a result, this increases the normal temperature of the surface of the earth. Not only that, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) also cause this Greenhouse effect. Likewise, vehicles, factories, refrigerators and air condition machines are the main sources that add these gases to the atmosphere. There are several harmful effects of global warming. They are rising sea level, risk of extinction of species, climate changes around the globe, desertification and emerging and re-emerging of diseases among the human population. What we can do is; • Reduce energy use for day-to-day activities like using LED bulbs for lighting purposes, establishing housing solar power systems and using alternative energy sources like wind power. • Changing transportation from private transport to public transport to reduce burning fossil fuel. • Plant a tree and stop deforestation. Depletion of the Ozone layer The ozone layer acts as a protective barrier of the earth by absorbing 97%-99% of infrared radiations(UV-B) of the sun. Since 1975, this layer has gradually been depleted due to air pollution. As a result, an ozone hole was first discovered in 1982 above the Antarctic continent. Similarly, it has been discovered the same size of the ozone hole above the Arctic ocean. Also, it has been identified that CFC is the most harmful gas for the Ozone layer. There are several harmful effects of depletion of the Ozone layer. They are higher risk of skin cancers, immunodeficiency state, cataracts and climate changes around the globe. What we can do is; • Proper maintaining of air conditioners. • Encourage to use public transport to minimize air pollution. • Avoid using products that contain harmful gases to ozone layers. Acid rains Developed countries burn coal and petroleum products to generate their energy needs. During this process, they emit chemical oxides of nitrogen and surfer as by-products to higher layers of the atmosphere. Further, these oxides become nitric acid(HNO3) and sulphuric acid(H2SO4) after reacting with water vapors. As a result, these acids come to the earth as rain or ice or mist or fog calling itself as Acid rain (pH is less than 5.2). There are several harmful effects of acid rain. They are damages to trees, vegetation and aquatic animals, changes in soil biology and chemistry by robbing essential nutrients, damages to buildings, historic monuments and statues, acidification of the ocean and a higher risk of respiratory illness among the human population. What we can do is; • Save energy and minimize the production of electricity/energy. • Use cleaner fuel for everyday consumption. • Use alternate energy supplies. Desertification This is the degradation of biologically productive and fertile land into dry land due to man's activity. So that, over 200,000-square miles around the world have been becoming desert each year. Therefore, you can see mass desertification in countries like Africa, South America and China Hence, scientists have shown the inappropriate agricultural, irrigating and farming protocols, and over-grazing as the main causes of Desertification. There are several harmful effects of desertification. They are the changes in natural vegetation, dust and sand storms, threats to global food security and higher frequency of drought and flooding. What we can do is; • Proper management of agriculture, farming and irrigation. • Educating the public. • Re-plant trees as ""Great green wall initiative"". What have we done so far? Most of the countries around the world have signed different conventions and protocols to overcome/minimize these global environmental problems. The basal convention, Marpol convention, Montreal protocol and Kyoto protocol are some of the most important historical milestones for this effort. • Basal Convention This is the convention on the control of the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste and their disposal. In the Basal city of Switzerland, 173 countries signed this agreement in 1989. • Marpol Convention This is the convention for the prevention of marine pollution by petroleum products. It was initially signed in 1973. However, it was revised several times by adding different regulations. They are regulations on prevention of pollution by oil (1983), noxious liquid substances (1983), garbage from ships (1988), harmful substances carried by sea in packaged form (1992), sewage from ships (2003), and prevention of air pollution from ships(2005). • Montreal Protocol This is the protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. It was signed in 1987 in Canada. It is effective since 1989. According to this protocol, the aim was to stop/minimize emitting CFC and other harmful noxious gases that deplete the ozone layer by the year 2000. However, the aim was achieved by 1996. • Kyoto Protocol This was the protocol for the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 1997, 37 countries signed this agreement in japan. Moreover, 187 countries have singed and agreed on this protocol by the end of 2009. Further, industrialized countries have reduced emitting greenhouse gases by 5%-8% in 2012. Not only those efforts, but there are also the latest conventions, protocols, and agreements among nations to protect mother nature and mankind. Therefore, we have a duty for maintaining sustainable development towards environmental management."

14,Facts about Cannabis and Life Insurance You Should Remember,social-issues," Legalization of marijuana was met with great celebration in Canada last year, but it’s not all easy street. Just like other substances, like alcohol, legal does not mean law-free. There are still a lot of restrictions and rules surrounding cannabis and it’s uses that must be observed. Failing to recognize these limitations can have an impact on things like your life insurance, home insurance and even automotive insurance. Here are a few things to consider if you use medical cannabis, or cannabis for recreational purposes: Know the Law Despite legalization there are still laws surrounding cannabis that many are not yet familiar with. These laws regulate possession limits, age requirements, where it can be purchased, where it can be used and how much you are allowed to produce yourself – these regulations vary by province. If you break any of these laws it can not only impact your criminal record, but it can also have an impact on your auto insurance and homeowner’s insurance, depending on what law your break. Your Existing Home Insurance May Cover Your Legal Plants If you grow your own marijuana at home, within the legal limits, then it is likely that your existing homeowner’s insurance will protect those plants’ value, just as it does the value of your television or jewelry. It is important to note, however, that each insurer is different. They may raise your premiums if you are growing your own marijuana due to the increased fire hazard they present. Each insurer may also impose their own limits or restrictions on growing within the home. Never take for granted that you are covered. Check with your insurer to get the details of your policy where cannabis is concerned. Do Not Drive and Smoke Driving and smoking or driving soon after smoking marijuana is a crime. Driving under the influence of any drug, including prescription and over the counter drugs that affect your alertness, is illegal and comes with heavy penalties. If you are charged with driving under the influence it will have a very negative impact on your auto insurance premiums, at the very least. If you are convicted of driving impaired and an accident resulting in damage occurs, your insurer will likely deny your claim and you will be responsible for all the associated costs of the accident. Read the Fine Print As we mentioned before, growing plants in your home increases the fire risk for your home. This can increase your insurance premiums. If you modify your home or bring in specialty growing equipment without informing your insurer, they may nullify your policy in the event of a fire or other disaster resulting from said modifications and equipment. Just because your insurer doesn’t know you have modified your home, and your premiums remain low, doesn’t mean you are covered. Inform them to ensure you are protected. Liability You are responsible for other people who enter your home, and your liability insurance is there to help you manage the costs associated with someone getting injured on your premises. This applies when people are sober or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Just as with alcohol, you are responsible for anyone who leaves your home impaired and operating a vehicle. It is your responsibility as the host and homeowner to ensure people use and travel responsibly, or you could be sued. We all want affordable insurance, and sometimes that means inquiring about cannabis insurance policies directly with your insurer. Whether you use medical cannabis or cannabinoid-derived drugs, you should check with your insurer to see how these things may impact your life insurance or health benefits."

16,Why waiting for Christmas may be bad for your child,social-issues," With toys wrapped and placed under the tree, with new shoes hidden in room cabinets and new pants and shirts inside locked down closets, children are outraged with their parents and caregivers. If without Christmas they cannot have their belongings, then who is holding up Christmas, and when is Christmas going to come, children frequently ask? Of course, since none of the explanations would make sense to the child, adults just ignore them. Which is why some children take matters into their own hands. ""She has ripped off all the wrappings to see the toys,"" the mother of a five-year-old girl told me during an unrelated conversation while they were on a medical visit at my office. ""Christmas is still two weeks away,"" lamented the mother. As the mother complained, I could tell that the child looked ashamed. Behind her finger-covered face, she watched my face for a reaction. Empathetic to the child, I told her I wish I had the power to bring on Christmas tomorrow. She was briefly elated, and I think I temporarily cured her shame, stress, and anxiety. Seeing one five-year-old ashamed of peeking at her Christmas presents made me wonder how many children are throwing tantrums or having sleepiness nights due to a favorite toy under the tree which they can’t have until Christmas Day. The reason waiting causes distress in children is, perhaps, because they do not fully understand the reason why they have to wait. While an adult sees the waiting as a crescendo that ends up in a climax on the day the birth of Jesus is celebrated, the child perhaps sees it as unnecessary deprivation of fun and pleasure. Moreover, this adult order to wait is in conflict with the child's natural tendencies to explore their environment and expose anything hidden. To them, there is no point buying a toy, wrapping it up so that nobody can see it, and putting it under the tree, waiting for an arbitrary day. Adults used to wonder the same way when they were children. Over time, however, they have learned to accept the behavior set by society. I remember how it felt when I was a child and my parents bought shoes and clothes that my siblings and I could not wear until Christmas.  Since there were no Christmas trees in my ancestral village of Akokwa, Nigeria, under which to hide presents, my mother would put them away in the corner of her closet and forbid us from going to search for them.  When I was probably the same age as the five-year-old girl who, as the mother had reported, had opened all her Christmas presents, I would go to my mother each day when we woke up to ask if it was Christmas yet. ""Not yet,"" she would say.  Disappointed, I would ask, ""When will Christmas come?"" ""You will know when it comes,"" she would reply. Whether waiting for Christmas makes children more sad than disappointed is hard to tell.  However, through their behaviors, one witnesses the anxiety the anticipation builds. With the toys under the trees that children must stay away from, with the new shoes in the closet that nobody can wear until Christmas, I am not sure what values parents are trying to teach. Parents, it seems, think that since as children they waited for their toys, their children should wait as well. Other parents may argue that waiting is a lesson in patience and self-regulation. If so, it is a burden to children's immature psyches. Every adult should know that it is not in the nature of children to wait. Their executive function (prefrontal cortex) is not mature enough to handle the strain of waiting. Let them deal with it, some adults will say. Let them learn to wait. Fine and good, but that approach leads to agitation and anxiety, which may linger over time and, in my judgment, may have pathological consequences. Anticipatory deprivation is the term I use to describe what these children have to endure. A child who waits seven days to open a toy may not suffer the exact impact of stress as another child who waits for three months.  This cultural practice of making children wait weeks for their presents is no different from looking at tantalizing food that is out of reach. Let us not gloss over the potential emotional turmoil these practices may have on children. Granted, Christmas is a once-a-year event; however, the same pattern of anticipatory deprivation may exist at other times. I am not suggesting that this kind of cultural practice rises to the level of an adverse childhood experiences, ACE or toxic stress (Shonkoff et al., 2012). But, added together, it is uncertain how these societal systematic anticipatory deprivations affect the young psyche. I have a notion that chastising a child for exercising his or her biological capacities may create some psychic conflict or trauma. Other holidays, such as Easter and Hanukah, as well as a celebration such as a birthday, may reawaken the same expectation anxiety in children. Children have vibrant emotions and feelings similar to adults, even though sometimes they do not have words to express them. Without proper explanation, children may conclude and believe that some adult practices (such as preventing them from opening their toys) are mean spirited, and they may carry this resentment in their mind until they reach an adult level of understanding and reasoning. Researchers and developmental psychologists warn of the mistakes that occur in the manner children understand adult actions. In fact, they say that a child’s misinterpretation of a parent or caregiver’s action might be one of the main sources of mental health problems later on in life. Taking a moment to explain the rationale of an action or a process to a child may help in their knowledge and lessen emotional conflict. I suggest that parents take time to explain to their children why they cannot have the toys until Christmas Day. Try to get feedback from the child to elicit an understanding of the parental explanation. Second, parents and caregivers should shorten the days between purchasing presents and Christmas Day. Do not let the child wait longer than necessary – definitely not more than one week. Third, keep new shoes, clothing, and toys out of sight if you do not want children to open them. Last, and foremost, bring back baby Jesus in all the discussions involving Christmas. Just like our understanding of a certain phenomenon informs us to set limits, I believe that a day will come when evidence becomes abundantly clear that anticipatory deprivation does not serve children well. To all the children of the world, I say, today is a good time to be a child. Help is on the way. Christmas will come sooner than you ever imagined.

18,Men at 58,social-issues," It was not that long ago that I was an eighteen-year-old boy, with a sculpted face only a craftsman could have brought to life. I sported a trunk as flat as the board on which my elementary school teacher, Coby, wasted thousands of chalks teaching the rest of the children and me, including a beauty named Odaaku. When she walked she swayed like the young stem of a cassava plant. Coby taught us how to add and subtract numbers, and he inspired discipline.  Dutifully, he would, with the strokes of a long cane across the back, punish children who, because their minds were focused either on ""Odaaku the beauty"" or on the ""Moi-Moi,"" they would buy at break time with a penny they found in their mother's purse when she was busy in the kitchen preparing meals, did not pay attention. I am not implying that I was in elementary school at age 18. No, I was not. In fact, I was a first-year medical student in University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan. In case you are wondering why I chose age 18 as a pivotal point for reflection, it is because that is a fascinating age for many people, especially for me. Or perhaps it was because nothing can go wrong when someone is 18; or perhaps because it was about this age that I wore this stylish shoe, the double- and the triple-decker shoes that most teenagers wore at that time. My friends Paul, Charlie and Frank O. will remember the boots. I am not sure my cousin, Frank A., wore any. He might have missed the fashion trend by five years or so. I think most people preferred the triple-decker. Even teenagers like my cousin Jude, who was tall and did not need the extra height, still wore the shoes. Think about being on the top of a moving mountain.  That was the feeling we got as we walked around, up and down the streets in search of (where it is happening) parties. Anyway, I dug up these past intangibles (""Agwashigwas"") to show that at that time, when we were 18, we had no worries. Our parents did the worrying for us. Partly because we did not understand their intentions and partly because they did not care to explain their reasoning, we hated parental attempts to restrain us – a situation which made our parents think that, going by the manner in which we dressed and the things we cared for, prayers and miracles were the only two interventions that could save us. They did not completely lose hope in us, but their faith was on shaky ground. At church, they prayed and gave offerings on our behalf. ""To God I surrender my child,"" prayed my mother. When I discussed with my brother, who by the way had a triple-decker shoe, about how dumb we were then, he reminded me that Daddy warned that someday we would be in his shoes, worrying about our own children.  What a prophecy! Our parents were half right. Some of us confirmed their fears and became nothing short of mediocre, not being the best we could have been, not reaching the goals they set for us. Others, like Paul, Charlie, Dam and Valentine, hit it big; they grew up outperforming expectations, which would have made their parents proud and apologetic. In the long run it did not matter, since none of the parents are here anymore to see the future they predicted. Just to get back on track, this essay is about men going from age 57 to 58. Without the past there can never be the future, which is why I mentioned some of the events of those long-ago days.  Certainly, I wonder where all that beauty and handsomeness have gone. One day, a boy is like Odaaku, the beauty; the next day he is a worn-out beast. God could have done a better job of creating man (I hope that is not blasphemy). Bear with me; sometimes my thoughts get ahead of me. I am sure others, like my childhood friends Paul and Charlie and Frank, wonder the same way, even though for fear of the divine wrath they will never say it. Forty years have gone by since age 18. Then, our parents did the worrying; now, as they warned, it is our turn to worry about our children. Will they get to their destination, and will they come back home, we ask each day? We never stop asking. Will they turn out okay? What will become of them? Parental fears and anxiety are written on our faces and our hearts, like heavy woolen clothing worn by Igbo Masquerades. There is no limit to the source of our worries, not with family and friends dying with every turn of the day. Each parental concern registers a mark on the contour of the face, carving out worry lines, and the weight of our cares drags us down the way oranges do to tree branches. For these reasons, age 58 approaches a watershed age of 60, where men (I am not sure of women) commit to a new plan in the journey of life. Some men stall or even backpedal in life activities, while others gear up and pedal forward with enthusiasm, vision and goal. I think the latter is the better approach. I tell you, I know of people who, at age 58, walk with the vigor of an 18 year old, but think with the wisdom of Methuselah. If you are turning 58 in December, like I do, put on a pair of sneakers, get on the treadmill and work up some sweat; or, if you have no access to a treadmill, find a trail, like the one leading to the Iyiba Stream in Akokwa, Nigeria, and walk for three miles. Count it as a present to yourself. Your knees might hurt and your back may ache, but never give up. One more thing – and do not let anybody else tell you otherwise – keep count of all food and drink that enters your mouth. No salt and no beer or soft drinks. They are full of sugars, and they will weigh the body down and make someone at this age feel like a pile of pounded cassava."
19,Tantra Massage - Why are People Crazy about This Therapy?,social-issues," Are you a massage enthusiast? If so, you must already know that massage is all about an experienced person working your muscles with the right amount of pressure to reduce stress and relieve pain. To an extent, tantra or tantric massage is similar. However, unlike conventional massage, it is a different experience and involves nudity, healing, your private parts and orgasms. If that got your attention, keep reading to know why everyone in Battersea and across London is in love with this rubdown therapy. The basics of tantra massage Tantra massage is a hands-on practice that is different from traditional rubdown treatments. This therapy incorporates the essence of shakti, which is known as energy. This treatment works to eliminate the blockages that people face thanks to the hectic modern life. The blockages can be mental, physical, sexual, emotional or even psychosomatic. Whilst you might think that tantra massage in Battersea is just about mind-blowing orgasms, you need to realise that orgasms are not the ultimate aim of this rubdown therapy. Of course, increased orgasmic and pleasure is one of the beneficial effects of this treatment, it is not the primary aim. It is simply a by-product. Tantra massage experience A tantra massage session feels heavenly as this is a very intimate and personal massage therapy. You will probably not be wearing any clothes or just a small towel to cover your private parts. The therapist will be massaging every inch of your body with warm oil, and the gentle touch will work towards awakening your dormant erotic energy. Once awake, the masseuse will massage your body so that the energy spreads throughout your entire body. Even though tantra massage essentially covers every inch of a recipient’s body, it is not necessary that your genitals have to be a part of the rubdown session. If you do not feel comfortable with the idea of a stranger groping and touching your private parts, you can make that clear beforehand. Then, the masseuse will respectfully and lovingly take her fingers near your inner thighs to arouse your senses, but she will not touch your genitals, unless you are comfortable and ready. When it comes to the experience of a tantric massage, people have different things to say. Some people find a profound change in their emotions and thoughts, whilst there are others who feel positively rejuvenated from the experience. There are also people who claim that the massage has helped to enhance their sexual performance and boosted their libido. In general, a tantra experience means recipients having their confidence restored and them feeling content with their body. This massage gives people the opportunity to explore their body and find out what kind of touch stimulates their senses. The experience is one of enlightenment, along with complete relaxation and total erotic satisfaction. The benefits of getting a tantra massage Tantra massage in Bayswater is not only about pleasure and orgasms. This treatment offers myriad benefits to the recipients. Some of them are mentioned below. 	Treatment of common sexual problems or dysfunctions of men, as well as, women 	Improvement of vitality and health 	Alleviation of emotions that are blocked or stuck 	Ignition of a spiritual realisation and awakening 	Enhancement of the potential of orgasms and the ability to feel pleasure 	Eliminating physical, emotional and mental stress 	Cultivation of joy and contentment 	Promotion of total and complete relaxation The benefits of this treatment are not just restricted to pleasure and sensual satisfaction. This means that this treatment takes a holistic approach and helps in boosting overall well-being and health. So, if you have never tried a tantra or tantric massage, it is high time that you see an experienced masseuse. When the masseuse touches your body using her gentle, soft hands, you will understand why so many men in Bayswater are dying to let a tantric goddess touch them. Just one session will change your life and make you fall in love with this treatment."
20,Issues Related to Extracurricular Activities when Dealing with Child Support,social-issues," Extracurricular activities are important in the development of well rounded children. However the logistics of extracurriculars can quickly become complicated by a divorce. Parents who are divorced or preparing for divorce should consider some of the following points. Can both parents agree on which activities are appropriate for their child to participate in? If one parent does not approve of an activity, it can lead to some serious tension and conflict. How many activities does each parent consider too few or too many? Each parent may have a different parenting style. Burdening a child with too many extracurriculars can burden them with stress or distract the child from their studies. Are both parents willing to contribute financially for the expenses related to materials, registration, transportation and other associated costs? How much is each party willing to contribute? Each parent should only expect the other to make contributions that are manageable with consideration for their financial situation. Are both parents willing to contribute the time necessary to transport their child to and from extracurricular activities? Are they willing to make arrangements to travel if necessary? The costs of extracurricular activities, both in terms of time and money can vary greatly. Rec league sports may be more manageable than travel leagues which require regular trips out of town and may require out-of-pocket payment for lodging and expenses. Sports and other activities such as music may require purchasing expensive equipment and instruments. It is important that parents are open to communicating about these decisions. Don’t be afraid to confront topics such as whether it is better to buy the most cost effective option or the best of the best. Considerations of Custody One important point to consider is whether any extracurricular activity may get in the way of either parent’s custodial time with their children. Consider the following scenario: The son decides he wants to join a local baseball league, and he asks his mother if he can participate. The father is not consulted and only sees his children every other weekend. After signing up for the team, the mother finds out practices will be Friday evenings with games on Saturdays and Sundays. This will consume a significant portion of the father’s precious time with his son. In these cases, be sure to consider the following questions: Will the other parent agree with signing their child up for this activity? Will they be willing to pay their share of the expenses? Will they be willing to provide transportation and attend? Agreements and Consent Orders Entering into a consent order or any other type of agreement, be sure to discuss every detail. Don’t be afraid to dive into these kinds of specifics. If you have a hearing, be sure to discuss the activities your child is participating in, the costs and the level of involvement, and have the judge address each of these details. Make it clear how activities are chosen between the two parents, and ensure there are mechanisms in place to deal with disagreements when they inevitably arise. Consider each of the following specifically when discussing costs associated with extracurricular activities: Will costs be split universally, or will differences in income between both parents be considered? Do split costs include all expenses or just enrollment and admission? Will travel expenses be shared? Ensure that enrollment in extracurricular activities is not monopolized by one parent or the other. You can do this by adding terms to the agreement that place a limit on the number of activities each parent can enroll the kids in every school year. You can also place a cap based on the costs associated, whereby each parent agrees to pay a set amount per year for activities, and the cost burden for anything exceeding this falls on the parent who enrolled the child. Consider custodial arrangements when scheduling extracurriculars. It is important that one parent does not detract from the other’s scheduled time with their children as in the example discussed earlier. It is also important that each party considers the children’s best interests and not just the existing custodial schedule. Include verbiage in your agreement that prepares for unexpected events. Extracurricular activities often come with unexpected obligations, and it is important that both parties agree to put in the necessary effort to allow their child to participate, even in cases when it disrupts the custodial schedule."

1,Important Questions to Discuss With Your Family Law Attorney,social-issues," When you first hire a divorce lawyer, you’ll be faced with a first-time consultation during which you should be given a broad overview of the state and local laws as they pertain to divorce. During this consultation, you’ll also have the opportunity to discuss your own unique case and highlight your goals and intentions. It is important that any reputable divorce attorney takes the time to listen and get to know their client and the unique circumstances of their divorce case. Have this discussion will lay some important foundations for the case moving forward. Doing this early on ensures that both the attorney and client are on the same page in terms of priorities and that the attorney has an opportunity to explain any fundamental misconceptions that the client might have. Once some background and foundations have been established, the attorney should then explain how the law applies to the particular case at hand. Any particular options and action items can then be highlighted clearly so the client has all the information necessary to make informed decisions. The purpose of an initial consultation is not to give hard legal advice or to predict the odds and outcomes of a particular case but for the client and attorney to get to know the background of a case. Therefore, it is also important that the client comes in prepared to ask his or her attorney some questions of their own. Here are some important questions anyone entering a divorce should ask their attorney at their first consultation: Questions to Ask Hiring an experienced attorney is important in any field of law, and divorce is no exception. Knowing the nuances of the law in different localities and having familiarity with judges and other lawyers in the area are important factors that come only through experience. Practicing law and learning the law are very different things. There is significant trial and error involved in becoming an effective attorney, so years in the business are an important factor to consider. There are some pros to hiring a less experienced attorney, including energy and price (which is typically lower for those early in their career), so you should necessarily disqualify a potential attorney based on their years of experience. There is just a risk factor that must be considered when choosing that option. Divorce cases can either be settled or taken to trial. These two outcomes are not the same, and it is important to understand the difference. Cases are settled out of court more often than not. While you should look for an attorney who is not afraid to take a case to trial, eagerness to do so is a sign of an attorney who is looking to rack up legal fees. The best attorneys should be able to settle a majority of their cases outside of court. An attorney cannot provide an exact estimate at the onset of a case. There a many factors involved and different choices and developments throughout the process can make the cost difficult to predict. Each case is unique, and clients who require more guidance throughout the process or who have larger estates at stake may be required to pay larger sums to ensure a positive outcome. All things considered, an experienced attorney should be able to walk you through a number of costs that you should expect and developments that you should be prepared for along the way. If the low end cost estimate exceeds what you are willing to pay, don’t be afraid to discuss other payment options. For example, it may be wise to avoid going to trial at all costs, due to the expenses that come with a contested divorce case. Before the end of your initial consultation, be sure to discuss any action items you can take with you. What should your next steps be to ensure the best possible outcome to your case? Don’t forget to consider factors such as alimony, child support, shared bank accounts and even restraining orders. It is important that you leave nothing on the table, as simple oversights such as failing to pay the required amount of child support could result in incurring more expenses on your part. Making the wrong moves early on could even result in you being required to pay your spouse’s legal fees, which does not come cheap."

3,Things You Should Not Do During a Four Hand Massage,social-issues," Massage enthusiasts across the world are waking up to the incredible benefits of a four hand massage in Mayfair. This special and superior kind of rubdown therapy involves two therapists using their hands to stimulate and manipulate the body. The masseuses move their hands in a choreographed motion that leaves the recipients mesmerised. Typically, one masseuse works on one side of the body like, the left leg whilst the other works on the right leg. Alternatively, one therapist manipulates the lower body whilst the other takes the upper body. This synchronised movement of hands ensures head-to-toe satisfaction. Recipients of a four hand massage are always left more relaxed and content than those getting a standard massage. Two pairs of hands are able to reach more places, excite more senses and stimulate more areas than one pair of hands. Simply put, two therapists are able to divide and conquer all the aching muscles, and double the relaxation. Even though this rubdown therapy is popular and offer loads of health, relaxation and sensual benefits, there are certain things that you should not do during a four hand massage session. Take a look below to know what things to avoid. Do not turn up for the session unprepared In Mayfair, there are agencies providing massages of all types and while they might provide similar benefits, they vary. If you are interested in getting a four hand rubdown, research about the therapy so that you do not turn up for your session with misinformed perceptions. You would not want to be shocked when two therapists walks in the room and asks you to strip, and one of them starts playing with your private parts. A four hand massage is an intimate affair, and you have to be sure whether you want two gorgeous masseuses to touch you. If you are sure, ensure that you maintain a certain level of general cleanliness and hygiene. Do not be totally passive Massage therapists like a bit of constructive criticism and feedback, otherwise they will not know if you are genuinely enjoying the things they are doing to you. If there is any part of your body that particularly feels strained, you can ask them to give extra attention there. You can also let them know when you enjoy a specific movement or suggest them to switch to the movement that they were using before. This is crucial because everybody has unique needs and only you know best what feels nice. Let the masseuses know and they will personalise the session as per your specific needs. Do not be inappropriate or aggressive A four hand massage in Mayfair is a type of erotic massage and it would involve the masseuses touching, teasing and caressing your intimate parts. However, you must not treat them as escorts. These women should be respected. You need to understand that they are professional therapists. Touching your private parts does not mean that they want to have sex with you. Just as tension accumulates in other parts of your body, your genitals also become stressed. Releasing stress helps in boosting sexual performance and you will be thankful for that. So, never be aggressive or pass inappropriate comments. Do not wait till the end of the session to pay the therapists It is considered good manners to settle the fee beforehand. Do not wait till the end of the session to give the masseuses what you owe them. Just put the agreed money in an envelope and leave it somewhere where the masseuses can see instantly as they enter the room. This gesture will make the masseuses treat you even better. So, these are a few things that you should keep in mind not to do when getting a four hand massage in Mayfair. All the best for having a great time."
4,The Creation of a Equilibrium Japan,social-issues," On August 6th and 9th of 1945, the first nuclear bombs were used on humans, dropping on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, ultimately ending World War II . The aftermath of these bombings impacted Japan’s political and hierarchical structure immensely. During the post-war occupation, the allied powers led by General Douglas MacArthur, set reforms on the Japanese economy and government to create a civil Japan. These reforms completely reconstructed the government, changing political and hierarchical powers. Though many reforms such as demilitarization and disestablishment of the state religion, Shinto, were made, the most impactful changes of the reforms were the modifications made to the government and the rights of the citizens . Formerly a constitutional monarchy, Japan did not have a very fair balance of power. The reforms helped to change this power balance by shifting Japan into a democracy. Through this change, many laws restricting the rights of the people became abolished and gave birth to a more fair Japan. The rights of women were most impacted by these changes, for they obtained capabilities that allowed them to escape their inequitable treatment and lack of influence. Before these reforms, women were unable to vote and held no social or political power. The reforms later granted women rights they never had before. Although Japan’s historical values were rooted in monarchy, masculinity, and suppression of feminism, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki set forth a variety of reforms that gave women the opportunity to influence the country politically. Women in Japan prior to the war were bound to many laws that restricted their capabilities and potential of influence. Buddhism, Confucianism, and the bushido all contributed to the mistreatment of Japanese women. These three philosophies were highly discriminatory towards Japanese women and greatly affected the treatment they received. The discriminatory beliefs were developed through Buddhism, which taught that salvation was not possible for women, as well as Confucianism, which emphasized the supreme position of males . In addition to having restricted rights due to these social morals, women also had their rights suppressed by Japanese laws. Japanese laws enforced that women could not own property, and were practically considered the property of their husbands. To emphasize this further, inheritance laws (Kotaku) allowed only the eldest son, even with an older daughter, to inherit family property. The Japanese government was a monotheistic patriarchy, which put women in a impotent position for influence in government. Women were often exploited in the form of arranged marriages in which lower-class families could rise in power. The women’s literacy was also suppressed by limited education and opportunities to learn. Women, not as literate as men, were only taught to read hiragana, thus preventing them from reading business and political transactions, which were written in the more formal writing style, kanji. The effects of World War II eradicated these social and political beliefs towards women and reconstructed the concept of equity. Women during World War II tolerated many changes that led to their future success. Despite the ongoing war, women gained many merits from the turmoil. Japan, desperately trying to achieve the same level of modernization as the west, employed thousands of women into industrial jobs. Though the condition of women in these factories was miserable, they were paid wages. The wages were significantly lower than that of men’s, but this allowed women to make money without a dependence on men. Women began to gain control of the industry as men were removed to join the army. The absence of men during the war put women in control of their personal households and overall power. Though women were starting to gain some degree of freedom, the overall state of Japan was miserable, as Japan encountered the atomic bombings.With the use of nuclear bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, millions of people were left dead and homeless, disillusioning the people of their powerful military. General McArthur wrote about the bombing, ""it was not merely the overthrow of their military might, it was the collapse of faith, it was the disintegration of everything they believed in and lived by and fought for. It left a complete vacuum, morally, mentally, and physically."" Along with the hopes of the people to win the war, the economy and social traditions collapsed. Social anarchy followed as a despondent period began. Many social connections were shattered, and a majority of the people were left to live without the help of family. This forlorn situation led to the fostering of a minor democratic shift, ultimately causing the collapse of the feudal family system. The post-war occupation followed the war as McArthur ensured the continuation of the social revolution that was starting to begin. The post-war occupation was a blessing to the women as McArthur changed the government entirely eliminating many methods of discrimination. Laws that led to inequality were abolished, ending the age of masculinity. Religions that oppressed women such as Buddhism and Confucianism were now far from conventional, and western ideas that gave power to women became more common. Women started becoming more literate, giving them access to all types of education. Twenty-six universities for women were established, and many women began rising in political power. Monotheistic patriarchy was abrogated, and the emperor now serves only as a symbol of Japan, not as a dictator. General McArthur encouraged union activity, which supported co-ed schools and women in government positions. A law of labor standards was also passed to provide equal pay, working hours, and maternity/menstruation leave for women. The number of women put through arranged marriages was halved since before the war, as women became more independent and self-serving. The role of women began to become more equilibrium with men; in fact, the role of women in a household has almost become more powerful than that of the men's’. Though the power of women significantly increased after World War II, there are still many cases in which women are discriminated against. Many people have disobeyed the new laws, following their pre-war tradition of masculinism. These kinds of people continue to suppress the rights of women in many societies, including Japan’s. Over the last decades, however, these kinds of cases have decreased significantly, letting women possess the rightful power they deserve to have. The effects of World War II on Japanese women were immeasurable, giving women the potential, capabilities, and opportunities to influence the country as they wish."
5,What Is Salvation ?,social-issues," The Need For Salvation There is one very critical issue that needs to be settled before you can ever begin to deepen your relationship and fellowship with God. Do you have a reconciled personal relationship with God ? What are the requirements and details of Salvation and the Gospel of Jesus Christ ? It is often said about the various religions of the world that there are ""many ways to God"" or ""the various religions all lead to the same God."" Is this true ? What does God’s Word the Bible have to say about Salvation & Gospel of Jesus Christ ? Is Jesus one of many ways to God, or is he The Way to salvation and a reconciled relationship with God ? True Salvation And the Gospel of Jesus Christ Step 1: God loves you and wants you to have a personal relationship with Him, and to experience peace and life. Abundant and eternal life ""We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."" – Romans 5:1 (peace with God means to have a restored or reconciled relationship with Him) ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life."" – John 3:16 ""I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly."" – John 10:10 God offers peace with Him, a restored relationship with Him, and eternal life in heaven as a gift. Many people think they need to earn these things from God by being religious, or being a good moral person, or by doing more good than bad in their life. Romans 6:23 – ""… the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."" Even though God offers these wonderful things as a gift, and He wants everyone to have them (1 Timothy 2:4), sadly most people today do not have these things and they are far from God. Why ? Step 2: The Problem – Our Sin & Separation From God ""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" – Romans 3:23 ""For the wages of sin is death (eternal separation from God), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" – Romans 6:23 ""But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear."" – Isaiah 59:2 Our sins cause us to have a broken relationship with God, and to be far and separated from Him. Many people try to fix this problem themselves in various ways. Our Attempts To Reach God People have tried in many ways to bridge this gap and separation between themselves and God. Good works, religion, philosophy, morality,… None of these work. ""There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death."" – Proverbs 14:12 (death in this verse means to die and forever be separated from God and His love, and to forever be under punishment for your sins) Jesus said ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one may come to the Father except through me."" – John 14:6 Because God loves us and He knows we cannot fix this problem of sin & separation from God ourselves, He sent the solution. Step 3: God’s Solution To Our Problem ""For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ."" – I Timothy 2:5 ""For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God."" – I Peter 3:18 ""But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 Jesus is God’s answer and solution to our problem of sin, eternal separation from God, and eternal punishment for our sins. ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life."" – John 3:16 God solved our problem of sin & separation from Him by sending His Son Jesus. In order to receive these wonderful gifts from God, the Bible is clear about what we need to do in response to God’s solution. Step 4: Our Response: Repent from sin, Trust Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and Receive Him by Faith and Commit Your Life to Him ""Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me."" – Revelation 3:20 ""That if you confess with your mouth ""Jesus is Lord"", and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."" – Romans 10:9 ""Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ""The time has come,"" he said. ""The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!"" – Mark 1:14-15 ""Yet to all who did receive him (Jesus), to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."" – John 1:12 You Need to Make Jesus Your LORD and Savior Nearly everyone wants Jesus to be their friend. Nearly everyone wants Jesus to be their Savior and save them from their sins and the eternal punishment of hell. But many people do not really want Jesus to be their Lord. The Lord of their life. Which means to give up control and the rights to their life to Jesus. It may mean you need to give up your dreams and goals and plans, and accept Jesus’ will and plans instead. It may cost you a lot. Their is a cost to follow Jesus as Lord & Savior and be His disciple (a disciple is a learner & follower of Jesus). You need to commit your life to Jesus, and commit to follow Him as your Lord and Savior. If you have never trusted and received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, but you are ready to do so, then you can do it right now. Repent, Believe With All Your Heart, Receive Jesus As Lord & Savior Talk to God If You Are Ready to Repent, Believe Jesus, and Commit Your Life to Him ""Dear Lord, Thank you for loving me very much, and for sending Jesus to die for my sins. Lord, I have sins in my life. Please forgive me for all of my sins. And dear Lord Jesus, please come into my life, and be my Lord and Savior. I commit my life to you, to follow You and Your ways. And I repent and turn away from my sins, and I turn back to you. Please give me peace with God and eternal life in heaven. Please teach me your ways, and help me grow closer to you. In Jesus name. Amen."" You Can Know For Certain That You Are Saved If you have done these things in your prayer to God – you truly repented of your sins, put all of your faith and hope in Jesus Christ, and received Him as your Lord & Savior and committed your life to Him and meant it with all your heart – then you for sure have a reconciled relationship with God, peace with God and eternal life, and new life in Jesus. ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."" – Romans 10:13 ""Those who have the Son (Jesus) have life. Those who do not have the Son do not have life. These things have I written, that you may know you have eternal life."" – I John 5:12-13 You can find more information and articles about your relationship with God at the Pursuing Intimacy with God site."
6,Should employees be given uniforms?,social-issues," Uniforms are prevalent across a number of professional industries. Many industries, including airlines and emergency services, are identified by their iconic uniforms. Some industries adopt more of a dress code approach and in fashion retail, uniforms provide an excellent opportunity to showcase merchandise. There are many reasons for enforcing a uniform or dress code in the workplace and conversely, lots of growing evidence to suggest that a relaxed dress code is more conducive to productivity and creativity. The choice of whether to enforce a uniform in the workplace is one that you shouldn’t take lightly, for many reasons. So, here’s what you should consider when thinking about a staff uniform. Safety Safety is a key factor in the decision to enforce a uniform. Emergency services, industries with increased physical risk and those with a need for high levels of sanitation naturally require employees to wear a uniform to be able to maintain safety standards. Workwear in these industries is based on practicality more than how the uniform motivates the individual. If there is a potential risk to employees that can be remedied or reduced by enforced clothing, then this must always be the priority. Safety in the workplace doesn’t always have to be life and death. Introducing a closed shoe policy, for example, can help to reduce the chances of accidental damage. Individual Identity Identity covers 2 aspects of the professional environment. Individual identity can play a part in how employees feel in the workplace; whether they’re valued as individuals and how much autonomy they have in their working environment. Corporate identity can also be a big part of your business. Introducing a corporate uniform can make employees feel like they are part of the wider team and give them a sense of inclusiveness at work. Corporate identity, whilst it removes most of individual’s style choices, also reduces the opportunities for inequality in the workplace, including financial or lifestyle inequality. Corporate Identity In many industries, the corporate identity of the individual is very important. This is true for tradespeople who visit customers in their homes, working on behalf of larger organisations, who need to be recognisable immediately. Corporate uniforms are easily customised with specialist embroidery or branding and can be a great way to help customers recognise your employees. Creativity There is a growing belief that allowing employees to be relaxed with their dress code can be conducive to increased creativity and autonomy within the workplace. Employees who feel like they are able to relax in their attire may feel more valued for the contribution they make to the business, rather than being stifled by corporate red tape. Of course, there is usually a minimum standard for clothing choices in the workplace, and safety must not be overlooked, but this shift to more relaxed workwear is growing. There are lots of factors to consider when making a decision about staff uniforms. The reality is that uniforms work in some industries and are less suited to others. Provided you are keeping health and safety at the forefront of your decisions, uniforms can be flexible within most workplaces, depending on your priorities and corporate requirements."
7,Some of the Best Men’s Lifestyle Advice,social-issues," The true quality of a gentleman is someone who turns his weakness into his strength and creates a character which can be respected by all. Even by himself! There are many ways by which you can create a better version of yourself and transform you into a true gentleman. Improve your lifestyle is the key to become the master of his life, and taking control of his character is the stepping stone towards it! Improving men’s lifestyle is easy to say but hard to do. Of course, but it depends on you where life takes you. How to improve men’s lifestyle? Wake up early- We all have heard the phrase, ""early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."" But there are only a few of us who implement it on our day to day life. So, it is important to set the alarm for every single morning, regardless of if you have any work or not. This will prevent you from lounging yourself on the bed all day long. Drop your addictions- There is no better habit than making commitments on all the right choices you make in your life. To improve your lifestyle, it is very important to drop all the habit that does no good to you, such as smoking, drinking, or spending money on useless things. Always be helpful- Being wise, along with being helpful towards others will never cost you anything. This will help you build a positive character that people around you will always respect. Stand up for the weaker ones- If you have the ability to build others up, then you should always do so as it is the most powerful skill that can make you a better person. It is not about donating all your money and energy on charity, but it is about a positive influence that you can create for the people around you. Stick to your words- Keeping promises is the trait of a gentleman. But there are situations when you cannot stick to your words. So, how to make promises that you can stick to? The things which should be kept in mind understand the importance of your guarantee, be selective with your promises, and determine the time periods that are required before making the commitment. These are vital to adjusting the needed energy and time that will help you meet your goal. Create something productive- If you want to improve yourself, then it is important that you stop sitting ideal all day long, doing nothing. It is your time to start working hard to achieve your goals. You can take short breaks in between that will help you recharge. Never settle on less- If you want to taste success in your life, then you have to start seeing possibilities as opportunities, not as challenges that you cannot overcome. If you start settling for less, you will never get what you deserve. Always be focused on your need and aims. Health is wealth- If you have always dreamt of having a perfect and fit body, then lying around on your bed is not going to help. Join a gym and then lift some irons, go for a run, and work hard till you get what you were dreaming about. Learn from your journey- You may face thousands of problems while achieving your goal. But if you enjoy the journey and learn from it, then failure or success would not matter to you. And once you learn from your mistakes, you will never make the same mistake again. Treat every woman with respect- Chivalry is simple to show, but hard to remember. Treat every woman around you with respect and make your woman feel special and safe with you. Small things like opening the door, help her sit and talk politely can make you a man to die for. Think about the present- You would be amazed at how being at present can improve your future. When you learn from your present experiences and stop dreaming about your future, you can actually bring a change to your life. Appreciate small things which people do for you- People who truly care for are your real gem. Keep them close to yourself and try to spend more time with them. Thank them for standing by your side, every time you needed them and show your gratitude. Make them feel like you love and care for them too. There is no shortcut for a improving your lifestyle. You have to work hard with full dedication to achieve a lifestyle that defines you as a gentleman."
8,Games Hone the Skills We Need as Adults and Have Changed With The Times,social-issues," Games are an integral part of people’s lives and have been since mankind began throwing stones. From childhood to old age games entertain and amaze us. But have you thought about the fact that they also prepare us for life and help us to hone certain necessary skills? So, how do they do that? Well, here’s a short list of some well-known games, from way back when as well as now, and how they teach and empower us: Early Children's' Games •	Hide & Seek honed hunting skills •	Cowboys & Indians taught the rules of strategy and fair play •	Hopscotch built muscles and dexterity •	Jacks taught thinking and manual dexterity •	Team sports taught teamwork, strategy, and physical prowess Games Then… Back in the good old days (like hundreds of years ago), games were very physical, which was a necessity for children of that period to prepare for adult life. At that time, life was much more physically demanding than it is these days. Kids played non-physical games also, like cards and board games to learn thinking skills. … & Now Fast forward to modern-day. Now, many of those games have been replaced by video games for teaching not only hand-eye coordination but also computer use, strategy, and teamwork. Yes, the main focus in gaming these days is on computer games like those played on PlayStation and Xbox or even on smartphones, tablets, and computers. In this day and age, kids need to be preparing for the world of adulthood and its high-tech demands. Is there a game of any kind that has spanned the years and is still popular today? Yes, there is and it's been around for a very long time, too. Chess Perhaps the most challenging and relevant game of all time has been around for 1500 years. What is it? Well, it’s chess and it teaches players, young and old, about a number of important things, including: •	Patience – Waiting for your opponent to move is the obvious example, but you also learn to be patient with yourself as you learn the game and think about your moves for extended periods. •	Concentration – Keeping your mind on the game and planning your moves, even when it is not your turn takes mental discipline and concentration. Keeping a mental picture of possibilities as the layout of the board changes also teaches this skill. •	Strategic Thinking – Taking into account the different abilities of the pieces, and their areas of influence. Most importantly though, considering how the different pieces relate to each other. •	Recognizing Consequences – Every move you make changes the parameters of the board, the strategy, and the life of the game. And every move you make will be met with another move by your opponent. These are the consequences. •	Imagination – Each move must be pictured in your mind before the move is made. Further, you then have to picture what your opponent can do in response, then what you can do to counter that. A great deal of imagination is used in chess. And now the game of Chess has been brought into our modern world with computers so it can be played online making the life skills it teaches even more accessible. Chess has been around for 1500 years and has adapted to this modern culture so well because the life skills it teachers are just as useful today as they were for people who lived and played the game 1500 years ago. Not Just for Fun It’s something to think about the games that we enjoy so much when we are ‘at play’ are simply tools to train us for the more serious aspects of life, but there it is. It has always been that you are not ‘just having fun’ or ‘wasting time’ when you play games. Sure, you're having a good time, but you're also learning plenty of life skills to boot. And, if you have kids, be sure to encourage them every day to play both the new and the old games so that they can learn the life lessons that they need to grow and prosper."
9,Safeguarding children and adults,social-issues," Sexual exploitation is the children and young people are increasingly recognisable in the recent years through the UK including both urban and rural areas as well as in all the parts of the world.

Abuse is mainly the violation of human rights and civil rights by another person where there are physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, discriminatory abuse, neglect and acts of omission and material abuse. The sexual exploitation raises issues in the lives of the children and young generations who are exploited from sexual and physical harassment. Child trafficking, domestic violence, sexual violence in intimate relationship, abusive behaviour with the children and young people, drug related offences, sexual abuse, gang related activities and domestic servitude are the major reasons for which the number of children and young people is increasing rapidly across the globe. The sexual abuse among the children and the young people further has adverse impacts on the social lives of them as well as mental health condition, education, grooming forced isolation from the society and immigration status.

Lack of confidence and self-esteem lead to difficulties in forming relationship with others and it has direct impacts on the mental as well as physical health. Sexual exploitation is therefore serious issue which can create the feeling of worthlessness within the children and the young people and it further leads to the acts of self harm including cutting themselves, eating disorders and overdosing drugs. Apart from the children, the young generation are also suffering from different risks such as sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancy and abortion as well as reproductive health problems and HIV.

It raises consequences from the family members, parents, siblings and extended members and the impacts are on their health, working, family cohesion, social life and economic stability. In addition to these, the siblings of the children also face sexual exploitation and can be alienated and face bullying which further adversely affects self esteem of the members. Hereby, there are adverse impacts of sexual abuse among the children and the young people where the family members of the people are also suffering from mental stress. It is the responsibility of the health and social care workers to investigate the incidents taking place in the society across the world and develop crucial strategic planning to resolve the incident and groom the people properly so that they can live a better standard of living.

Take a long shower first This might sound absurd, but if you  meet your chosen masseuse for your massage a bit smelly and sweaty, you will  not feel confident stripping down. As this rubdown therapy is not like  traditional massages, the therapist might ask you to strip down and there might  also be a lot more contact between you and the masseuse. If you are constantly  worrying about how you smell, you will not get a lot out of the session and  when the session ends, you will not be completely relaxed. So, it is crucial to  make sure that you are clean and fresh. This way you will not feel embarrassed  in front of the therapist. Also, you need to take into  consideration the feelings of the masseuse. Masseuses would prefer to work on a  client who is clean and smells fresh. If you shower and smell nice, the  masseuse will appreciate the gesture and return you the favour by giving you  the best massage that you have ever received before. Bring a change of clothes This is particularly for incall  massage appointments. If you are visiting the therapist in her apartment, make  sure that you bring a pair of comfortable clothes. During the massage, the  therapist will probably use some kind of massage oil or moisturiser. You would  not want the oil to stick to your clothes, especially if you are wearing  formals. Another reason is that your muscles are going to get worked up after a  massage. It is just like going to the gym. You would not want to put on a suit  after a great workout session. So, carry comfortable clothes that you can get  into after a relaxing sensual massage in Knightsbridge. Do not hit the gym after a massage Immediately after getting a massage,  you must not hit the gym or partake in any kind of strenuous physical  activities. You need to rest your muscles to fully take advantage of the  massage session. So, make sure to have enough time on your hands that will  allow you to take rest for a while before heading out. Make sure to instantly give cash to your masseuse When your chosen therapist is  massaging you, it is best that she does not have any kind of distracting  thoughts. One of the thoughts that she might be having is regarding money. It  is best that you hand her the cash the moment you see her so that she can just  focus on taking care of your needs. So, these are a few of the things that you can do  to boost your sensual massage experience. You can either opt for an incall or  outcall massage session in Knightsbridge.

12,Climate change,social-issues," Climate change has become a bigger deal lately and is affecting all of us and our surroundings. Some of these changes might be more noticeable and more dramatic than other climate issues. Some of these issues have been there without us really noticing until it’s almost too late for us to do anything about the situation. Many animal species are being affected and are endangered or vulnerable because of what us humans do in our daily lives that affect our environment. We are hurting our environment by dumping toxic wastes into our oceans,  which this hurts the underwater world habitats and what they eat. Lack of food happens and the fish and animals underwater starve to death and lowers their population until they are all in serious trouble or they are already categorized in the endangered list. Our forests are burning and our lakes and rivers are drying out from intense heat waves that are getting worse and worse. This is because of our temperatures changing and our planet warming up. Places such as Antarctica are defrosting because of temperature changes and the temperatures being unusually higher than the years before. These changes might sound minor to some people but this can affect our way of life and our whole planet and cause major changes to our environment. These affects the amount of oxygen that our planet is getting. Wildfires are becoming more and more frequent. In 2018 more than 58,083 wildfires, and more than 8,8 million acres were burnt. Our waters are being contaminated by all the litter that ends up in our oceans and bodies of water. Greta Thunberg, a climate activist, said in her speech "" people are suffering,people are dying,entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.""  She is right, we are destroying our own home to the point where we might not be able to fix things back to normal. Climate change is becoming a bigger deal and we need to do something about our planet before the damage is completely irreversible. We have already done so much to the earth that we need to do something about it now before we can't go back."
13,Successful Dating Tips for Men,social-issues," Hey guys, I am really excited and thrilled to share with you some valuable advice on how to get back into the game of conquering women or the woman of your dreams. I know time is short and of the essence so without further ado I will share three simple advises on how to get back into the game and get the woman and the life you always dreamt of. Just Be Yourself 1.) Just do it: Sounds so simple and eventually it is. Most people think too much and have an inner discussion before approaching a woman and talking to her. Questions arise such as. What if she doesn't like me? What should I say? How do I continue the conversation? Basically when taking the confidence to finally go and talk they have already lost and defeated themselves. My advice: Just go with the flow, stop thinking so much and just go and talk to her, a simple ""Hi I am ... I saw you and just felt like talking to you"" goes a long way. If you combine this with a genuine smile you already won. And don't worry if she doesn't like you you will survive and off you go to the next one ;) Keep your cool 2.) Keep your cool. Research shows that it is not so much important what you say but how you say it and how your body language, postures transmits it. A perfectly funny and witty opener will not be successful if your body language says ""help let me get out of here"". Be confident, be genuine, show a smile, be your best self and it will be fine. Women like confident men, who know what they want and transmit this throughout their body language. Dress To Impress 3.) Dress well and take care of yourself. Now this you might think, why should I do that? Well let me put it this way. Imagine yourself a gift to the women of your dreams. As we know a gift always comes in a nice wrapping, who wants a gift that is not wrapped nicely? The wrapping some people would say is sometimes even more thrilling than the actual gift and leads the way ;) So get out your best cloth, invest in something nice if you have too, shower, brush your teeth go to the barber and get out there. Go Get Out There Well my friends that's it for today, I am confident that with this advice if you implement it, you are one step closer to conquering beautiful women and always remember just be yourself. Cheers guys, Sergio"

Too many people are inhibited about sex as their body has changed from what it once was. That is going to be a fact of life for all of us. Eating a well balanced diet is something you should incorporate into your life. If you aren’t doing it now, then start to make some small changes. As time goes on you will adjust to them and they will become a second nature to you. Consuming too much caffeine can be a problem. If you aren’t getting all the vitamins and nutrients that you need from food, make sure you take a quality supplement. Make sure you take the time to exercise at least 30 minutes each day as well. Walking is very common for older individuals as it is low impact but very good for the body. Get a companion such as a friend or even a dog that you can walk with each day. Some malls and other locations have indoor walking clubs too which are perfect when the weather turns cold. Being happy with your body is also important. Too many people start to notice all the small details as they get older. They will see every line and wrinkle on their body so they aren’t comfortable during sex. They don’t have much self confidence that they are desirable. They aren’t able to let go and enjoy what is taking place because they are too focused on such details. Reducing the amount of stress in your life is important as you get older too. The toll it can take on both your body and your mind is more than most of us imagine. Not everyone can be worry free when they are older though. If your finances or relationships aren’t in the best format, it can be hard to get past it. Do your very best though to reduce as many stressful issues from your life as you can. It will certainly help with your sex drive because you won’t be preoccupied with other things. If you are healthy as you get older, you will be able to maintain your sex drive. Both men and women have the ability to be turned on sexually until a very late age in life. They also both have the ability to continue having orgasms into those later years as well. It all comes down to how fit a person is both physically and mentally. Age is merely a number as anyone who is over 60 can tell you. Many of them continue to enjoy as wonderful of a sex life as others who are only in their 40’s. It is something you can strive for in your own life as well. Make sure you are making healthy choices today so you won’t have too many issues that reduce your sex drive as you get older."
16,All You Need to Know About Tie and Tease Massage,social-issues," Tie and tease is the method where an individual is tied and  later brought to climax. The therapist assumes the role of the dominatrix and  denies the recipient of the massage an orgasm, increasing his sexual  frustration. In this practice, the submissive partner is repeatedly stimulated  so that he comes to a highly aroused state without giving him relief.

18,Treatment for Impotence – Helping Men Regain Their Confidence,social-issues," Impotence is also commonly known as erectile dysfunction. This problem tends to affect some men and can hamper their performance in sexual activity. When a man is unable to perform well sexually, it can be quite frustrating for him and make him feel less of a man. Luckily, treatments for impotence do exist and depending on the condition, the problem can definitely be fixed. The cause of impotence is generally said to be either emotional or mental problems. Techniques can range from medication to counseling that can help the partners talk about what the problem is and this could help get rid of the problems that may be causing impotence in the man. The best treatment for impotence can only be found if the cause of the problem can be determined. Once the cause is found, the treatment for impotence can easily be derived. Counseling is opted when the cause of the problem is an emotional or mental problem. A counselor can help with whatever the problem may be and by helping to eradicate, it will also be solving the problem of erectile dysfunction. If the person going to the counselor has a partner, it is always recommended that the partner also goes to meet the counselor. However, private sessions can also be arranged. Sometimes, all a person needs is to talk about his problems and that would be enough of a solution. However, this depends on what is causing impotence to occur. For people who are experiencing emotional problems such as anxiety or depression or have been through a traumatic experience, the treatment for impotence is likely to be different. It should also be kept in mind that people who are prone to emotional problems, or having an erectile dysfunction problem can be a cause of anxiety and/or depression itself. For people experiencing severe depression and emotional problems, treatment for impotence can come about through visiting a trained psychiatrist. If the situation is more severe, counseling is unlikely to help. For conditions that are quite bad, doctors tend to provide their patients with devices that can help fix the problem. A penis pump for example is one such device that is considered to be a solution for impotence. It takes blood to the organ and holds it in place so that the person can indulge in sexual activity. Sometimes, physicians suggest penile implants as a solution to this problem as well. However, this is generally considered to be a last resort. Impotence is definitely a serious cause of concern and men who experience such a problem should definitely get the problem sorted out by visiting a doctor. The visit can certainly be embarrassing, but it could help change the life of the person who is experiencing such a problem in the first place. Impotence can lead to further problems and it is best if the issue is solved as soon as possible. There are simple changes in lifestyle that can also help people prevent the problem of impotence.

Avoiding habits like smoking and drinking can go a long way in preventing impotence. Eating vegetables and fruits is also beneficial for enjoying good sex life. A satisfied and happy lifestyle also boosts the sexual prowess. Happy lifestyle means proper sleep, nutritious food and regular exercise. Stress and tension are detrimental to sex life.

20,The Secret History of Toilets,social-issues," Whilst it may not strike you as the most exciting of subjects, the history of toilets actually makes for some fairly interesting reading. Indeed, we take for granted that we’ve got nice and clean loos to use wherever we go. This wasn’t always the case. When it comes to the first recorded use of toilets, historians generally agree that it was our Stone Age ancestors that used them. Well, perhaps the word ‘toilet’ is a bit of a stretch. It would be more accurate to describe them as cubicles inside of huts which had drains dug beneath them. Whilst this setup might not sound nearly as pleasant as the luxury bathrooms of the twenty first century, it served the very same purpose. When it came to ""proper toilets"", it was the Ancient Egyptians who were the first to innovate. With toilet seats made from limestone, the wealthy members of their society were comfortably looked after whilst poorer citizens had to make do with wooden stools above holes in the ground. The Indus Valley civilization were also attentive to nature’s call, building their streets around a grid pattern which accommodated for the sewers which ran beneath them. They also figured out how to flush their loos with water to increase their overall cleanliness. Of course, the Romans are well known for their prowess in toilet innovation. Building public toilets and sticking sponges on the end of sticks, these ancient citizens clearly took great pride in keeping clean and orderly. Monks in the Middle Ages had a funny way of doing their business- they built chutes that ran into rivers and the sea to dispose of their sewage. Medieval castles were also a little unusual, with vertical shafts running the length of the building to allow waste to flow freely into the moats which surrounded them. In 1596, the inventor Sir John Harrington introduced the first flushing loo with its own cistern. It wasn’t a hit. No, people preferred to use their chamber pots for another hundred or so years. It wasn’t until Alexander Cumming and Joseph Bramah brought out better flushing toilets that they started to catch on. By the late 19th century, porcelain toilets pans were a fairly common sight. Featuring in the homes of the rich and shared by the poor, these functional loos ultimately made society a whole lot cleaner. Nowadays, clean and functional toilets can be found almost anywhere in the developed world. With many charities working together to bring more hygienic loos to third world countries, there’s hope that the history of the toilet will end with everyone having access to one."

1,Prostate Massage: Advantages and How is it Milked,social-issues," P-spot is to men  what G-spot is to women. If there is a way to arouse the G-spot for women,  there is also a way to stimulate the elusive P-spot for men. But, the only  difference is that prostate massaging is a bit of a taboo for men. Most men  cringe at the thought of anal pleasure. The idea of having a finger inserted  into their anus makes them feel gross and this is why a lot of men miss out on  the fun and pleasure of prostate milking or prostate massaging. However, if you  relate to this dilemma, do not count this rubdown therapy out unless you have  tried it. Below given are some of the surprising benefits of prostate massage in Baker Street and information on how it  is performed. Benefits of prostate milking Improved function: Prostate massage helps in  enhancing the overall functioning of the prostate as regular massaging releases  fluids and promotes blood flow in the area. This also helps in improving other  functions like, urine flow and the prevention of build-up that might lead to  swelling and inflammation. Furthermore, prostate massaging is also related to  augmenting the ability to overcome impotence due to the increased stimulation  and circulation of seminal fluid. Prevention of illnesses related to the prostate: Prostatitis, benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer are some  of the most common prostate-related illnesses. Regular and proper prostate  milking can help prevent such unwanted conditions. Enhanced sexual performance: Prostate massage  goes hand in hand with sexual pleasure and better sexual performance. By  regularly milking your prostate, you can improve your ejaculation and enjoy  explosive orgasms. Ejaculation as a result of prostate stimulation can be much  more explosive and intense than a penile one. How is the prostate massaged? It is important  that you only allow your prostate to be touched and massaged by a professional.  Masseuses with years of experience have the expertise needed to carry out  prostate milking safely. The steps that therapists follow whilst massaging the  prostate are given below. Set up the atmosphere using  candles, dim lighting, aromatic oils and soothing music. Setting up of a  romantic environment is important as it helps to set the mood and take away  nervousness. The therapist washes her hands and  wears gloves. Makes use of a lot of lubricant so  that the finger is able to slide in and out the anus smoothly and with less  friction. The therapist applies a lot of  lubricant around the anus area and on her fingers and then, slowly and gently  inserts her finger into the anus. At first, she only enters it a little and  takes it out. This process is repeated a few times to make the anus feel  comfortable of her finger. Once the muscles loosen up and relax, she inserts  her finger deep into the anus, finds the prostate and starts massaging and  rubbing it gently. The process is extremely relaxing and highly arousing. So, as you can  see, getting a prostate massage in Baker Street is not a scary experience,  but a highly satisfying one. You get to improve your overall health, get the  relaxation that you desire and also experience pleasure. The new sensations  that the therapist will introduce you to are going to make you feel content and  delighted.

3,Order Rosh hashanah Gifts,social-issues," WHAT IS ROSH HASHANAH? Rosh Hashanah (ראש השנה) is the Jewish New Year. It falls once a year during the month of Tishrei and occurs ten days before Yom Kippur. Together, Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur are known as the Yamim Nora’im, which means the Days of Awe in Hebrew. In English they are often referred to as the High Holy Days.Rosh HaShanah literally means ""Head of the Year"" in Hebrew. the month of Tishrei is believed to be the month in which God created the world. Hence, another way to think about Rosh HaShanah is as the birthday of the world. Rosh HaShanah is observed on the first two days of Tishrei. Jewish tradition teaches that during the High Holy Days God decides who will live and who will die during the coming year. As a result, during Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur (and in the days leading up to them) Jews embark upon the serious task of examining their lives and repenting for any wrongs they have committed during the previous year. This process of repentance is called teshuvah. Jews are encouraged to make amends with anyone they have wronged and to make plans for improving during the coming year. In this way, Rosh HaShanah is all about making peace in the community and striving to be a better person. This day is deeply spiritual because on judgment day, not unlike what happens when a person is waiting to hear a court sentence, we are forced to reflect on ourselves. Did I live up to God’s expectation of me? Is God pleased with me? What are my faults? Because of the intense mood of the moment this day presents the most powerful spiritual opportunity available — the opportunity for us to reflect on how we can elevate ourselves to a higher plane. What does God want from me? He wants me to be on His team. How am I judged? Have I lived my year pursuing self-gratification, or have I grown closer to God in thought and deed? Am I making this world a better place to live in? Even though the theme of Rosh HaShanah is life and death, it is a holiday filled with hope for the New Year. Jews believe that God is compassionate and just, and that God will accept their prayers for forgiveness. SPECIALITY OF OUR ROSH HASHANAH GIFTS Our Rosh Hashanah gift baskets comes in a wide variety of options and budget that can suit any family. Every Product from us is O-U Kosher Certified.

4,Erotic Massages: an Effective Way to Relax and Stay Calm,social-issues," Life is extremely stressful and it  can be difficult to forget all the stress and just relax. Jobs, family,  financial problems and friends can add a lot of stress to your daily life. In  this highly stressful environment, massage therapy is the only way that can  make you feel better. There are different types of bodywork available today,  but the most effective is getting an erotic massage in London. However, the  myriad styles of erotic massage might make you feel overwhelmed when you have  to choose one. Below given is a brief description of the various erotic massage services in London. Once  you know what each type of bodywork involves, you can make an informed  decision. Tantric Massage Tantric massage is an ancient  bodywork technique that has its origin in the Indian subcontinent. This  technique focuses on the chakra centres present in the body. Therapists use  pressure and strokes to stimulate specific areas in the body to awaken the  dormant kundalini energy. It is believed that the human body has various energies  within itself and for overall well-being, it is important for the energies to  flow through every inch of the body. This is where tantric therapy comes in. Tantric massage is a whole package.  The therapy does not just aim to relax and alleviate tension from the muscles,  but the therapist also eliminates sexual tension from the erogenous zones. It  is quite possible for recipients to experience orgasms during a tantric massage  session. However, orgasm is not the ultimate goal and sex is not involved during  the session. Body to body massage If you are looking for a more  hands-on approach massage therapy, a naked body to body massage might be what  you are looking for. This massage therapy guarantees complete skin to skin  contact between the receiver and the giver. For this technique, the therapist  does not just use her hands, but her entire body. The recipient can feel every  feminine curve of the giver’s body as she uses her stomach, breasts, hips and  thighs. The massage is an immersive experience that will leave you totally  rejuvenated and satisfied. It will also take care of your desire for female  intimacy. Nuru massage Nuru massage is considered to be one  of the hottest and sexiest massage therapies. This bodywork has its origins in  Japan and it became famous at a time when prostitution was being curbed. This  slippery, messy and highly satisfying massage spread like wildfire and quickly  became popular across the globe, especially in London. A Nuru massage is like a body to  body massage as this bodywork is performed and received naked. There is body to  body contact. But, this massage is slippery as therapists use Nuru gel. This  gel is made using nori seaweed and it is colourless, tasteless and odourless.  The gel is natural and does not cause allergy. The therapist generously pours  this gel on herself and on the receiver before smoothly gliding and sliding all  over the recipient’s body. Apart from the slipperiness of the  massage, the other difference between a Nuru and body to body massage is that  recipients get to enjoy a smoking hot shower with their chosen therapist before  the start of a Nuru session. So, if you want to blow off steam in the company  of a hot masseuse and have her rub her assets across every part of your body  without friction, you would choose a Nuru massage. So, these are some of the popular  erotic massages that you can indulge in during your trip to London. You can  also combine a happy ending massage with the mentioned erotic massage sessions  and end the treatment on a happy note. If you want to know about more such  sensual massages, find a reputed massage agency in London. Make sure that the  agency provides discreet services, has a wide selection of masseuses and offers  transparent hourly rates."
5,6 Unexpected Reasons That Cause Erectile Dysfunction,social-issues," Before we go into talking about 6 unexpected reasons that cause erectile dysfunction, let us first try to get the answer to… What Is The Main Cause Of Erectile Dysfunction? Today, all over the world, there are about 150 million men who suffer From ED. But the truth is that, there is no single cause, due to which men all over the globe, suffer from erectile dysfunction. Various men would suffer from male sexual impotence, due to various reasons. So, if one man is suffering from ED for one reason, it does not mean other men will also be suffering from reason of weakness in man, for the very same reason. There are many reasons why men all over the planet suffer from impotence in men and these are inclusive of: Physical causes. Psychological causes. Injuries. Most people have no clue as to what causes erectile dysfunction. In fact, there are some men who do not even know that they are suffering from ED. And then there are those men, who know that they are suffering from weakness of man in bed, for the simple fact that they have seen the warning signs of erectile dysfunction in themselves and they are well aware of them – but they have an ego that tells them that nothing is wrong with them. But for now, let is take a look at… 6 Unexpected Reasons That Cause Erectile Dysfunction You may be suffering from ED for a reason that you never ever imagined was possible. Here are 6 unexpected reasons why you may be suffering from ED: High Blood Pressure And Medications Used To Treat High Blood Pressure: If your blood vessels are healthy and there is good enough blood flow entering your penis, this is sufficient enough to give you a good hardon. But if the blood pressure shoots up, this could lead to your blood vessels being damaged. And because of this, they get less elastic and their capability of transporting the same volume of blood, quickly, diminishes. There are also certain medicines that are used to treat high blood pressure, medicines like diuretics and beta blockers which can increase your chances of getting erectile dysfunction. Infected Gums: How can gums that are infected cause you to suffer from ED? Studies have shown that if you suffer from gum diseases or you have chronically inflamed periodontitis, you have an increased chance of suffering from ED. There was a recent study done on mice, which suggests that there is a link between ED and gum diseases. But what this connection between gum disease and erectile dysfunction in humans is, is not clear till now. If a person suffers from gum disease, this is a sign that the person has poor health in general and this has been linked to the person having an increased risk of suffering from heart disease, which happens to be yet another indicator of a risk factor for ED. Medicines Taken For Enlarged Prostate And Hair Loss: There are some medicines which when used to treat an enlarged prostate and hair loss in men, can lead to a man suffering from loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. These medicines work by decreasing the amount of dihydrotestosterone that circulates in the blood. Dihydrotestosterone is the sex hormone of males, which helps a man in keeping his sex drive. Cycling: If you spend too many hours cycling, that too without changing your position, this can result in damage to your nerves and this can give rise to erectile dysfunction. Male Friends And Colleagues: Her male friends, your male friends, her male colleagues, your male colleagues – they can cause you to suffer from ED. Yes, no matter how hard you might find this to believe, studies have shown that this is true. Your wife or fiancé or sexual partner spending more time with male friends - yours or hers and colleagues - yours or hers, is a condition that can cause you to suffer from erectile dysfunction. Studies indicate that if your wife or fiancé got closer to friends or colleagues, your chances of you keeping an erection or even getting it, can be much lower, as compared to a man whose wife or partner did not associate with male friends or male colleagues. High Levels Of Cholesterol: If your level of cholesterol is high, it increases your chances of you getting atherosclerosis, a condition in which the arteries become narrow and also clog. And the result is the reduction in the flow of blood. Because of this, the arteries which are present in your penis, are not able to let enough blood flow into your penis, to give you an erection. Other Erectile Dysfunction Causes There are many other reasons why you could suffer from erectile dysfunction and some of these are: •	Smoking: This leads to damage of your blood vessels, inclusive of those blood vessels that supply blood to your penis. Without blood flowing in to your penis, you would not be able to get an erection. •	Peyronie’s Disease: This disease causes your penis to be curved and when you get an erection, it gives you a lot of pain and thus causes you to suffer from ED. •	Diabetes: If you have diabetes, your nerves and blood vessels are affected. And due to this, you are at an increased risk of suffering from ED. •	Medicines: ED can also take place as a result of it being the side effects of some medicines used such as medicines for epilepsy, medicines used to lower cholesterol, antipsychotics, medicines used to treat high blood pressure and antidepressants. •	Depression: When you are depressed, it can cause you to lose interest in having sex and lead to you suffering from erectile dysfunction. •	Relationship Issues: You may be facing relationship issues with your sexual partner or with some other people in or out of the house or even at your job and this could also be a reason for you to suffer from ED. •	Loss Of Interest In Your Partner: You may no longer like your partner, the way you once used to and this could also lead to you suffering from ED. •	Anxiety And Stress: If you are stressed out or if you are anxious about some things in your life, you could suffer from ED.

6,Types of Environmental Remediation,social-issues," The Environmental Protect Agency and other federal and state agencies have over twenty-year experience managing the environmental reclamation and site remediation activities at mine and industrial sites. Since this time they have developed, tested and deployed multiple cleanup technologies that have proven successful in the cleaning up of polluted mine and processing sites. As cleanups continue at different mine sites, the EPA and environmental engineers are continuing to develop additional technologies that are more efficient and effective at cleaning up hazardous locations. It is important the environmental engineer and the environmental cleanup company have a deep understanding of the technique and type of environmental remediation being used. Some methods are effective at a small scale but will fail when implemented over a large area. While other methods are not effective at all for the type of pollution being cleaned up. Top Conventional Environmental Remediation Techniques and Soil Treatment Methods Conventional technologies have been used the longest by environmental engineers and environmental cleanup contractors to perform remediation at mine sites. These technologies have been used on small scale and wide-scale reclamation projects to treat soil pollution across the United States. Chemical Treatment With this type of treatment, remedial systems are developed that introduce reagents into the soil or groundwater and modify the organic and inorganic contaminants and convert the pollution into environmentally less damaging forms. One of the most common and widely accepted forms of chemical treatment at mine sites is the use of lime to neutralize acid rock drainage. Stabilization Stabilization is changing the contaminants to a less mobile or soluble form thereby making it less hazardous to the environment. For example, stabilization could be used to treat soil pollution found in a sludge slurry by changing the pH of the sludge to make it less mobile. Another form often used for stabilization is the capping of soil pollution. In this case, a clean cap of soil is placed over the polluted soil to protect it from running into streams and rivers. Solidification This process involves making the pollution solid, such as capping or mixing the pollution into a concrete block. The contaminant migration is restricted vastly by decreasing the surface area exposed to leaching or runoff from rain and stormwater. Decontamination of Buildings Often when a mine site has finished operations, historical preservation is requested of the buildings. When this occurs, the structures themselves will need to be decontaminated. Decontamination could be as simple as washing the building or as complicated as removing asbestos from the interior walls and ceilings. Landfill Disposal Landfill disposal of soil pollution is one of the most common methods of disposal and is an example of encapsulation site remediation. Landfills are designed to accept waste for permanent disposal. Landfills used for site remediation and polluted soil are often designed to be lined to protect against leachate and have specially designed caps to project against stormwater and erosion. Using a landfill for disposal of mine waste can be significant as the site must be maintained and protected for as long as there is an environmental risk. Environmental Remediation Companies According to Manta, there are over 3,300 environmental remediation companies located in the United States. One of the main reasons for there being so many companies is site remediation requires a significant amount of local knowledge. The environmental engineer must have an in-depth understanding of the local environmental reclamation requirements, a history of the site, and relationships with federal and local contractors. With this in mind, it is usually better to work with a small environmental engineering business rather than a large national or multinational firm."

8,How To Be a Perfect Sugar Daddy?,social-issues," After a busy day of work, do you want someone to comfort and accompany you, making you feel relaxed and happy outside of work? Are you also looking for mutual beneficial relationships? And do you want to meet a dating partner with benefits? Life is short, If you don't want to waste too much time looking for sugar baby, then you can follow the following principles. 1.Where to find your sugar baby? In some reputable dating sites to find your sugar baby, membership fees are nothing for you, a good sugar baby will give you double returns. You are treating the liaison as a dating relationship, not looking for a client. Anyway, Sugar baby is not a sex worker. You need to find a regular sugar baby or sugar daddy dating site, not some spam porn sites. Don't join some free dating sites because you are afraid of spending money. There is no free lunch in the world. You should know better than us. 2.Don't talks about your former sugar baby all the time. No one wants to hear you, how attractive it is to your former sugar baby. No matter how sexy your former sugar baby is, how beautiful, how to obey, that is just a former. Because she didn't participate in your previous life, she won't be interested in listening to you. She is more expecting your current life style. 3.Don't try to control their life. Although you pay to date her, but you can't buy her all. Don't try to control all of her life, give her plenty of freedom, she will admire you more. Even a very intimate couple, they each have their own private space, and money can't buy everything. Many rich people have some desire to control. But she is a living person, not an item. 4.Don't use violence against your sugar baby. Many sugar daddies think that as long as I have enough money, I can buy everything, so I can do whatever I want. Violence is an act that we strongly disapprove and endure. Maybe you want to vent your stress, anger, but violence is definitely not the best and the only solution. Every baby should feel like a princess. I know that does not fly with today culture. Woman should be treated well. 5.Don't be too embarrassed about your baby. Frankly speaking, sugar baby is a sugar baby because of lack of money, so since you have become someone's sugar daddy, don't yell at your money, generous sugar daddy will attract more baby. In any case, this is a world full of temptations, everyone needs what they want, Everyone needs to pay to get what they want."
9,Legal Advice for your Retirement,social-issues," By the year 2040 one in 12 of us in the UK will be aged over 80.  Currently, approximately 20% of the Scottish population is of retirement age.  Many of those people are still extremely fit and active and are enjoying their retirement to the full. We all wish to have a long and healthy retirement, however, we believe it makes sense to plan for your future especially whilst you are in a position to make the best decisions for yourself. Everybody should put in place plans for future care, and legal protection to look after their affairs. POWER OF ATTORNEY This is a very useful legal tool which everyone should consider putting in place. By making a Lasting Power of Attorney, you are able to choose who will have the legal authority to manage your affairs and speak on your behalf, if in the future, you lose the capacity to do so because of physical illness, frailty or mental health issues. It is a comfort to know that one or two people whom you trust completely and who know your preferences and life choices, will be able to stand in for you when you are in need of help. A word of caution. We advise against having joint Attorneys. By all means, have more than one who can each act for you alone but it can be complex if two people have to be present together at, say, a bank branch, in order to take any action. There are two types of Lasting Power of Attorney; one dealing with property and finance and the other concerned with health and welfare matters. Your solicitor will be able to provide you with the best legal advice for your circumstances and needs. CARE HOME PLANNING You may be lucky and remain fit and well throughout your retirement. You may even be certain that you will not require the services of a care home. However, none of us really know if our health will remain, so we believe it is wise to be prepared. If you have thought about what you want while you are still fit and healthy, it will help your family hugely if your health does deteriorate. Advice from your solicitor can help smooth the process of choosing to move to a care home. They can help in the following ways: Write a Will which helps preserve your assets for your family and minimise care home costs. Help you budget your money and arrange for all your bills to be paid. Deal with your state benefits and apply for additional benefits if you are eligible. Sort out your tax affairs including Income Tax. Deal with the Local Authority on your behalf. WRITE A WILL It is extremely important to write a Will, even if it is very straightforward and simple. Once done it means your wishes will be granted no matter what happens in your future. Your assets, no matter how small or large will be passed to your chosen beneficiaries according to the terms specified in your Will. Making a Will is relatively quick and simple. It can also give you peace of mind, knowing that your affairs are in order, so that everything will be straightforward for your family and loved ones. Some Solicitors will help you write a standard Will for a fixed price and will also store your Will. We strongly advise you to take advise from your Solicitor while you are fit and well so that you can have peace of mind that all your affairs are in order. Enjoy your retirement! You deserve it. And we hope you remain fit and healthy for a very long time."
10,What are the Wonderful Benefits of Tantric Massage Therapy?,social-issues," The hectic and busy life of today  impacts men, as well as, women. It causes physical, mental, emotional and  sexual exhaustion and disorders. What people need is some kind of relief from  their daily chores and tasks. For this purpose, massage serves as a wonderful  means of enjoying comfort and relaxation. Massage is relaxing and it also helps  in regaining energy. Now, there are several types of  massages available in London. However, the most popular and highly sought-after  rubdown therapy is considered to be tantric  therapy in London. The main  focus of this therapy is to offer sexual delight, along with complete  relaxation that results in better health and well-being. Even though it is an  erotic massage, the purpose of massaging the particular erogenous zones is to  bring out the joy that pleases and satisfies the entire body. A tantric therapy  provides myriad benefits. Take a look at some of them below. Relief from stress Stress has become a part and parcel  of today’s fast-paced lives. The pressure of working long hours in the office,  making constant decisions, managing family and work, and such other things  cause stress. But, tantric massage therapy helps in making the body feel light  and clears the mind. It also helps in relieving all kinds of stress and tension.  So, once in a while, it is good to treat yourself to a therapeutic and relaxing  sensual tantric rubdown. Prevents premature ejaculation In men, premature ejaculation occurs  mainly because of the pressures of performing. Since men are considered to be  ‘doers’, they have to face a lot of pressure when it comes to performing in  bed. Sometimes, this pressure gets too much and results in premature  ejaculation. On the other hand, if men engage in regular tantric rubdown  therapy, it can help to take some of that pressure off of them. Also, this  erotic therapy makes men feel confident of themselves that helps them perform  better in bed. This way the problem of premature ejaculation is tackled. So, if  you are facing such an issue, you can reach out to an experienced tantric  masseuse. Sex education In cultures around the world, sex  education is just adequate. This is why both genders are generally unprepared  for sexual interaction or any kind of sensuality. Getting a tantric massage is  one of the best ways to explore one’s body and learn how each part responds to  sensual touch. The massage also provides insight into what the body is and  which specific parts react to certain sensations. This way it can teach you to  how sexually pleasure yourself and your partner. Eliminates blockages Blockages in your body and mind can  stem from different sources. The origin of some blockages might often be  unknown. This is why you need a mindful massage that caters to both your  physical and mental facilities. A professional tantric masseuse will be able to  sense your blockages and apply specific techniques to alleviate them. Once the  massage session is over, you will be swept with feelings of freedom,  contentment and relief. Realising full orgasmic potential Contrary to what you have been  taught your whole life, the pinnacle of a sexual encounter is not supposed to  be a transitory and brief moment of gratification. It is supposed to be an  extended state of bliss that can last for several hours. But, when your sexual  energy is only condensed towards your genitals, the result will be explosive  orgasm that will be fleeting and short. However, tantric massage helps in  dispersing the sexual energy throughout your body, which makes it possible for  you to make love and have a full-body experience. You will be capable of  experiencing orgasms on your entire body. So, when in London, do not hesitate  to consider getting a tantric massage. You will readily find experienced  therapists with the knowledge of performing authentic tantric therapy. She will  alleviate your stress and take you on a wild journey."
11,Will Marijuana Users Pay More for Life Insurance Coverage as New Research Emerges?,social-issues," Although the recreational use of marijuana officially became legal in Canada on October 17, 2018, cannabis still remains a heavily debated topic for both consumers and business owners. The laws regarding the use and selling of cannabis differ from province to province. In Ontario, businesses in the marijuana industry must carry $15 million in cannabis insurance, specifically Product Recall coverage, while in British Columbia, the requirement is $10 million. These inconsistencies have caused many insurance carriers in Canada to be wary of providing coverage. The same can be said about medical marijuana insurance. Although Canada was a pioneer in approving medical marijuana, with courts ruling that Canadians have a constitutional right to use cannabis medically, insurers are still treading carefully, and coverage varies. Many Canadians assumed insurance rates would go down because of last year’s law change, but that might not be the case after all. How Marijuana Impacts Insurance Rates Although both recreational and medical marijuana use are now legal in Canada, the negative social stigma associated with cannabis hasn’t disappeared. It is still being factored into the formulas insurance companies use to price their policies, but the key lies in what is considered to be a low-risk user and a high-risk user. This means that when you apply for life insurance in Canada, you will be asked about your frequency of marijuana use. If your marijuana use isn’t chronic, then you won’t be penalized in the same way a cigarette smoker is — premiums for smokers can be three times higher than those of non-smokers. Insurance companies consider a smoker to be anyone who has had tobacco in the last 12 months but, according to The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, Canadians who only smoke up to two marijuana joints a week are considered low-risk users and should not pay more for their life insurance premiums than non-smokers. Insurance companies that follow this recommendation will class occasional marijuana users as ""non-smokers,"" and you will likely not be seen as a high insurance risk. However, now that the ban on marijuana has been lifted, a new era of research is emerging. As more and more research is revealed regarding the plant, extracts, and pharmaceutical usage, the landscape of insurance policies and premiums will change. The Impact of New Data Insurance companies are going to start using more and more data to evaluate the risk and exposures of their potential clients. A person’s occupation, their activities and hobbies, their income, and even the area they live are factors that will be used to determine how to underwrite them. While term and permanent insurance policies don’t have much of a difference in terms of cannabis use, fully underwritten policies and simplified issue policies do. The former has lower rates but more stringent requirements. Your application may include a blood test, a urine sample, and less flexibility in regards to cannabis usage. The latter has no medical tests, just a series of health questions, and while the premiums are higher, the restrictions on usage are a little more relaxed. The Bottom Line Legalized cannabis is here to stay so you can breathe a sigh of relief and safely enjoy the occasional joint without being charged a higher insurance premium. However, the definition of safe use is still being determined. No matter how much cannabis you consume throughout the week, you should never lie on your life insurance application. If you aren’t completely truthful and your medical exam reveals you recently consumed cannabis, then be prepared to set off a lot of alarms. If your insurance company senses any red flags, that’s when your premiums may substantially increase, or your application is denied altogether. You may also have to undergo intrusive medical testing."
12,What is the Difference Between Body to Body and Nuru Massage?,social-issues," Asia is renowned for a number of  things like, its creativity, work ethics, technological advances and crazy  fashion sense. But, one thing that nobody talks about is Asia’s sexual attitude  and the general attitude that the continent has towards sex. As a matter of  fact, Asia is responsible for the birth of erotic, exotic massage therapies  that provide complete physical, mental and sexual pleasure. Body to body and  Nuru massages are two such Asian erotic massage therapies that have grown in  popularity and thoroughly enjoyed by people in London and other parts of the  world. Both body to body and Nuru massage  are therapies that are known for their intimate nature. These massage therapies  are memorable as they are given and received completely naked. Here, the masseuse  not only uses her hands, but her entire body. The recipient can feel the  feminine curves pressing against his skin. This is what makes these two  therapies a highly sought-after and enjoyable experience. Main difference between body to body and Nuru rubdown Even though both body to body and  Nuru massages involve skin-to-skin contact and the therapists use their entire  bodies to massage the recipient, there are slight differences. Nuru massage is a specific type of  massage that originated in Japan and it makes use of a special gel made of nori  seaweed. This gel is known as Nuru gel and it is specific to Nuru massage. The  gel is tasteless, odourless, colourless and it does not stain. Also, the gel is  extremely slippery and makes it easier for the masseuse to smoothly slide and  glide across the body of the recipient. On the other hand, body to body  massage makes use of massage oils. These oils might be slippery, but not as  much as a Nuru gel. Therapists are not able to smoothly slide their bodies as  they do during a Nuru rubdown. However, masseuses can stroke, grind and rub  during a body to body massage in Knightsbridge. With the absence of a  slippery gel, friction is created between the two naked bodies and a lot of  people seem to enjoy that. Another difference is that  recipients are asked to step into a hot shower with the therapist. This is  because the Nuru gel is best applied when mixed with warm water. Also, warm  water helps to soften the skin so that the Nuru gel is readily absorbed. As for  a body to body massage, you might not be invited to share a steamy shower with  your chosen therapist. The sensations Body to body and Nuru massages make  use of myriad grinding, rubbing, pressing and stroking motions. The feeling of  a well-shaped, gorgeous woman’s body rubbing against the naked skin feels  amazing. Recipients get to enjoy the warmth and feel all the edges and curves.  This is what makes both the massage therapies so unique and popular. They take  sensual massage to another level. As for the difference in sensations,  the use of Nuru gel allows for minimum friction during a Nuru massage session.  Therapists are able to easily slide up and down the recipient’s body. However,  owing to the slipperiness, there is little body control. But, body to body massage  has the perfect amount of friction. When the friction gets too much, the  therapist makes use of massage oils or moisturisers. This helps to soften the  friction and take the receiver on a beautiful journey of intimacy. When it comes to body to body and Nuru massages,  there is no question of which is better. Both of these therapies are super  intimate, steamy and erotic. It depends on what mood you are in. If you are  tired of getting the same old traditional massage and want to switch things up,  you can go for either body to body or Nuru. However, if you have already tried  a body to body massage in Knightsbridge and want spicier experiences, a Nuru  massage is the obvious choice."
13,Why You Should Know Your Bloodline,social-issues," Why A Bloodline Cannot Be Changed Outside God When a person who has been in the enemy’s lineage has been saved, it does not matter whether he was once of the enemy. What matters is that he is now of the Lord’s sheep pen. If a person who has not been in the Lord’s sheep pen expects to avoid the cunningness of the enemy, he is deceived! The enemy is his own father, he cannot out trick him! If he could, he would have been as cunning as his father. There is no one that the Lord has made who can out trick the enemy apart from the Lord Himself! All other attempts at beating his cunningness outside the Lord’s will are in vain. What is the Lord’s will concerning people who have constantly rejected the Lord yet they are of the Lord’s bloodline? Such people are destined for hell! When they reach hell, they are the ones that are the most active because they still have their birthright in hell! They usually give while on earth and that is the reason why they have chances to make it to heaven. What is the difference between a bloodline and a birthright? A bloodline cannot be stolen whilst a birthright can be stolen by the enemy or by a man. When a birthright is stolen, the rightful owner can get it back through the Lord. A bloodline is blood that is either from the Lord or from the serpent. There is no other bloodline on earth apart from those two. Both bloodlines have birthrights, the birthrights of the Lord’s bloodline are always coveted by the enemy because he knows the worth of the Lord’s bloodline. The bloodline of the enemy is the one we may covet because the riches attached to it are most pronounced. It, however, comes with hidden curses attached to it as well. Why A Person Of The Lord's Bloodline Is Always In Disagreement With A Person Of The Enemy's Bloodline A person who has the enemy's bloodline is always antagonistic to the Lord. If the Lord says tarry! He will say, it is time to move! If the Lord says go! He will say it is time to stop! A person who has been in God's presence is always in disagreement with anyone who is of the enemy's bloodline. A person who is of the enemy's bloodline is highly susceptible to being exposed if he is a wolf in sheep clothing among God's people. It means that if he is practicing falsehood among God's people, he will be exposed by the power of the Holy Ghost. Anyone who has a bishop in his environment and is an agent of the enemy will be exposed by God. If you are of the enemy's bloodline, do not attempt to deceive people that you are of God. A person who has been exposed by God as being an agent of the enemy is usually not supposed to stay among God's people. He is not supposed to be involved with people who have God. A person who is of the enemy's bloodline is cursed to distance himself from God and everything that God is including his people! Why An Agent Of The Enemy Should Not Conceal His Sins If a person exposes himself as an agent of the enemy, God will give him the grace to live among His people. If he decides to continue concealing his sin, God will raise up a bishop to expose him and excommunicate him from among His people. A person who has been called an agent of the enemy by God is a person who has cooperated with the enemy to solve a problem that could not be solved by God because it required either restitution or disposing of either cursed property or relationships that are not in God's will. If a person who is an agent of the enemy declines to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, the enemy will usually offer a solution that fits within what he has to offer. An offer from the enemy will always appear to be easier and attractive at the beginning but will become unbearable with time."
14,Tantric Massage - the Most Sensual and Relaxing Experience,social-issues," A tantric massage goes beyond  relaxation.

This  rubdown therapy has all the elements of a regular massage, along with erotic  elements that ensure an overall satisfaction of the body, mind and the soul. The massage starts with a visual treat If you have never got a tantric  massage, it is normal for you to feel nervous and awkward. However, the moment  you meet your chosen massage therapist, she will instantly make you feel at  ease. Usually, tantric massages are performed by massage girls who are not just  experienced in the art of tantra massage, but flaunts strikingly good looks.  These girls dress seductively, dim the lights and play soothing music so that  you are visually aroused. This adds to the overall experience of the massage. Muscle relaxation, along with sexual arousal Initially, a tantric massage starts  like a traditional massage. The therapist focuses on loosening the muscles on  the back, neck, shoulders, arms and legs. She also massages the head and back  of the ears as those are some of the most stressed areas of a person’s body.  Once these knots are ironed out and you feeling comfortable in her company, she  will request you to lie on your back, facing her. Using her soft hands, she  will gently caress your body and slowly her hands will inch towards your  erogenous zones. You can feel her fingers exploring your inner thighs whilst  the back of her hand is brushing against your genitals. Whilst the teasing goes  on for a few minutes, you can be sure of getting your sexual relief. The reason why a tantric massage  includes touching and caressing of the genitals is because it is believed that  genitals accumulate a lot of sexual tension. With the release of this tension,  an individual will be able to control his orgasm for longer, get better  erections and have much more enjoyable sexual experiences. It is this combination of genuine  relaxation and sensual stimulation that makes a tantra massage in Earls popular amongst people. This therapy provides the recipient what they need,  along with sexual satisfaction. Nothing beats a tantric massage Tantric massage is a step above  other types of massages. It is a massage therapy where the recipient is  pampered to the highest level and his sensual desires are brought to the fore.

This massage will cater to your relaxation  and sexual needs. However, it is important to remember that a tantric massage  is not a glorified term for sex, which means that you should not meet your  therapist hoping for some kind of penetration. In Earls, you will find several  agencies offering discreet tantric massage services that can be enjoyed in the  comfort of your home or in the incall apartment of your chosen therapist. Go  through the agency’s gallery carefully to choose the right kind of masseuse who  makes you go weak in the knees. This is important as a tantric massage  experience starts the moment you meet your therapist. You must feel excited  looking at your therapist as that will make it easier for your hidden urges and  cravings to come to the fore. Book an appointment and have fun."
15,Herpes Dating Tips: How To Success At An Online Dating Site,social-issues," Many young and active singles with herpes like yourself use popular online dating sites or apps to make friends, connect with others, date and search for a long-term relationship.

For any single living with herpes, your best online alternative for dating is with an STD specific dating site, or herpes specific dating site, that caters to anyone with an STD and offers a large and welcoming community of active singles. After selecting a herpes dating site or two to try out, here is a set of dating tips to make your experience more rewarding and fulfilling.  You might even discover your soulmate and begin a lifelong relationship filled with love and happiness.  Following are a series of online herpes dating tips from online dating experts, designed to optimize your success on online herpes dating site: First impressions are what it’s all about. Create a profile that is intriguing, interesting, and shows different aspects of yourself, yet is honest.  Your profile should be written to attract the sort of person you are interested in and peak their interest.  For example, if you are really into outdoor activities, mention the types of things you like to do and invite people to join you. Post flattering photos of yourself, and only yourself. Again, this is all about first impressions.  Your personality should shine through in your photos.  Be happy, excited and engaging.  Since this is a dating site, don’t use photos of yourself with others, even if it is a brother or sister.  People are only interested in you.  Take advantage of all the photo uploads available at the site.  If the site you are using allows for five photos, upload five photos showing you doing different interesting things. Your initial messages and exchanges are critical. They should be interesting, exciting, and show interest in the other person.  Read their profile and ask questions about things they are interested in.  Avoid clichés and dull, boring messages.  Create an air of mystery and intrigue about yourself. After a few exchanges, be a little flirtatious and show interest in getting to know this new friend better. Avoid blatant sexual talk or overt sexual innuendo.  That will come along naturally as your relationship progresses. In all exchanges, show interest in getting to know the other person better including their interests, what they are looking for, and any other information they choose to share. Ask questions about the topics they bring up; explore to learn more. Quick response times communicate to the other person that you are interested. Even if you don’t have time for a long exchange of text messages, a short message saying you’d like to talk more tomorrow and asking what time works best for them conveys a high degree of interest and sets an important follow-up date, which you should not be late for or forget about! View the process as a way to attract a quality man or woman that you may not have had an opportunity to meet in real life. Be clear about what you are looking for, take the time to read possible matches’ profiles and get to know them, and be honest about who you are and what you are looking for."

17,How to deal with carnal desires in a christian marriage,social-issues," A man and a woman become one flesh by the bond of marriage (Math 19.5-6). Once married, the man is the husband and the woman, the wife. Marriage must be between one man and one woman (Gen 2.20-25). Marriage must not be between people of the same blood (Lev 18). The marriage bed must not be defiled (Mat 5.27-28). The marriage must not be dissolved except for sexual immorality or illegitimate marriages (Mat 5.32). The primary purpose of marriage is raising a family unto the glory of God. Christians, both man and woman, must submit to one another (1 Peter 5.5) and love one another (John 15.12). In the body of Christ, we are all brethren and we submit to Christ, the head. In Christ, man and woman should submit to one another. In Christ, the man should submit to the woman even if they are married. The body of Christ (God’s family) is bigger than the body of the man (man’s family). In Christ, man and woman should love one another. In Christ, the woman should love the man as Christ has loved us, even if they are married. If we love and submit to one another, there will be no need for more laws. Love fulfills the law, even the laws of marriage. Love submits to and serves another. Love respects another. Love shows affection. Love is not selfish. Due to the weakness of the human nature (little ability to love), emphasis must be made in the key areas of marriage: As for you, let each one love his wife as himself, and let the wife respect her husband"" (Ephesian 5.33). The husband, because he is head, must be obeyed by the members of his household. The respect of obedience or submission is gained by one’s position, not by his deeds. Even bad husbands must be obeyed. A bad king must always be obeyed as king even if he is bad. In marriage, the wife submits to (obeys) the husband (Eph 5.22). The husband, because he is the head, must love the members of his household. The elder serves the younger. He who is the greatest is the servant of all (Mat 23.11). Respect can be obedience or admiration. Obedience is earned by one’s position, but admiration is earned by love (sacrificial and affectionate love). The man wins the admiration of his household by love. A couple that obeys the law of Christ, will satisfy the law of marriage. Both submits to one another as commanded by Christ and both love one another as commanded by Christ. Humility and selflessness is the garment of all Christians whether man or woman. The wife will always feel loved and respected and the husband too will feel respected and loved. The law of Christ is meant to bring all men (whether man or woman) to the complete image of Christ. In the flesh, the woman is more inclined to receive love and the man more inclined to receive respect. However, our bond in Christ is higher than all fleshly bonds and we should let ourselves to be ruled by the bond we have in Christ. The life of the spirit should prevail above the flesh. The Lord Jesus submits to the Father in all things. The church submits to the Lord in all things. The brethren in church (both man and woman) submits to one another in all things. In marriage, the wife should be quicker to submit to the husband because he is the head of the body. The entire church should submit to earthly authorities in all matters that do not contradict the will of God. The Heavenly Father loves the son; the son loves his bride (church), the church must love another as Christ has loved us. In marriage, the husband should be quicker to love to his wife. The entire church should love their unbelieving neighbors. God punished Adam and Eve for their sin of disobedience in the garden of Eden. Adam would toil to get bread for his family. Eve would suffer birth pangs when bringing forth her children and she would still desire her husband. Do these curses affect our marriages? If they do, can we be set free? Adam’s curse: Before the fall, the earth tilled and watered itself to bring forth food for man but after the fall, it stopped. Man began toil to get food. Man is the breadwinner of his home. He must till the soil and bring out food for his family. The curse was true and binding until the coming of the Lord Jesus, the last Adam. All who are in Christ are free from the curse. It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep (Psalm 127.2). But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Mat 6.33). Though the earth no longer tills itself, the LORD blesses the handwork of his children. They do not have to toil as much as the sinners do to get food. If we pursue obedience and faith in God, he will meet our daily needs. Eve’s Curse: Eve was cursed with pain in childbearing. Can a woman be free from this pain? Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth (Mat 9.23). All things are possible to those who believe in the Son of God. You can have a pain free delivery if you believe without doubting in your heart. The church of Corinth faced carnal issues on sex and self-control. Apostle Paul gave his opinion (not God’s commandment) on how to tackle their problems (1 Corinth 7). He said; Since the people have strong desire (lust)for sex Since sexual immorality is rampant among them Since they lack self-control They should: Marry than burn They should not refuse one another in bed They should not stay away apart from each other for a long time except for prayers. They should do these so that the devil will not tempt them to sin because of their lack of self-control. Still, he would wish that all believers will remain unmarried as he were so that they can give themselves entirely to the Lord. Paul’s advice was directed to a carnal church. The church of God is not supposed to be carnal. There is no other word that can be given to a carnal church except that they stop being carnal. As the church, they must do away with their strong sexual desire and lack of self-control. Apostle Paul’s counsel is an opinion, not based on God’s word and thus, it is not the standard for the church to follow. The word of God on the matter was for them to stop being carnal. If they crucify their flesh, they will no longer be tempted by it. They should deal away with the lust and lack of self-control in their hearts. Marriage, frequent sex, not refusing your spouse in bed, as Paul suggested, will not treat the lust in their heart. People must not marry for sexual gratification, nor must they give themselves to sex nor burden their spouses with it. Unrestrained bodily desire is not a fruit of the spirit of Christ but of the flesh. The fruit of the spirit of Christ is self-control and selflessness. The life of the spirit of Christ can strengthen us to control our sexual desires. God created air, food, water, sex, etc. for survival of humanity. He did not create only these things, but he also created human appetite for them. The primary purpose of the appetite was not for enjoyment but to enable us to do them. It is not easy to eat, drink or sex if you do not have the desire or appetite. To the best of my knowledge, female animals, including the woman, go on heat during ovulation. Ovulation is a natural time where a female desires sex for pregnancy. During ovulation, the woman desires sex without any stimulation from the man. The female animal does not accept a male animal no matter the extent of his appeal except when she is on heat. Women were not created as sex objects to satisfy the men. They are created to bear forth children to the glory of God. The man’s sexual desire is usually stronger than that of the women because he is by nature created to ensure continuity of his lineage. However, both men and women should exercise self-control over all bodily appetites and watch against self-indulgence, lest we become slaves to our own human desires. We cannot put a thump rule on how many times sex is appropriate, but we can say that we must keep in mind the purpose why God created sex and regulate ourselves accordingly. He who loves the world makes himself an enemy of God (James 4.4). The things of the world (1 John 2.16) are: The desires of the eyes The desires of the flesh (the human nature) The pride of life It is a sin to live to self-pleasure rather than to live for God. Do not set your mind on enjoying sex, rather set your mind on things of heaven. If you are in a marriage that is not very sexual, instead of working to increase the sexual satisfaction, drive your energy towards self-control, love for your spouse and the things of the Spirit of Christ. If you are in a marriage that is not at all sexual, and your spouse will not respond to you, you must not think of divorce, but run to Christ for grace to deny self and to stay married. You are in a difficult marriage, and you are more vulnerable to temptation. The Lord Jesus can strengthen us to deny self and win over the flesh. We must watch over our hearts not to be overtaken by the pleasures or cares of womanhood (Luke 21.34). Women, by nature, desire attention, affection, romance, love & emotional intimacy from the male spouse. While we are aware of these natural tendencies, we must remember that we are to live after the spirit of Christ and not after the human nature. We must be careful not to live for these natural or carnal desires, rather pursue God’s desire. Women must be careful not to make their husbands slaves to their desires. In Christ, we are all free. A woman who pursues much intimacy with her husband will scarcely have her mind on God. We can enjoy these things, but we must be careful not to run after them. Our happiness must not depend on them. A true disciple of the Lord is one who carries a cross of self-denial. The woman should by the power of the spirit of Christ, bring her natural tendencies to control. If you are in a marriage where your spouse does not give you time or attention, do not think of leaving the marriage. If your marriage is emotionally unsatisfactory, and your spouse will not repent, you cannot divorce, rather run to Christ, for the grace to deny self. The solution will not necessarily be for your spouse to spend more time with/on you, rather, you should deny self and redirect your heart to God. If much of your heart and mind is set on your marriage, you will never be available for God. By the power of the spirit, if you want, you can be an eunuch for the kingdom of God."
18,The Masks & Fruit of false teachers in the Church of God,social-issues," ""Now there were false prophets among the people, just as there also will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many people will follow their immoral ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned. In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. The ancient verdict against them is still in force, and their destruction is not delayed"" (2 Pete 2.1-3). The above verse makes us to understand that these false teachers are not going to come out from the world; rather they shall rise from among the righteous. The devil uses false teachers to hit and attack the church, so that many will be lost and never get to find the way that leads to heaven. Many will follow their ways and end up in perdition. The Mask of False Teachers The devil’s teachers mask themselves with some righteous deeds: They ""believe"" ""Jesus Christ"" They preach ""Jesus Christ"" They look harmless and humble They perform signs and wonders that marvel people They do some charitable works A person who does these things may quickly be called a man of God, but they may not be so. A false teacher is not known by some outward works, rather they are known by their fruit – the nature of their person. ""Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are savage wolves. You will know them by their fruit. Grapes aren’t gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles, are they?"" (Mathew 7.15-16). Remember, they preach another Jesus (not Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible). The motive of their charity works is questionable. The Fruit of a False Teacher The three principal marks/fruit of a false teacher are; Greed Sexual Immorality Selfish Ambition If a preacher has one or two of these attributes, then know that he is a false teacher. Even if he calls down fire from heaven, run away from him as fast as you can. The devil is moving about confirming the wrong teachings of these teachers with signs and wonders. If you follow the signs instead of the fruit, then you are doomed. Greed is idolatry (Col. 3.5; Mat 6.24). Idolatry is a sin punishable by death (Rev. 21.8). There are diverse kinds of greed (Luke 12.15); Lack of contentment Stinginess Stealing Cheating Anxiety Storing up for tomorrow keeping more than you need Fighting over property Refusal to share Sharing only an insignificant portion of your wealth Murmuring and grumbling These false teachers have more than enough wealth that can last them five life times. They have so much while most of their church members are so poor. They do not only refuse to really help these poor people, but they still demand and collect from them. Their wealth is counted in millions of dollars. They live in mansions, drive expensive cars, wear designers’ outfit, own private jets, their children are in choice schools worldwide etc. A preacher who is rich cannot be a disciple of Christ. The disciples of Christ give up their all for the kingdom of God (Mathew 19.27). Love puts the needs of others first. God’s servants obey him, and they give even to the last penny. These false teachers are going straight to hell and taking many with them. They suffer the righteous people both spiritually and materially. A preacher who cannot control his fleshly sexual desire is a false teacher. God does not work though carnal people, rather he works through people who are led by his spirit. God works in people before he uses them for any service. God is holy, and his servants are holy. Do not follow an immoral preacher even if he raises someone from the dead. Ambition is a trait that is applauded by the world but in God’s kingdom, ambition for self is sinful (Phil 2.3). These false teachers preach Christ to satisfy their selfish ambitions (Phil 1.17). They desire to promote self, more than anything else. They are more earth than heaven conscious. They desire the pride of life and earthly possessions. They desire fame, political power, institutional positions and the comforts of life. They point their institutional ministries to people instead of pointing the Lord Jesus Christ to people. Beware of false teachers! ""Many people will follow their immoral ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned. In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words"" (2 Pet 2.2). ""…because false messiahs (christs) and false prophets will appear and display great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect"" (Mat 24.24). ""Christ"" means anointed one. This means that in the last days many false anointed ones will come. Many will come saying that they are anointed by God, but they are of the devil. We are in the dark times, may the Lord be your light."

2,Learn the Difference Between Nuru and Tantric Massage,social-issues," Massage is always soothing and relaxing, but this becomes  more erotic when it involves the sensual touch of a masseuse.

Amongst all the  raunchy massages, Nuru and Tantra hold special mention. Both the massages are  extremely erotic, but have dissimilar goals and techniques.

The chosen lady focuses on energy and chakras to relax a  person physically and mentally. She awakes the chakras so that the recipient  connects deeply with her/his soul in a completely safe and undisturbed  ambience. Tantra is a path to enlightenment, and the lady makes sure that the  receiver attains utmost pleasure in the end.

She  also pays attention to the penis/vulva of the recipient so get him/her sexually  aroused and transfer this energy throughout the body. Orgasm is not the goal,  but it is necessary. Before moving to the erogenous body parts, the tantric  specialist erotically rubs the chest/breasts, abdomen, thighs, feet, back  muscles of the receiver to evoke the chakras.

5,Loss Of Sex Drive Affects A Lot Of People,social-issues," Loss of libido, or sex drive, is something that can affect many men and women in their lifetimes. According to the NHS there is no such thing as a ""normal"" libido because everyone’s sex drive is different. However, there are a lot of things that can affect it. Simply being with a partner for a long time and becoming over-familiar is one reason, while another can be loss of sexual attraction. Regular arguments can cause problems, as can poor communication and/or difficulty in trusting one another. Physical problems can also have a great effect. If the cause is physical, a low sex drive can be the result of inability to orgasm, painful sex, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation problems, or vaginal dryness. There is also a condition called vaginismus which is involuntary tightening of the vagina. Stress and anxiety are more causes of low sex drive. This can be because of problems at work, insufficient income, or simply feeling tired all the time. Depression is another cause, and according to the NHS this is not just feeling unhappy or sad for a short time. It consists of feelings of extreme sadness that will not go away, feeling hopeless, and losing interest in things that you used to do and that you enjoyed doing. If this should happen, you are advised to talk to your GP about it. (1) Simply getting older can also have an effect. You may have falling levels of sex hormones as a result of ageing – testosterone in men - and testosterone and oestrogen in women just before, during, and after the menopause. There could also be mobility problems or the side effects of medications that you have been prescribed. Women can lose interest in sex during pregnancy, after giving birth, and while breastfeeding. Drinking too much alcohol and/or the use of so-called ""recreational"" drugs can also have a bearing on your sex drive. In addition, health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, or thyroid problems can also be a cause. As you can see, there are many things that can affect the sex drive and loss of libido, and one of the more common is erectile dysfunction in men. According to the US website UW Health, around 5% of men aged 40 have total erectile dysfunction, and that increases to 15% of men aged 70. Mild and moderate erectile dysfunction affects approximately 10% of men per decade of life (i.e. 50% of men in their 50s, 60% of men in their 60s, and so on. Basically, that means that sometimes they can and sometimes they can’t. (2). Fortunately, today there are several medications which can combat erectile dysfunction, the best known of which is, of course, Viagra. It was discovered by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in 1989 when they were searching for a cure for angina, or chest pain. It was being tested on male patients who reported that a side effect was that their erectile dysfunction problem had disappeared or was considerably lessened. Pfizer then created the ""little blue pill"" with its’ diamond shape, and this was then approved for use for erectile dysfunction in the US and Europe in 1998. Pfizer applied for, and was granted, a patent, but that expired in 2013 so it is now legal for any manufacturer to produce a generic version of Viagra. These generic versions contain exactly the same active ingredient as Viagra which is sildenafil. In fact, there is a generic version which is known as Sildenafil and you can buy Sildenafil online today. It is available as Sildenafil 50mg and Sildenafil 100mg and it is always recommended that users commence with the 50mg pill and use it several times to see how well it works for them. In many cases, the 50mg pill will be sufficient, but people do vary, and if it is not proving sufficient, one can increase to the 100mg dose. In order to buy Sildenafil in the UK it is necessary to have a doctor’s prescription, because there could be contra-indications. In other words, a man might have certain conditions which make the use of Sildenafil inadvisable. However, if you want to buy Sildenafil online you can complete an online questionnaire and this will be assessed by a doctor who will then issue a prescription if you are suitable. NHS UK.

6,What Do You Need to Know About Tantric Massage?,social-issues," With stress being a common problem  today, the popularity of relaxing massages has grown exponentially. Not just  stress, but massage helps in dealing with anxiety, heart disorders, headaches  and sometimes, sexual issues. There are various types of massages, but the most  relaxing of them all is considered to be tantric massage. Even though tantric massage is a  full body rubdown therapy, most people think it is only concerned with sexual  gratification. In fact, it is so much more. This bodywork originated thousands  of years ago in the Indian subcontinent. It is only recently that this rubdown  therapy became a go-to solution for relaxing in London. This massage aims at  providing physical, mental, emotional and sensual relaxation. The techniques  applied are erotic in nature and the therapists do not stop at just touching  the recipient’s upper and lower body. During the session, the therapist touches  the receiver’s delicate, intimate parts with the aim of releasing sexual  tension. What is the ancient tradition of tantric massage? According to ancient tantra, it is  believed that the human body consists of various circulatory channels, which  need to be massaged for better circulation of the fluids in the body. This  includes hormones, blood, nerve signals and sweat. When someone receives a  tantric massage, all the channels are opened and provide relief from tension  and pollutants. As your body receives a healthy amount of oxygenated blood  circulation, the skin glands get rid of congestion. This has a good effect on rejuvenating  your sexual energy and strengthening your sensual perception. Since the massage involves caressing  and rubbing delicate parts in varying degrees of pressure, it leads to  awakening the dormant sexual and kundalini energy.

7,Undertake CAT Course to Create a Safe Work Environment,social-issues," Underground cables, pipes and wires can be anywhere, even in places that you least expect it to be. Thanks to rapid urbanisation, there is a constant need to install new cables and wires for buried services.

So, engineers and contractors cannot begin digging the ground for construction or any purpose without carrying out a thorough survey of the place. It is crucial to take the necessary precautions so that cable strikes do not occur. In the UK, there are already a number of reported accidents and injuries during its 60,000 yearly cable strikes. In order to carry out an in-depth survey of a site before excavation, two main tools are used - CAT & Genny. These two equipment can accurately detect and locate underground utility services.

This is why cable strikes happen. But, by undertaking a CAT course from a reliable and professional training provider, contractors or engineers will be able to create a safe working environment for the workers. Typically, a CAT course covers the following topics: 	The dangers and costs of cable strikes 	An overview of the equipment so that you know the use and limitations of the cable avoidance tools 	Location techniques, modes and its limitations 	Depth location 	The different types of underground services and the dangers associated with them 	HSG 47 and a safe working system 	The use of sondes and accessories After the completion of the CAT training course, you will have the expertise needed to use cable avoidance tools.

For instance, your workers might get severe burns if they accidentally hit an electrical cable. They might even be seriously hurt in case of a gas explosion as a result of hitting a gas pipe. Even hitting sewage pipes can make the environment unsafe for your workers. By knowing how to use the CAT, you will be in a position to prevent such situations. You can avoid those areas where utility services are located and instil confidence in your workers that they are safe.

There might be instances when a cable strike does not result in any kind of injury, but the utility services will be disabled for a period of time. It will need repair or replacement. This will cost money and as a contractor, you might have to bear the expenses. You might also have to offer compensation to the buildings in and around the excavation area whose services are gone temporarily. All of this will even result in loss of reputation for your company. But, using cable avoidance tools can prevent such situations. Now that you know the importance and necessity of CAT, all you have to do is get enrolled for a CAT training programme.

11,Reproductive Fluid 101: Everything a Man Needs to Know about His Intense Point,social-issues," That cloudy white, sticky substance that Intense Points forth from a man’s submarine is a bit of a mystery and a miracle. That little bit of opaque goo holds the key to civilization in its weird consistency. So, what is reproductive fluid? What’s it made of and why? Let’s go deep in a man’s most private area and explore the wonders of reproductive fluid. What is reproductive fluid? Reproductive fluid is the opaque white fluid that is released from the urethra and springs out of the member during intense point. It is made up of mobile seed cells and nutrient-rich seminal fluid. The seminal fluid is what transports the seed to the egg (or the tube sock). What’s the difference between reproductive fluid and seed? Seed is in reproductive fluid, and arguably, the most important part of the complex reproductive fluid recipe. Think of it like this, a man is making chocolate chip cookies. Seed is the chocolate chips and reproductive fluid is the whole batter. They’re better together. Where is reproductive fluid made and what does it contain? Seed is made in the reproductive organs and gets stored in the epididymis until needed. When a man is ready to Intense Point, the seed is carried through a passageway called the vas deferens to the urethra to be expelled. While it goes on this voyage, it goes through three different glands, the accessory pleasure glands, which release mucous secretions. They are known as the Cowper’s gland, the prostate gland, and the seminal vesicles. Cowper’s supplies the pre-ejaculatory fluid, the prostate provides a host of minerals, amino acids, and enzymes, and the seminal vesicles supply the majority of the reproductive fluid cocktail with fructose for seed energy and prostaglandins that trigger the Female canal muscles to contract, thus helping escort the seed to the ova. How much reproductive fluid can a man produce? The average man can turn out between two to six milliliters of reproductive fluid each time he Intense Points. To go back to the cookie batter analogy, that’s like the amount of vanilla that’d go into the batter, maybe a bit less. But, just to be clear, don’t actually put it in cookie batter; the cookies will not taste good with the special sauce. What does reproductive fluid taste like? As it contains over 65 percent sugar, it is alleged to taste sweet. However, diet greatly impacts the taste of reproductive fluid and can be like going to a 31 Flavors, just without the Rocky Road. What color should reproductive fluid be? Intense Point is usually clear, white, grayish or a form of all of those with a cloudy look to it. It can, however, be many different colors. Here’s a quick run-down on some of the tints reproductive fluid can take and what they may mean. •	Yellow/Green – It could be urine in the reproductive fluid, which is nothing to be concerned about unless it’s a persistent issue. Diet can also influence seed color (think curry or green juice). Jaundice can also cause a yellow tinge and suggests a liver issue which requires immediate medical help. •	Red/Pink/Orange/Brown – All are a sign of blood in the urine. The more red or pink, the fresher the blood. If it’s more of the orangish brown variety, it’s old blood. Both can be classified as hematospermia, which is associated with STIs, prostate issues, high blood pressure, too rough or vigorous pleasure, excessive self- that causes tears in the skin, and cancer. •	Black – This is again, hematospermia, but the blood is extreme old. It is related to two serious issues which men should seek help for, spinal cord injuries and heavy metal exposure (lead, nickel, etc.). Keeping the reproductive fluid vessel healthy and strong Keeping the member clean and well cared for is just one of the ways a man can be sure his reproductive fluid can exit the premises expertly and with a laser-focus. Keeping the member clean with regular washing and rinsing is a critical part of ensuring a precise aim and avoiding ""backups."" In addition to cleaning, many men have added a specially formulated male organ health creme (health professionals recommend Man 1 Man Oil, which has been clinically proven safe and mild for skin) to their grooming ritual. Using a male organ health crème delivers the important vitamins and amino acids which prevent bacteria from infiltrating the member while strengthening the skin and protecting against environmental free radicals and nerve damage that can make Firms and intense point harder. A generous massage with a nutrient crème like this is one of the best ways to promote male organ health on a daily basis."

13,The Most Deadly Strain of Ebola Strikes Again,social-issues," Ebola can as well be referred to as hemorrhagic fever. Ebola is a virus disease that causes problems with how blood clots which results into internal bleeding as blood leaks from small blood vessels in one’s body. Ebola can be transmitted through direct contact with body fluids say blood, saliva, sweat, tears, mucus, vomit  of people infected with it. Therefore one should stay away from the infected in order to reduce the spread. Symptoms of the disease may comprise fever, sore throat, headache, muscular pain and diarrhea and these are most likely to appear 21 days after one has been affected. Thus with such symptoms one is required to seek early treatment before the disease cannot be treated any more. The national laboratory (INRB) confirmed on 7 August that the current outbreak is of the Zaire Ebola virus, a deadly one and the same one that affected West Africa during the 2014-2016 outbreak. HISTORICAL FACTS ABOUT EBOLA With the current outbreak occurring in the North Kivu (Kivu Nord) and Ituri provinces of the DRC being the most populated provinces in DRC, one should know that it is not the first. History has that Ebola was just discovered in the early 1970 in the democratic republic of Congo formerly known as Zaire. It’s outbreak, Infected over 300 people covering over 200 deaths from then on wards, sporadic out break have occurred in Africa with an expectation of years between 1979-1994 with a death of over 400 people in year  2000.The recent outbreak started accumulating again in August 2018 from Congo and into Uganda around 9th-10th of June. With such a worry, various groups have since then come up with campaigns to fight this disease say the most popularly known UN, Red Cross and USAID. These all working hand in hand to sensitize people about the killer disease and encouraging people to report any suspicion of the disease early to the concerned persons. They have as well gone ahead to educate people on how to live Ebola free. Declare a Global Emergency In 2014, the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern or PHEIC — came less than five months after the virus was detected. At that point, there had been fewer than 1,000 deaths. In the current outbreak, the WHO's emergency committee debated the issue three times — in October, April and just last month, as the outbreak enters its second year. But the emergency committee concluded that the ongoing response would not be enhanced by formal temporary recommendations from WHO."" For example, a declaration could inadvertently provoke travel bans, visa cancellations and trade freezes, which would further devastate the fragile region's economy while making health workers' jobs more difficult. International health regulations forbid such actions, but they happen anyway. Fifty-eight countries restricted travel from West Africa during the 2014-2016 epidemic, and several airlines ceased flights to and from the region. Research also suggests that the decision to declare a global emergency is often influenced by an outbreak's degree of impact on the United States. In 2014, the PHEIC designation came just six days after infected health workers first arrived the United States. SENSITIZE PEOPLE ABOUT THE KILLER DISEASE One wise man once said that two heads are better than one. Therefore with such a saying most preferably groups should vividly work hand in hand with professional translation companies to sensitize people about the disease. Despite that people still believe that this disease is meant to steal from them by foreigners so as to make money, there is still a better way to educate the masses on how to eradicate this epidemic. This can be done best through professional translation service that can avail basic information to the world at large in different languages that various people understand best. Some of these African languages include Swahili, Lingala, Yoruba, Tigrinya, Somali, Bemba, Kinyarwanda, Rukiga, Madi, Ndebele among many others. This has no exception with the European and Asian languages like German, Spanish, Italian, Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and many others.

19,Heart Disease and Erectile Dysfunction,social-issues," Is erectile dysfunction a parent to heart disorder? The erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability of a man to achieve and keep an erection firm enough during the intercourse. This sexual disorder may serve as a warning sign for current or future health problems. There has been consistent evidence in this regard that impotence might serve as the first sign of cardiovascular ailment in younger men. In the same manner, if a person has cardiac disease, then getting the right course of treatment might help him with erectile dysfunction. Erectile Dysfunction and heart diseases Earlier the development of plagues in the arteries of health was believed to be the cause of ED which often precedes the heart ailments. The main idea is that the development of plague reduces the flow of blood towards the penis which primarily makes the erections quite difficult. But now experts believe that when ED is preceding the heart ailments, it is quite often due to the dysfunction of blood vessels lining along with the smooth muscles. The endothelial dysfunction leads to an inadequate of the supply of blood towards the heart and also this impairs the flow of blood towards the p*nis and assists in the development of atherosclerosis. There is an extremely strong association which has been found between ED and heart ailments. Several of the studies have indicated that man suffering from ED is at a greater risk of heart issues. In one of the studies which is being conducted 57% of the men who suffered from bypass surgery along with 64% who were hospitalized for a heart attack suffered from ED at one point in their lives. Risk factors for impotence and cardiac disease The erectile dysfunction and heart disease arises due to many of the risk factors which include: •	Age With an increase in age, the risk for both ED and cardiac problems increase. However the connection between the two is quite strong among young men. When you are experiencing ED below the age group of 50 then it might be the signs of underlying cardiac issues too. When ED is being experienced after 70 years of age then there is a chance it is being linked to heart disease. •	High Blood pressure When you suffer from high blood pressure for an extended period of time, then it damages the arteries and might interfere with the flow of blood. This affects the ability of a person to achieve and also to maintain an erection. •	High blood cholesterol The high blood cholesterol damages the arteries of the heart. When there is a build up of the cholesterol in the arteries, it clogs them and also restricts the flow of blood. This contributes towards the erectile dysfunction along with cardiac problems. •	Smoking Use of tobacco increases the risk of the development of vascular disease and causes an erection. A study being published in tobacco control 2006 examined the data from 8367 Australian men who are in the age group between 16 to 59. It has been found that there is quite a significant of the link between smoking and also erectile dysfunction. •	Diabetes People who are diabetic are at a greater of the risk cardiac problems. A research study which was being published in the journal of American College of Cardiology determined that there was the presence of ED in 13 men who were suffering from diabetes 2. Obviously, there were no signs of the heart disease that were predicted in the coronary cardiac problems. •	Depression The depression is being linked to the erectile dysfunction and also cardiac syndrome. According to the article which is being published in the Journal of s*xual medicine, all those men who suffer from impotence and severe other symptoms of depression will be at a higher risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment options The first thing that the specialist will do to ensure that you are getting the right course of treatment is to diagnose your health condition which could be the cause of ED and worsening this condition. The physician explains the risks as well as the benefits of each of the treatment and also considers the preferences. The health care professional may prescribe you oral medications –the first line of ED treatment which includes Sildenafil (Viagra), Vardenafil (Levitra), Tadalafil (Cialis) and Avanafil (Stendra). All these oral medicines work through the relaxation of the smooth muscles and increase the flow of blood towards the pnis during the arousal. All these four types of pills are being widely utilized and serve as a scientifically proven technique for treating the erectile dysfunction which means that you will get extremely good results regardless of the medicine. Ultimately the best treatment for this particular sxual condition depends upon your individualized needs. When you are searching for the best drug, then you should communicate to the ED specialist and learn about the potential of the benefits as well as the side effects of each of the specialized treatment options."

1,What You Need To Know About Prohormones AKA Pro Hormones Drugs,social-issues," Prohormones are a unique type of supplement that can increase muscle mass and boost testosterone. It is a bodybuilding supplement used primarily by athletes and those wanting to increase lean muscle mass, but let's be clear, prohormones are not just any average body building supplement that you can buy at your local drug or department store. Prohormones are steroids and therefore illegal in the United States. However, there are still ways to buy prohormones without having to worry over legal entanglements or trying to buy them in back alleys, and not every brand of prohormone supplement is illegal. Legal and Illegal Pro Hormones The main thing that separates the illegal prohormones for sale from the legal prohormones for sale is that the legal versions don't contain the same testosterone precursors as the original and illegal versions do. It is this precursor that makes prohormones so popular and allow them to work they way they do to increase muscles and testosterone. Basically, prohormones for sale in health food stores are watered-down versions of the originals, but there are some high-quality legal prohormones available online and through a few major retailers that work almost as well as the illegal prohormones do. The Benefits of Using a Pro Hormone Supplement In order to find the best prohormone for your needs, you will have to do a little research and of course be ready to spend some money. An online search will yield a lot of choices, but after you read a few reviews and check the ingredients, you should be able to narrow your selection to just a few. Remember, that price is a big clue to the quality of the product. Never just buy the lowest priced prohormone just because it's affordable. The brand name is also a clue to the quality. The best prohormones on the market will not very cheap, will have at least one key ingredient such as Trendione, and have lots of positive reviews. A high-quality prohormone supplement offers a lot of benefits besides increasing muscle mass. If you find that your sex drive has been somewhat lower than usual due to age or lack of energy, then a prohormone supplement will also increase your sex drive. Other benefits include: *Greater strength and endurance *A more manly appearance *Faster athletic recovery *Greater confidence *A lean and improved physical appearance Like most other types of supplements you take, prohormone supplements also comes with some side-effects such as nausea, dizziness, acne, liver damage, and hypertension. However, there are ways to minimize the side-effects through dosage, usage, and post cycle therapy."
2,Personal Responsibility,social-issues," As a society, our books, movies and our national sympathies seem to admire those individuals who are risk takers and live the adventurous life--those who risk all for fame and fortune.  This makes for very interesting but not necessarily truthful storytelling. For those people who succeed, risk is indeed a fascinating life choice, but not all risk takers succeed either financially or personally, and that leaves the rest of us with the necessity of trying to discover alternate choices about how we wish to conduct our lives. One of these possible alternate choices is to choose a life dedicated to the pursuit of personal responsibility. This potential choice may perhaps in the long run be an even more satisfying life choice than many other possibilities Our first commitment to personal responsibility must of course begin with a lifelong commitment to ourselves and our needs--our health needs, our education needs, caring about our appearance, caring about our personal environment and our happiness, so that we can ultimately enhance our self-esteem and become strong and secure individuals. Next our ongoing commitment should be to the important others in our lives to help them to achieve their own potential so that they too will be able to live more fulfilled lives. When we have made a determined effort to achieve our first two goals, then our next step is a dedicated, personal commitment to the society and the world in which we live to try to help make a better and safer environment for all, so that someday when we look back at the accomplishments of our lives, we can feel a sense of pride that because of our efforts we have succeeded in some small way to make the world a more human and humane home for all. This life path choice is not entirely risk free. Life has no completely risk free options, but it is certainly a safer and more secure choice for a life well lived, because each succeeding step is given careful thought and each potential risk is assessed carefully, This life path choice can almost certainly lead to a happier life with better relationships and a more loving and certain future for ourselves, our loved ones and for the entire world."

4,16 Reasons to be Pro-life,social-issues," The pivotal point of your stance on abortion is defining what constitutes human life. Life starts at the moment of fertilization. It is not a theory or religious belief, but a scientific fact. According to a research study done by Princeton University, ""The development of a human being begins with fertilization, a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote."" [Langman, Jan. Medical Embryology.] The moment a zygote forms there is a unique organism that has never existed before, nor will ever exist in the future. At that moment there is a different set of DNA than the parents and traits like hair color and texture, eye color, complexion, height, weight, and even susceptibility to mental disease is determined. I also want to point out that a fetus can be considered a baby, as a baby is an offspring and the term for offspring in Latin is ""fetus"". Abortion at any stage after fertilization is stopping the life of a human being that otherwise would have been on the planet like us. At 3 weeks there is a tiny fragile body with a beating heart, at 5 weeks the facial features start to form, at 8 weeks all the organs are functioning, at 10 weeks you can count the fingers and toes and see the nails, and at 12 weeks the fetus can even suck its thumb and show kinesis to sound, light, and touch. Keep in mind that this is just the first trimester. The fetus only gets larger and developed from there, indicating that indeed it is just as much alive and as human as the people inhabiting Earth. A bacteria is considered life on Mars but a growing human in the womb cannot be accepted as life by a wide population. I get so puzzled when people tell me a fetus is not a human. Then what species is it? This is the cruelest aspect of abortion that makes me yearn for banning it. Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as a ""safe"" abortion. All abortion procedures violently take the life of a living fetus and we should acknowledge how morally wrong that is. Starting from just weeks after conception, if a woman finds out she is pregnant through a pregnancy stick she could take the abortion pill (RU-486). The pill can be offered over the counter and purchased by girls as young as 15 without parental consent. This deprives the growing fetus of nutrients and nourishment and blocks progesterone, which stabilizes the lining of the uterus. This causes the lining of the uterus to break down, depriving the fetus of nourishment. It will die then and there and must be expelled from the mother into a toilet bowl and flushed down the drain. Another option during the first trimester is Suction D and C. During this procedure a suction catheter is inserted into the uterus and a force 10-20 times a household vacuum is applied. This sucks the fetus into tiny pieces. In the second trimester, a Sopher clamp grabs onto a body part and forcefully pulls it off and this continues until the skull is crushed and all the remaining body parts are removed and discarded. Third-trimester abortions account for only 1.3% of abortions but just from Planned Parenthood, this is about 91,000 abortions annually. The fetus is viable and too large to use any of the methods described above so the abortionist will inject Digoxin, a medicine that is typically used to treat heart problems but in the case of overdose imposes cardiac arrest. This is injected directly into the fetus’ body causing an immediate fatal cardiac arrest, stopping the heart. Laminaria is inserted into the cervix to allow the birth of a stillborn baby. All in all, abortion just makes you the mother of a dead baby. Imagine killing criminals the way we kill unborn babies. That would be cruel and unusual punishment. A fetus is shown to exhibit a response to stimuli as early as 11 weeks. It is heartbreaking to see a little embryo trying to push against a sharp abortion instrument and fight for its life when we should be the ones helping it survive. Some ultrasounds show a fetus crying and screaming as it is being pulled out. A fetus has fully functioning nerve cells at 19 weeks and can feel pain like we do. Bernard N. Nathanson, MD, is a former abortion doctor and says that when an abortion is performed, ""We see (in an ultrasound image) the child’s mouth open in a silent scream. This is the silent scream of a child threatened imminently with extinction."" Planned Parenthood lies about providing anesthesia for the fetus, and has been videotaped saying the fetus will be ""ripped apart"" and it will be ""painful"". Second-trimester abortions will elicit the same response in a fetus as it would if we were torn apart, crushed, and forcefully thrown away. This should not be considered a woman’s right and is sad that anyone would get an abortion knowing the fate of their defenseless child. Who in the right mind would deliberately cause someone pain, especially someone who has never hurt or wronged them in any way? When the abortion procedure doesn’t destroy the fetus as planned, some abortionists are left with no choice but to leave an extracted, intact embryo out to die in a steel pan. A living fetus is out of the womb and given no care and left alone to meet its demise as it suffers through its first and last few hours on Earth. Pure cruelty. Human life has been reduced to the phrase ""a clump of cells"" a countless number of times. They are only cells until embryonic differentiation occurs between the second and third week of pregnancy. During embryonic differentiation, the cells form into tissues and start taking on specific roles in the formation of a human body. The only time you would be aborting a sack of cells is within the first twenty days of pregnancy which is impossible. This is because most women only find out they are pregnant at or after 6 weeks. I saw this on a pro-choice account written by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, stating that they find out through a menstrual period that is two weeks late. They contradict their argument by referring to abortion as killing a group of cells while also proving that women only find out they are pregnant at 6 weeks which is not a sack of cells. At that point, they are aborting a baby who is way past just a cluster of cells and contains vital organs and a beating heart, leading us to this. A beating heart signifies life. What happens when we die? Our heart stops. If abortion at any stage terminating a human life is not something you can digest (though it is scientifically proven), you at least have to accept that stopping a heart from beating is a homicide. A fetus gets a heartbeat at 21 days and sometimes even as early as 16 days. Without a heart, there is no life which symbolizes that the heart is what provides us the quality of being alive. Anatomically, a heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body and without that our body stops working. The reason we hear about keeping the heart healthy more than other organs is that the heart is the most essential life-giving organ. Abortion stops that something (heart) that gives life to someone (a fetus). The heart does so much for our survival and is the epitome of our existence, which is why intentionally stopping that heartbeat is murder. I have heard the argument which compares abortion to pulling the plug on a brain dead person. These are two independent events that cannot be compared. A brain dead person will never become a ""normal"" human again but if left unperturbed a fetus will. I would also like to point out that abortion is murder since it is the deliberate and premeditated termination of one human’s life by a separate human. Excluding rape/incest, 99.5% of women had consented sex meaning they accepted the possible consequences and still proceeded to have sex. Only about 5% is due to medical conditions for the fetus where it is inevitable. I have heard the argument ""The baby will have a bad life and not deserve the love it needs."" They knew they are financially/mentally unstable but still chose to have intercourse. Even when using birth control, they knew it was not 100% effective. They acknowledge that there is a chance of getting pregnant and that they are in unfavorable conditions. This is needless to say for unprotected sex, but even using contraceptives can offer a chance at pregnancy, with condoms, a popular, cheap, and accessible form of contraception, having a mere 85% success rate. Only people who want fun sex use protection, so in the end, it is like they are terminating a fetus because they desired erotic pleasure. This is not only barbaric but gruesome and dehumanizing. Despite being aware of their bad parenting conditions/environment and despite being aware of a chance of pregnancy they still decided to have sex. Now she is pregnant and wants to kill a child out of her selfish actions? You have to take responsibility for your actions so if that means you had sex then you have to be willing to accept the baby, not kill it because you were horny one night. Many pro-choicers’ argument is ""they will not have the money or resources to give him/her a good life"", but if they knew from the start that they cannot support a baby then why did they have sex in the first place? You don’t know the future. I don’t know the future. That hot Starbucks barista who spelled your name wrong doesn’t know the future. No one knows the future. You do not know whether your child will have a great life, mediocre life, or even a bad one. Therefore, you should not assume that he or she will for sure have a bad life and settle for killing them right off the bat. I am not saying you have to be an optimist and hope that everything will go amazing, but you should not be so negative as to think killing is the only way to avoid potential suffering. With life there is hope. No matter how terrible the living conditions are, there will be some way, some ray of sunshine that there is a good path for your child. For this to happen your child must be born first.  Everyone is loved, everyone is wanted, and everyone deserves to inhabit the Earth no matter how bad circumstances can get. Everyone deserves to celebrate their first birthday and accomplish so much more in their lives. Just because there is a possibility that not everything goes perfect does not mean you can take the life of your child and violate the moral code. Eliminate the suffering, not the sufferer. Give your child the life that you would like to live yourself. Imagine going up to a homeless person and murdering them, and then justifying that with ""You are poor. You will not have a good life. Let me just take away your life so that you will not have to suffer."" That is what financially unstable parents do to their babies, except for the fact that it is in the womb where you can not see it. Would you kill your daughter just to make sure she doesn’t get raped in the future? Aborting your child stops them from pain and suffering in the way that decapitation stops someone from experiencing tooth decay. Just as unfair as it is to the mother, rape is an unfair reason to kill a fetus. Why should the fetus suffer for the mistake of its father? We do not even give the death penalty to the perpetrator who committed a felony, but people are all for giving the death penalty to the innocent fetus who had nothing to do with the rape. The fetus is the byproduct or third party of rape with the two parties being the woman and rapist. Children conceived during rape have lives too and do not deserve that to be stripped away when they are guiltless. I am not denying that having the child is a memory of the rape, but who says the abortion won’t serve as a second reminder? Now she has to carry the burden of rape and the guilty conscience of killing her helpless child. Abortion just adds violence to the situation. Abortion doesn’t un-rape a woman - it only adds more violence to her situation. The eleven-year-old girl example is not an accurate representation of abortion as a whole as she is one example out of the several million who abuse abortion for egotistical reasons. Imagine telling a grown person that they do not deserve to exist just because they were born out of rape, with the same going for foster care children who have been constantly told they should not be here. After all, a person's a person no matter how they got here! The reason for conception does not lower the sanctity of human life. No matter what the circumstance is the fetus is innocent and doesn’t deserve this deathly punishment. Even murder can be justified for self-defense and stealing can be justified for feeding your family. The fetus never intentionally did anything bad for you to kill it and that is wrong to do to have a more convenient life. I repeat, killing others so you can have a more quality life is unacceptable. If you stuck a knife through the chest of a 5-month-old baby, you would be charged with manslaughter. If you killed that same baby in the womb, it is a human right and you are applauded for being brave. Do you see the irony here? The only difference between the womb and the Earth is that life is less developed and we cannot hear the fetus cry. If a fetus could talk, it would say ""leave my body alone"". According to the Constitution, every human has the right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". They have every right to live and just because they are less developed does not mean they are less human. Just because the fetus can’t express its right to live does not mean you can take advantage of that and kill it against its will. The fact that someone is dependent or vulnerable should be more of a reason for us to protect them, not harm them. The fetus’ body is the one being aborted. Where is its choice in the killing of its own body? If the fetus is incapable of deciding its life outside the womb then the mother cannot make that decision for the fetus either as it is another human. Bodily autonomy applies to the choices you want to make to your own body and your body only. The moment another life is in the picture, you do not have the choice to decide the destiny of that other human. The body you are aborting is not yours, but a separate living entity located inside you. Just because the fetus lives inside your body does not mean it is your body; this is comparable to a Russian doll. The fetus is merely connected with the umbilical cord with a complete individual body of its own. Women do not have 2 unique sets of DNA, 2 heads, 20 fingers and toes, 2 different hearts with differing heart rates, 4 arms and legs, 4 eyes and ears, etc. The fetus and mother are even awake at different times so it is not a clone or ""her body"" when there are two separate organisms having different eating and sleeping patterns. How can it be her body her choice when that choice of abortion is forced upon a different body than hers? If it was her body then she would be the one that dies. It is not your body, not your choice. An abortion occurs every 36 seconds. By the time you started reading this, approximately 15-20 innocent babies have been killed around the world. No flags have been lowered, no media is hyperventilating, nothing. Every day this genocide is occurring but we do not acknowledge all the unique, beautiful lives lost in the name of choice. An empty building is ruined and there is an uproar, but actual human lives are lost at an extreme rate and we are silent. It is bad enough that the helpless are put to death, but the fact that people will make abortion look like a pretty present though it is murder in a disguise is the cherry on top. Abortion promotes a society that believes motherhood is a drawback, fertility is a disease, and the unborn are disposable. We should not normalize the act of inhumanely discarding humans no matter what the circumstance is. Babies are worth so much more than what their living conditions or other limitations define them as. By justifying abortion by saying it is worse to be in foster care, you are undermining the lives of all the children in foster care homes and saying they were better off dead. Pop stars Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Miley Cyrus have all contributed to Planned Parenthood by advertisement or donations. These celebrities are showing their female youth fans that killing is a positive thing and that human life can just be executed as if it means nothing. How come when a woman has a miscarriage it is regarded as a tragic misfortune? If the life growing inside of her was just ""a clump of cells"" then why should she feel bad about spontaneously losing a few of those extra cells feeding off of her like a parasite? We feel sympathetic towards them and think about the angelic baby that died, so we should apply that same logic towards what an abortion deliberately does. Abortion not only kills every bit of the fetus but also the conscience of the mother. Compared to the general population, women who have had an abortion are 81% more likely to develop at least one mental issue. There is a 600% increase in suicide in all women who had abortions with teen girls being ten times more likely to attempt suicide than their counterparts who have not had an abortion. There is a 200% increase in preterm birth. There is a 30% increase in breast cancer. There is a 34% increase in anxiety. There is a 37% increase in depression. There is a 110% increase in alcohol use/abuse. There is a 220% increase in marijuana use. There is a 70% increase in self-harm. Over 90% of post-abortive women said they weren’t given enough information to make an informed decision. Women have abortions because they simply feel it is their only option, similar to what suicide is. Both take lives, and both are permanent solutions to temporary problems. Women need support and care. She shouldn’t feel so backed into a corner where she is convinced that killing is the only way out. Prolifers promote positive beliefs and encourage women that they are strong, brave, smart, and capable. This is exactly what a woman needs. She shouldn’t be put down with negative words like ""unprepared, young, immature, uneducated, and weak"". I have heard the argument ""Our parents make decisions for us all the time"". This is undoubtedly true, but that does not give our parents the right to kill us or even abuse us in any way or form. These are the exact things abortion does to an unborn child, highlighting the hypocrisy of that statement. Imagine your mother paying hundreds of dollars to a wicked brute who has promised to end your life using sharp tools and even sell your dismembered parts for profit. You have no choice but to endure this inescapable death penalty for your ""crime"" of being conceived. This is the terrifying reality of what the 2,400 aborted fetuses every day have to go through. A mother should be the one that secures you, gives you warmth and comfort, and consoles you. She should be the one who is there for you when you need support and love. She should not be the woman who wants you out of the world the most. Abortion is the complete opposite of what feminism is. Girl power should not be confused with killing your baby. There is nothing empowering about ending the life of someone innocent because you could not provide care. What women need is support and the feeling of strength and confidence that they can raise their babies. They should not feel so backed into a corner where they believe killing their fetus is the only way out. You have to kill the suffering, not the sufferer. If we think a mother killing her helpless child is courageous then what other crimes will we start justifying? Abortion kills unborn children of several minorities at a much higher rate than the national average. In other areas of life, there are government-imposed protections to defend minorities against ""disparate impact."" If that is true then shouldn’t it be the same for babies in the womb. 82% in NYC and 64% of abortions in Texas are on African American and Hispanic babies. 57% of abortions reported to the CDC nationwide were done on Hispanic and African American women. There are almost as many African American babies aborted as there are born in New York - this is eugenics in action. A report from 2011 showed Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry in the United States target black and Hispanic Americans by placing abortion facilities in communities with high minority populations. The founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, is quoted saying, ""We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population."" Looking at the gender perspective, countries like India and China allow for sex-selective abortions meaning the parents abort just because the gender of their baby is not what they desired - usually females. There are 27 million girls killed globally every year and some of them just because they are girls. The sex of your baby does not justify killing them at all and only promotes more gender gap and gender inequality. Again, it is especially sad that people consider abortion feminism when so many females are killed just for that reason. Don’t equate girl power to killing. If you truly supported feminism then you would be advocating for the rights of unborn women, not succumbing to the popular opinion and killing them. Every life matters and no life is lesser than another for being a certain race or gender. Abortion does not kill a potential human being; it kills a human being with great potential. Out of the 60 million babies aborted since Roe v Wade we do not know what groundbreaking impacts any one of those humans could have made. Every life has intrinsic value and is filled with so many prospective abilities. When we abort our children we throw away the endless possibilities of what they become, what they accomplish, and what they contribute to future generations. So many mothers finish their education and have a career even when they did not expect to have a baby. So many women, even those who were raped, have come out saying that their unplanned baby was the best thing that has happened to them. There are numerous people who could have been aborted, but were not and became successful. If Justin Bieber was aborted as planned, you wouldn’t have been singing your heart out to Baby when you were nine years old. His mother had suffered sexual abuse and was pressured into abortion. She was seventeen, suicidal, and had a less than shabby relationship with her spouse, and was convinced that her son would be brought into a world where he did not get all the resources and affection he deserved. Still, she made the right decision by letting her child experience the world and just waited to see how life would go for him. This is just one example of so many young, broke, unstable, and single mothers deciding that abortion was not an option for them. Think about how different your life would have been if someone close to your heart was aborted. You would not be the same person you are now and would not have that influence they caused. Realize that this is a sad reality for so many families affected by abortion. Healthcare enhances the quality of life and ultimately saves lives by providing medical assistance. Abortion terminates lives. I can not even begin to fathom how abortion is equated to healthcare when they are obviously on opposite ends of the spectrum. ""Medical procedure"" is a euphemism for the cold-blooded murder of a tiny human’s life using sharp tools. It is the only procedure that is considered a failure if the victim survives. Remind me again how killing is healthcare. We should be saving babies from cardiac arrest and heart attacks, not imposing it on them. CPR and healthcare teach us how to save people from heart failure so it makes no logical sense of how heart attack abortions, the complete opposite, are also considered healthcare. Would you still consider it healthcare if your doctor killed you? Abortion is not like a kidney transplant or back surgery like normal healthcare is. It leaves women with emotional scarring which normal healthcare shouldn’t do. All abortion methods violently take an unborn child’s life which is plain murder, not healthcare. If suctioning, dismembering, and poisoning is healthcare then might as well add the death penalty to the list because they are more or less the same thing. Abortion is also not a reproductive rights issue as reproduction has already occurred by the time the fetus forms. Final Thoughts: Abortion was the number one killer globally in 2018, with a shocking 42 million deaths. Planned Parenthood has several affiliations with supporting child predators, and aided a sex-trafficking case of a fourteen-year-old girl. They opposed legislation that would protect infants born alive after failed abortions. They have also let seven women die in their facility because they did not call the ambulance. A woman named Tonya Reaves was left bleeding to her death for five hours after a failed abortion after denied emergency care. Planned Parenthood makes about $3,270 per one aborted fetus by selling their brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and upper and lower limbs. This is not only crime and infringement of human rights but also morally wrong and ruthless. Women’s rights are human rights and no human has the right to kill another human. The womb is a place for growth and development (and only living things grow) and shouldn’t be regarded as a supernatural place. Also, the pro-life movement is not about trying to control women’s bodies but fighting for abolishing immorality towards the innocent and defenseless. Abortion is an issue about ethics and anyone, no matter whether they have a uterus or not, can fight for the life of someone who will be unfairly killed. I also want to point out that saying ""I would never get an abortion, but other people have the choice to is like saying ""I am against child abuse, but you can abuse your child if you want."" Moreover, if you saw a stranger’s child being abused you would step in and try to help right? It is the same way with the pro-life movement - it supports and advocates for the fetus who does not deserve to be stripped of the gift and constitutional right of life. All in all, abortion is killing and no innocent, irreplaceable, and beautiful baby deserves to be reduced to just a choice."
5,An Open Letter to Religious Leaders,social-issues," Primitive groups millions of year ago began religious practices in response to their fear of the unknown and often terrifying world in which they lived, and to try to understand the mysterious forces of the universe which surrounded them and impacted their lives. In the ensuing centuries, a great variety of religions appeared. There were some that worshiped the sun and the moon. Their were some that called for human sacrifices. There were some that worshiped a large number of deities and some that worshiped only one. Many of these religions no longer exist as part of our lives and have been replaced by more modern versions. Although all religions have at their core a moral, spiritual and social base, the history of the interaction between religious groups from earliest centuries until the present has been one of intolerance, violence and bloodshed. We are now at a time in world history that calls for more tolerance and dialogue , because man’s weaponry can now easily poison and destroy our world.  Religious leaders of all religions must come together to recognize what common bonds they share and emphasize those bonds of family, honesty, social unity etc. which are part of all religions.  Religious leaders must insist that their followers allow freedom of worship to all religions and freedom from coercion to conform to any particular value system. They must emphasize the separation of church and state in all countries. The goal is that every person have freedom to worship as their conscience dictates in a country which is tolerant and respects all rights. Religious leaders have enormous power to change the world into one of cooperation and harmony, if they choose. Isn't that the goal of all loving human beings?"
6,The Complexity of Sex,social-issues," First and foremost we need to understand that sexuality is a natural function of our bodies like eating or sleeping. As such, we need to treat it like any other bodily function with understanding and thought. Just as our eating and sleeping habits become distorted by the pressures of society, our anxieties, and the lack of sensible control (which can ultimately become obesity or anorexia,) so can sex, this very elemental function, become manipulated and distorted by these same pressures — the values of society, our many anxieties and the lack of sensible control which still continue to shape human sexuality all over the world. Many of our religions teach us that our body is something to be ashamed of and should be treated with repression and guilt. Many of our societies teach us a disregard for the equality of the sexes and allow us to use and abuse each other for our selfish needs. Often when people are angry or troubled by the stresses of life they use sex as an outlet for their anxiety. This really has nothing to do with their natural drives or love, but becomes a mechanism used as a release from their frustration and anger. Those who commit domestic abuse, those who use other people without regard, those who are addicted to pornography, those who try to dominate others sexually because of their need for power must begin to look at the source of their behavior much the same way that a person who is out of control when they eat too much or drink too much must recognize that the source of their behavior is unhappiness and anxiety. Why is it so hard to examine or change our sexual behavior? Our sexual attitudes and behaviors are formed when we are very young before we have the skills or the critical thought to question them. They are formed by our parent’s attitudes, by our society and by our peer groups according to the prevailing thought of the country and the century and the misconceptions in which we happen to be born. It will take conscious thought and action to understand the real needs of our men women, and children to correct the past misconceptions of previous sexual thought and to ultimately change those many complexities and misconceptions to a better functioning mode that is less stressful, more compassionate and more satisfying for all human beings Isn’t it time, as the world tries to become more knowledgeable and less self-conscious about understanding the realities of sex, that we also begin to personally examine our own actions and motives and begin to change our sexual behavior, if that becomes necessary, to a more tolerant, caring and ultimately better functioning mode, so that we all can become more balanced and happier individuals? How different our future world will become, if we begin to act with more insight and more wisdom about the enormous complexities of human sexuality."

8,How Is Your Self-Discipline?,social-issues," Sometimes we forget, or give up on, what we want to do… Sometimes we get side tracked or distracted and can’t seem to get traction… Sometimes we are afraid to follow are dreams… We believe we don’t have what it takes, and thus hold ourselves back. Can you remember a time in your life when any of these happened for you. Part of the reason this happens is because we don’t have enough personal ownership and self-Discipline. Because I knew I was getting ready to be ready (LOL) for this big project, I chose the Focus Term™ Discipline for myself when I was doing my year-end Strategizing… Eh? This has been my mantra since the beginning of the year when it comes to the Areas I’m addressing this year and the goals I’m working towards. I’m already a pretty disciplined person, but I’d like to improve this further. I knew getting to the place to be able to fit in this big project would require Discipline, and it will require tons more once it gets on its way. Whee! What is the value of Discipline? Discipline is one of the most important attributes of successful people. If you do a-day-in-the-life of anyone who we consider super successful you will find loads of discipline in their lifestyle and approach to life. Discipline means to train, teach… Discipline has to do with being the trainer, master, of your mind, your emotions, your body, your environment, your life. Discipline shows up in the habits and routines you create for yourself. In the systems and structures you put in place to support you in achieving your goals when pursuing your dreams. Discipline comes from our Father figure growing up… Just like Nurturing comes from our Mother figure growing up… [Not a sexist, nor discrete concept, but an observation on male/female energy influence and impact on our psyche…] The structure and discipline imparted by the male-energy figure in our early life provided stability, security, and safety. When they were absent, unhealthy or a less-than-perfect parental figure they were not able to provide this to the extent that we needed it. Which left us fending for ourselves and creating defense mechanisms to feel safe… See what this means? This means that if we don’t intentionally Train ourselves to create the life we want, that we will create our life by default. Riddled with unfinished business, dissatisfying repeating patterns, defenses, unhealthy habits, and self-sabotage! Without Discipline our energy is scattered and unfocused, not targeted. This is not how we create the life we want. This is not living to our full potential. This is not how we were meant to have our Human Experience. We were meant to come Win at the Game of Life on earth. So, what say you? Ready for adding some more Discipline into your life?? Assignment: Choose a life area where you’d like to make a significant improvement or change in your life. Where being more Disciplined can pay huge dividends. You might want to tie this to your Summer Project or Theme, or to your yearly goals (more on this on the next issue!). You might want to do a power-combo with your own Focus Term™, such as with accountability, boundaries, ownership, transparent, present, compassionate, grateful, partnership, intimacy, romance, and such… As you continue your reprogramming, reparenting yourself, by giving yourself what you didn’t get growing up, you are healing and evolving.

9,Refresh on the Definition of Professional Conduct,social-issues," When asking ""Google"" what the definition of ""Professional Conduct"" is, you’ll receive the following brief description ""Professional conduct involves ethics, morals, and standards of behavior. Being a professional, it is necessary for the person to maintain his/her ethical behavior and to have good professional conduct"". But does today’s working society remain within these vague boundaries for which Google outlines? While one would think it is common sense to dress appropriately, be on time, meet deadlines and to respect their peers, it is becoming more prevalent that the general scope of professional conduct is morphing into new expectations. One of which goes outside the box of the regular 9 to 5, Monday through Friday job. I’m sitting here in my flannel pajama pants, tank top and slippers as I write this article because I’m fortunate to work remotely and have done so for the past 20 years like others are permitted to do around the world nowadays. Does this fact mean I’m less professional? I think not; however, I do feel my personal perspective of professional conduct would be up for debate if this conversation topic were to arise among those who still battle daily commutes, are required to maintain a certain appearance and are constantly faced with reminders in the workplace on harassment, ethics and conduct codes. The general scope of professional conduct is based upon ethical benchmarks which we are supposed to abide by, but in a world filled with social media, emails zipping through cyberspace at the speed of light and images bouncing around the globe, is today’s society abiding by the traditional conduct codes laid out so long ago? Furthermore, as time proceeds, the next generation (in my opinion) that’s gradually taking over the workforce are more opinionated, are often offended easily and feel entitled to things that they have not earned. Having a positive attitude, speaking appropriately and communicating effectively within the workplace was once a necessity yet appears to be diminishing. Why is this? Could it be all the media outlets and constant hoopla of celebrity activity, maybe it’s something we’re eating, or could it possibly be the fact that the parents of the generation that will proceed us are lazy and constantly gave in when it came to providing structure, boundaries and discipline to the children that are now growing up and entering the work force? Regardless of the underlying factors, professional conduct, despite the location of where you work, your ethnicity, religion, gender or age, should maintain the same substance and values as it always has. So, considering this topic, here are some simple reminders as to what is expected of anyone who wishes to be a professional… Maintain a positive attitude as there is enough drama and darkness in the world, neither your colleagues nor clients need to hear about yours. Speak appropriately according to the environment, it’s not hard to use your manners, show appreciation and be respectful. Adapt to present situations when required as no one likes listening to a whiny adolescent. Communicate effectively! This is one of the most important skills required, not just in business, but in LIFE! Meet deadlines set without continued excuses as failure to meet deadlines ultimately reflects on how dependable you are and if you can’t meet deadlines you will lose respect from your peers who are likely affected by your neglect. Accept that you are responsible and will be held accountable for your actions. (or lack of) Demonstrate generosity of spirit rather than an inflated ego. Follow through and have integrity in all you do cause making empty promises eventually result in not being believed or trusted. Understand and accept constructive criticism as best you can. While some topics may hit a little close to home personally, when being a professional you need to be able to separate the 2 to be able to survive. In a world full of opportunity, you don’t require a degree to be considered a professional, you simply need to go back to the basic foundations, just as google stated. Morals, respect, integrity and honesty is what makes you a professional, it’s that simple!"
10,Bridgeport Correctional Center: Offender BEWARE,social-issues," My time at BCC was long enough to see most of the injustices that are rampant there and short enough to know that I wouldn’t wish that place on my worst enemy. I am Dennis Morehead Jr and I was sent there for charges that were meant for someone else but because I was easily accessible and those people were not, the charges were put on me. I was taught from a young age that no accidents happen to the children of God and I knew that He would allow the truth to come out eventually. The true purpose of my being there was to tell people who I would never meet otherwise, that God cared about them. I was sent to give hope to the hopeless. To be love to those who may have never met love in person. This all sounds good until everything that you were accustomed to having and depending upon is stripped from you and what’s left is who you really are. I found out first hand that in this system, you are guilty until proven innocent. And you were treated accordingly. The intake process took about 6 hours before I was escorted to my cell. For anyone that was not familiar with how this works, like me, it felt like an eternity. The not knowing what to expect was almost like torture because the only thing I knew about prison and jail was what I saw on TV or in movies. I was never around criminals to hear first-hand of what this process was like. When it was my turn to walk into the back area , I was instructed to go to this single shower area/stall and strip. Open your mouth. Lift your tongue. Raise your arms. Show me your palms/back of hands. Lift your nut-sack. Turn around and lift up one foot towards me. Lift the other foot towards me. Spread your cheeks. Squat and cough. I watched too many movies so I bent over and the guard yelled squat, squat, not bend over. After that I was asked if I wanted to shower or get dressed into the tans, t-shirt and karate shoes that were provided for me. I chose to take a shower. The guard provided soap and a hand towel and walked away with my clothes and personal items. When I was finished he directed me to go into the next waiting area. There are way too many people in this one little area waiting for our names to be called. No seats and barely enough space to sit on the floor. The conversations that were overheard just confused me even more. Some guys talked about what medications they say they are prescribed at home so that they could be doped up inside there. Then others say not to let them perform the TB test so that you can be put into quarantine and have your own cell. The problem with that is, until you agree to receive the test you are confined to that cell 24 hours a day. Still there were others that were trying to be bullies. Because of this my head was spinning, to say the least. Should I be the tough guy that I grew out of or should I be who God wanted me to be and let Him shine? Should I let it be known right now that I’m the man before somebody tries me or just trust God when He told me that He would protect me the whole time I was inside? And then my name was called to come into the office. As I walked into the little office I was told sit down at the desk. The guy asked me several questions, had me fill out papers and then told me to stand by the door so that he could take my picture and take pictures of my tattoos. After that I was told to go back outside in the hallway waiting area. More inmates were poured into the already crowded area. As I waited for whatever was next, I couldn’t help but notice the two telephones that were on the wall right in front of us. Not knowing if we could use them, I waited to see others use them first before attempting to use one of them myself. We found out that one of the phones didn’t work so that meant that everyone there had to use that one phone and wait his turn. I quickly declared my number in line, I’m next. To use the phone you had to pick up the receiver and then look into the camera above your head. At that point you’ll hear a tone which meant to enter the phone number. The voice prompts informed you to state your name and that you will be connected to a 20 second call and that options will be made to the other person on how to add money in order to receive future phone calls without the 20 second time limit. A while after speaking to my family my name was called again. This time I had to see the doctor and answer a whole new set of questions. I was asked for my consent to receive the TB test, I agreed. I was told that someone would check on the area where I was stuck in a few days. No one ever came to check on that test. After waiting for what seemed like an hour, I was called back into the first office to sign for my ID card. When I got back to the hall way I noticed that my name was spelled wrong and there was an H where it said race. I looked on some of the other guy’s ID cards and realized the H stood for Hispanic and I am Black. I was then called into the psychiatrist’s office. I forgot his name but he was very cordial and seemed concerned. His demeanor was extremely laid back and that appeared to some as if he didn’t care but we had a deep conversation in that brief time that I was in his office. Because of my bail amount I had to meet with him to discuss suicide, homosexuality and other topics associated with prison living. He also informed me that I wasn’t going to the dorms, as most of the others were headed, but I would be going to the cell blocks. Once a few more hours passed, a couple of us were escorted there. Getting accustomed to this life was a shock. The first night I was only given pants, a t-shirt and a sheet. I went inside in the month of January. January in Connecticut is extremely cold. Inside the cell the vent was at the foot of the top bunk where I would be sleeping. The vent was blowing out freezing cold air. There was an old commissary sheet covering most of the vent but the air forced its way through anyway. In the thick handbook they forbade anything covering the vents. I didn’t cover it but I wasn’t taking it off either. The next morning I went to orientation where I was given another t-shirt, a sweatshirt and a thin blanket along with a toothbrush, a bar of soap and some trial sized deodorant and toothpaste. To stay warm we were forced to sleep in our clothes wrapped under the blanket. The dayroom and corridor outside the cells were comfortable enough for us to warm up but as soon as we stepped back into our cells it was as if we were stepping outside into the cold. Complaining fell on deaf ears. I even mentioned it to my wife and she called up to the facility after hanging up with me. The next time we spoke, she told me that when she called and complained that the inmates in my cellblock on my tier didn’t have heat, she was told that she doesn’t know what’s going on inside the jail because she wasn’t inside the jail and to not call there again followed by a dial tone after getting hung up on. It took prayer to be able to endure the cold and soon the outside weather made it bearable inside. Thank God. Dealing with the elements was one thing but dealing with the CO’s was a whole other beast. Whenever it rained our tier and day room leaked from the roof and we would be on lock-down meaning we were confined to our cells. Whenever we saw a new CO being trained on the tier we knew that there would be a fake code sent throughout the blocks and we would be locked down. Sure enough, the call came over the intercom that we had to return to our cells immediately. Seeing the transition of the new CO’s is blatant. It almost seems like they are trained to treat the inmates unfairly where they used to at least acknowledge your question, now they act like you weren’t speaking at all. I sort of got into it with one CO on two different occasions. The first time was when he was delivering legal mail to one of my tier mates. A lieutenant is supposed to deliver legal mail not a regular CO. This CO had the inmate sign for the Fedex letter, opened it up to check for contraband then removed the stack of papers then handed the papers to him while keeping the envelope. Myself and another inmate spoke up and said that wasn’t right. That envelope is part of your mail, they have no right to withhold any part of your legal mail. The CO’s reply was ""am I talking to you? No, well shut up"". Of course my reply was I’m talking to you, you can’t do that. About a week earlier the lieutenant had me sign for a UPS letter so that’s how I knew. A short time after the incident with this CO, he came to deliver legal mail to me. I should’ve never signed for it because he wasn’t a lieutenant but I did anyway. After I signed he opened up the Fedex letter and checked for contraband then gave me the stack of papers inside. I told him that I needed that envelope. He said for what and I said because it’s mine. He lied and said that inmates aren’t allowed to keep envelopes and right away I told him that his lieutenant is supposed to deliver mail that has to be signed for and his lieutenant gave me two envelopes that are right in my cell. Then I said as a matter of fact, I want to speak to a lieutenant immediately. He walked away as I was talking and I repeated myself for the whole tier to hear me. About 5 minutes later as the CO assigned to our tier was about to do his rounds, he walked up to me as I was still on the phone and handed me my envelope. That other guard did all of that for what? Every inmate or group of inmates is assigned a counselor. They are supposed to be your advocate and voice while you are there. Counselors are supposed to visit the inmates regularly and answer questions that may arise. The counselor assigned to our tier was the absolute worst and had a reputation for being the absolute worst. She transitioned from a CO to a counselor and apparently still had the CO mentality. The only time she came on the tier was to drop off request form replies. She wouldn’t even answer the simplest question, her only answer was to submit a request form. So often guys would politely say excuse me Ms. Mc_____y, and she would always reply rudely with ""what"". My sister sent bibles to me, two of them at one time and when she delivered them she didn’t even have the decency to at least bend down, if she wasn’t going to have the door opened to hand them to me, she could’ve bent down a little bit to place them on the floor. From a standing position she dropped both bibles on the floor then proceeded to kick them repeatedly until they were fully under my cell door. The level of anger and disrespect that I felt were off the chart! I yelled out ""why are you kicking bibles under my door?? How disrespectful is that""! She never once apologized for her actions which shows that she didn’t see anything wrong with them. As I stated earlier, for every question or request there had to be a request for submitted. There were different boxes depending on who the request was for, counselor, warden, legal or medical. I learned that the rumors of the medical department there at BCC were true. Their medical division is horrendous. I put two medical requests in back in January and I was called for one of the requests during the last week of February. There’s an amendment to the Constitution of the United States that speaks about cruel and unusual punishment. That facility skates dangerously close to the edge of crossing that line and has numerous times. I dare say that they are comfortable on the other side of that line until legal action is threatened. Even then only the bare minimum is done temporarily to put a band aid on the situation. When it was freezing cold in our cells, we complained to the warden herself. After a couple weeks someone came to test the temperature in the cells but placed the device under the door outside the cell which led to a reading of the hallway temperature instead of the drastically colder temperature inside the cell. As far as they were concerned, they addressed our concerns. The shower on our tier cut off while someone was showering one Friday evening and wasn’t fixed until Monday morning. After that it cut off a couple days later and was off for about 3 days. Early one morning around 5a something happened with the water system where the toilets in mine and about 5 other cells started flushing non-stop. The noise from this was almost deafening. That lasted around 30 minutes. Maintenance came and turned off the water and it remained off for several hours while they tried to figure out the problem. When they finally came to turn the water back on, the water pressure in the sink was so low that the water barely cleared the water fountain style nozzle on the sink. Prior to this, when the hot or cold water buttons were pressed, the water would shoot to the middle of the sink allowing your other hand to wet the washcloth, hold the toothbrush etc. Now the water from the nozzle to the side of the bowl. I requested about 5 times for the CO’s to put in maintenance tickets for them to fix this and nothing happened. This happened the week of Valentine’s day. I put in request forms to the counselor as well asking that someone address this and nothing ever happened. It’s sad to say that the inmates are forgotten and abandoned while incarcerated. Especially if there is no support system for them outside or at least someone praying for them. I truly believe that in order to work for any correctional facility you must receive more training than what’s being offered and required now. And after an officer completes the training, there should be some sort of monitoring that takes place regardless of how long you’ve been on the job. CO’s shouldn’t have the power to treat inmates any way that they want to just because they have a badge. Everywhere in this world there are rules and rules should be adhered to. In the correctional facilities this holds true as well, for inmates and for officers. At BCC lock-up time that all inmates are supposed to be in their cells at night is 11p. Most CO’s flashed the lights at 10:45p and then there were some that flashed the lights at 10:30p. In spite of the rules that were in place if one of them told you to do something, you had to comply or there’d be hell to pay. If you were the last one out of the dayroom when one of them felt like locking up early, he would keep you locked in your cell the next day while everyone else is out for rec, most times for at least 30 minutes. Superbowl Sunday a group of us put our commissary together during our lunch rec so that we would have a huge meal as we watched the game later that evening. About an hour and a half later when we were supposed to come out for chow, I heard banging and yelling coming from the tier below ours. I told my cellie that I hoped all of that banging didn’t make them mess up our Superbowl dinner and lock us down for the game. No sooner than I said that, the CO came and said he had an announcement to make. He informed us that we were on lock-down until Monday morning. There was no further explanation other than that it came down from the warden. Unlimited power shouldn’t be so unlimited. And it shouldn’t be okay because after all, it’s only affecting inmates. That should never be the attitude but it is. In BCC you are placed there until you are sentenced, meaning you are only accused of something while you’re there. The culture there is that everyone there is already guilty and you’d better have someone trying to prove you innocent are you’ll sit until they get around to dealing with your case. There are people that have been there for close to and some for over two years. That is entirely too long to be in an un-sentenced jail because they didn’t even get to you yet. I went to court one time and was on the transport bus with at least 10 other inmates. I was the only one that got to see the judge. Some got an explanation but most didn’t. When they expressed that they didn’t see the judge they were told that they’d be informed when their next court date is. That is unbelievable. If it wasn’t for God and my praying family, I would’ve been just as hopeless as most of those powerful men inside are. They will always be in my prayers as I pursue change."
11,Advanced Waste Management System in Major Australian Cities,social-issues," Regardless of how new a city is; it must have an acceptable waste disposal system. A poor garbage management procedure will invariably cause a great many problems for residents and city administrators alike, so it is no surprise that waste management is a hot topic in a modern society like Australia. With more and more industrial and commercial waste being produced from packaging materials, toxic elements and household usage, managing this garbage is becoming a big headache for administrators. Reuse and recycling is high on the agenda across the country, from local councils to state governments. Every country has varying systems for proper waste management; some make use of private companies, but for many, it’s up to the local administrators to put those systems into place. Here are some well consider and future-proof systems which could be adopted in Australia. Many modern countries are taking steps to get rid of the traditional systems that managed waste. In the past landfill sites were used to bury household, commercial and industrial waste. This is not a sustainable practice, however, because of a lack of space surrounding most of cities, not to mention the need to tear up the countryside to bury rubbish. One alternative to traditional waste management is Waste Categorization. For years, waste was bundled together and buried in landfill sites without a second thought. But, over the time people started to realise that burying toxic waste, harmful chemicals, and other noxious substances in the ground causes leaks into the environment and poses a threat to public health and safety. These days, waste is sorted into individual groupings based on their level of toxicity and danger to the environment and public health. Many local councils have handed out recycling boxes which people use to sort their own rubbish. Different waste groups include: Liquid - cleaning products, wastewater, detergents and other materials which turn into liquid waste. Solid - regular household waste, garbage and other solid wastes. Hazardous - chemicals, flammables, combustibles and other poisonous or toxic materials. Organic - food waste, grass clippings and other organic materials. Zero waste management is a philosophy of recycling and reusing products. The idea is simple; send no trash to landfills or incinerators. To understand Zero waste, it helps to consider nature; in nature, nothing is considered as waste and everything is recycled in the ecosystem. Practically, achieving zero waste might seem impossible. However, cities like San Francisco and New York are on the verge of accomplishing it. Not so long ago, New York city had a landfill so big that it was said to be visible from space. Even if this is an exaggeration, you can begin to guess just how large it was. Still, with proper planning and precise execution, New York is nearing their goal of achieving zero waste. On the other hand, Sweden is one step ahead. They burn almost 2 million tons of trash every year, which is converted in their impressive waste-to-energy plants. This drastically reduces landfill waste; in fact, other countries even pay Sweden to take their waste and make use of it in their waste-to-energy system. Sweden actually makes a profit from taking other countries’ garbage! Taiwan’s waste management system makes use of one particularly special technique; their garbage trucks have a sound system attached! Their trucks play classical music, from Beethoven or Mozart, while roaming around the city. Whenever citizens hear the beautiful sound of a Beethoven symphony, right away they know it’s the time to take out their garbage. Professional waste management companies provide comprehensive services to take your waste - from domestic to commercial and industrial - and will sort your recyclable materials, solids, liquids and organic foods for you. This process is made easier when people recycle their waste correctly themselves. Many waste management services offer specific collections of materials as part of their rounds. If you’re living in large like Melbourne, you can make use of a skip bin company to speed up the process. These professional waste collectors can also assist you in sorting the recyclable materials from hazardous waste. Items such as computers, televisions and electronic equipment contain many different parts which need to be disposed of differently. This sorting is an exhausting, and often costly, process due to the labor involved. Special sorting machines exist to aid in the sorting process. It’s clear that keeping tabs on a city’s recycling level is a strenuous task for the local authorities alone, but with the involvement of its citizens and the additional help of professional waste management services such as Metro Bin Hire, this task can be made significantly easier. It not only provides a boost to the economy in terms of efficiency, productivity but also provides a cleaner environment for all."
12,Things You Should Know Before Your Tantric Massage Appointment,social-issues," Tantric massage is a unique type of rubdown that uses chakras (a centre of energy in the body as per Indian belief) and energy to relax an individual into a blissful state where physical boundaries are dissolved. A proper tantric rubdown session transports a person into a state of trance where time disappears, problems and worries no longer seem important or they disappear altogether. Whilst most traditional massages will have you covered under a towel, tantric massage involves massaging the erogenous, genital areas. If you have booked an appointment in London, there are few things that you need to keep in mind. Take a look below. Set aside significant time for enjoying the experience Tantric massage is not a quickie experience and you cannot just meet your masseuse thinking it will all be over in about 20 to 30 minutes. You cannot have the mindset of a chair massage. There are a lot of elements that have to be taken care of before the therapist begins the actual massage. For instance, she has to make you comfortable in her presence and get you to the mood. You will not simply find her hands groping your private parts, but it involves a gradual, slow build-up. Initially, the masseuse will just focus on calming you down and eliminating stress and tension from the sore muscles of your body, especially upper and lower back, shoulders and neck area. After that, she starts to gently stroke the other parts of your body. So, you need to have ample time for truly enjoying this massage experience. A minimum of 2-hours is highly recommended. There is no pressure to orgasm The erotic nature of the tantric massage makes a lot of men lose control and orgasm multiple times. However, orgasm is not the ultimate goal of this massage therapy. It is not essential or expected of you to maintain an erection when the massage is being performed on you. The objective of this therapy is to help you reach spiritual enlightenment and a state of complete relaxation. Orgasm is just a part of the process. Carefully choose the location Tantric top massage in London can be enjoyed in the privacy of your own home or in the incall apartment of your chosen therapist. Most agencies provide both outcall and incall services.If you are staying alone or your roommate is out for the weekend, you can invite a therapist over; otherwise, visiting the therapist’s incall apartment would be a smart choice. Choosing the location of the massage is crucial because the rubdown has to be enjoyed in a safe and comfortable environment. You will not be able to truly feel the immersive power of the therapy if there are pressing thoughts on your mind or you can constantly worried about someone coming home. Breathe This might seem obvious, but you will be surprised at the number of people who forget to breathe during a tantric massage session because they are so excited. Breathing is an important part of the massage and if you want, you can ask your therapist to show you a few breathing techniques. This will certainly help to heighten the overall experience and make you feel relaxed from the very core of your being. Apart from the above-mentioned, you have to remember that a tantric massage does not involve any kind of penetration. So, do not expect your therapist to entertain your requests for sexual services. The best that you can do is combine a happy ending massage with your tantric massage session if you feel too aroused and sexually stimulated. Also, remember to eat light if you truly want to have an engaging experience. As there will be so much of kneading, rubbing and other such techniques, a full stomach will simply make you uncomfortable and it will not be a pleasant experience."
13,Packing List for a New Truck Driver,social-issues," Now that you have your CDL, you must be pretty delighted to get on the road. One of the most essential things about life as a truck driver is packing for the journey. You never know what you would need. But just for that reason, you cannot gather your entire belongings. You just  need to pack the right things. Matrack incorporation presents you with the ultimate packing list, which every experienced truck driver swears by. Baggage and Clothes: You will be on the road for 10 or more days. You cannot await on laundry as fewer truck stop offer that service. Before starting your trip, read the weather forecast for the days and areas you will be travelling, and prepare accordingly. Keep a warm coat and a rain jacket always at hand. Also, pack a pair of socks and a few extra handkerchief. Keep a separate bag for clothes that want to be washed. And do not forget your sunglasses for those sunny days. Toiletries and medical kit: Although you can get a toothbrush at any truck stop, packing a small kit with necessities for shower and shaving will be more cost-saving.  If you are on any medication, make sure that you take extra dosage, just to be prepared for any delay. You can also pack adult bath wipes, garbage bags, disinfectant wipes paper towels, as well as a small laundry kit. Bedding: Truckers require rest. After having driven for longer periods of time, you will desire a comfortable place to sleep in. A blanket, comfy pillow and a change of sheets will do for a week’s travel. Snacks: Profession of Trucking is not one of the healthiest one. You are often sitting in the seat of the driver. Also, most of the truck stops do not serve healthy food. So you can get one step closer to better health by packing healthier snacks like fresh fruit, protein bars, vegetables and hummus dip, mixed nuts, frozen fruit bars (if the truck has a fridge), beef jerky, and more. If you are more of a DIY enthusiast, you can also pack a crockpot, a small stove, some disposable plates and spoons, and make yourself a hot meal wherever you want. Entertainment: Trucking is a pretty lonely job, and you definitely require entertainment. You can carry all your favorite songs and movies in your laptop. If you love reading books, having a few audio-books or keeping an e-reader will be better than carrying physical books. If you love photography, you can bring a small point-and-shoot camera, especially for those sunrises and sunsets. You can also invest in a good Bluetooth headset, if allowed by your company, and be in touch with your friends and  family  at all times. Maps: Even though you have GPS and your smartphone, it is always advisable to have the atlas  or map of the terrain you are going to travel. You might not get a phone or internet or Wi-Fi service everywhere, and a map will come in handy on such situation. Money: Carry all the credit and debit cards you have. But also carry some cash and cheques for remotely situated areas. Tool Kit: Your truck shall break down anywhere, and you will need to undertake minor repairs before help arrives. Also have a set of dependable gloves for handling the repairs. Stationery: You will require a binder, to keep all documents at one place. Few pens and a small notebook will also help you keep track of things and make notes. You may also get a few envelopes to store receipts. Charger: In modern times, we do not leave the house without our phones. So keep a battery pack and a charger for extra usage. Paperwork: Most important thing – your paperwork. Keep copies of your identity proof, license, insurance cards, emergency contacts, medical certificates and prescriptions, and all of your CDL endorsements. For the duration of your travel, the truck will be your second home. So go ahead and decorate it if you need. Keep a snow globe, a small succulent, and frames with pictures of your family – anything to make the cabin of your truck feel like your home."

There is no harm in consulting; because you’ll avoid a lifetime problem. When a male and a female get into a relationship, its only cause is love why they are together. There is one more important factor that plays a vital role in their healthy and long-lasting relationship, and that is their sexual compatibility. It is not considered the main reason why two people get together in the first place, but they need to pay attention to that. Sexual compatibility is something when a couple is ideally on the same expectations and wavelength with what happens in the intimate events.

15,Homegrown Hero and Philanthropist gives something more valuable than money!,social-issues," As I began my journey to find true leaders in the ""unsung"" world of giving back, I encountered someone that caught my eye and piqued my curiosity. His name is Dennis Morehead. Dennis Morehead, 47 grew up in a small town in Westchester County called Mt. Vernon in dual parent household with one brother and one sister. He is from modest beginnings but that is not evident by the impact he is having on many people’s lives present-day. Dennis Morehead will tell you forthright that he’s made many mistakes in life and credits God first and then his family’s undying support for his 180-degree turnaround. Coming up on the south side of Mt. Vernon was not easy for a ""preacher’s kid"", as Mr. Morehead would often be teased, but his faith in what he learned about God in his early years gave him hope for a better future. Mr. Morehead’s father instilled in him to always dare to be different. He impressed upon him not to try to be part of the ""in"" crowd but to be a leader in a world of followers. Mr. Morehead recalls hearing his dad say many times, ""if you see a crowd of people running in one direction, go in the OPPOSITE direction."" In spite of Mr. Morehead trying his hardest to be a good example to his friends growing up, many of them were killed at a young age. Some were involved in a criminal way of life while others were victims of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This was all the more reason for him to follow his father’s instruction but he did not turn his back on his peers. Even though he was never one to hang out on a corner or be in big crowds that gathered, he would stop by from time to time to check on the guys and invite them to a program at church or let them know that he was praying for them. Because of this, he had ""street cred"" without having to hang out in the streets. Fast forward to 2019, Dennis Morehead is actively engaged in making a difference in the lives of many inmates of Bridgeport Correctional Center. He had the chance to visit several inmates there and to create bonds that transcended the facility. Even the distance that was between them and him. While working hard to push for prison reform to include the unfair treatment of inmates from the meals to inmate healthcare, he maintains correspondence with many inmates. Some of which have since relocated to different facilities. Mr. Morehead does this through letters, cards and setting up a phone account where inmates can reach him 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if necessary. Mr. Morehead is also trying to establish programs, with the help of his brother Greg Morehead, that will aid in the difficult transition from being an inmate to being a functioning member of society. One thing that I’ve learned from this brief time getting to know Mr. Morehead is that even without massive fortune, one could impact a life more than all of the riches in this world. That happens when LOVE is involved. And Dennis Morehead believes with all of his heart that the love that he is able to show and that has been making a difference in the lives of so many that he comes in contact with, comes only from Jesus Christ. Let God be magnified!"
16,Diamonds are Forever; And so is Plastic,social-issues," Plastic may be convenient and easy. It pleads to our busy one time ""use and throw"" society. Beyond that, it exists in almost everything around us; right from the morning when we brush our teeth, to work with our phones, computers, to the grocery store and it’s even in the clothes we wear. But what exactly happens to the plastic once we discard the item that contains it? Do we ever think of the ""life"" of that plastic further than our trash can? Unfortunately for the Earth and for us, it doesn’t end by throwing it away. Its journey has just begun. Just like the saying ""Diamonds are forever."" And so is plastic. The only difference is diamonds have value and we guard them safely. On the contrary, once the plastic item serves its purpose, it’s tossed away to remain eternally as waste; polluting the only home we have; Earth. The situation that we face today is that our lakes, rivers and oceans are literally teeming not just with fish life anymore, but with all sorts of plastic. It’s fair enough to say it’s become a plastic epidemic. Fish, whales, dolphins are meeting their death; and they are dying due to our waste. We are literally witnessing a plastic crisis; and there is no end in sight. With such a grim situation ahead of us, what can us as individuals do to help the plastic crisis and save our planet? Sometimes the biggest result can come from the smallest change. While legislative initiatives such as passing environmental protection bills are essential, there are also many small and easy, yet powerful ways that each one of us can make a difference. Once we change, others will also join us so the ripple effect will be even greater. Here are a few tips to get started and spark the flame of change: Bring cloth bags to the grocery or department store. Make sure you bring larger cloth bags to bag up your groceries as well as small cloth or mesh bags for veggies and fruits to avoid using plastic bags each time you want a head of lettuce or an apple for example. Likewise when you go clothes shopping make sure you use cloth bags for your purchases instead of plastic or paper (which causes more trees to be cut down). Tip: Keep a stash of cloth bags in the trunk of your car. That way if you spontaneously stop somewhere, you don’t have to resort back to using plastic or paper. You will even find the cloth bags useful for things that you never imagined! Use reusable cups and Tupperware. Keep a reusable cup handy with you and use it for all your drinks instead of ""one time use"" plastic or paper cups. Pack meals and pack up leftovers from restaurants in reusable Tupperware containers to avoid using throwaway leftover containers. Shop wise While shopping, you may have noticed that practically everything is wrapped in plastic; if not just once then double, triple, quadruple plastic packed. It’s almost as if you have to have a war with your purchase once you get home to extract the product from its protective plastic shield. So next time you go shopping, shop wise by purchasing products with less plastic packaging. You may not be able to completely avoid plastic but it’s definitely a good start. If you don’t need, don’t buy it This goes back to fundamentals. Are we purchasing products out of want or is it out of need? While it is definitely still fine to buy item because of want as opposed to need, this trick will help you think twice before buying something. This in turn will save you money and also protect the Earth. Shop at thrift stores Try out shopping at stores like Salvation Army and Good Will for clothes and accessories. The majority of the items of the store may not be up to standards in terms of quality or style but if you sort though you will find some gems. You may even come across some designer clothes, never wore before, with the tags still on them. You can feel satisfied that you got a great item at a fraction of the cost and you have helped the environment too! Get involved in plastic clean up and recycling drives. Get involved in your community and join river, beach and lake cleanup projects. If nothing is going on in your community then don’t worry, start by yourself and be an inspiration to others! Spend a small chunk of time every week picking up and recycling plastics in your area from forests, prairies, rivers, and streams. It may seem small but others who see you will feel inspired as well! In addition, spending that time outdoors every week will give you a greater understanding of the depth of the problem, as well as exercise and an appreciation and respect for nature. Stay educated As they say, knowledge is like gold. Make sure you keep yourself educated about the environment and help spread the word to others too on the changes you have made in your own life to avoid plastics, and on the environmental crisis in the world. The plastic crisis, along with countless other environmental challenges, may seem daunting and even scary. However, through each individual’s small changes in lifestyle, we can make a difference in our world. But there is no time to spare. If we want this world to be a clean, safe home for generations to come, we have to start changing today. If we don’t change our ways, ocean plastic is predicted to triple within a decade and there could literally be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Without wasting even a day more let’s all become guardians of the Earth, our only home, and make efforts to become a spark of hope for change."

1,Online Dating Rules: What Photos are You Posting,social-issues," When you are putting your profile together it’s important to pay attention to the details. Things like your headline, photo and comments in your profile can make the difference between someone who approaches you and someone who passes you by. A picture really does say a thousand words. A single picture can tell someone more than just what you look like. They also can tell someone about your recreational choices, your choice in coffee houses, and even a bit about your self-confidence level. Here are a few tips to make your online photo the best it can be: If you don’t have any suitable recent photos, arrange to go out with friends. Relax and have fun. Get your friends to take lots of photos of you. Hopefully, you’ll get at least one that you’re happy to post. If you have a photo of yourself in a social environment, use that one. It will give a better impression than one of you seated on your sofa at home. Watch for identifying landmarks in your photos. If you routinely go biking on the local trail and post a picture of yourself and bike on that trail, it is unsafe to post on your profile. You may open yourself up to a stalker. Don’t post photos of yourself looking unhappy, drunk, hung-over, lonely, or on a bad hair day! Avoid expensive accessories for your photo. It sends a high maintenance signal. If you want to post multiple photos, make sure that they’re varied and interesting. Avoid multiple photos taken at the same time. Don’t use it as an opportunity to demonstrate in six different ways how attractive you are. It should be an opportunity to convey the fact that you’ve got an interesting life. It’s OK to change your photo from time to time if you come up with better ones, or if they get more than a year old. Even if a photo is a professional one make it look casual. Never wear high fashion garments or accessories. This is the time that casual speaks louder than professional. Your photo should accurately represent you as you are today. For example, if you have lost or gained more than 10 pounds you should replace the photograph with one that is accurate. Nothing screams desperate faster than a woman who posts a photo of herself 10 years younger than she is, or a man 20 pounds’ thinner. Dating sites will often give you guidelines for your photos. Be sure you read these and comply or you might find yourself reported to the management. Many times, they ask that you are central to the photo and usually the only one in it. The photo should be clear and current. Be sure that your photo is: one of you smiling shows your eyes clearly represents the real you. DO NOT: Post photos in skimpy, tight clothing. Use heavy makeup. Only wearing dark glasses. Remember that your photo represents YOU before they can meet the real you."
2,Female Viagra a Myth or reality,social-issues," Like Erectile Dysfunction in men, female also suffers from sexual disabilities. Though it may not be related to erection but definitely sensations. In such a scenario, is there a female Viagra for women. To your surprise, yes there is an equivalent to Viagra suggested for female. But before we see how this medicine helps women, let’s see what root cause of the problem is. Female Sexual Issue: Now one of the most common sexual issues in the female is the low libido and inability to respond well to sexual stimulation.

3,Causes Of Infertility In Men And Women,social-issues," Infertility appears to be a problem when a woman cannot conceive despite having regular unprotected sex and with a desire to produce a child. Medically speaking, infertility is defined as a problem when unprotected sex occurs for a period to 12 months without conception. Worldwide, between 8% and 12% of couples experience problems with infertility, and despite the fact that it is often blamed on the woman, around 45% - 50% of cases are believed to stem from factors affecting the male. One of the main causes in men is a low sperm count, In fact, a low sperm count is thought to be a factor in one in three couples who are trying to produce a baby. A low sperm count is where the man has less than 15 million sperm in one millilitre of semen. That is still quite a lot of sperm when you consider that it only needs one sperm to produce a pregnancy. Nonetheless, that is the way it is. Another problem may be the ability of the sperm to swim. They may not be able to reach the egg as quickly as they should, and this can result in the inability of the woman to conceive. Another situation occurs if the sperm are not of the right shape which can also cause problems with fertilising the egg. Around 2% of men are thought to have abnormal sperm, and in addition abnormal semen may not be able to carry the sperm effectively. There may be several causes of abnormal semen such as a testicular infection, surgery, or cancer. There could be a deficiency of testosterone or there could be ejaculation disorders such as blocked ejaculatory ducts which may cause the semen to be ejaculated into the bladder instead of through the penis into the vagina. There can be several other causes, such as mumps. If a child suffers mumps after puberty this can cause an inflammation of the testicles. Anaemia, diabetes, thyroid disease, and Cushing’s disease can also affect sperm count. Cystic fibrosis is another problem: it usually affects the lungs but can also obstruct the vas deferens which carries sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct and the urethra. Another problem can be genetic factors which could result in a man having two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome where he should have one of each. In this case, the testicles will develop abnormally and there will be low testosterone and sperm count, or possibly no sperm at all. Chemotherapy can also significantly affect sperm count. Yet another problem today is the widespread use of illegal drugs. Consuming cannabis and cocaine can have a considerable effect on the sperm count. Bodybuilders who use anabolic steroids on a long-term basis can also suffer from problems. Being overweight or even obese also reduces the chance of conceiving, whether it is the male or the female who is overweight, or both. Excess alcohol consumption has also been proven to increase the risk of infertility. Then there is the question of age. Male fertility starts to decrease after the age of 40, while in women it begins at around 32. Exposure to things such as herbicides and pesticides has also been shown to reduce fertility. Another element that has become very important in the 21st century is stress. We live in an age where stress affects almost everyone to a greater or lesser degree. Money worries – suffered by a large percentage of the population – together with worries about work status and attempting to achieve a higher step on the career ladder can have a devastating effect on fertility without the individual concerned being aware of it. One of the ways of dealing with all these possible problems of infertility is the Chinese Traditional Medicine of acupuncture. Acupuncture for fertility in London has been used in recent years and has been found to have some dramatic results, especially in cases of stress. It has to be accepted that acupuncture has not been subjected to many scientific tests, and those that have been carried out have been mixed in their outcomes. However, it is also a fact that many men and women who have opted for acupuncture for fertility problems have been delighted with the results that have allowed them to become parents for the first time."
4,Uncontested Divorce in Texas,social-issues," What is an Uncontested Divorce in Texas? Is there really such a thing as an uncontested divorce in Texas? When people see signs on the side of the road advertising low rates for an uncontested divorce, it is easy to get confused. There is a misconception that the word ""uncontested"" refers to whether the couple mutually agrees to be divorced and dissolve the marriage. This misconception often comes from television and movies where characters are focused on whether one will give the other a divorce. In dramatic scenes, one reluctant party finally gives in and signs off on the divorce. While entertaining, this is not an example of an uncontested divorce. Rather, an uncontested divorce is a divorce where the couple has resolved all major issues including child custody, visitation, parenting time and property division. This means much more than husband and wife agreeing to split everything equally and handle custody and visitation on their own. There are several issues that should be addressed, and the parties should be advised of their legal rights under Texas law and the Family Code before making any agreements. An Agreeing to Divorce is Not the Same as Uncontested Divorce Texas, like many states, is a no-fault divorce state, where all a husband or wife needs to allege is insupportability, stated in the Texas Family Code as follows: ""On the petition of either party to a marriage, the court may grant a divorce without regard to fault if the marriage has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marital relationship and prevents any reasonable expectation or reconciliation (Texas Family Code, 6-A)."" If one party alleges the marriage should be dissolved, they allege the grounds for dissolution, such as insupportability, in their petition. If that party wants to be divorced, the court will make a finding that the marriage is dissolved. Whether the other party agrees and wants the divorce is not a question of whether the divorce is an uncontested divorce because uncontested refers to all the legal rights and issues involved in dissolving a marriage where children, income, assets, and property are involved. What Issues Must Be Resolved to Have an Uncontested Divorce? Child custody and visitation are significant issues in divorce. What may sound good in theory, is more difficult to implement in real life. For example, some parents want to share equal parenting time with their sons and daughters and suggest they will work together without a fixed schedule. Everything may run smoothly, but anything can change. Having a well thought out parenting plan helps answer all the ""what if"" questions. Child support, medical expenses, and insurance are issues which must be addressed and resolved before you can proceed with an uncontested divorce. Financial and property issues in a divorce can be the source of conflict. Couples who approach divorce and agree to split everything down the middle may change their mind. There are so many issues involving money and property that people don’t think about until they drill down into the details. It is important to learn your legal rights and duties regarding money and property. Discovery is the process in a divorce, where the parties exchange documents and information about finances, assets, and liabilities. So even if the parties still agree to split everything 50/50, they should be aware of their legal rights and options before proceeding in an uncontested divorce. Using Mediation to Resolve Issues for an Uncontested Divorce A Mediated Settlement Agreement is a document identifying the parties in a divorce and their respective award of the divided marital estate. When the parties agree to mediation, they can use the formal dispute resolution process to identify, resolve and confirm how parenting and property will be addressed in the divorce. The result of the mediation process should be a written Mediated Settlement Agreement. It is important to use an experienced divorce lawyer who knows the requirements necessary so that the Mediated Settlement Agreement is enforceable and the party seeking divorce is entitled to judgment. A Waiver of Service for an Uncontested Divorce In a typical divorce, the party filing for divorce has the other party served with divorce petition and the affidavit of service is part of the divorce court record. If both the parties who want an uncontested divorce, they may waive the formal requirement of being served. The process of serving someone with divorce papers is all about the court’s right to establish personal jurisdiction over the party listed as a respondent in the divorce petition. Judges hearing petitions to approve uncontested divorces require a waiver of service be filed with the clerk of court before the uncontested divorce may be approved. A Signed Final Decree of Divorce for an Uncontested Divorce A final decree of divorce is a formal document containing a list of recitals that identify the requirements for the process of a divorce have been satisfied. The final decree for an uncontested divorce should properly identify the rights and duties of both parties and what will happen with children and property. The final decree indicates that the court has jurisdiction over the parties and the divorce, and that the waiver of service has been filed. Getting an uncontested divorce in Texas is a relatively straightforward process when both parties agree on the division of property and parenting rights and duties. Always hire an experienced divorce attorney to prepare, file and present your divorce to the court."
5,The Kathleen Norton Experiment,social-issues," The Kathleen Norton Experiment OK, here's my story. I started going out with a woman six years ago. (We'll call her Kathleen) She found me on POF (Plenty of Fish) her profile was a silhouette, meaning she did not have a picture of herself online. So, she sent me pictures of her. But I was married at the time. My wife of 30 years (we got married young) was from Denmark, We'll call her Suzanne, a red head. But the last 3 years of our marriage was marred in (my fault, I blame me for this) an affair on my end. (Only once but that will take the trust out of a relationship) so, the last three years of our marriage she would go out on Friday night and come back Saturday morning Then go out Saturday night and come back Sunday morning. She would walk through the door in the morning and I would say ""WTF? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT?"" But I realize that you can't tell someone that is over the age of 18 what do, say, think or feel, they are a legal adult. I don't hit women, in fact I have never hit a woman. Our kids were subject to this display for three years. Maybe she was getting even, I don't know. I just knew that if she wanted to get even she had done so 10 fold. The only reason she left our house was when I confronted her one morning in front of the kids and said ""You are not just hurting me, you are hurting them as well and I pointed to the kids, and teaching them how to follow in your shoes""  That she understood!  She promptly moved out the next day. She was a good woman and I will always love her. She filed for separation that year and finally a divorce, two years ago. I remember that she moved in with my mother We'll call her Diane. But my mother doesn't put up with crap and told her she can live there if she gets a job. She did for two weeks. She she didn't work again and after 3 months of loafing around Diane threw her out. From there she moved in with my oldest daughter and my son. My youngest daughter still lived with me. My oldest daughter moved out  to her own apartment leaving the two bedroom apartment to my ex-wife and my son. I hold nothing against my ex-wife. Suzanne gave me three beautiful, gorgeous kids that I love to death and nearly 30 years of great sex, love, healing and someone in my corner. Even if I don't see kids as much as I would like to. (me ranting...) But everyone needs to live their own life and their own pace So, I hold nothing against anyone. Save One... I was a lost cause, it took me a long time to get over a great person that I had wronged. After nearly a year of just looking out the front door and not getting involved with anything, and I mean anything. I would look out the front window, I would only go out to go to work, buy groceries and mow the lawn. LOL  I was truly lost. Suzanne was really good about the divorce. She always took my calls when I was feeling low. She even stopped by and gave me money if I was a little shy of the APS bill (Electric) or Southwest gas or century link. She was such a good person and I crapped on our relationship. Ugh... Try and live that one down (nice try). So, I eventually weaned myself off of Suzanne, I I finally met someone new. on a dating site. Of all things. I hate dating sites, I mean I loath them. For all you readers out there you know what loath means. for all you non-readers (get yourself a thesaurus). Anyways, I almost immediately fell in love, but I was guarded. This was someone from a dating site. Her name was Kathleen. She was a big girl. I'm not talking taller than me. I'm 6'1"", she was big in the hips, the waist, her thighs. But I fell head over heals for her. Until she started to try to change me and my nature. I mat not be the best of people but, again, I would never hurt a woman and I never will. She had mesmerizing aora about her. She had a masters degree MBA and had worked in some of the most prestigious pleases in Manhattan NY. She had been with way more sexual partners than I had and was used to. It was a draw to her. I tried to end the relationship 3 times but to no avail. The last time I told her that it was not a good match, My son let her in the front door and she came up behind me while I was listening (headphones on) to music and she tapped me on the shoulder and told me how much I needed her. That was the start of my downfall. I have fallen ever since, but I had my first date in months yesterday. With a wonderful woman named D-D Now, Kathleen was so mean that on Christmas of 2018 I was planning on staying home, not doing anything and had just bought myself a turkey hungry man dinner. I was staying home. My right as an adult yes? Kathleen was injecting herself into my life. She moved in about 3 years ago, She lived in Surprise AZ. A Long journey for my worthless vehicle. But I was mesmerized but her beauty. She talked me into going with her to her daughter and future son in laws new house. I was enamored and said yes. I told them how much I liked their new house and after cooking (Yep, I'm a foodie) jumbo shrimp for everyone meaning everyone in her immediate family. Het oldest daughter, her future son in law and her youngest daughter, I went out in the back yard to have a smoke, thank the lord for all he has done for me, showing me the proper path to take. Five minutes after I was out side, Her children (her children!!!) sent her out to apologize to me. HUH? what, yep she was sent out to apologize to me from her children. For being so mean to me. Can you imagine the life I had to endure when no one was around. Her children saved me. She left me for the last 4 months now but the longer she stays away from me, the more I realize that my first instincts were the best. I believe that our nature is what we are. I don't think people can change their nature. They can change their clothes, plastic surgery can change their face, boobs, take weight off of them. But their nature... I've never seen it. Sorry but no. If you are a mean person, you will probably be mean until the day you die. If you are a nice person, you will be bowled over in this world. Last Year 2018, I got into an argument with Kathleen about something stupid. I mentioned that I wanted to call her ex-husband and ask him if this was the reason he left her? Or was it the reason She left him. Maybe, someone was onto her and I was her latest victim. Sounds like I am trying to reason huh? Nope, I was brutally physically hit several times. I DON'T hit women. I was told I was an alcoholic, a lazy ass, a molester in bed. Kathleen Norton woke me up a week before she left to tell me that someone was on my brothers property and their dog was taking a crap on the lawn. I yelled at the new neighbor for doing this. (I have 1 minute of waking up) so yes, I yelled at her, but I was following orders from Kathleen. After a brief but non-necessary conversation, I walked back into my house where I was beaten again. (Slugged in my shoulders and glancing off my shoulders to my head).  All true. I'm not sure why seem to love the people that are so bad for us! OK, here's my story. I started going out with a woman six years ago. (We'll call her Kathleen) She found me on POF (Plenty of Fish) her profile was a silhouette, meaning she did not have a picture of herself online. So, she sent me pictures of her. But I was married at the time. My wife of 30 years (we got married young) was from Denmark, We'll call her Suzanne, a red head. But the last 3 years of our marriage was marred in (my fault, I blame me for this) an affair on my end. (Only once but that will take the trust out of a relationship) so, the last three years of our marriage she would go out on Friday night and come back saturday morning Then go out Saturday night and come back Sunday morning. She would walk through the door in the morning and I would say ""WTF? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT?"" But I realize that you can't tell someone that is over the age of 18 what do say, think or feel, they are a legal adult. I don't hit women, in fact I have never hit a woman. Our kids were subject to this display for three years. Maybe she was getting even, I don't know. I just knew that if she wanted to get even she had done so 10 fold. The only reason she left our house was when I confronted her one morning in front of the kids and said ""You are not just hurting me, you are hurting them as well and I pointed to the kids, and teaching them how to follow in your shoes""  That she understood!  She promptly moved out the next day. She was a good woman and I will always love her. She filed for separation that year and finally a divorce, two years ago. I remember that she moved in with my mother We'll call her Diane. But my mother doesn't put up with crap and told her she can live there if she gets a job. She did for two weeks. She didn't work again and after 3 months of loafing around Diane threw her out. From there she moved in with my oldest daughter and my son. My youngest daughter still lived with me. My oldest daughter moved out  to her own apartment leaving the two bedroom apartment to my ex-wife and my son. I hold nothing against my ex-wife. Suzanne gave me three beautiful, gorgeous kids that I love to death and nearly 30 years of great sex, love, healing and someone in my corner. Even if I don't see kids as much as I would like to.

I extended my hand in good faith but she pushed it away and gave me a hug instead. I told her how sorry I was for saying the things I did. But I protect the people I love in my life with everything I have.  I turned around and there standing outside my front door was Kathleen, head down, arms crossed and tapping a shoe. Sounds like a rambling huh?  Nope, I can prove it all! For some strange reason, I kept all the texts I was sent on my cell. I am now something I never wanted to be. A guarded person! PS, if you read this and respond to me, I will always respond to you! Dennis H, Phoenix, AZ"
6,What Is The Worst Thing In A Bisexual Marriage?,social-issues," Maintaining and developing a good marriage is challenging for straight, and is it more difficult for bisexual friends? Perhaps the first thing many people think of is derailment. Yes, Derailment, whatever the cause, is of course wrong and is not acceptable to the majority. But the fact that everyone knows is that marriages that are not derailed are not necessarily happy, and marriages that have been derailed are not necessarily unhappy. Derailment is contrary to the basic principles of marriage, and it will certainly hurt the marriage. But derailment is not the worst thing in marriage, nor is it the ""end of the world"" of marriage. The wise man knows how to absorb the nutrients that are valuable to his life and become life. The real winner. For bisexual marriage, Based on a special definition of bisexuality, bisexual people are attracted by two genders, Many bisexuals are more or less likely to have additional sexual relationships or male or female friends outside of marriage. Many times, we will see many couples on the bisexual dating site to find friends to join their marriage. Women Looking For Threesome, It's great to see that. If both spouses are willing to join a third person, whether it is a one-night stand or a long-term three-person trip, then you must find some of your boundaries and look for your other half without hurting your marriage. I think the most terrible thing in marriage is indifference and refusal to communicate. The quarrel is not terrible, the terrible thing is that it can't be noisy, it doesn't matter to anything. No comfort, no greeting, no communication, no passion. Quarrel is a way to solve problems, The worst thing is that two people say nothing, are indifferent to each other, this is the so-called cold violence, cold violence is very harmful to women, they will be mentally and because of your cold, contempt, laissez-faire, alienation and indifference Psychologically hurt and on the verge of marriage despair. In a bisexual marriage, I think that we should be honest with each other. Create more opportunities for communication with each other. We should be honest about our sexual orientation and our thoughts and practical actions on threesome. In many bisexual marriages, many bisexual people want to try to have a threesome relationship, but they are worried that their other half will be hurt, so before that, treat each other honestly and make relevant boundaries that will benefit your marriage. Marriage is not easy to walk all the way, Learning to be inclusive is the most important skill. In bisexual marriage, How Do I Be a Bisexual Supportive Partner? This is also a very hot topic. Mutual trust should be a very important factor, Suspicion often ruins a good marriage. When many people find that their husband or wife is bisexual, they start to wonder if she/he still has a girlfriend or boyfriend. Does she/he not love me, does she/he often talk to another person about yourself? Maybe there is no another person at all, everything is just suspicion."

8,Questions To Ask Before Dating Again,social-issues," Questions To Ask Before Dating Again When it comes to dating, it's easy to become fixated on what we want in a partner. But the real key to successful dating, especially after having been in a substantial relationship, is knowing that you are ready to date again. When is the right time? While there is no one answer for all people, here are some key things to consider that will help you decide if it’s time to get back in the dating saddle. Mental Health Are you emotionally ready to go on that search for someone special? Failed relationships can leave their wounds, and it can take time to mend them. Are you ready to get into another relationship, or do you bring too much baggage? Take an honest personal inventory. You might be lonely for a companion, but are you emotionally independent and stable enough to date again? Maybe you’re ready for light dating, but not at all ready for a serious commitment. Of course we all know it is best not to jump into a rebound relationship because after a long-term relationship we need time to get grounded. Our Children This won’t apply to everyone, but it can be critically important if you are a parent. If you have children, you should consider talking with them about your decision to date again. Explain why it’s important for you to have an adult companion, and of course take time to comfort your children and let them know they are the most important people in your life and no new relationship will ever compromise your bond. Physical Health Our emotional lives can only be as healthy as our bodies. While health varies from person to person, all people deserve love. But whether you are looking for that next serious relationship or you are just looking to casually hook up with other singles for a fun night here and there, you need to know that you are sexually fit to begin a relationship with a new partner. There is no better measure we can take to ensure we’re in the right state of being to physically connect with others than simply getting our health checked. Even if you have been in a long term relationship, it can be very reassuring to you and to any potential partner if you get yourself tested for sexually transmitted diseases. Lessons Learned Why did your last relationship fail? There’s nothing like a bad break up to make us second guess our life choices, and that sort of introspection is good. It’s important for us to be forgiving of ourselves, but it’s also important for us to be honest in our self-reflection about the role we played in the demise of our previous relationships. What have we learned? Moving forward, what can we do differently? It is here that you will find your personal keys for relationship success."
9,Who is eligible for Zakat?,social-issues," What is Zakat? Zakat is also known as Zakah and it is one of five pillars of Islam. It is very compulsory for every person but it is not essential for those persons, who are not able in the term of finance. In the Arabic language, Zakah means purification. As Allah SWT mentions it in the Holy Quran: Take from their wealth so that you might purify and cleanse them_ All eligible people are needed to pay an annual to the percentage of 2.5% as Zakah, from the wealth and property they own. Zakah is the 3rd pillar of Islam and it is mentioned alongside the prayer (Salah) in eighty-two verses of the Holy Quran. What are the benefits of Zakah? Muslims believe in that it has many worldly and spiritual benefits. They also believe that they get the happiness of Allah by paying Zakah. There is only one act for vanish poverty in society. For example, if rich people give zakah to the poor people and this cycle is continuous each time, then there will be a time when poverty will vanish from society. In these days, poverty is a social evil which creates many social evils. Zakah is only obligatory for Muslims and it is not mandatory for Non-Muslims. Every Muslim who has reached maturity which means he/she knows the difference between the good and bad deeds, he/she has to pay Zakah. Muslim should pay Zakah on any surplus wealth under your procession.

Ibnus-Sabeel: Those people who are travelers and they stay in a foreign land but they need money. They will only be entitled if the purpose of traveling is lawful (Shrai). Al Ghaarimeen: This word is used for those people who are in debt. Nowadays, Zakah is very essential in this world because wealth has become an important part of life to get the required things. When Muslims pay from their wealth in the form of Zakah, it means they are sacrificing wealth in the way of Allah.

10,"Start A New Relationship, With Your Partner",social-issues," It’s been a wonderful Season so far of clearing, replenishing, and resetting ourselves. As we move into the lovely holiday weekend with Passover and Easter, if you observe, we can expand on the meaning of the holiday beyond the religious message. I love to experience this time as a time for new beginnings… A time for rebirth, for freely pursuing our heart and our dreams, for beginning anew, for blooming, for thriving… And, I love applying this lens to our Relationship… This is a time for recommitting to our partner and for starting a new chapter in our relationship, maybe even a new book! Regardless of the status of your relationship, here is another opportunity to reinvest in creating the relationship you desire. You have a chance to create a new relationship with your partner. You have a chance to start new. I’m all for milking any and all opportunities in front of me. How about you? So, what does this mean for our relationship? Of course, feel free to run with this concept as fits your life, relationship, current status, style, creativity, and such, but for my priming let’s entertain the idea (don’t overthink this!) of how different things could be if you had no choice but to succeed at your relationship… How would you show up if all of a sudden: Your relationship is brand spanking new and you’d inherit trillions of dollars if you create a successful relationship… You only have a few days left to live and want to enjoy a successful relationship experience… You lost your relationship memory but know you love and enjoy your partner and have a successful relationship… You are in a gameshow where you win big bucks if you are selected as the best couple with the most successful relationship… You are the poster couple for relationships being showcased to teach children about successful relationships… You are the last couple post-apocalypse and have to role model a successful relationship for the future of humanity… You are going on a very dangerous mission and want to leave a recorded year-in-the-life of Mom and Dad’s successful relationship for your children… You are in a foreign world where the inhabitants are to be terminated unless they learn from you how to be an amazing couple, and create a successful relationship… Your life is threatened, unless you engage your partner creating a successful relationship… You swap identities with the partners of the most well-known/public, wealthy and successful relationship in the world… What is the common denominator in the above? To be the best you can be in your relationship, no matter what… It’s interesting what comes up when you entertain this (again, play along, don’t logic this!). How would you be in your relationship, if you had no choice but to show up with your best self? It’s also interesting to see what happens when we do show up with our best self… This is what I teach our couples. It makes a huge difference once the partners focus on what they contribute and step up their own game… Your Assignment this week: Right about now is the perfect time to commit anew to your Partner, the Relationship, and to creating a Successful Relationship. Dust-off your yearly goals and see what you had for Relationship Enrichment. Tweak those as necessary to capture the recommitment, starting new, the gorgeous meaning of the season, and properly kick off Q2!

11,Simple Tips to Become an Escort’s Favourite Client?,social-issues," Escorts are more than just a replacement for someone you like. They are professionals in the business of giving pleasure and guarantee a great time even in the saddest moments. You may hire an escort for different reasons like, for a party or to take care of your unsatisfied desires. But, you have to remember that just because an escort is a paid companion, you cannot treat her badly. After all, a sexual encounter can only be heightened when both parties are enjoying themselves. So, even though you do not have to go out of your way to treat her special, you can keep in mind the following things to increase your chances of becoming her favourite client. Whenever you are availing escort services, reach for your appointment on time. In case you are held up elsewhere, you should call and let her know the time it might take you to reach. If you need to prepone or postpone your appointment, inform her beforehand and reschedule. Also, coming late means wasting precious time that you could have otherwise spent with your chosen escort. Escorts are classy and expect their clients to treat them the same way. Avoid discussing money when you meet her and never try to negotiate. You already know her hourly rate when you booked her. So, give her the money before the start of the session in the most discreet manner possible. Also, if you are planning to go to a party or event with her, do not make her feel uncomfortable with your sexual overtures. A little kissing here and there, and under-the-table activities are acceptable, but do not embarrass her in front of your friends or guests. Be the perfect gentleman and she will return your gesture in ways that you can only dream about at night. Be respectful and treat her like a lady. Just because you are hiring an escort, it does not give you the right to force yourself on her. Usually, escorts make known their range of services. Whilst some enjoy BDSM, watersports and deep throat depilation, others might not. So, if you have chosen an escort who provides GFE, role-play, cross-dressing and lap dance, do not demand her to entertain your whims of watersports or BDSM. You need to ensure that you have booked the right escort as per your mood and preferences. Most escorts will not be thrilled about providing extra services and they may also refuse to see you ever again. Women love to be appreciated and you must already know that. The same rule applies when you are enjoying the company of an escort. Throw in a few compliments here and there to make her blush and she will be truly yours for the night. Would you like to engage in fornication with a woman who has not bathed? Or is wearing lingerie that has holed? You will certainly not enjoy that experience. Well, it is the same with escorts. At the end of the day, escorts are women with exceptional taste in men as they serve the needs of discerning gentlemen. When you avail escort services, make sure to have a nice, long shower before meeting her. It will also fetch you brownie points to shave, trim your pubic hair and wear a fresh pair of underwear. First impressions go a long way in deciding if the escort will like to meet you again. The above-mentioned are some small, but significant points for you to remember when you hire an escort in London. By following these tips, you can make sure that your chosen escort would be thrilled to meet you again. She might even be eagerly waiting for you and give you a little special something the next time so that you remember her."
12,Can visiting a brothel help you find the girl of your dreams in the real world?,social-issues," You may not have realised it, but spending some time with one of the ladies at Cleos On Nile could help you with finding lifelong happiness in your real-world relationships! Your lady of choice may not fall madly in love with you, sorry to say. She is, and always will remain a professional courtesan that is offering you a service. However there are many ways in which seeing her can facilitate your pursuit to having the ultimate relationship outside of the brothel. Brothel Girlfriend We’ve heard it all before: explore all your options before settling down. Having a brothel girlfriend can eliminate the time and effort that is involved with starting a relationship but allow you to still experience intimacy without all of the complications a traditional relationship can bring. The service provider will be thrilled that her efforts in the bedroom have helped you to find success with the lady of your dreams! You will find yourself more motivated to take care of yourself physically, when you know that you will be intimate with your brothel girlfriend on a regular basis. This motivation will also benefit all aspects of your life, including boosting your confidence when it comes to holding conversations with potential partners. Having an increased confidence in this aspect of your life shows and will help you to attract the woman you want to spend your life with. We are always happy to see you Sexually frustrated people often don’t make good decisions, based on desperation and frustration. This may cause you to seek out wrong potential suitors, and lead to increased emotional mind games you never had any intention of getting involved with. Knowing you have a loyal service provider who is always happy to see you and allow you to express yourself in the bedroom will allow you to have much more confidence that you will choose the right girl in the real world for all the right reasons. Your brothel girlfriend will not sugar coat your performance in the bedroom either! Having this objective feedback from her will allow you to practice your skills (or lack therof) so you can perfect them for when you finally meet ""the one"". There is nothing more impressive than having a man know what he’s doing in the bedroom. Being able to see a professional means you are not wasting any of your time with women who may not be interested, who may not be as skilled, or who may come with a host of demands far more complex than a simple exchange of currency. Professional Girlfriend If you are the type of man that gets emotionally connected to women easily, there is the option of spending time with more than one service provider. An experience with more than one beautiful and exciting escort is not only a wonderful fantasy to fulfill, they will allow you to be open to more than one type of lady who you might be looking for. The chance of an infatuation developing when you are seeing more than one brothel girlfriend is less likely to happen, and best of all, no one will be jealous or upset at the situation! If what you want is a real relationship, then visiting Cleos On Nile will help facilitate this in so many ways. We hope to see you soon in your quest for love! ================ This article was originally posted in Cleos On Nile Blog."

16,Why Lingerie Shopping And Kama Sutra Go Hand-In-Hand,social-issues," Kama Sutra, written by Vātsyāyana Mallanāga, dates back to the third and fourth-centuries in India. Hindus believed that sexual activity was a sacred act which served three purposes: piety (dharma), prosperity (artha), and sex (kama). According to ancient Hindu practices, the pursuit of sexual pleasure was equal to spiritual enlightenment or a religious passage, which was very different from the Christian view, which is that sexual activity should only be for procreation. Today, Kama Sutra has become increasingly popular and more adaptable by couples all over the world. Many consider it to be the ultimate sex guide, because it provides an array of sexual positions that combine yoga with sexuality. Kama Sutra has been shown to improve physical elasticity and flexibility in the body, similar to gymnastics, while it simultaneously invites more creativity into the bedroom. Some report that Kama Sutra is the ultimate way to experience the sacredness of sex, thereby linking one’s spirit with matter by having a more direct connection the root chakra, thereby increasing one’s opportunity for a full kundalini rising.

17,The Bi modal Personality: A Socio-sexual model of Human Behavior,social-issues," by Robert DePaolo Abstract This article discusses two core aspects of personality that have broad impact on multiple behavior patterns; including creativity, politics, sexuality and antisocial behavior. The model is derived from human/primate evolutionary origins which include the quest for social hierarchical status and the drive to reproduce. The two factors are presented as inextricably linked as an integrated, bimodal motive to a wide range of emotions and behaviors. The Master... Freud's tripartite theory of the psyche emphasized the relationship between reason, impulse, the conscience and their interactive relevance to normalcy and pathology. If one were to include all the other components of his theory, for example the unconscious, dreams, complexes and stages of development, gaining a concise understanding of what makes Homo sapiens tick would be very difficult indeed. Over time the sheer complexity of psychoanalytic theory put it somewhat on the sidelines as a conceptual and therapeutic methodology. In addition its long term parameters created a bottleneck for insurance carriers who began to gravitate toward more economical methods such as cognitive-behavior therapy and behavior modification. Whether the newer, briefer methods are more effective than psychoanalysis is open to question, particularly since the ways in which therapeutic improvement is determined can be subjective and ultimately existential. Still the elegance of Freud's theory remain appealing, in part because it dovetails with some irrefutable facts about human nature. For example his unification of the libido and the principle of energy conservation (borrowed from Maxwell and Einstein) was elegant. Much of what we do has some sort of relationship to the drive to seek pleasure (sexual and otherwise); particularly in an evolutionary context. Archaic Homo was only modestly encephalized, could neither run very fast nor climb as well as his quadrupedal cousins. Over time our forebears were evolving into a more slender, gracile creature. Despite potential advantages emanating from that, including enhanced fine motor dexterity and greater heat tolerance for long distance traveling, having less muscle mass was also a physical liability. In addition, archaic females, in typical primate fashion gave birth to one child at a time in most instances and the infant's development extended beyond the usual primate norms. Faced with such long odds and predatory vulnerability nature had to bestow on the creature a fervent, compensatory sex drive. Ladies to the Rescue... Fortunately, females in at least one of the Archaic Homo groups changed in their morphology (by a quirk of nature or something more neo-Lemarckian?) Protruding breasts and pelvises, which in other primates only emerge during estrus, became more permanent. It looked to males as though these females were in permanent estrus. Good fortune prompted a physically weak, not yet brainy species to develop an intense interest in mating, which helped to ensure species continuity. Primate courtships... The final result was a complex human psycho-sexual dialectic. On one hand having such a lustful orientation favored much-needed propagation. On the other hand, since the infants' development began to take longer, females had to balance their sexual interest with their maternal/protective instincts. They did so by selecting males with a helping, cooperative orientation, that is, males whose behavioral traits signaled commitment and stability. To the prospective mothers, it was clear that while having males around to help in child rearing was beneficial, it also meant males would have more contact with the infants. Males are not as typically gentle with infants so the females offered themselves up as a laboratory. An empathic strategy evolved in which females used the males' behavior toward them as an indication of how the males would react to off spring in what amounted to a fusion between courtship and paternal fitness. As a result of this complex process a distinctly new primate mating pattern emerged which was both revolutionary and evolutionary. One might ask; why use the term ""revolutionary""? For example, don't most animals treat each other gently during mating season? For example, even the lion in the throes of sexual fervor makes sure none of his sexual reactions will hurt or frighten off the lioness - pleasure, not pain being the whole point of the interaction. The problem is that this is not necessarily true of primates. Chimps (our closest evolutionary relatives) have a fairly random mating process, whereby deception, opportunism and aggression are a bit more common (Crystal, 2018). Because they tend to live in large social groups sexual competition is more intense. Indeed alpha males attempt to hog all the action and lesser ranked members have to persuade or cajole females into clandestine rendezvous. If caught by alpha males the consequences can be dire - which makes one wonder if this is the original/primal source of sexual guilt (fear of getting caught in a non-approved sexual encounter by an authority figure). That, of course, is mere conjecture. Less speculative is that sexual opportunity in primates has a direct correlation with social status. Thus a more comprehensive view of the human psyche would suggest one fundamental catalyst of human behavior, the libido, must be integrated with another, the drive for social status. In that context ""rank and arousal"" would be coupled in the same way that Einstein coupled mass and energy. While this proposal is theoretical there is ample research lending support. For example Muehlenbein, Watts, et. al. showed that as social status was enhanced not only did chimp males experience an increase in testosterone levels but also became more attractive to females-who apparently sensed both the status and fertility of the higher ranking male (2003). Such a neo-Freudian modification might entail not just a unification of two prominent (previously separate) personality factors; social need and sexual need but would also include the inferiority/superiority complex and derivative compensatory mechanisms discussed by Alfred Adler, (Orgler, 1976). A (Psychic) Theory of Everything? Ever since Einstein put forth his special and general theories of relativity, theoretical physicists have argued about what a unified field theory would look like, i.e. one describing a common source for the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational forces and whether such a mechanism exists. Whether it be Neils Bohr challenging Einstein on the orderliness vs uncertain nature of the cosmos, Richard Feynman depicting the universe as having no more of a cause-effect history than a fluctuating random particle, the central question has been the same:  which model/argument has enough teeth to resolve all issues related to the functions of the large and subatomic aspects of the universe? A similar question could be asked regarding this bimodal socio-sexual theory, to wit: does it explain a significantly wide range of human behaviors and motives? In addressing that question, obviously one must wax subjective, since there seems to be a dearth of research on this topic. Yet one can begin on fairly solid anecdotal ground by pointing out that almost every human motive has either a sexual or social source. From the moment of early human art, depictions of large breasted females and otherwise voluptuous characterizations were prevalent. The influence of sexual themes on language, morality, literature, art, filmmaking and music remains pre-eminent in human affairs. So does social concern. Modern technology has shown us that our need to know about what every person does, what they achieve, what they say, how they act, how they sin and how sincerely they apologize has turned social media into a trillion dollar enterprise. Clearly Homo sapiens is by nature a bit snoopy, gossipy and competitive - traits that are thankfully (occasionally) balanced by altruistic concerns. If sex and social interest are in themselves powerful drives, one could argue that the unification of those drives into a psychological mosaic would be powerful enough to be at the root of other motives.  That is precisely the argument here. The Particulars... Freud's theory of the personality was by far the broadest and possibly the most ingenious ever devised; not just because of its clinical, physical and biological breadth but also because Freud was bold enough to apply his theory to a wide variety of behavior patterns - even some of the most mundane. He discussed history, dreams, humor, smoking (his own personal vice), art, politics, child development, as well as psychopathology through the prism of psychoanalysis. While it is  difficult to aspire to that level of intellectual prowess, it might be worthwhile to apply this socio-sexual model to various aspects of human behavior to see if a theoretical unification is possible. Art... The drive to create has many possible antecedents. For example, the curiosity drive forces us to seek new stimuli. Humans not only have a tendency to invent new and useful or entertaining concepts and tools but often invent new fears and worries because we need to not only adapt to our environment but also to anticipate its perks and dangers. (One cannot come up with solutions unless there are problems to solve in the first place and creativity initially requires an irritating vacuum). Yet art is also a social phenomenon. Painting, music, sculpting, literature, architectural design - all pass through the filter of social approval. While not experimentally validated, but demonstrable, artists usually have no dearth of mating opportunities. That does not mean artists employ their skills merely to attract sexual partners but the effect is the same. The fact that their social rank (through reputation, notoriety and financial success) is enhanced by artistic endeavors offers further support of the inextricable link between status and the libido. As an interesting side note, paleoanthropologists have long wondered what motivated early man to paint in the caves at Lascaux and Altamira. Some believe the paintings were spiritual (Greene 2007). Others believe the drawings were the inevitable byproduct of a cognitive leap in brain evolution (Waldman, 2012). These theories, and others, are interesting and possibly valid. One question seldom asked is whether the ancient artists drew these pictures to among other things, obtain higher rank and sexual access. Athletics: One way to address this aspect of human endeavor is to conjure up a kind of thought experiment, whereby one group of well-trained athletes are asked to run as fast or jump as high as they can with no one watching, the second group to do so with people observing.  This is not the same as asking whether some athletes perform  better or worse under pressure of scrutiny - clearly that varies with the individual. Rather it is to ask whether non-social performance would differ significantly from social performance. The same question could be asked of musicians, lecturers and actors. Research on this is sparse but one suspects the presence of observers would more often than not enhance performance; for various reasons having to do with social status, heightened adrenal output and the performance enhancing reinforcement (or fear of rejection) from the crowd. Politics... The role of socio-sexual elements in politics is obvious; not only in light of the sexual exploits of various leaders over time (and not just in the USA - which begs the question of why we are so surprised by revelations about the sex lives of powerful politicians) but also because politics is not only about policy but also about appeal, attractiveness, and abstractions such as...""connecting with the people"" ""being charismatic"" and ""having a following."" Under the most horrendous circumstances we have seen this tendency utilized by figures like Caligula, Jim Jones and Charles Manson to manipulate the social and sexual/political instincts of their followers. Yet even benevolent figures have fished in those waters. Henry Kissinger's famous quote about power being an aphrodisiac comes to mind. Humor... Humor can also be said to derive from socio-sexual roots. It is of course social, since much of it pertains to one person's observations of others; for example George Carlin's comments on the flat backsides of white folks and Richard Prior's epiphany at seeing predominantly black folks in his travels to Africa. Yet while it is social it is also, interestingly, devoted to social rank. In fact when this writer was a young man a joke-fest among peers was often called a ""ranking party."" Freud maintained that inherent in humor is an aggressive or taboo component, that allows us to say or imply things that have hurtful, demeaning tones but are masked as sarcasm and irony. Hennie Youngman's ""take my wife... please"", Jeff Foxworthy's...""You could be a redneck"" are just two of many examples of the hierarchical underpinnings of humor. Since social rank has bearing on sexual access it can be said to fit into the bimodal personality paradigm as well. Crime... In recent times there has been an emphasis on analyzing the psychological motives of criminals - particularly terrorists and serial killers through the prisms of religious fervor, symbolism, maternal relationships, child abuse etc. While each of these elements no doubt plays a role one has to wonder if the hyper-analysis of criminal behavior misses the point and if the roots of such behavior also derive primarily from a socio-sexual dynamic. For purposes of discussion let us review some crimes of note. Ted Bundy's horrific dynamics... For all the analysis in books, commentary and documentaries on the motives of serial killer Ted Bundy the dynamics of his horrendous acts might have been fairly uncomplicated. He was spoiled as a child - perhaps due to guilt over the deception that his mother was really his mother. His eventual discovery that he was illegitimate and that his sister was really his mother created a dissonance-fomenting demotion from status of favorite son to gullible, unwanted bastard. He was later rejected by his fiance'; a slender woman with long dark hair who broke their engagement abruptly. This was no doubt interpreted by Bundy as a further demotion in status. He then found another girlfriend whom he tied up regularly as part of a sexual control ritual (possibly in a feverishly compulsive act of self restoration, e.g: ""If I prevent you from moving and exert maximal physical control you can't leave or demote me"") and subsequently went about murdering numerous look-a-likes to his fiance'. Did his need to kill, then rape his victims posthumously occur because he was never able to reestablish his hopeful, self perceived social rank as ""bright, charming law student""; his female-directed nihilism a bizarre way of re-promoting himself and during the process, raising his testosterone levels through the safety valve of ultra control ? Similar dynamics seem to be involved with many mass murderers and Islamic terrorists - the latter of whom had been promised not only legendary heroic status in death but also access to 72 virgins in paradise. Charles Manson was a rejected musician who neatly divided up the world into ""injured have-nots"" (his narcissistically inspired group) and the ""haves."" For all his ranting about ""helter skelter"" his actions might have been designed for rank restoration and to establish sexual and physical dominance. Psychopathology... Freud's main emphasis was of course on psychopathology. In recent times many syndromes have been found to derive from biochemical processes in the brain.  At face value this would seem to mitigate against a bimodal, evolutionary model of causation; that is, unless correlations can be found between the neurochemical and socio-sexual systems. Perhaps there are. For example a causative feature of many depressive disorders is a depletion of pleasure-enhancing neurotransmitters such as the catecholamine group. This and other transmitters are also related to social-hierarchical experiences, including an uptake following successful experiences and increased social status (Cheng, Kormenko, et al. 2015). Thus many of the  same chemical agents involved in psychopathologies are functional in the socio-sexual dynamic. In addition, the cognitive themes of psychotics, dissociative as they might be, often pertain to social themes. For example a sense of being programmed or spied on by the paranoid schizophrenic, social anxiety at being in a room full of people, compensatory (status enhancing) rage at authority figures by an individual with an anti-social personality, status enhancing acts of sexual dominance by a low ranking individual who engages in rape or child molestation and the status seeking hysteria of the spotlight-seeking borderline personality. Whether one can, as per this model, simplify the psyche via the integration of two indistinguishable drives is, of course, speculative. To do so would probably require proof that on a basic neurobehavioral level the human brain is co-wired in this way. It might also mean conjuring up an evolutionary link between social and sexual need (perhaps even extending to the origin and primal functions of human language). It is clear that studies of the comparative cognitive abilities of young children and chimps showed that (brain mass notwithstanding) the advantage human infants had was a greater capacity to learn by observing and copying others (Hirschon, 2017). It suggests enhanced social perception might have been the evolutionary ratchet leading to our higher intelligence and unique capacity to pass information down through generations in building  a cumulative culture. If the sex drive fuels us and social concern drives us, perhaps it can be assumed that in some way there would be a level of cooperation and mutual influence between the two in virtually all aspects of the personality.

Dating after divorce can make you experience anxiety, it is normal to feel this way. However, the tips I will discuss in this post will help you make the right choices and avoid wasting your time. Many people advice that divorced dating should be avoided because you need time to heal. The flip side is that you will spend long days and nights feeling sorry and sad. This is not a good place. You need to get your social life back as quickly as possible. Divorced singles can date people who have never been married before or other divorcees. There is no hard set rule to determine who you should date. However, you must focus on what’s important, starting a relationship that offers everything you desire. Here are some helpful tips to help you start dating after divorce. Making comfortable decisions When you start divorced dating, it will be best if you accept offers that make you comfortable. For example, if you don’t like visiting the zoo, don’t make plans to go there. Visit places you are genuinely interested in, this also applies to dining in restaurants. When you are in an environment that makes you happy, the chance of having a great time is higher. Take it slow when dating after divorce Decisions that are rushed usually end up badly. So you should take it slow. First focus on being friends, find common interests and talk about things. The easiest way to know you will have a good friendship is when you can carry on conversations for long periods easily. Flirting is harmless Don’t be surprised when someone flirts with you. Think about it; you still got the looks and features to make someone throw you glances or pass flirty notes. So take it as a compliment. Never compromise behavior You just got out of a relationship and that experience has to be buried in the past. This means you should look out for signs of toxic behavior or other attributes that led to the end of your marriage. Never compromise. If you overlook that behavior, you may be heading into a relationship with similar bad experiences. Keep the gadgets away During dates, it will be best if you avoid the use of smartphones or other gadgets that can cause a distraction. Your focus should be studying the other person to know them better. Introducing friends and family This should come after you have known them and are comfortable with their personalities and lifestyle. If you introduce them to people around you too early, you may be put under pressure to make commitments before you are ready. This can happen if your family thinks you need a partner urgently, they will influence your judgment, and you can miss important signs regarding the relationship. Overall, it would be best if you always looked for ways to have fun. If it doesn’t work out, you will have the good memories make you smile. Don’t be worried about starting divorce dating.

1,"Did You Say, I Want An Asian Bride. Here She Is!",social-issues," So you’ve made the decision, put your foot down and finally said to yourself, ""I want an Asian bride?"" Well, my friend, you’ve made the right choice and I’ll tell you just why in the rest of this article. First, allow me to let you in on a little secret, however – I won’t be trying to get you to order a particular Asian beauty. Why? Because the choice is completely up to you and always will be. You are not in an arranged marriage situation. Choosing the right girl is absolutely up to your preference, and given that you have the money to order one – you’re as good as ready! Need more convincing to go browse through beautiful Asian brides? Then, by all means, continue reading this article. Ordering wives over the internet aren’t something that just appeared overnight. It’s a phenomenon that has been widely spread across Europe, America and other parts of the world for a while now. A lot of western men live busy lives and have hectic schedules, so going out and finding a girl they like on the off chance that they end up marrying her isn’t something they can afford to do. This is exactly why this service was created in the first place, and since there are so many women constantly looking for husbands outside the borders of their own country – it’s here to stay for a long, long time. Besides, who wouldn’t want an Asian bride for themselves? Now, for a second thought might pop into your head, ""I want an Asian bride but, are they actually selling these girls?"". Absolutely not! Every single woman that’s listed on bride ordering websites personally applies, or even comes in for a face to face interview, depending on the agency. There is no human trafficking involved and there never has been in the first place. You’re paying for the services, not her ""services"". Okay, so let’s say I want an Asian bride, where do I get one? There are numerous sites out there dedicated exclusively to the concept of finding each and every single man a suitable, charming and most importantly – a willing bride. Most of them offer wide selections of women, ranging from stunning Thai girls to exceptional Japanese beauties. There are also websites dedicated to just one country, in particular, made to satisfy some of the bigger markets like China or Thailand, so you’re sure to find yourself a match. It’s also worthy to mention that nobody is rushing you to go into any relationship immediately. You’ll undoubtedly have more than enough time to plan out and arrange everything before your bride arrives, from dates to wedding arrangements so awkwardness will be a thing of the past. To be quite honest with you I want an Asian bride of my own even, and know many people who do – it’s just a matter of affording one in the first place. The prices aren’t extortionate by any means, however, so if you’re one of the more fortunate western men and are looking for a gorgeous Asian wife of your own, do yourself a favor: Order one, choose to be happy and be the envy of everyone around you."

3,How Can Elite Singles Find And Meet Rich Men looking for marriage,social-issues," If you are looking to meet rich men in the hopes of settling down with someone wealthy, you’re not alone. But in order to stand out from the rest of the crowd, you will need to consider a few things that will help you find rich men looking for marriage easier than the many women competing in the sometimes fierce world of online elite singles dating. Use an elite singles dating site One of the best ways to find and meet rich men is through an elite singles dating site. Elite singles dating sites are designed to match up rich men and women with partners that suit their preferences. This can include rich men looking for marriage, rich women looking for rich men, rich singles looking for singles of any monetary income, and everything in between. An online dating site will make it easier to get in touch with elite singles, narrowing down the search with a few taps of your finger. Improve yourself mentally and physically If you really want to meet rich men looking for marriage, then you need to ensure that you are mentally, socially and physically able to meet their standards. You don’t have to be a 10/10 or have a graduate degree, but remember that rich men—as it is with rich women—will have certain standards or expectations for people they are willing to date. For instance, a tailored wardrobe will make up appear much more put-together, which will in turn increase your appeal to rich men. Cultivate shared interests with rich men Whether you’re using an elite singles dating site or you are hoping to meet a rich man in the park, you should strive to cultivate shared interests that many rich men enjoy. These interests will vary depending on where you live and what particular elite social circles you are interested in, but typical interests include cultural pursuits, the entertainment industry, fitness, and more. Once you have cultivated a shared interest, you can work on creating a bond with a rich man through that interest. This is especially helpful if the interest involves an activity, such as a yoga or fitness class or strolling inside a fine arts museum. Place yourself in the same spaces as rich men Perhaps you just haven’t been able to find the right rich man when using an online dating site—or perhaps you just want some extra help finding a rich man who isn’t limited to online matchmaking sites. Whatever the reason, there is nothing wrong with deciding to look for rich men to begin relationship with than where they live, work, and enjoy their recreational time. By placing yourself in the same spaces as rich men—walking your dog in the same neighborhood, visiting the restaurants and cafes that rich men visit, and so on—you will increase the chances that you will catch the eye or strike up a conversation with a rich single man who may just end up being your husband!"
4,How Can Single Athletes Select A Right Athlete Dating Site?   Are you hunting for a long-term relationship?,social-issues," Are you hunting for a long-term relationship? Online dating sites are a great solution for single athletes since their busy schedule seldom allows them for offline reach. At the same time, single athletes are not much aware of success rates of athlete dating sites. This is why they find it arduous and exhausting with number of questions in their mind such as - Do online athlete dating sites really work? Why Single Athletes Should Opt For Online Dating? Athlete dating sites are the best way to know people. All you need is internet connection, and love is at your fingertips when dating an athlete. The biggest benefit that online dating comes with is convenience. However, with more athlete dating sites or apps, it becomes intimidating to choose the right athlete dating sites. Apart from convenience, how can oneself be certain that process of online dating will help you find a professional athlete or elite partner. Probably, the person you want to hang out with might be committed. Let's face it. The key to find the right person lies in selecting the suitable athlete dating sites. Top Features to Look For In Athlete Dating Site ●Consider a reputable athlete dating site. Search their user base, verify their photo or profiles and read success stories of their members for dating an athlete. ●A right athlete dating site should have ability to find a perfect match for you. For instance, a compatibility checker can result in finding potential matches among thousands of profiles. This, in result, leads to a better user experience and makes the process easier. ●If you're seeking a person who resides in your area, then opt for a site that caters to locals only. Or, choose a site that offers a local search option. This is because athletes travel a lot during athletic seasons and localization makes searching way easier for those who are new to the area. ●As they say, everything comes at a price. Mostly, subscription based dating sites are not as effective in finding the love unless you pay the price. So, you will need to pay premium price to use site for your utmost benefit. ●Look for a mobile-friendly site that includes only authentic and verified profiles. ●Identify your ideal match. Think about what qualities you want in your partner. After all, it’s all about hanging around with someone who wants to take interests in same things as you, isn't it? What to Avoid While Dating An Athlete online ●Don't waste time on an athlete dating site that doesn't offer what you're looking for. ●Dating sites could be time consuming. So, it will be better to commit to a certain amount of time spent per day. ●Don't choose a site that cause invasion of privacy. ●Don't bounce around various platforms. Instead, stick to one at a time. Conclusion Dating an athlete comes with its own perks and limits. Sure, it's very crucial to choose the right athlete dating site. But, if the site's clientele goes well with your needs, and has members that are compatible with you, is just the start of your efforts. Don't treat every other dating site the same. Instead, do your research and find the best dating site for you."

7,"Four Horsemen of the Cultural Apocalypse – Criminology, Psychology, Sociology and Theology – Adventures in Pseudoscience",social-issues," Historic attempts, feeble and selfish at best, the four horsemen   of the cultural apocalypse long endeavored to establish their relevance for defining human nature. For the tip of psychic iceberg, the regression devolved from philosophical contemplation to pretentious claim of scientific validity. Behold, they came from the darkness of human intentions, to claim truths yet to be found in the shadowy mysteriousness of human intentions, motivations and eternal damnation. As to pundits, politicians, the public and the proselytes for each cause, or school of thought, or cult of confession, they fostered arrogance of speculation deemed ""scientific"". Of those not seriously qualifying as a science, as in astronomy, biology, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, by way of rigorous analytic contention, philosophical conjecture conspired to make its creations inventive nightmarish creatures. In the realms of academic, the path of least resistance, the trails the herd frequently travels and the walkways crowded with mass gullibility, sleight of hand mesmerized the many. As to the usual suspects, in the treachery of myth, magic and metaphor, the four collude their smug piety in egregious fallacies of inference. Of that, the wayward pretenses of magical thinking deludes the masses in simplistic thinking. Complicity is found in the ease by which degreed sanctification blusters in the hallowed sanctuaries of anecdotal regurgitation, flashbacks through history and bogus claims of research validity. Where the challenge comes in mathematical analytics, biologic physicality, subatomic microscopy, astronomical forensics, and proof of scientific validity, the horsemen excuse their shortcomings in appeals that hope springs eternal. Subjective validation supersedes facts. Their bafflegab trespasses upon many boundaries, as criminology, psychology, sociology and theology strike back with a vengeance. None dare disagree and breaks from the formation. In the adventures of pseudosciences, anything is possible, and yet, the mere mention of the word should not engage fear, animosity or condemnation. Nothing about the term should invite excommunication, exorcism or execution, but instead encourage the intensity of continuous investigation. No silver bullets, holy water or laying on of hands should amass a counteroffensive against those who might question the scientific authenticity of myriad conjectures. Healthy skepticism in the pursuit of intellectual vitality, by insistence upon investigative scrutiny, questioning and doubting specious generalizations, is creative and productive. Nonetheless, the mention of anything that might sound like, look like, or feel like a hint of something akin to ""pseudoscience"", the emotional reactivity transmutes a seemingly normal looking individual into a venomous demonic entity. The question arises as what constitutes normal, or better yet, what is a ""reasonable person"". Additionally, the query begs the timeline as to when it became acceptable to advance varying levels of stupidity or ignorance in terms of hunting down the truth and proving evidence to support any assertion. The negativity is nauseous. As to that historic point of reference, in article of major online science journal, the writer ponders at what point in U.S. history it became part of the social mainstream to accept fiction over facts. Further, as one of the founding fathers claimed well-reasoned thinking processes, supported by scientific validation, and persistent testing and systematic study to prove or disprove, are essential to the revelations of truth beyond doubt. The hint is in the writings of historic scientific investigators and those who contributed to the Declaration of Independence. While people have a right to their beliefs, at least to some degree in the West, knowledge advances wisdom which transforms civilization, not by mere conjecture based on opinion, but by intense study, rigorous testing and analysis, argument and dispute. Additionally, belief systems either transform over time, or remain static prone to stagnation. Regardless, continuous introspective assessment within each individual is essential. Further, ongoing discourse is vital, as each ought to understand the other given their perspective, time and place, maturity, experience, innovation, growth and discovery. As most are where they are at a point in time, based on at least the forgoing, but also their selfless attention to rigorous analysis of their ideations that channel into propositional viewpoints. Disagreement is indispensable, while peer review is a fraud, unless the laboratory, or the crime lab, the microscope proves the assertion at hand by the physical nature of scientific validation. Alternative philosophical fascinations often remain fixated on unsubstantiated illusions. Ideological claims are insufficient without the stringent testing of evidentiary authentication by the weight of physical realm provability. As to that, beliefs, especially those of an occultic, supernatural or cultic philosophical standpoint are immensely tainted by the bias of subjective validation. Key to the maturation of experienced real-world credibility includes the degree to which transformation has chosen a higher path of informed enlightenment. While everyone should labor to transcend their personal egoistic intentions, most will be unwilling to concede their self-interests. Unfortunately, arrogance contrives to make pseudoscience into a science. For non-practitioners in the various schools of philosophy, particularly those who transferred from the classroom to the faculty room, and never set foot in the real world, the challenge of credible scientific validation remains daunting. So much so, that ""field research"" often passes on as anecdotal observations, interviews, surveys and speculations regarding other research. In the regurgitation of previous opinionated speculations, sometimes, a facade of ""scientific"" is attached to the inquiry. Sooner or later, others begin to accept the ""scientific validation"". The gamesmanship becomes even more pervasive as that public begins to accept ideological perspectives as ""conclusive proof"" of an unsubstantiated claim. While some investigators have tried to foster a round table discussion on issues of ""real science"" versus ""pseudoscience"", as well as ""peer review"" versus critical analysis, the experience has been less than satisfactory. Particularly in the world of academia, where fantasy sometimes becomes a defensive theory, challenges to the pretentious allegory of fiction masquerading as fact, usually invites severe reaction. To claim or otherwise perpetrate the illusion of a science, a particular school of thought, or ideology, etc., does little to promote problem solving in everyday matters of human behavior. While various doctrinal and dogmatic traditions assert a scientific basis, the reality is such that a claim of using ""scientific methodology"" is a shallow appeal the practicality. By the convolutions of magical thinking, it is a leap of faith from theory to evidentiary validation.  And, in the 21st century, reflecting the words of one scientist, people may have forsaken the ability to distinguish between science and science fiction. Personal bias skews every point of view. For the inclination to subjective validation, bias enters every query. Control of that predisposition by way of some effort at objectivity is vital to any investigation. Accordingly, this suggests the influence of the investigators personal beliefs. Attempts have been made to identify preconceived notions and their influence in relation to ideological partiality. Depending on the survey and the organization conducting the survey, results may vary to some degree. In this regard, one study of religious inclination by a major research agency, as pertains to a ""belief in God"", suggested little of 80% of the participants believed in a ""higher authority"". That is to say, the majority claimed a belief in a divine being or supernatural entity that influences their lives. On an education basis, those with graduate degrees were reported to have a believability range of about 70%. Of course, the temptation here is to speculate on the influence of belief systems and the claim of ""scientific methodology"" among the pseudosciences. Where two thirds of educated persons believe in the supernatural, how does that impact objectivity? The illusionary intricacy assumes many parts of the whole. Taking belief systems from ""cultic"", or dogmatic sources, the comingling of presumptive errors compound the mythic proportions by which fallacies of inference transition to accepted hastily drawn conclusion. In collusion with multiple facetious claims, unsubstantiated by the organic rigors of physical evidence, whether microscopic or cosmic, viewpoints, opinions and gossipy flirtations mutate into grotesque forms of imaginative superstitions. In most controversies of argumentation and debate, as regards human behavior from a mental analysis, interactivity of interpersonal exchange should be cautiously anticipated. One or more participants may not have achieved sufficient maturation. To confront or otherwise interact in more profanely productive ways, a certain degree individualization is necessary. Bias, prejudice, immaturity, inexperience, lack of close contact with reality, and so on, stifle energetic intensity for enlightened liberation. As suggested in the forgoing, dogmatic and doctrinaire beliefs constrict visionary processes. This suggests probable generational rift, as younger generations may not have arrived at levels of competency strengthened by years of experience, education and personal transformation. Mature, adult, grownup and wiser insightfulness requires extraordinary investment of well-differentiated selflessness. An example of the youthful indifference to adventurous discovery outside the monogamous constrictions of institutional conformity, comes in the form of limited and defensive perspectives. One aspect is easily attacking alternative points of views, such as the ease by which schools of thought in psychology quickly condescend the medical specialty of psychiatry. That is fascinating intrigue of extraordinary bias, especially considering the roots of psychology. Opinions are not evidence of extraordinary discovery for the complete explanation of human nature. But of course, in main stream American society, any conjecture can be accepted without question as scientific efficacy. Of which, the frauds perpetrate the worst afflictions over a weakened society. In a dumbed down culture, self-imposed of course, anything is believable. Plus, bias reflects the academic arrogance of fearful, self-absorbed, child-like infantile narcissism. In this, as for example within the collegiate communities, academia perpetrates the fantasy as fact, absent materiality of scientific proof. And yet, the hypocrisy runs rampant. On the offensive, in a celebrity worship culture, any actor of famous characterization can pontificate on any social issues and be accepted as authorities. While free speech is one thing, and an opinion is good anyone else’s, expertise is quite an exception. Opinions, gossip and rumors are not evidence. To use one’s wealth, status and influence is not equitable. Where bias clouds conjecture and otherwise influences conclusions, observational misinterpretation hazes over the reliability of personal perspective. All utterances should be suspected of cognitive bias, as eye witness testimony is subjected to cross-examination. Yet, frequently, to leverage one’s apparent status of supposedly famous stature and notoriety, to espouse an opinion as though fact or scientific validation, is to use the force and effect of egoistic intimidation. It is insulting and abusive to presuppose one’s socio-economic political status is more relevant than some else. Power and privilege do not infer intelligence. Such arrogant notions, as for example a Hollywood actor, blabbering about guns and school violence are essentially private opinions. Often such blathering are superficial for fame and personal promotion, and avoid any semblance of scientific or evidentiary authentication. Unsubstantiated speculations do more harm than good and serve to mislead others. In the use of wealth, pretense of authority, and presumed reputation, many frauds are perpetrated. Given the nature of egregious fallacies of inference, public policy can be adversely affects, as politicians tend to be easy targets of pseudoscience. Such exhibitions of notoriety use the unfair advantage of material success to promote a particular economic or political agenda. Often the result is further erosion of any aspect of intellectual discourse to serve the greater good, or protect the general welfare of the republic. Too frequently, stupidity advances instead of wisdom. When the four horsemen enter the scene of societal interactivity, pseudoscience quickly becomes the imposter impersonating the reality of scientific validity. Fiction replaces fact. A very quick admonition is to exercise a sense of healthy skepticism by common sense application of cynical analysis. People say and do what people say do because it’s what they desire to do. Claims, assertions and studies of any kind are to be carefully investigated by testing the data, insisting upon replication and ensuring scientific efficacy. At one of the inquiry is the immediate understanding that correlation cannot be confused with causation. Regardless, the intentional collusion is committed every day in the not so hallowed halls of academia. In the non-science realm of philosophical speculation, anything is possible. Pseudoscience can easily concoct an explanation and assert a correlation as a causation. While comparing an apple and orange side by side, one can infer the relationship as examples of fruit. In terms of a distinctive differentiation, a dissimilar nature emerges. Nonetheless, many can easily conjure along a simplistic continuum claim a specificity of correlation to causation generalities. No matter what the facts may show, some will insist every apple is actually an orange. Since the comparison of the fruit was conducted over a bushel or a basket or two, the observational bias, and the resulting survey assessment, extrapolate a very broad generalization. Given the fruit’s family tree, seasonal abnormalities, and agricultural inequities, it is easy to infer that all apples and oranges are exactly the same. In other words, one template fits all. After labeling one or more as ""bad apples"", or ""rotten oranges"", the diagnosis, or cultivation, transitions to a ""cure"", which typically means a drug therapy, or pesticide to kill off the psychic contagion. In the end, a question lingers in the haze of magical thinking, regardless of protestations and threats of retaliation for political correctness violations, and that is what does the scientific evidence show? Followed up by, what does the blood test, x-ray, ultra sound or other lab test reveal? Offenses are easily taken when serious speculation challenges viewpoints. However, when consensus, or by majority vote, a theoretical construct becomes a ""diagnosis"", skepticism ought to fill the void in the empty spaces around the special conjecture. The insightful inquisitor chases every element of claims said to be true to the exclusion of every other possibility. Unfortunately, in a devolving society, facts are easily circumvented for the satiation of the most convenient and simplistic explanation. Of which, conjecture is not really an explanation at all. Speculation as to the superficiality of an alleged ""mental illness"" issue is an opinion based on a theory. It is centuries old dogma exorcizing demons, or fortune telling masquerading as ""criminal profiling"", or pseudoscience pretending to be science. Doctrines of the supernatural are schemes of myth, magic and metaphysical suppositions, for which something called faith accepts undefinable phenomena. Faithfulness to an ideology does not insist upon the rigors of scientific validation. Meanwhile, in the hypocrisy of belief, if 80% of the population, including adherents of certain schools of ""social studies"", believe in things supernatural, bias of speculation has been influenced before the fact. So, bias influences conclusions about one thing or another, while observations of the biased inquirer has preconceived notions as to subsequent observations. In conjunction, designing a form of investigation, or model to be tested, in conjunction with predisposition aforethought, influences the outcome determined in the results. To this primordial mix, throw in ""scientific sounding"" jargon and anecdotal references similarly supportive, and a whole scheme of conjecture becomes believable. Now add a spiritual dimension, or occult symbolism, or doctrinaire admonition, and eventually the unsubstantiated claims will be accepted. By politicians, pundits and the public. Willful acceptance follows the easy path of simplistic acquiescence. Easy trouble free receptivity does not provide the motivational basis of in-depth inquiry. To say that ""it turns out that"", ""it has been reported that"", or ""it is assumed that"", and so on, does not substantiate anything. In fact, to the contrary, immediate challenge should be issued. Any and all claims are to be vigorously tested, debated and questioned. Alleged data ought to receive critical analysis, while opinion, rumor and gossip are never to be accepted without thorough investigation. Likewise, jargon, labeling, and so-called diagnoses from a philosophical viewpoint are to be questioned without hesitance. Included in this inquisition is any pretentiousness relative to anecdotal claims of supposed credibility. Similarly, faith proves nothing. Motive, means and opportunity is an illusion. This typical ""crime solving"" rubric sounds nice in a movie or television drama. The public finds this sort of simplicity easy to digest. However, it is misleading. At best, a starting point. Nonetheless, such a perspective can be misleading and counterproductive. In a classical criminological spectrum, such admonitions by an inquirer are meaningless unless evidentiary substantiation suffices the authenticity of scientific validation. Every critical analysis invites the provocation as to whether or not an issue can be elevated to a scientific sufficiency by matters of reliable proof of technical authentication. Absent serious evidentiary verification, credible legitimacy and substantive multifaceted verification, supposition based on opinion remains insufficient. As research comes in many forms, and data often manipulated to ensure subjective validation, intense scrutiny of any claim is essential. Otherwise, conjecture, assumption, inference, and so forth, are speculative points of interests that demand deeper investigation. To the reference of motive, means and opportunity, yes, fiction writers are fond of any phrase redundantly torturing one cliché after another. Outside the hardcore sciences of forensic analysis, the ""soft sciences"", ""social studies, or more adversely the pseudosciences, perpetuate grievous fallacies of inference that render an assortment of hasty generalizations. Especially in detective fiction, movies, television, etc., the repetitive nature of fallacies of inference unfortunately carry over into the real world. Unfortunately, people will believe anything. Faulty conclusions, lazily drawn through the zeal of immediate gratification for a definitive ""singular theory"", erroneously pontificated upon cognitive bias, results in unsubstantiated conjecture. This sets the stage of divisive social policy and hastens the eventual demise of the human species. That point relates to the regressive inclinations of human devolution. In a world losing the imaginative edge of innovation, the decay of analytic insight, and the loss of rational methodology, self-serving infantilism invites a dystopic set of consequences. Observing post-election vehemence in the grotesque rhetoric of condescension is but one example of a regressively adversarial trend in the American society. An entitled sense of retaliation for perceived claim of ""victimization"", irrationally justifies a ""get even"" mentality. Selfishness, the grand scheme of personal enrichment, easily allows the seduction to any mythic or supernatural means to exert power, control and domination over others. From the standpoint of personal belief systems, influenced by ideological extremes of one form or another, the baseless claims of over-simplification justifies egregious fallacies of inference clinging to hasty generalizations. Lacking the backbone, expressing cowardice in avoiding courageous actions toward wiser ascension, and degrading the freedom of individuality, the social mainstream exhibits an illicit collective consensus that conspires to stifle mature growth. In the process of perpetual putdowns toward another’s perspective because they disagree, expresses the erosion of the free exercise of competitive ideations. Maturation to higher states of mental and physical individuality demands fortitude beyond the normal routine of daily interactivity. In addition, such evolving transformation bears the signpost of pointing in the direction of an attendant possibility toward a more probable outcome of higher self-realization. Across the superficiality of social media and ""opinionated"" news reporting, the shallowness of bloated ""mindless"" conceit wallows in the shortsighted inebriation of degrading arrogance. As such, anti-thinking pervades the array of communal connections with a range of nonsensical notions for the sake of emotional reactivity. In support of the status quo consensus of myriad small-minded illusions, meaningful levels of rational understanding stifle the elevation of society. As alleged in one major publication, representing one of the four horsemen (criminology, psychology, sociology and theology), an author for the ""psyche"" realm accuses religion as being representative of faulty reasoning that leads to magical thinking. In so doing, the claimant suggests gross errors of ""cognitive bias"" in the spheres of religiosity and the paranormal. The argument proposed is that such things are the result of wishful thinking not scientific validation. Such is a fascinating notion emanating from field closely allied to the psychological aspects within the arena of ""social studies"". But wait, one could offer by contrast that the ""four horsemen"" are very closely related in that real science is not a strong element in their entrenched domains. All such accusations, claims and ideological perspectives devolve to speculations based on philosophical biases. Hope springs eternal in the non-reality of subjective validation and ensuring consistent patterns of simplistic conjecture. As such, the status quo remains secure."

15,Love Horoscope 2020,social-issues," Love Horoscope 2020 How will the stars be positioned in this new year and what will be their influences on love, family, friends and affections in general? Here is a summary of what the future holds for each astral sign. ARIES The presence of Saturn in your sign will show you who you need by your side. If you have not yet found your soul mate, this year, with the presence of Saturn you can go to him or her. You may have to take on new responsibilities in your love life and understand your friends better. You have just lived through a couple of rather difficult years, but for Aryans, 2020 will be a year of positive achievements. Due to new experiences, you will change the way you understand the world or rethink some of your most fundamental opinions. Don't shut up about these new ideas, they will enrich you. 2020 is a year of learning in which you will have your intuition to learn, achieve and create the reality you want for yourself and those around you. The presence of Neptune in your sign for much of the year, will allow you to be more tolerant with your partner and friends. TAURUS Jupiter's presence makes it possible for you to fall in love with your partner again, if you are in a stable relationship, or with someone who can be very important in your life, if you are single. Your social life will be interesting and fun, you will enjoy with your friends throughout 2020. You will meet interesting people and feel attracted to new social circles, something uncommon in bullfighting. Your family may demand more of you this year. Try to be patient and help the older and younger members of your family environment. This year presents an opportunity to be compassionate to yourself and others. GEMINIS Pluto, the planet of change, birth and death, has long been present in your opposite sign: Sagittarius. Many Gemini have experienced the death of someone close, the failure of a friendship, a separation or divorce. This year you will be able to withstand the difficulties that arise if you think with your head and act with calm and intelligence. Beware of manipulative people. You will want to make new friends and look for fun through them. This year you will be a more reliable person and your friends will perceive this, which will result positive in your friendship and relationship. The last few years have been somewhat difficult for Geminians, but in 2020, the overall result will be positive. CANCER By 2020 cancers will value intimacy and home. Socially you will go out less and, unlike in recent times, you will feel more and more like staying at home, on the couch, watching a movie or having dinner with your partner instead of going out at night. You will seek intimacy with your partner. Thanks to Jupiter's presence throughout most of the year, you will have good luck in love and happiness. Those who have been with the same partner for years will remember the reasons that made them fall in love. You will take more care of yourself, you will have more confidence in your appearance and this will have a positive effect on your sexual life. You will feel fulfilled in your personal life. Jupiter's transit through Scorpio will bring you fun, romance, fulfillment and creativity. LEO Leoninos have experienced many changes in their relationship over the past few years. But through all this instability, you have remained true to your heart and your principles. In this 2020, under the direction of Saturn, a planet that brings stability and discipline, if you don't have a partner, you may find a new love or return to an old stable relationship. It is possible that some friends turn out not to be as reliable as you thought, or that you are simply bored with their company and seek new friendships. There will be times when you will feel confused or bored and seek change in some facet of your life. However, with the presence of Jupiter in Scorpio and Sagittarius, you will have a sense of optimism and energy that will help you experiment with new situations and take risks that will benefit you in the medium and long term. VIRGO For virgins this year is an unpredictable year in love. You may discover that the person you thought you knew so well is a stranger and the plans you had for the future with him or her will not come out as you expected. It is possible that friends who have always deserved your trust will fail you this year. Or simply get bored with your old friends and decide to look for new incentives in other social circles. The influence of Pluto on your sign will create some complicated situations in which there will be disagreements, power struggles and unexpected endings. You will seek new experiences and try to break the monotony both in your personal life and in your professional life. You will have a special energy in May, when Uranus combines with Mars and Jupiter. In spite of being afraid of a radical change in your life, it is possible that you will make some profound decisions that can have a very positive impact. You will have more energy and optimism, which favors making bold decisions for you, but also positive ones in the medium term. Libra For the Libra people this can be a year of trial in their affective relations, especially in March when a solar eclipse can help you to fix things or even end a relationship. On the other hand, once the first months of the year are over, if you have a stable relationship, you will be able to reach new levels of communication with your partner to such an extent that they will produce a feeling of being more united than ever, both in you and in your partner. The best time for love will be between March and April, also between September and October. Your social life will be active and, for some pound, even exciting. You will feel inspired and the presence of Jupiter, a planet of opportunity and abundance in November, will help you end the year with the same level of enthusiasm and optimism as the previous year. SCOPIO The Love horoscope for Scorpio 2020 tells us that the presence of Uranus promises a lot of romance and some surprises in your social life this year. Married scorpions will not notice great changes in their marriage, for better or for worse. If you have a desire to have a child or spend more time with children, you could get a very pleasant surprise this year. Because of the importance of work in your life, your family or partner may resent your commitment a little. If this happens, it won't be serious, but you should nevertheless make an effort to explain your reasons and also spend more time with your relatives or involve them directly in your projects. Your enthusiasm, creativity and effort will be transmitted to those around you. SAGITTARIUS 2020 is a year without surprises for the sagitarians in the field of personal relations. Pluto, the planet of birth, death and change, follow its path through your sign and for this reason it is possible that some people in your life try to manipulate you or, on the contrary, that you begin to be too demanding with others. The last few years have been somewhat unstable for many sagitarians due to the prolonged presence of Pluto. It is possible that you have suffered a breakup with your partner, lost your job or an important client, or that someone important to you has died during this time. Thanks to Neptune's transit through Aquarius, you will feel a special energy that will inspire you to be more creative or more spiritual. This is a good time to evaluate your life and try to balance your utopia with reality, identify your goals, and design strategies to achieve them. At the end of the year enters Jupiter in your sign, which is tremendously positive for 2021. CAPRICORN This year you will try to get away from people whose obsession is to earn money and acquire possessions. You will prefer friends who, like you, have already gained some acceptable purchasing power and are looking for things out of life rather than getting rich. You will be more open to making new friends, you will meet very interesting people and you will learn from their experiences. Whether you have a steady partner or not, you will enjoy love with passion. You will make new friends, thanks to the presence of Uranus, a planet that symbolizes the break with tradition and the development of new projects. The influence of Pluto will help you to examine yourself and know your spiritual side and will allow you to analyze some topics in depth that you usually try to avoid. AQUARIUS The year 2020 will be a year of challenges for Aquarius in their affective life. With Saturn active in love and marriage all year round, you will end 2020 much safer in your relationship and if you manage to keep the channels of communication open with your partner, the relationship will be strengthened. If you don't strive to talk and understand your partner's concerns, however, you may have problems. The best month for love will be August. It's an excellent year to take care of your friendships with attention to detail. Use your talents and vision to pursue your most ambitious goals, because this year you will be able to achieve them. With Neptune in the same sign as your sun, you will dream a lot this year and your dreams could contain messages sent from your subconscious that will be very useful in daily life. PISCES If you do not have a partner, the year 2020 is not a particularly suitable year to find the love of your life, because you will give greater priority to your personal freedom, spirituality, travel and health. You will feel less tied to your family and friends and more attracted to adventure, fun and new sensations. You will be so full of energy, optimism and desire, that sometimes you will have the feeling of power with everything. Your friends or partner, if you have one, may try to stop you, but it will be difficult. 2020 is a year of great change for Piscianos. You'll want to take more risks. You will feel more daring and open to new experiences and possibilities."
16,How to attract and keep the woman of your dreams,social-issues," Guys, a lot of you out there don’t know how to attract the right single woman into your life. Single women are very picky and they will tear you apart if you don’t meet their checklist. I know this sounds a little harsh, buts its true and the quicker you get it, the closer you will be to finding the right girl to share your life with.  Some guys can attract the right women, but they don’t know how to keep them from running away. Follow these tips to help you attract and keep the right single woman in your life: First impressions are so important.  Women like men who are clean, have nice white clean teeth, smell good (get advice on scents) and dress nice.  Nice shoes are a must as women will often judge men by their shoes. I’m not kidding! Play on the women’s senses.  Look into her eyes when you’re talking to her, give her subtle touches, yes I said SUBTLE, NO GROPING.  Compliment her and make her feel beautiful. Women like men that are funny.  If you’re naturally funny, let yourself go.  If you’re not funny, don’t try to be, as you may come across as awkward. Be confident but not cocky, there’s a big difference.  Women don’t want to particularly listen to how great you are all the time.  Actions speak louder than words so show her how great you are by the way you treat her. Be a gentleman, chivalry is NOT DEAD!! Women are looking for a man to be the man.  Pay for that 1st and 2nd date; open the car door, etc... Make a woman feel safe; feeling secure and safe is definitely a BIG TURN ON for women. Control your sexual hunger.  Women want to know that you’re interested in more than just sex.  Refrain from any sexual advancement for the first 2-3 dates unless she’s the initiator and just roaring to go. Make a woman feel that she is special and the center of your universe.  I know it can be difficult at times but what can I say, this is how woman are wired.  They like attention, lots of it! Never show up to a woman’s house in the beginning stages without a little something; it doesn’t have to be anything expensive. Some things you can bring are flowers (even 1 rose will do), a bottle of wine, chocolates, or even a plant.  It’s the thought that counts and believe me it goes a long way. Women like men that are busy.  Don’t always be available but do send a little message once in a while to say hello and let them know that you’re thinking of them. Be yourself, honesty goes a long way.  If you show signs of dishonesty in the beginning, you will break the trust factor and the relationship may never progress in a healthy manner. Ask her about her interests and hobbies and pay attention to detail. Surprise her once in a while with an overnight somewhere or a day trip.  Women are usually the planners but appreciate it when a guy makes the effort to be the initiator.  Make things FUN, be spontaneous!!! Don’t show signs of possessiveness.  There should be trust in a relationship, otherwise don’t be in that relationship.  There are enough other daily stresses people need to deal with and that one shouldn’t be necessary. These are some tips to make you more attractive to the single women out there.  Remember, women aren’t necessarily always looking for the most gorgeous man but for the man that knows how to treat her without being too needy and possessive.  Guys, I suggest you take my advice; it may just improve your love life!"

1,Dating In Your Current Relationship?,social-issues," The longer we are with our partner and the more time goes on, there is a tendency for complacency, laziness, neglect, taking-for-grantedness, and boredom in the relationship. These are common to relationships after the honeymoon period, the infatuation stage of relationships, is over. They are actually a part of the power struggle stage of relationships, where couples can’t seem to see eye-to-eye and get stuck in repeating unresolved conflicts due to their reciprocal triggering of old wounds. When couples have a hard time resolving issues and don’t have their needs met, they get more and more disconnected perpetuating this cycle further. This can become detrimental if not addressed. One easy way to tackle this is to treat your partner as if you were still dating.This does not imply to have a fluffy relationship without the commitment and level of intimacy that is present in a more mature relationship. I’m only referring to getting back and maintaining the specialness of being together. I’m talking about bringing back politeness and respect, planning, caring, mothering and chivalry, romance, caressing, seduction, teasing, playfulness, interest, intrigue, adventure, mysteriousness, surprises, and whatever else your heart desires. Maintaining these wonderful and tickling qualities in a long-term relationship while it is still in the power struggle phase is very difficult. Couples in this stage are usually combative, self-centered, empty, exhausted, and a lot of times hopeless and resigned. This is all normal stuff but it doesn’t have to stay this way! Making the effort to have the pleasures of the dating qualities back into the relationship is worth it as it can actually make going through this phase a lot easier. Having these connecting qualities back help couples stay out of the red assisting them do the work that the power struggle stage requires (seeing the reciprocity of behavior and wounding, and stopping the cycle by giving each other different outcomes than the usual, meeting each others needs). Not running on empty allows couples assess to their emotional, mental, physical and spiritual resources and inner strength needed to address their situation. Give this a try. Do a mind shift and imagine your partner as a possible suitor. What would you do to impress, intrigue, and allure them? How would you treat them differently? How would you behave differently? What areas of yourself would you work on improving? I know this is difficult stuff as the relationship has picked up a life of its own by now, and add the daily responsibilities and family life to the mix, and you have a complex and tenuous context. But I’m not asking you to go back to dating and throw your current life away or make believe is not there. I’m just asking you to do a minor mind shift and approach yourself and your partner in a kinder more special way. That’s all. Happy Dating!!! ~ Your MetroRelationship™ Assignment Pick two aspects of yourself that you want to change to make you a more interesting, fun, and enticing suitor: (i.e., getting fit, changing your look, being more positive, getting a hobby or other outside interest, uplifting your attitude, addressing personal unresolved issues, closing exits and being more available, etc.) ~ Share Your Thoughts & Successes in the comment box at the end!

2,How To Get To The Best From Your Partner,social-issues," It never ceases to amaze me what couples can accomplish and how they are able to turn their relationship around when they set their mind to it! I have literally seen miracles happen… I have seen couples come back from real horrible places. It is a formidable phenomenon to witness. I have, unfortunately, also seen partners give up on their relationship without fully investing in creating changes. They get too hang up on what their partner is doing or not doing and how they are being or not being. This is a train wreck in the making… Very unfortunate indeed If you find that you are struggling in your relationship, a little or a lot, I beg you to stop looking at your partner for answers or changes. This is only ingraining and maintaining your status quo. You can’t do anything about what your partner is doing or how they are… You were actually attracted to how your partner is… Granted, how they show up nowadays might be different, but this is only a protection on their part… Their True Self, the person you fell in love with, is still there! I want you to remember this and engage your partner as if you can see their True Self… Ignore their nonsense and engage their True Self, Core Self, Authentic Self, Pure Self, Soul… When you engage Soul to Soul, miracles happen… Your approach needs to be: to Be as you want to Be. Be the partner you want to be. Treat your Partner as if you are in love… Treat your Partner as if they are your dream come true… Treat your Partner as if they are the best thing in your life… Treat your Partner as if they deserve to be treated with the utmost love and care… Does this feel like too much? Exactly… Treat your Partner as an equal human being… (Ouch!) We don’t generally invest in having an Awesome Relationship… Isn’t this crazy? We invest with all our might in other things, but not in our relationship and then we wonder how come it suffers. Then we wonder how come we are not treated well. Then we wonder how come it fails. We get what we put in! I’ve been pushing my clients in this regard with CRAZY AMAZING results! I know it can be done. I know you can do it too. The trick is to focus on ourselves, not on what we don’t get and how we are wronged, but on what WE put in and what WE contribute. When we focus on our stretches, how we communicate, on soothing ourselves when triggered, mindfully and respectfully going about getting our needs met, understanding our partner and having compassion for their experience, sprinkling our interactions with loving and caring gestures, setting things up for cooperation, etc. the tending pays off. Sometimes this approach is challenging to embrace. I know this too… This is difficult because we are insecure, our Ego gets the best of us, we are holding on to resentments (the past), we might be projecting (putting things on our partner that’s not theirs…) or owning our partner (we know best how they should be and what they should do…), or we are not being accountable for our own Self – we are not being honorable and virtuous… These get in the way. This is sucky. We do not want to go through life and our relationship like this. This is a sure way to being unhappy… Instead, we want to invest with all our might, to really go for it. Now, I’m not talking about smothering or stalking your partner, being disingenuous, etc. I’m talking about really contributing the way your partner and relationship call for… As I’ve written before, partners share that ""they’ve tried it all"" and that ""they do everything for the relationship"" – but is what they have tried what is needed the way it is needed? Usually it is not… Herein is the secret: tailored and targeted investing – not till you drop dead and at your expense investing, but just the right investment that meets both your needs… I’ve seen it done. I know you can do it as well! So, figure out what is the right investment and go for it. It has to touch the right places, at the right times, in the right way while meeting both your needs. This might seem tricky but it is TOTALLY doable. Just put on your open minded lens and you’ll see… Invest the best, get the best… Complete the MetroRelationship™ Assignment below to help you effortlessly implement this, make changes and immediately start experiencing your awesome relationship, and Authentic Life… Happy Investing! ~Your MetroRelationship™ Assignment Stop thinking about how your Partner stinks – stop thinking about how they could look better, do better, be better… Stop owning them! Start thinking about how You can invest better!! Focus on what You contribute and what You can do better… Add this to your Tool Kit…"
3,The Time Of Your Life ...,social-issues," As I’ve written before, one of the reasons some couples’ relationships deteriorate over time is because the partners get lured by life away from their partner… Partners work hard at their jobs and become involved in their careers, children absorb much of their attention and a multitude of life maintenance tasks drain their energy. Compound this with ""poor relationship skill"" and the fact that most relationships get stuck in the ""power struggle"" stage of relationships, and we have a formula for disaster! I hear quite frequently how couples ""don’t have time"" to spend together, be with each other, enjoy each other’s company, have time to have chats, catch up and process, and plainly do fun things together. This is a very common experience. I think that a lot of us in general feel we ""don’t have enough time"". Therefore, I’ve become a student of ""time"". I have been significantly more aware and attuned to time, how I use it, structure it, experience it, and of course even misuse it. In this quest I""ve also done some reading on the topic. A book I found very interesting is called: ""Unwinding the Clock: Ten Thoughts on Our Relationship to Time"". I would like to share with you a concept I became alerted to, that of divided and undivided time. Remember when we you were a kid and summers appeared endless? The reason for that was that time was undivided. The summer was a long string of connected days. Now as adults, we chunk up time into small units into which we fit frenzy activity. We have lost the idea of unstructured, unscheduled, unobstructed time where being, creating, and connecting with nature, others and life were the primary goals. I would like to bring this back into our lives. Granted we can not generally have a string of days of unscheduled and unstructured time, we even slice up and over schedule time when we are on vacation!, as we would not fit in the structure of our society, but we can bring it into our lives as much as possible. What I’m suggesting is ""chunking"" time into as large amounts of time as possible. This alters your experience of time. Assign projects and theme tasks to larger chunks of time as opposed to constantly or frequently moving from activity to activity and experiencing time fly by. When you can get lost in a larger frame and settle into yourself, you’ll feel less rushed, more available and in touch, creative, energetic, and alive! I have experienced this myself and try to recreate it on a daily basis as much as possible. Note, that the nature of my work, seeing clients on a 45 minute schedule, is counter indicative to this goal. Moving from client to client all day long makes time go by extremely fast. So, I apply this ""chunking"" concept to my other work days so I have larger portions of time – in essence more time! In that created time I can be more creative and productive and not experience ""lose of time"". Imagine instead that I had clients all over the map, and left the in-between time to get things done. I would never have enough time to get anything of any worth accomplished aside from insignificant tasks and putting out fires. You see there is not enough time in in-between time for us to get settled, be and tap into ourselves to imagine, create, and produce. This is how we waste our lives. A related concept I want to visit is that of undisturbed time. Keeping interruptions and distractions to a minimum or nonexistent in our moments, makes our moments feel longer. Did you ever notice that waiting on line at the market or doctor’s office feels interminable unless you are on your cell phone or reading and therefore distracted from your moment? Having time is a frame of mind. We all have 24 hours in the day. We all have lots we do, and even more we want to do. Yet, some people get a lot more done than others, feel more satisfied and don’t walk around feeling frazzled, rushed, stressed and like life is passing them by. The secret lies in not being distracted from your moments. You will have all the time in the world when you live your time. I’m inviting you to create bigger chunks of time and undisturbed moments in your routine, lifestyle, and interactions. This will bring a more present, aware, open, energetic, and alive you to your projects and moments. Imagine what an enhanced and available you can come in contact with your partner and in a much more conducive context: The universe is the limit!! Gain your time back and your partner. Stop passing each other by like ships in the night! Happy Timing!!! ~ Your MetroRelationship™ Assignment Ask your partner to pull his calendar out and together create chunks of couple time to be left undisturbed and open to be utilized as you fancy at the moment. No work, tasks or serious discussions allowed! Start early thinking of ways to ""be"" with your partner in preparation for when the moment arrives."
4,"Energy, Passion & Sex",social-issues," Couples frequently come to my practice expressing that they have lost something or that something is missing in their relationship. They complain there is no passion. They share that they are good friends, but want something more in their relationship. A lot of these couples have a sexless relationship (having sexual intimacy less than one time per week) and want to express and feel their love in all realms including the physical. Passion has to do in part with the energy of the partners and the relationship. If one or both partners are tapped out, and if the relationship is depleted, not for nothing the partners find it difficult to feel passion and maintain a satisfying sexual relationship. Energy is required to have sex! It behooves these partners to mind their own energy level and quality and nourish the relationship’s. The relationship’s energy is made up of what the partners put into the relationship, in the space between them: time, effort, care, nurturing, kindness, respect, etc. Each partner’s own energy is very personal and they each need to determine what enhances and depletes it.  It is up to each partner to protect, tend, create and manage their own energy. Energy can be generated and enhanced through tailored efforts to meet our specific needs in the areas of sleep and rest, nutrition, hydration, exercise, routine and life style, emotional and spiritual care, support system, and stimulation and fun. Even small amounts of stress, toxicity, negativity, and drama and indulgence on substances such as drugs, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, and tobacco can have a detrimental effect on the quality and level of our energy and need to be eliminated from our lives. Couples complaining that something is lost or missing, and about the lack of passion and intimacy, is an indication of depleted personal and relationship energy.  The stuff in between us gets lost or damaged as time passes if not safeguarded. The courting, being on our best behavior, having our game face on, putting our best foot forward, and the intensity to be with one another diminish overtime. As the relationship and our lives become more complex, we become overextended and care less for ourselves becoming exhausted if we are not careful. Energies becoming depleted create an empty situation and a passionless relationship (and life!). When both partners are consistently and appropriately taking care of themselves and putting in quality stuff into their relationship, energy abounds and sparks fly! Partners can reignite or find their passion! Happy energizing!! ~ Your MetroRelationship™ Assignment Generate more personal energy!  Work on one item from each list at a time. Increase the quantity and/or quality of:  Sleep and rest Nutrition Hydration Exercise Routine and life style Emotional and spiritual care Support system Stimulation and fun Eradicate from your life: Stress Toxicity, negativity, and drama Indulgence on substances such as drugs, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, and tobacco"
5,How Can Rich Single Men Attract Single Female Celebrities?,social-issues," Determining how to attract a woman is a question that is often asked by men around the world. When it comes to how to attract a specific type of woman, it gets asked even more.  Who do you ask when you have this question? You turn to our blog. Our blog has specialized in answering questions such as this. Today we are going to answer the question of how rich single men can attract single female celebrities. Single celebrities are a unique type of people that can be fun. Without further ado, let’s look at the celebrity dating tips we have for rich single men. Learn That Celebrity Dating Is Normal Dating The first thing that you must learn is while single celebrities are famous, they are people too.  Find the right balance between treating them like a celebrity and a normal person is essential. If you don’t find that balance, you will push them away. For the most part, try to apply regular dating experiences you have had throughout your life. Go To The Right Places Most single female celebrities don’t just go anywhere. They spend their time at places that they won’t get judged. Often times you can also find them at places that are popular amongst other celebrities. Find out where single celebrities go in your area and start going there. Sometimes a new face might not be what you are looking for. You should go to the place multiple times and don’t let one let down get you down. Establish yourself as a regular and the single female celebrities will start to see you as a normal part. You are a rich single man after all. Confidence Is Key Even rich single men can get flustered or nervous. It takes a lot to be confident but confidence is key when you are trying to participate in celebrity dating. Celebrities like a man who has confidence in himself. They don’t want to waste time with those who can’t give them what they want. You don’t have to actually be confident, you can fake confidence. Put on an air that you believe in yourself and that you can achieve what you are out there for. As you continue on faking confidence it will become real. It also builds up as you learn that you can find a celebrity date. There is an important difference between cockiness and confidence. You need to make sure that you don’t overstep into cockiness. With most single female celebrities, cockiness will get you shut down. Spend Time Getting Ready Preparing for a date is typically something that men don’t do. They throw on stuff and go out to find a date. If you really want to attract single celebrities you need to do more than that. Rich single men getting ready for celebrity dating should spend their time getting ready. Shower, shave, and iron your clothes. Everything about you should scream that you are a good catch. It also shows that you are truly interested in finding someone. Show that you are willing to put in the work and it will show you care. It Never Hurts To Do Some Research When trying to engage in celebrity dating, it never hurts to know who you are looking at. When you see single female celebrities take a moment to Google them. You aren’t looking to browse through hot photos. You also aren’t looking to be creepy. Avoid using facts that are gossip or rumor or it will come off that way. What you are looking for is something to break the ice. Most celebrities have profiles all around the internet. On these profiles you can find facts about what they like and what they do. Use these to build up conversation starters. Dating single female celebrities isn’t a complicated process. You just have to take steps to make yourself attractive to them. The more that you do the more you will get back, just as long as you aren’t trying too hard. The most important thing is to make sure that you have fun. If you don’t have fun there is no point."
6,"The Sinner’s Need Of Christ – Steps To Christ, Chapter 1",social-issues," Welcome to Chapter 1: The Sinner’s Need of Christ In Short: Why does sinner need help? Why only Christ could provide that remedy? Mankind was originally: endowed with noble abilities with a well-balanced mind perfect in their being in harmony with God with pure thoughts and holy aims. Humanity was made captive by Satan After they sinned, our first parents could no longer find joy in holiness. Furthermore, they sought to hide from the presence of God. Such is still the condition of the unrenewed heart. We are not in harmony with God, and find no joy in communion with Him. The sinners could not be happy in God’s presence. They would shrink from the companionship of holy beings. There thoughts, interests and motives, would be alien to those that actuate the sinless dwellers there. Heaven would be to them a place of torture. It is no arbitrary dictate on the part of God that excludes the wicked from heaven. They are shut out by their own unfitness for its companionship. The glory of God would be to them a consuming fire. They would welcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them. Moreover, human race would have remained so forever had not God specially interposed. Satan would point to all this evil he caused such as: state of misery and degradation darkness, accusations, deceptions and lies alienation and damnation lack of satisfaction and crashed by the weight of gilt no future but death as the result of God’s work in creating man. The Sinner’s Need of Christ It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them. Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 3:3 In other words, unless he or she receives a new heart, desires, purposes and motives, all leading to a new life, they cannot see the kingdom of God. There must be a power working from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power is Christ. Those who have experienced the love of Christ cannot be idlers in the Master’s vineyard. They will see opportunities for helping others in their steps to Christ. Partaking of Christ’s love, they will labor for the souls of others. Let every soul copy the Pattern, and become missionaries in the highest sense, winning souls to Jesus. May we all Repent, Confess, Grow up into Christ, and Rejoice in the Lord."

10,Meeting People Online,social-issues," People fall in love — it happens. You could even say that it is natural and ""human"" for people to feel attraction to one another when they communicate over a period of time. Online love and romance take place all of the time, and usually begins as a back and forth of communication, be it emailing, talking on Myspace or Facebook, or commenting on blogs, etc. As with all things related to love and romance, there are ups and down to online love and romance that you should be aware of before you fall into a romantic situation with an online acquaintance. Many of these sites require paid memberships. For example, if you check Charmdate review this site filter their members through background checks so they are a little safer to surf. But paying a membership does not guarantee success. Other dating sites are free. Anyone can register and create a profile with no filtering. The risks are a little greater but if you don’t find someone within a month, you are not out any money. On social network sites, you get to post information about yourself along with current happenings in your life. You create a list of friends and can go read about what is happening to them. These sites are a great way to reconnect with old friends, keep up with new ones, or make contacts you can use for business. Before you hop into a chat room, though, you really need to be aware of the topic (if any) and the proper way to conduct yourself. Some chat rooms are not very friendly to just anyone. And if you don’t know a lot about the topic being discussed, you will be ignored. Hobby and Special Interest Sites – Hobby sites are good places to find people with the same interests. Whether it is music, movies, cars, or fashion, you can find just about any site with your interests. While you may not find a romantic interest at one of the websites, you can still meet new friends, gain resources, and have stimulating discussions. Online Groups – Some groups have an online site for updates on group activities. These sites have email lists, forums where you can post discussions, and moderators that oversee the site. Online groups are great places to just hang. Some groups even get together in person occasionally and enjoy some ‘live’ time."

12,The App That Lets You Speak From The Grave,social-issues," In the digital age where most things are made simplistically convenient, and formidably on point, a new app comes to clarify what’s left after dying. Just launched in early-December the new app from Mylastwill.org has made, of all things, creating a video will easy. Just sign up, pay a fee, input the contacts to be notified, and make a video will, living will, or last loving message. From there the app’s notification service will do the work. Upon the app user’s passing, it sends timely notifications via text or e-mail to set minds at ease and leave no inheritance to chance. Welcome to the simplest way to love the living from beyond the grave. Helping to facilitate estate law & probate law practices while effectively making probate court unnecessary, the Mylastwill.org app cuts to the chase. Those ready to take the futuristic leap can make use of a 50% off code for pre-registration before the November 2018 launch date. So, how does it work? Free to download, Mylastwill.org offers five packages to choose from on an annual fee schedule. Upon payment, up to three ""notifiers"" are listed to alert Mylastwill.org of the user’s passing. App users will also input the phone numbers of friends and family who should be notified about their death. They will then record a will or last message and, when the time comes, the system will send the applicable recipients either an invitation to the funeral or a digital copy of the recorded videos. Though useful for everyone, the app is especially helpful for men and women in the military as video wills, video messages, and recipients can be changed at a moment’s notice. Miss Kathy Carlton & JJ, Owner and Designer of Mylastwill.org Inc. said of the trend, ""It’s tough to argue with someone’s wishes when they’re captured on a video.  Court cases are proving that. So, we’ve jumped ahead of the trend by placing the power of a video will in the hands of our users. Now they can be assured that their will and last loving message is conveyed correctly. Moreover, it can show our members’ mental capacity at the time of the recording. They can also show the exact items they’re bequeathing privately. It’s a dignified way to meet the intended goals for everyone involved."" Reported by the Boston Globe, three cases recently foretold the beginning of a change in the criminal justice system via body camera video footage. The criminal cases in Massachusetts were overturned due to the footage being used as evidence. Now, something as simple as a mobile phone’s video capturing functionality has become a tremendous truth-teller and documentarian in a court of law. ""We’re committed to seeing their last wishes through to the end and beyond with integrity. So much so, in fact, that our members can purchase up to twenty years of the service and forget about it. We’ll handle the rest."""
13,Expose Unreliable Grabbing Skills of Claw Machine Game,social-issues," Claw machine game has been popular all over the world for a long time. Some great players of catching dolls constantly share their keys to success on the Internet. However, many players tease these secrets useless in the forum and cannot grasp the favorite prizes. In view of the true availability of grabbing skills, a series of investigations and certifications are launched. The main purpose is to help players distinguish whether these grabbing skills are practical or not. a. Swing grasp method First we tested the hottest grabbing skills in YouTube. According to the method of commentary on the video, shot the joystick to make the claws swing in the show cabinet continuously. Once aiming at the prizes, press the button of claw machine to grasp the prizes. When formal testing, select a common player and a top player to test 10 machines respectively. The final result shows that the common player grabbed 30 times and did not grab the prize. Top player grabbed 4 prizes for 30 times. Two players summarized their testing results. Common player said:"" That’s ridiculous. The method is of no use at all."" Top player said:"" I did not catch one prize in the previous tests. Later I began to carefully observe the position of the prizes and the strength of the claws, and choose the position of the prize near the door of the prize out to use the method of swinging claws, but it does not work very well. The prizes can be thrown out of the door under the specific conditions, but it is not easy to catch the prize under normal conditions. Based on the understanding from two players, we are not optimistic about the grabbing skills. It is suggested that players do not try to use this method. b. Quick click method This method is the grabbing skill we read in a forum. Players can click on the button of dropping claws quickly, thus increase the strength of the claws, so that they can grab the prizes more easily. In the beginning of the test, two players still do the test separately. But the results are useless. In term of the introduction from staff of the game hall, the probability of prizes out from the claw machine is adjusted. Clicking on the button crazily from the players in just only a psychological hint and it is useless. c. Free falling method This method still comes from a post of search engine. Players adjust the claws to the top of the favorite prize, and wait for the time button, and the claw will free fall down and grab the prizes. At this time, the claws are more powerful and easily grab the prizes. We have not tested the above method, but have been mocked by the staffs on site. The nature of this method is the same as that of the quick click method. It is totally a psychological comfort and it is useless. d. Shaking machine method This method is a rough one. When we are out of the staffs’ sight and start to do the test. First of all, do not insert the coins or operate the claws. As long as you are tall and strong enough, shake the claw machine. And the prizes can be thrown out of the door. It is found that this method is more practical, but advised that the players do not try it, or they may be expelled by the staffs. e. The law of 3 dollars This is a method invented by top player Neo. As everyone knows, the claw machine game can be adjusted to the probability of prizes out. When the number of coins inserting reaches a certain probability, the claw strength can increase, and the players can grab the prizes at one time. So Neo’s method is to observe the situation of the machines, and analyze the probability of prizes out of these machines. After other players inserting a certain number of coins, and then grab the prizes. Therefore, the success rate will be greatly improved. Usually spend three dollars to grab the prizes successfully. Two players still do the test. The final result shows that the common player grabbed 8 prizes for 30 times, while the top player grabbed 22 prizes. This overall test took us an afternoon. However, it is seen that the probability of success is much higher than other methods of operation skills. The only disadvantage is that it is a waste of time and requires the players have enough patience. The above is the test for some common operation skills. If there are new test results later, let everyone know as soon as possible."
14,Tips For Revitalizing The Passion Starved Relationship,social-issues," Most couples can revitalize their relationship after they’ve lost desire for each other and/or after being in their non-sexual relationship (10 sexual encounters a year (less than one per month) for a while, even for decades! This is good news! These dissatisfied couples loose hope of ever having an interesting, stimulating and satisfying relationship with their partner that includes a healthy sexual component. This does not have to be the case!! Dissatisfied couples fall into patterns of relating that hold them back from their true intimate potential. They have a very limited repertoire of interactions within their tedious and boring daily routines and in their interactional style. They don’t utilize the spectrum of behavior and experiences available to them that automatically engender the feelings and relationship they crave. Partners say they love each other, even though sometimes it might even be difficult to concede that, but crave the feeling of being-in-love with their partner, of having passion. Anthropologist, Helen Fisher, speaks of Romantic Love, comprised of passion, as a by-product of novelty. She claims that mystery, newness, physical activity, and joint endeavors increase the chemical levels in the brain that make us feel elated, in-love, passionate, energetic, high. Couples don’t take advantage of the natural and built-in benefits of the novelty factor. Couples that have been together for a long time and that know each other well believe that novelty has gone out the window, but novelty can be brought into any relationship at ANY time with some external assistance: Doing new fun and physical activities, creating new routines, going on trips and vacation, doing joint projects or ventures, etc. These couples’ situation is compounded when they bring into the relationship distorted views and definitions of intimacy and sexuality. Their expectations of fairy tale romance or porn/movie-like sexual encounters set them up for disappointments. These contribute to couples’ misconceptions, expectations and negative images of self and other that impede establishing and maintaining real levels of intimacy including mutually satisfying sexual interactions. This can be addressed with a reality check, honesty, openness, and acceptance, and by adapting an anti-avoidance approach to intimacy, which includes: Positive anticipation, pleasure oriented sex and regular consistent sexual interactions. Sometimes, with even the best of intentions, sex is worlds away. Sex follows a specific formula: Desire, Arousal, Orgasm and Satisfaction. This process is truncated when there is a lack of desire because of relational and circumstantial issues. Couples can manage this by reformulating their approach to physical intimacy: They can go for arousal first which in turn invites desire promoting the continuation of the encounter. Just get moving! There are 5 Gears of Physical Intimacy according to Couple Sex Therapy Expert, Dr. Barry McCarthy, author of Rekindling Desire. The gears include: Affectionate Touch Sensual/Non-Genital Touch Playfulness/Genital or Non-Genital Erotic Stimulation (High Arousal) Intercourse Couples that are having difficulties or who are not fully satisfied in their relationship usually have only two out of these gears. They go from affection to intercourse. And, if they don’t make it to intercourse, they also give up on the affection… Not for nothing these partners feel disconnected, unloved and dissatisfied! Integrating additional physical intimacy gears to the couple’s repertoire of interactions assist in creating the anti-avoidance mind set, promotes arousal/desire, and are a source of novelty. This is a must have tool!! Couples can break the avoidance/dissatisfaction cycle, become more intimate, meet their needs and create a satisfying relationship. Add some novelty, touch more and have more sex and watch the Passion soar!!! Revitalize your relationship today!!! Happy Revitalizing!!! ~ Your MetroRelationship™ Assignment Their expectations of fairy tale romance or porn/movie-like sexual encounters set them up for disappointments. These contribute to couples’ misconceptions, expectations and negative images of self and other that impede establishing and maintaining real levels of intimacy including mutually satisfying sexual interactions.

17,What The Heck Is Creativity?,social-issues," Before diving into details of what is creativity and ways you can achieve that, let me ask you first. What do you think is creativity? Stop reading this article right away. Start your favorite word processing software and write down your pearls of wisdom about creativity. Go ahead. If you are done, you might have come across something like this. Creativity is something new. It is innovative. It solves problems. Creativity always brings to mind the names of some important personalities like Pablo Picasso, Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Stephen Hawking, Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, Shakespeare, Seth Godin, Charlie Chaplin or some other popular figure of the similar league. People take a number of different positions on account of what is creative. It seems that everyone is yet to arrive at a logical conclusion. Let us explore some other dominant point of views on creativity •	Creativity Is Non-Industry Specific Creativity has touched on almost every possible industry. It can be found in linguistics, design, technology, psychology, cognitive science, and healthcare. You name it and it is there. It would not be wrong to say that anybody and everybody can use creativity for creation, innovation and problem-solving. •	It Is About Getting Knowledge It can be safely said that the more knowledge you have the more liberty you have to create something new. It makes sense too. Let’s say you are a small business and you are approached by a student of computer science working on artificial intelligence to create a print advertisement on that. They will not expect you to get a Master’s degree on computer science but you have to have an in-depth understanding of artificial intelligence to have an idea about why it is beneficial to the client’s target audience. Knowledge is an immense power to create something new, fresh and innovative out of it. •	Novelty Is the Essence of Creativity A lot of people agree that creativity has a predominant novelty factor attached to it. It could be a new joke. It could be a new way of looking at things. It could be a new perspective to a cliché concept or a fresh analysis of the event. Advertisers have used this technique to make millions of dollars for their clients and themselves. Remember the Apple Macintosh commercial? Nothing similar happened ever before like that. This is called novelty and it is an important aspect of creativity. •	It is a Fusion if Different Ideas Novelty in creativity is often achieved by blending two or more completely unrelated ideas to create a new one, specifically called conceptual blending. Example, Metaphor, and analogy are used to apply this technique. ""Swimming with the sea of sharks"" is a linguistic metaphor used by writers to depict the intensity of the potential risk involved in doing something. •	It Is Valuable Creativity is not valuable if it doesn’t hit the mark to create value. How can creativity drive value and who is calling the shots? Creativity produces the value if it does what it is intended for. The simplest example would be an advertisement commercial. If a commercial, intended to increase sales, does not get the job done, it is not valuable no matter how fresh, innovate and creative it is. •	It is About Imagination Creative people possess above average imagination. They have a special eye to observe nature, people, things, concepts, and almost everything. They can quickly tap into their imaginative power and source inspiration out of it without a hassle. Creativity is a concoction of different things. It is about infusing the different ideas to create something new and original. The aforementioned are some of the elements that define creativity in parts. Hope it helps you learn the different facets of creativity."

1,Shame on You!,social-issues," My husband loves websites that offer free astrology readings. I don’t have the heart to tell him that what they email him every morning are designed to be one-size-fits-all, because not every Leo in the world was born on the same date in the same year, and have the same rising and moon signs in the exact same place on their charts. So even though every Leo gets the same reading, my husband still thinks the message is just for him. (Isn’t that like a Leo?) Oh, well, it’s all in fun… Until the other night he showed me a very disturbing ad the website had sent him – and I’m sure it was sent to all of the website’s subscribers. The message banner asked: ""IS YOUR LOVE LIFE CURSED?"" I gritted my teeth. What an awful idea to implant in people’s minds! I thought of all the psychic scam artists out there who prey on people’s vulnerability and ask them to pay money to remove ""curses."" Here’s some great advice FOR FREE for everyone who thinks they’re living under a black cloud: Think positive thoughts, strengthen the light within yourself, and stop believing other people have power over you. Here’s the message, in part, my husband received from the website: ""Do you feel like there's a black cloud hanging over your love life? Are you underappreciated at work? If the stars seem to have forgotten to work their karmic magic on you, don't give up hope! True love, your ideal career, or a windfall could be right around the corner, or even right in front of your nose!"" Shame on you, for sending out such a fear-inducing message! The only part of the ad that’s true is love and happiness is right in front of your nose. The world is a loving, supportive place, and your angels and guides want to help you realize that. If you feel love and happiness is always just out of reach, it’s not because you’re cursed – perhaps you’ve put blocks in front of you. Are you secretly afraid of success? Are you missing out on love because you’re shy, or you’re hesitant about opening yourself up to the possibility of sharing yourself with someone? Karma isn’t working against you – you’re tripping over your own fear. ""Change your attitude and change your life"" is the lesson behind many wonderful self-help books available at your local public library. If I’m coming across as strident, I apologize. I’m sure there are many fine workers at psychic-based websites who whole-heartedly want to give service.  I’m sure they, like me and countless other intuitives, honour and respect the work we do. I just don’t like to think there are psychics and mediums out there who take advantage of people who are truly seeking help. I’ve been writing blogs for several years, and I get the most responses from one I did on psychic scams. It’s never too late to recapture your power. Just remember: No one can curse you except yourself. Or, as Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""No one can make you feel bad without your permission."""

4,Do You Know What Makes Your Spouse Tick?,social-issues," For many couples talking about sex in relationships can be uncomfortable. However, it is necessary. Not communicating about sex can cause tension and bitterness. You cannot assume you know what makes your spouse tick. It is your responsibility to find out in order to please them. The rule is to never assume that you know what works sexually for your significant other. Ask. You may be surprised and have a new revelation by just talking about your needs. No one should be the boss in the bedroom. It should be a mutual commitment to equally satisfy and please each other, continuously. So, my question to you is do you know what makes your spouse tick? Many times women are more emotional then men. Women may like the fore-play that leads up to the lovemaking. However, it really depends upon the personality, because there are men that enjoy the conversation, cuddling, touching, and that is enough sometimes. Then you have some women that just want to get down to business all the time. Don’t think the gender determines the emotional and sensitively level of the person when it comes to sex. Sure, the presumption is that women may not be as aggressive, demanding or sexual as men, but the reality is that it depends on the person. That is why it is so important to talk about what you want, and what makes you feel good and not so good. You may be doing something assuming they are happy, and they absolutely hate and dread it. Talk. What do you need to get you in the mood? What are they doing that you like?  What don’t you like? Is there something new you want to try? Sit down and have an open honest discussion about your needs at a scheduled time. Write the information down, so you won’t forget. Repeat what your spouse says to get clarity and understanding. Do not assume you know exactly what your partner want and need. Is your spouse visual? Wear something that turns them on. Look good, clean, and sexy! Be romantic, fun, and loving like you just met. Is it a good and pleasant conversation that sets the mood for you? Don’t think you can act like the devil all day, belittle, act disrespectful, and then when you want ""some"" in the evening they are ready with open arms. No, you need to massage the conversation in order to get that massage at night. Finally, listen to you spouse. If they are talking and telling you what they need, pay attention. Do not be offended by what you hear. Take heed. Would you rather be uncomfortable for a short time listening or uncomfortable for a long time because needs are going unmet? Listen and learn what your spouse desires are. Be open to changing from the status quo. When you discover what your spouse really want and need sexually, you may have a ticking bomb ready to explode."

Several options are available. Administration of ED pills is the most convenient and widely prescribed method of treating ED. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a type of sexual dysfunction in men in which a man is not able to achieve or sustain a firm and strong penile erection for a long duration of time.  This leads to unsatisfactory sexual life, which further can result in relationship conflicts. ED can be treated in several ways.

Both branded and generic versions of the ED pills are available in the market. The branded versions of ED pills include Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra. Some of the generic versions include Suhagra, Penegra, Zenegra, Generic Viagra, Tadalis, and Snovitra Professional etc. How do ED pills improve sexual dysfunction? The drugs present in ED pills inhibit the PDE-5 enzyme present in the penile region.  This inhibitory process leads to an increase in the levels of cGMP, which produces relaxation of smooth muscles and dilation of the blood vessels. The dilated blood vessels let more amount of blood to enter into the penile region. The improved blood supply to the penile organ results in a firm and strong penile erection, necessary for having a satisfactory sexual intercourse. Drugs present in ED pills include- • Sildenafil Citrate • Tadalafil • Vardenafil Sildenafil Citrate- It was the first effective oral drug to be approved for treating erectile dysfunction. It is a potent and selective PDE-5 inhibitor. It was approved for use in ED in the year 1998 by FDA. The action of this drug starts within 30 to 60 minutes after taking the medicine orally. The action lasts for an average duration of four hours. The most effective dose of Sildenafil citrate is 100mg. Tadalafil- It was approved for use in the treatment of ED in the year 2003 by FDA.

Only take the necessary precautions and follow the advice given by your healthcare expert."
7,Metaphysical Reflections about Spinoza and his Concepts Pertaining to Metaphysics and God and the Wave Structure of Matter,social-issues," Metaphysical Reflections about Spinoza and his Concepts Pertaining to Metaphysics and God and the Wave Structure of Matter ''A free man, who lives among ignorant people, tries as much as he can to refuse their benefits. .. He who lives under the guidance of reason endeavors as much as possible to repay his fellow’s hatred, rage, contempt, etc. with love and nobleness''. (Spinoza, Ethics) ''Except God no substance can be granted or conceived. .. Everything, I say, is in God, and all things which are made, are made by the laws of the infinite nature of God, and necessarily follows from the necessity of his essence''. (Spinoza, Ethics) Baruch (or, in Latin, Benedict) de Spinoza (1632-1677) was one of the most central rationalist philosophers in the early modern period, along with Descartes, Leibniz, and Malebranche.  Spinoza can also be considered as the most prominent ""atheist"" in Europe during this period.  ""Atheist"" at that time means someone who discards the traditional Biblical views pertaining to God and his relation to nature. Spinoza declared his new radical conceptions about God and his relation to nature in his most important book, titled Ethics, which revealed an ingenious geometrical manner and striking dexterity in his coherent logical analysis. His geometrical method is closely related to Euclid's Elements and Newton's Principia. He proposes many radical new conceptions which can be seen in direct contradiction to Judeo-Christian ones at that time. Spinoza postulates that God and Nature are one, which means he excludes the well-established notion about transcendent and personal God. One of these new radical ideas is his claim that the whole natural world, including human beings, follows the same course of natural laws which means humans do not have free will as they may think, instead, everything that happens could not have happened differently, he means the universe is only behaving totality (which can be conceived of as either ""God"" or ""Nature""), and the mind and the body are fundamentally the same thing conceived in two different ways, which means they share the same inherent essence. In this article I will try to analysis some fundamental issues of Spinoza’s new ""metaphysics"", and shed some light on the most important and difficult aspects of Spinoza’s metaphysics; especially, his theory about Substance, Monism and his theory of Attributes. Spinoza argues that everything that exists is either a substance or a mode. He starts by defining ''Substance '' as something that needs nothing else in order to exist or be conceived. Substance is independent entity both conceptually and ontologically. Whereas a Mode is something that needs a substance in order to exist, and cannot exist without a substance. For example, being furry, orange, hungry, angry, etc. are modes that need a substance which is furry, orange, hungry, angry, etc. Hunger and patches of orange color cannot exist floating around on their own, but rather, hunger and patches of orange color need something (namely, a substance) to be hungry and have the orange color.  That means hunger and colors are dependent entities or modes; they cannot exist alone without ''The Substance''. But according to almost all of Spinoza’s predecessors, including Aristotle and Descartes, there are lots of substances in the universe, each with its own modes or properties. For example, according to Descartes a cat is a substance which has the modes or properties of being furry, orange, soft,…. etc. Spinoza, however, rejects this traditional view and argues that there is only one Substance, he called it  ""God"" or ""Nature."" Whereas, cats, dogs, people, rocks,etc. are not substances in their essence according to his view, but rather they are just modes or properties of one infinite absolute indivisible  substance. This one substance can be conceived simply as people-like in places, rock-like in other places, chair-like in still other places, etc. We may think of that Substance as an'' Infinite Space'' according to a new modern physics theory; '' Wave Structure of Matter'' and the ''Dynamic Unity of Reality''. I mean, some regions in this '' Infinite Space'' are hard and brown (rocks), other regions of that Space are green, juicy, and soft (plants), while still other regions are furry, orange, and soft (cats), etc, (See Bennett 1984: 88-92 for more on space and the extended substance in Spinoza). Spinoza starts his argument by postulating that this one Substance has an infinite number of attributes. He defines an attribute by simply an essence; a ""what it is to be"" that kind of thing. Whereas, according to Descartes, every substance has only one attribute. Bodies have only the attribute of extension, and minds have only the attribute of thought. Spinoza's main focal point in his argument is that the Substance is absolutely infinite which entails it must exist in every way that something can exist. Thus, he infers that one Substance must have an infinite number of attributes. An attribute, according to Spinoza, is just the essence of substance under some way of conceiving or describing that substance. That is why Spinoza defines an attribute by the way our mind can conceive or realize the manifestations of the essence of that substance in specific circumstances. He means that Substance has only one absolute and infinite essence; nevertheless, our mind cannot conceive this absolute essence except through dividing it into numerous attributes, because this is the way our limited mind can function or deal with infinite and abstract issue. In other words, he means that when we consider substance one way, then we conceive of its essence as extension, but if we consider the same substance another way, we may conceive its essence as thought for instance. (See Della Rocca 1996a: 164-167.) While Substance has an infinite number of attributes, Spinoza argues that human beings are only able to recognize two of them: ''Extension'' which reveals itself through the creating process of the entire Universe and bringing the material world into existence, and the ''Thought'' which reveals itself through the Logos and the pervasive inherent intellectual faculty in all living creatures. We are only able to conceive these two attributes because of the limitations of our human mind of course. In fact, what seems to be the most distinguish feature of Spinoza's argument about Substance is his ''substance Monism''.  He claims that one infinite Substance can only exist, and he called this substance'' God or Nature'', and he decisively excludes the possibility of the existence of any other substances. His strategy to prove this ''monism'' was demonstrated in the first part of the famous book '' Ethics''. We can highlight the main points of his argument as follows: 1- Every substance has at least one attribute. 2- Two substances cannot share the same nature or attribute, because they will be identical and they will end up being the same Substance, and that can be absurdity according to Spinoza. 3- God has all possible attributes as a logical consequence of being an infinite substance, which excludes the possibility of existence of any other attribute outside that absolute being. 4- An Infinite number of attributes should include the attribute of existence as well. That is why God should exist by the necessity of his infinite number of his attributes. 5-Therefore, no other substance other than God can exist. That is because there is only one substance (called ""God"" or ""Nature"") which has all possible attributes. In other words, this Substance possesses all the possible attributes and has allowed no room for any other substance or attribute to exist outside his infinite essence. In addition, no other substance can exist in this case because if it exists it would have to share an attribute with the first substance, but it is impossible, according to Spinoza, for two different substances to have the same attribute, because they would end up the same substance. Spinoza defends each of his four assumptions as follows: Premise number one: If a substance existed which did not have any attributes, then (by Spinoza’s definition of attribute, this substance would not have an essence.  However, according to Spinoza, it makes no sense to claim that something exists which does not have an essence.  Thus, every substance has at least one attribute.  This premise is not particularly controversial. The Argument for Premise Two: Spinoza’s argument for the second premise (""Two substances cannot share the same nature or attribute"") can be fishy and somewhat controversial. In this premise, Spinoza argues that if two substances share one and the same attribute, then there is no way to tell the two substances apart. For instance, if substance A and substance B both possess the same attribute or the same inherent nature, then who can distinguish between these two substance? I mean, who can judge if these two substances are identical or not? Why aren’t A and B just one substance? Modern physics testifies for Spinoza's accuracy pertaining to his ''Monism ''and his ''infinite unbounded'' Substance According to the modern theory of ''Wave Structure of Matter'' all the matter in this universe is a reconstruction of an infinite Substance which they call it ''Space''. This theory means by Space an infinite Substance which we all of us observe and experience around us, and all the matter in our universe came into existence by the mere movement of this Space. ''The notion that all these fragments is separately existent is evidently an illusion, and this illusion cannot do other than lead to endless conflict and confusion. Indeed, the attempt to live according to the notion that the fragments are really separate is, in essence, what has led to the growing series of extremely urgent crises that is confronting us today. Thus, as is now well known, this way of life has brought about pollution, destruction of the balance of nature, over-population, world-wide economic and political disorder and the creation of an overall environment that is neither physically nor mentally healthy for most of the people who live in it. Individually there has developed a widespread feeling of helplessness and despair, in the face of what seems to be an overwhelming mass of disparate social forces, going beyond the control and even the comprehension of the human beings who are caught up in it.

11,How to Express Your Emotions,social-issues," Studying psychology can be very beneficial because you get to understand human behavior in their daily undertakings. You get to read people's mind and know why they behave in a particular manner. One also acquires proper research and analytical skills that will help them come up with the right findings. Studying psychology also helps improve one's communication skills. You get to create a strong, healthy relationship with others and even communicate on important issues. This helps create a proper understanding and build stable relationships between different people. You can enroll in any schools that offer a psychology course to learn more. One can also access relevant information on psychology online. Sites like rincondelvago have a wide range of documents with valuable information on subjects like psychology. Emotional expressivity is one thing you will learn in your psychology classes. This is all about revealing your emotions verbally or through non-verbal gestures like facial expressions. One's conduct or social rules can influence their emotional experience. Expressing your emotions can benefit you psychologically. It helps bring that sense of closeness, and you will feel much connected with others. You also get to build a strong and healthy relationship with other people. It is also vital for self-growth. The following are some simple ways or steps on how you can express your emotions. Establish the Emotion One thing you can do is find out the feeling or emotion you are having at that particular moment. You should be keen on the different changes or reactions happening in your body. The things that are running through your mind or the symptoms you are facing at that time. This is the first step you should take. Analyze Your Feelings What are the changes that have come about as a result of what you are experiencing at the moment? You should be able to figure out what your current feeling has created inside you. List down all your emotions and find out what can give them away physically. Be keen on emotions that can be more visible to other people. Be Attentive You must also pay close attention to the different reactions in your body. Stay calm during that period until whatever you are feeling cools down. You can now sit down and figure out everything about it and come up with the best methods on how you can combat the situation. Find Ideal Time You should find the perfect time to express your emotions. A good example is when you've argued with someone else. You need to wait and examine the situation before expressing yourself. Is everything calm? Have the tempers cooled down? Analyzing the circumstances will prevent the chances of another conflict, and you also get to express yourself freely in the right environment. Positive Communication One should stick to a positive means of communication. Use the right tone, phrases and also maintain eye contact. Having or using the correct body language when expressing yourself is also essential. The person you are talking to will understand your situation better if you express yourself in the right manner."
12,Testosterone improves sexual desire and erectile function in type 2 diabetes.,social-issues," Type 2 Diabetic (T2D) men are three times more likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than men without diabetes. Erectile dysfunction is often seen associated with low testosterone (Hypogonadism). Hypogonadism is defined as having low testosterone levels along with sexual symptoms. As a physician who treats erectile dysfunction (ED), I have seen more and more diabetics come in for this exact issue. It’s known that Testosterone replacement (TRT) can significantly improve sexual function in men without diabetes. Diabetic men had previously shown some improvements in sexual desire, but poor improvement in erectile function.  A recent study in the Journal Andrology looked at the effect of TRT on sexual desire and erectile function in men with mild and severe hypogonadism.  It also looked at duration of treatment and benefits of TRT at 6, 18, and 30 weeks for comparison. Results showed that in T2D men with mild hypogonadism, 36-39.6% had improvement in sexual desire at 6-30 weeks.  Improvement in sexual function was also 40-39.6% at 6-30 weeks. The interesting thing was that T2D men with the lowest initial testosterone levels showed the greatest response to TRT.  Improvement in sexual desire increased to 60% at 6 weeks and 74% at 30 weeks.  Erectile function improved to 36.7% at 6 weeks and increased to 63% at 30 weeks. This study showed that improvements in erectile function may take longer than we previously considered.  Prior to this I used to tell my patients that based on my clinical experience, erectile function could take up to 6 months to improve. Now I know that it’s closer to 8 months of therapy before TRT can demonstrate a benefit at the tissue level for most patients. Improvements in erectile function takes longer because the changes that testosterone must provide have to occur at the tissue level. This is essential information to know in that most men may become frustrated and quit therapy before TRT has a chance to improve erectile function. The more we know, the better we can treat our patients."

14,Why to Avoid Joining The Free Couples Dating Site,social-issues," Are you eager to find a perfect date on the bisexual couples dating sites? Are you still in a dilemma as to how to find suitable couples dating sites? Are you still considering whether you should choose a free couples dating site or a paid couples dating site? OK, what I'm going to tell you today is why we should join a paid couples dating site, not be completely free. It is not difficult to understand that most people are more willing to choose a free dating site. Some people just hold the mentality of playing, and they don't care whether they find a partner or not. However, some people who really want to find partners do not trust a paid dating site because they do not know it at first. In fact, most of the paid dating sites offer free registration, only for some special functions, a part of the membership fee will be charged. So why should we join the charging website? 1.better service quality. Most of the paid dating sites are for profit. in order to achieve the expected goal, the paid dating sites need to continuously improve their own service quality. This gives members more excellent experience. However, completely free dating sites exist for some other purposes, which may result in their services not keeping up with the needs of members. 2.match rate. Members who are willing to pay are all very interested in the date itself. they will treat the date with seriousness. Members can naturally improve the success rate of dating by screening paid users and free users. Therefore, the paid dating site is more conducive for members to select suitable dating partners 3.safety. Actually. It is similar to the first tip, but it is mentioned here separately. Every online user is extremely concerned about his privacy. Paying dating sites will naturally protect users' privacy for their own brands. After all, the disclosure of privacy does not only require huge compensation, but also means that businesses are at risk of collapse. As for the quality of users, the paid dating site will assign special personnel to review the user information to ensure the safety of personnel and websites. This greatly reduces the possibility of encountering fraudsters. And free websites can be joined by anyone. The authenticity of personnel information cannot be guaranteed which will result in poor user experience. In short, paid dating sites have many advantages over free websites. But how to choose, still need users to choose according to your own situation. If you already have the right dating site, join it boldly. And you will find happiness that you have never experienced before."

Having said this, I now wish to perform an analysis of my desire. In order to do an analysis, I’m left with a choice: I can either refer to a real human being, who wants to place all planets between the United States and the United Kingdom, so that they can enter Annabelle Creation and turn Janice into a real human being, or, I can refer to a real human being valuing the placing of all planets between the United States and the United Kingdom, because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being. It’s a 50/50 choice, and on this occasion I’ll go with the latter option. A real human being, valuing the placing of all planets between the United States and the United Kingdom, because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being is not a human being valuing the placing of all planets between the United States and the United Kingdom, because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being.

The placing of all planets, is not placing of all planets. Not placing of all planets is placing all planets. Placing all planets, between the United States and the United Kingdom because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being is not all planets between the United States and the United Kingdom because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being. Not all planets is planets. Planets between the United States, and the United Kingdom because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being is not between the United States and the United Kingdom because of the desire to enter Annabelle Creation and to turn Janice into a real human being.

Fun to give is not to give. Not to give is give from. Give from fun giving is hierarchy from fun hierarchy. Authority can only exist because it was the original entertainer."
20,"The true meaning, of rich women still deserving to be bad boys in their mansions after healthcare is universally free",social-issues," I want to talk about what it means, if rich women still deserve to be bad boys in their mansions after healthcare is universally accessible. Healthcare is a means to survival. A means to survival is not means to, and not means to is means from - means from is simply non-means, and non-means is an actual endgame. So healthcare is an endgame. Now for the other aspect of the scenario: rich women aren't women. The opposite of women is the opposite of human beings - the opposite of human beings is non-beings. Non-beings is being; being is a state, but it isn't necessarily a living state, but can instead just be state - so on this occasion, I'll choose to interpret being as nothing but short and sweet state. Still deserve isn't deserve. Non-deserve is possession. To be bad boys isn't be bad boys. Not be bad boys is then something that's even shorter, and even sweeter: bad boys. So as of right now, part of the sequence reads as follows: if state possession bad boys. In their mansions isn't their mansions - not their mansions is mansions. Is universally accessible isn't universally accessible. Not universally accessible is partially accessible. Partially accessible is not accessible. Finally, the full sequence reads as follows: if state possession bad boys mansions after endgame not accessible. State possession is non-possession. Endgame not accessible is accessible. Bad boys mansions is mansions bad boy. Mansions bad boy is not bad boy - not bad boy is good boy, and good boy is adult. If non-possession adult after accessible - or in other words, possession adult after accessible. Possession is hierarchy. Hierarchy is service. Accessible is equality. Service adult after equality. Serve adult after equality. Adult is master after equality. Equality before adult is master. Equality before adult isn't free. Equality is stability. Stability creates adult as prisoner. Adult as prisoner is prisoner as child. Prisoner is oppressed. Oppressed is isolated. Isolated as child is isolated as error. Isolated as error is error being group. Stability creates error being together. Balance is when error is together. Evolution is error coming together. History is error coming together. History is the past coming together. History is particles coming together. The 21st century is particles coming together. The 21st century is the universe coming together."

1,Best Way To Improve sexual Performance,social-issues," The sexual satisfaction of married couple go a long way in enhancing their relationship. The root cause of most problems in marriages can be traced to sex. Either the man is sexually dysfunctional or the woman don't enjoy it. When a man is sexually effective, he feels proud, it increases his confidence and he feels sexually fulfilled but if he is sexually dysfunctional, it affects his ego. He feels frustrated, incompetent and begin to have the feeling of low self esteem. The woman in turns feels unsatisfied and begins to desire other men outside. Research has proven that must sexual enhanced drugs and pills have side effects. The best way to solve sexual dysfunction especially in men is to  eat fresh fruits. Some of them are listed below. 2.Banana: It contains Bromelain, an enzyme that enhances libido and reverses impotency in men. Asides from the penis shape joke people often make with banana, it contains potassium, magnesium as well as other vitamins. Bananas not only serve as food for nutrition, they also help improve the production of hormones, increase energy level and help spice up sexual desire. They contain Vitamin B6 which helps in the production of red blood cells, dopamine and serotonin. This vitamin help men with low sperm count get over this challenge. READ ALSO: Why You Should Be Drinking Lemon Water in the Morning. 3.FIGS: rich in amino acids that will set your sexual desire  on fire. 4.AVOCADO: Avocados contain lots of potassium which improves stamina as well as it increases blood flow. When blood flows and rushes into the sexual organ, the desire to have sex is increased. The avocado tree is sometimes called the Testicle Tree because of the fruit’s shape when compared to the human testicles and it growing in pairs. Avocados also support healthy cardiovascular system and help in the regulation of blood sugar; thus they are safe to consume. Avocados are high in folic acid which would help increase sperm count in men. For the women, it would help prevent birth defects."
2,"When the Titanic sank, in 1912, it was so that the laws of physics could tell the rest of the universe to annihilate capitalism",social-issues," If physics orchestrated the sinking of the Titanic, so that physics could review its own history, physics reviews its history in spite of physics causing the sinking of the Titanic. The sinking, of the Titanic, is the sinking of an object. The sinking of an object is the annihilation of an object - the annihilation of an object is the object of no annihilation. Object is non-living. Non-living of no annihilation is non-living of life; non-living of life is non-living to non-living, and non-living to non-living is from non-living. Physics causing is not causing. Not causing is afterward. Physics reviews its history in spite of after from non-living is physics reviewing its history opposing after from non-living. After from non-living is before non-living - before non-living is living. Physics reviews its history is not physics reviewing history. Not physics reviewing history is physics reviewing. Physics reviewing is reviewing not physics. Reviewing not physics is reviewing not science. Reviewing not science is reviewing not proof. Reviewing not proof is reviewing mystery. Reviewing mystery opposing living is living supporting reviewing mystery. Review is question - life supports question mystery. Life is evolution. Support is hierarchy. Question is oppose. Evolution hierarchy oppose mystery. Evolution hierarchy is hierarchy evolution; hierarchy is service, and thus, service evolution opposing mystery is help evolution oppose mystery. Opposing mystery is mystify balance. Mystification means to make into the supernatural. Help evolution mystify balance is help evolution turn into the supernatural balance; help evolution turn into the supernatural balance is not evolution turning into the supernatural balance - not evolution turning into the supernatural balance is inferiority turning into the supernatural balance. Supernatural balance is supernatural stability. Supernatural stability is stable reality. Stable reality is safe reality. Inferiority turning into the safe reality is the safe reality avoiding inferiority. A safe reality is a safe location. Avoiding inferiority is inferior interaction. Inferior interaction is not interaction. A safe location not interacting is an unsafe location interacting. An unsafe location is a safe non-location - a safe non-location is a repetitive non-location. Non-location is non-physical. Non-physical is imaginative. A repetitive imagination interacting is an imagination not interacting. An imagination not interacting is the imagination interacting: the imagination interacting is interacting not the imagination. Not the imagination is the physical. Interacting is reacting - reacting is receiving. Receiving the physical is physical not the receiving. Physical not the receiving is physical the giving. Physical is structure. The giving is the teaching. Structure the teaching is alienate the teaching - alienate the teaching is end the teaching. When the Titanic sank, in 1912, it was an event orchestrated by the laws of physics in order to tell the rest of the universe to go to war with culture."
3,"The true meaning, of extramarital affairs beating magic before the Big Bang so that gravity can occupy the universe",social-issues," If extramarital affairs beat magic, before the universe, so that gravity can occupy the universe,  gravity occupies the universe in spite of extramarital affairs beating magic before the universe. Gravity occupying the universe is gravity occupying total quantity. Total quantity is not quantity, and not quantity is absence. Gravity is oppression. Occupy is oppression - gravity occupying absence is oppression oppressing absence. Extramarital affairs is violation. Beating magic is not victory. Before the universe is not before. Violation not victory not before is violation loss after: violation loss after is violation not loss. Violation not loss is violation victory - violation victory is victorious consistency. Oppression oppressing absence is not oppressing absence. Not oppressing absence is oppressing presence - oppressing presence means to oppress style. The oppression of style, in spite of victorious consistency is not of style in spite of victorious consistency. Not of style, in spite of victorious consistency, is style in spite of victorious consistency. Style in spite of victorious consistency is victorious consistency because of style. Consistency is formula. Style is creativity - creativity is fiction. Victory is status - status is importance. The importance of formula is because of magic. Magic is in spite of the importance of formula. Importance is credibility. Credibility is tested. Tested is known. Known is information. Formula isn't importance, therefore formula isn't information - formula doesn't exist. Magic doesn't exist either, which means that absence in spite of information of absence is information of absence because of absence. Information is use. Use of absence is not use of - not use of is use to. Use to is toward no use. Because of absence is not of absence. Not of absence is to absence. Toward no use is not toward use. Not toward use is use. Use to absence is device to absence. Device to absence is absence from device. Absence from device is magic from device. Device is inferior part of hierarchy. Magic is power. Power is superior part of hierarchy. The superior part of hierarchy is from inferior part of hierarchy, which means that the inferior part of hierarchy can't come from the superior part of hierarchy. Reality wants the inferior part of a hierarchy to have the power to come from the superior part of a hierarchy."
4,India is forging ahead,social-issues," While Western trade institutions are withering amid the global crisis, entrepreneurs in developing countries are breaking out ahead, using new ideas and technologies. But will they be able to take advantage of their power in the global arena? One of the main problems associated with poverty in developing countries is the reluctance to make the necessary and important changes. Even earlier, they said that if the reformers come to power in the third line countries, and start building market relations and a law-based state, this will surely  lead to prosperity. However, in the last few decades, few countries have been lucky enough to take the right path and get closer to the level of development of the guiding countries. It has become more and more obvious, that the centuries-old mentality and social institutions can both contribute to and hinder the development and realization of the opportunities inherent in market relations and political democracy. Let's look at the specifics of the mentality and social structures of Indian civilization and follow their influence on the development and establishment of society. The ideological basis of Indian civilization is Judaism. Since Judaism is a closed religion, they can not just become what they are, the Hindu can only be born. At the moment, of the population of more than one billion people, 80% are Hindus. According to this, it becomes clear that no Western innovations could fall into the hands of people lived on the territory of India. The Hindu worldview is based on the doctrine of dharma. The word ""drachma"" can be translated as a socio-cosmic order. According to the doctrine of the drachma, a person must be engage in what he should, and not in what he wants. Caste acts as a ""distribution hat"". In short, the doctrine of the drachma is an idea that binds man to a particular kind of activity. This idea, as we can see, is contradicts the progress. Perhaps this provision that everyone should follow the drachma's orders made the Hindus an easy victim for foreign invaders. The kings and princes constantly fought among themselves not with the purpose of solving geopolitical and economic problems, but in order to fulfill their duty and become famous. Infinite internecine wars led inexorably to the fall in defensive capability. It's no wonder that India has been under the rule of foreigners for centuries. Set of doctrines and institutions, such as a weak level of democracy and the caste institute, should be considered as an obstacle to social progress, since the Hindu first of all realizes himself not as an autonomous unique personality, but as a member of the caste. Caste makes Indian society split. Currently, when the global information space is being formed, there are many opportunities  to get rid of former ideas and institutions that impede progress. Today everyone in the world is well informed about each other. Everyone knows who is ahead and who is behind, who is rich and who is poor. If not for everyone, then for most people the benefit of scientific knowledge is crystal obvious. Comprehension of this simple truth, will help to get rid of irrationalism and neophobia. The population of India see how in a relatively short period of time some of the peoples have made significant progress in social and economic development. This observation can help to throw away the idea that a human can not change the world for the better. The Hindus took the path of forming an individualistic vision of the world. The introduction of Blockchain technology is only the first breakthrough to release outdated principles and ideas. If we take a deep look into the function of crypyocurrency and it role in modern Export/Import business, we will understand why India has chosen new inventions to track any transactions. Modern technology is just a miracle. Different useful things come from nowhere and help us in life. Today, everything has changed. It's hard to imagine a person without a mobile phone, laptop, credit card, or banking account. These things have made our daily life very convenient. Cryptocurrency is another technology that can conduct our world on the right path to improvement. This concept appeared several years ago. However, the technology was very useful and in demand in a variety of areas. Starting from everyday payments and ending with the protection of national interests. Finance Minister of India has approved Blockchain as an important tool for launching in digital economy. The only minus of this innovation can be methods of control the financial undertakings. Because of the fear of losing more money using digital money, the Indian state was on the verge of striking out this option as one of the components of the business. The main thing for the country is not about lifting up the currency, but the economy. In India, the financial system is at a low level of development, the country has a lot of microcredits simply because small enterprises, without necessary networking, can not develop normally. This also reflects the state interest in this issue. If statesmen take into account the latest improvements in technology and innovation industry, for India this will become a powerful impetus for the overall development of the economy. The ability to track locations, as well as the speed of goods moving, from the place of departure to that destination, would greatly facilitate that kind of market relations represented in a list of countries like India, Brazil and China. In the matter of health care, there would also be new ways of solving problems with the filling of questionnaires and warehouses, where a large volume of medical waste paper is stored. Everything would simply be transferred to digital version! Each patient would have his account in real time, which would enable him to view his data himself, and the supervising doctor could easily get all the files he needed. Work would be much easier and smoother than to keep staying in long queues. The reluctance to change, has made India a hostage to its own convictions, but the features of the Blochkchain system presented above under consideration made it clear, that economic crises can be overcome by more acceptable and in likable tools."
5,"The true meaning, of Marnie Simpson being the life of the Battle of Hastings so that Hollywood can be free from American culture",social-issues," On the condition, that Geordie Shore's Marnie Simpson is the life of the Battle of Hastings, so that Hollywood is disconnected from American culture, American culture is the non-life of the Battle of Hastings in spite of Hollywood being connected to Marnie Simpson. Hollywood's connection, to Marnie Simpson, is the non-connection to Marnie Simpson. The non-connection to Marnie Simpson is Marnie Simpson to connection - Marnie Simpson to connection is not to connection, and not to connection is connection. American culture is culture of not American. Culture of not American is culture of not style, and culture of not style is culture of universal; culture of universal is universal not of culture, and universal not of culture is universal to culture. Universal to culture is not to culture. Not to culture is to universal: to universal is universal not to - universal not to is the same as universal being oppressed. The non-life, of the Battle of Hastings, is the oppression of the Battle of Hastings. The oppression of the Battle of Hastings. The Battle of Hastings is an event that was oppressive. Event that's oppressive is oppression that's not event. Oppression that isn't event is oppression that's not experience. Oppression that's not experience is non-experience that's free - non-experience that's free is experience that's oppressive. The oppression of experience that's oppressive is the non-existence of experience that's oppressive. The non-existence of experience that's oppressive is experience that's free - experience that's free is freedom that can't be experienced. Universal being oppressed being freedom that can't be experienced is not being oppressed being freedom that can't be experienced; not being oppressed is being free, and being free being free that is absent is the presence of being free being not free. The presence of being free being not free is being free being free. Being free being free in spite of connection is connection because of being free being free. Being free being free is not freedom being free - not freedom being free is oppression being free. Oppression is not symmetry. Not symmetry is not isolation. Not isolation being free is freedom being isolation. Connection because of freedom being isolation is connection because of isolation being isolation. Isolation being isolation is being connection; being connection is connection not being - connection not being is not being not being. Not being not being is being being. Being being is not being. Not being is absence, and absence is magic. Connection because of magic is magic in spite of connection. Connection is between mutual presence. Between mutual presence is not mutual presence - not mutual presence is unequal presence. Unequal presence is equal absence. Equal absence is equal magic. Magic in spite of equal magic is magic that rejects equal magic. All information can only interact with information which is the same"
6,How Do I Know If I Have Herpes?,social-issues," There are many types of sexually transmitted diseases or infections, but herpes is without a doubt one of the most popular. This can be blamed on the fact that most people who have herpes rarely show any signs and symptoms. As a result, they can continue spreading the disease to their sexual partners with no complaints or knowledge of what they are doing. What makes things worse is the fact that some of the signs and symptoms of herpes can easily be confused with other medical conditions. For instance, some people often confuse the disease with the flu, pimples or ingrown hair. In addition to that, the symptoms often come and go away, but the infection stays in your body for life. How to Know You Have Herpes Once you are infected with herpes, you may not show any signs or symptoms, and the symptoms will disappear and come back after some time. This will make it difficult for you to know if you have the STI, so how do you know whether or not you have herpes? Well, the surest way is to get tested. Ideally, you should get tested annually for STDs. When you find a new sexual partner, the two of you should get tested to ensure you are both free of these infections. Meanwhile, you should use male latex condoms to ensure you do not contract or spread the STI. If you notice some signs and symptoms that you suspect are caused by an STD, you should get tested. There are two ways to test for STDs. First, you can go to a private medical facility and have your blood tested. However, this option does not offer much in terms of privacy. The best option is to order a home test kit for herpes. Be sure to visit http://herpeshometest.net to get additional information about at home herpes test kits. With these kits, you can test for herpes in the comfort and privacy of your home. If you test positive, you can seek urgent medical attention. Since self-medication is ill-advised by medical experts, you will need to visit a local medical facility for a second opinion and treatment in case you are found to have herpes. If you do not test positive for herpes, you should continue practicing responsible sex. How Herpes Home Test Kits Work Herpes testing is usually done on urine or vaginal discharge. This means that you do not need to prick yourself to get a blood sample. A simple urine sample or vaginal swab will provide sufficient sample for testing. This means that virtually anyone can extract a sample and test it for the herpes simplex virus. Most test kits are highly accurate and boast a specificity and sensitivity of over 99%. This means that the results you get are credible. However, if you are in doubt, you can always seek a second opinion. When you buy a herpes test kit online, the kit will be mailed with free 2-way shipping. The kit will most likely include; Postage paid envelope for sending the sample back to the lab Usage instructions Urine/vaginal swab collection kit Phone number in case you want to consult an expert before or after the test Once you have collected the sample and mailed it back to the lab, experienced lab technicians will analyze the sample and send you the test results. In case you test positive, the technicians will include the contact details of a competent medical practitioner that you can consult or get medical attention from. The best thing about home test kits is that they are highly reliable and offer a great deal of privacy."
7,"The true meaning, of religion forcing God to believe in God by threatening to connect American men to dickie bows",social-issues," When religion makes God believe in God, by threatening a connection American men and dickie bows, the equivalent is the threat of a connection between American men and dickie bows not making God believe in God because of religion. God believing in God, because of religion, is the non-belief in God because of religion. The non-belief in God because of religion is the rejection of God because of religion. The rejection of God, because of religion, is therefore the acceptance of religion because of God. The threat of a connection, between American men and dickie bows, which has nothing to do with the support of faith because of God is the connection between American men and dickie bows having something to do with the support of faith because of God. The support of faith is the faith in no support - the belief in chaos. Because of God is not of God. Not of God is of reality. Of reality is God. When the connection between American men, and dickie bows is connected to the belief in chaos God, it is the same as the connection between American men and dickie bows being connected to the belief in stability. The belief in stability is not stability, and the absence of stability is the same as chaos; the connection between American men and dickie bows is connected to chaos. The connection to chaos doesn't mean to be synonymous with chaos. It almost does, but not quite: the connection to chaos is the chaos of connection, and the chaos of connection is the immorality of connection. Immorality of connection is connection to morality. Connection to morality is not to morality, and not to morality is to immorality - the connection between American men and dickie bows is to immorality. To is toward. Toward is invasive. American men are a type of men. Type of men is men of universal. Men of universal is not of universal. Not of universal is universal. Dickie bows are a non-living style. Non-living style is living universal. Living universal is non-living. Non-living is living living. Living living is a history of life - history of life is life to history, and life to history is life being under threat. The invasion of immorality is not invasion of. Not invasion of is isolation from. Universal is morality. Connection is morality. The morality between morality and the threat of morality isolates from: isolates from is to group. The morality between morality and the enemy of morality to group: to group is not to, and not to is from. Morality between morality is not between morality. Not between morality and the enemy of morality from is between immorality and immorality from - between immorality and immorality from is from morality and immorality between. Between is inside. From morality and immorality inside is not morality and immorality inside. Not morality and immorality inside is morality and immorality outside. Morality and immorality outside is inside morality and immorality. Inside morality and immorality is morality and immorality being outside of inside. The American male who wears a dickie bow is morality and immorality both being scared of humanity."
8,Marnie Simpson is the exact same life force as the Battle of Hastings,social-issues," If Marnie Simpson, from the British reality TV show Geordie Shore, is how God is weaker than the universe, the universe is how God is better than Marnie Simpson: of course however, ""how"" God is better than Marnie Simpson is not God being better than Marnie Simpson. The opposite, of God not being better than Marnie Simpson is God being lesser than Marnie Simpson. And if the universe is God being lesser than Marnie Simpson, the universe is the source of the universe being lesser than Marnie Simpson: the source of the universe is power, which seems fair enough, which overall makes the absence of power power being less than Marnie Simpson. When the absence of power, is power being the absence of power than Marnie Simpson, Marnie Simpson is power not being the absence of power than the absence of power. The absence of power than the absence of power is absence than absence, and absence than absence is not than absence - not than absence is than. So what could it mean, if Marnie Simpson is power not being than? Not being than is than being. Than being is not being, and not being is being being - Marnie Simpson is power being being, which also makes Marnie Simpson power being power. Power is hierarchy: hierarchy being hierarchy is not being hierarchy, and not being hierarchy means the same as being equality - being equality means being balance. Being balance is being a consistency. Being a consistency is the consistency of nothing - the consistency of nothing is the consistency of chaos. The consistency of chaos, is the chaos of chaos; the chaos of chaos is chaos that belongs to chaos, and a chaos that belongs to chaos is the equivalent of a stability that can't belong to stability. A stability, which doesn't belong to stability is a stability which can belong to chaos - the ability of chaos to create stability. Chaos is the lack of repetition. The lack of repetition is the lack of history, and the lack of history is the lack of reference - the lack of reference is the lack of deference, and the lack of deference is the lack of leadership. Stability is symmetry. Symmetry is history, and history is change: change is reality to magic. Marnie Simpson is reality to reality that creates reality to magic: reality to reality is not to reality, and not to reality is to magic. To magic is magic not to. Magic not to is oppressed magic. Reality to magic is not to magic, and not to magic is to reality: to reality is reality not to, and reality not to is oppressed reality. Because magic is already oppressed, reality can't possess the identity of ""oppressed reality"". As a result, oppressed reality must be changed to free reality. Marnie Simpson is an oppressed magic that creates a free reality, which means that Marnie Simpson is an unfree freedom which is before a free restriction - a limitation which is before a freedom. A limitation, that's before a freedom is a freedom that can't be before a limitation - a freedom that is forced to be after a limitation is freedom being the force of after limitation. After limitation is before magic. The force before magic is reality; thus, when magic is real before magic, reality is magic after reality. Reality that's magic after reality is the real version of magic that's after reality. Real version is not version. Universal of magic is normal from magic. Marnie Simpson is a reality from magic that's before magic. Marnie Simpson is an example of magic that exists before magic has the actual ability to exist. Marnie Simpson and the Battle of Hastings are the history of the very same life force."
9,"Why it's important, that the Iraqi army goes to New York to talk to a New York therapist about Michelle Monaghan",social-issues," An Iraqi army, that goes to New York, and does so so as to talk to a New York therapist about the meaning of the actress Michelle Monaghan is a situation that gives me a lot of emotional warmth. The overall dynamic is fantastic, with each of the component parts all doing a fantastic job to complement each other – to juxtapose with each other. Of course, the Iraqi army would count as its own component (and presumably every hypothetical member of the Iraqi army – even if it means counting up to the tens of thousands, or more so). And then after the Iraqi army, next would seem to be the New York therapist – although this is where things become a bit murky, since one could always contend that the very city of New York deserves to count as its own component part. Like the Iraqi army, Michelle Monghan herself is an obvious component, of the dynamic, but that doesn’t do anything to resolve the issue of a possible equality that exists between the city of New York and the New York therapist – something which I will try to resolve now. In the overall dynamic, the Iraqi army is a visitor. The actress Michelle Monaghan is a problem (because her meaning is being disputed, therefore she can count as a problem). And then finally, the New York therapist (not any therapist in particular, but for the purpose of this discussion just the concept of a New York therapist) is the physical counter-part to the Iraqi army itself– a very interesting perspective, in and of itself. A visitor. A problem. And a balance to the visitor: how do or how can these three elements be interpreted? To start things off, a visitor is a guest, and a guest – it can be safe to assume – is an innocence. By definition, a problem isn’t innocent, and since it’s the guest who’s already claimed the meaning of innocence, the New York has something in common with Michelle Monaghan: they too lack the right to be innocent. The Iraqi army is innocent, however, it can’t be the case that both Monaghan and the New York therapist are the absence of innocence: thus, whilst it’s fair to say that the therapist isn’t innocent, they’re not a problem either, in effect being forced to become a solution that isn’t innocent – and so in effect a solution that is replicated. With the therapist being a replicated solution, the Iraqi army stands to be a solution that isn’t replicated: if a solution isn’t replicated, it’s a solution which is unique. So, as of this moment, how do things stand: the Iraqi army is a unique solution, a New York therapist is a typical solution, and Michelle Monaghan is a problem – a problem, a typical problem, and finally a unique problem. A problem, a typical problem and a unique problem are all the stages of a problem – ergo, all the stages of an evolution. Before, I said that the city of New York was a potential equal to the New York therapist: obviously, the city of New York can’t also discuss an issue with the Iraqi army (even one as meaningful and as satisfying as the meaning of the actress Michelle Monaghan), but can it at least rank as a type of role? As far as logic goes, the only role that New York can have is to be a setting. The Iraqi army certainly isn’t a setting, and neither are a New York therapist or Michelle Monaghan – but is it worthwhile to do this? A setting is a location, and a location is a destination: a destination is the opposite of the means to a destination, and the opposite of the means to a destination has a natural right to be a solution: so potentially, it’s the mere setting of New York which represents the actual innocence in the whole dynamic, whilst all the other component parts of the dynamic are types of a problem. Because of Michelle Monaghan, the true meaning of innocence is when the basic concept of a problem is the same as the inner workings of a problem, and therefore the basic concept of a solution exists outside of the inner workings of a solution. Because of Michelle Monaghan, the meaning of stability is to oppose the experience of stability."
10,Kinds of People You meet on Social Media Groups,social-issues," Humans have established several means of initiating conversation among themselves.  The atmosphere is mostly saturated with mutual relationships, business ideas, information, education, entertainment, religion and most of all technology.  The concurrent inventions in technology have transformed the pattern of group gathering and conversation. Such platforms as Facebook, whatsapp, snapchat, twitter etc. gives people the opportunity to create groups for several purposes. Caught in this web, people of different creeds and heterogeneous backgrounds are made to join these social media groups just for the single reason of getting information.  As things may turn out, owing to the individual difference factor, members of these groups take to different functions to give breathe life into the group. Some could be great informants, some jesters, crazy, some always acting confused and ready to ask questions about the least common piece of information. Sounds familiar right? Now let’s see where you belong; The Continuity announcer This group constitutes the group administrators. Often they are the ones who give first-hand information about the group’s major motive. He answers to most of the pressing questions.  Messages from management, the new business trend, the new product prices, the dress codes etc. are usually announced by these executive group members. Still in this category, you can find admins who are always ready to remove unrepentant noisemakers and give caution to fighters. Fund raisers This group of persons are great persuasive speakers. For one reason or the other, they make appeal for funds usually for some other person who is related to the group. They sound like…he is our brother, we did it before, and we can do it again… Back then in school, the easiest way to raise money from your peers and course mates is on the whatsapp class group. You only need to meet one of the influencers who ofcourse is a fund raiser. And as expected, the class responds positively and quick because they have mastered the tone of the pitch. The Hush type These group members are just in the group to scroll down the chats for information. They hardly make their presence known to other group members. They rather call a message source than throw a question to the group. Often, people in this category can be really busy people, introverts or coy. The busy ones sometime have the opportunity to go through the chat once or twice daily. The introverts try as much to avoid arguments and prefer to keep opinions to themselves than expressing it. Interestingly, they tend to capture every scenario in the group chat. The Jungle Cats This group category can be really troublesome. They talk back at every single comment made either directly or indirectly to them. Infact, they are ever ready to fall out with anyone who misbehaves; they can fight your fight and still come out victorious. They are habitual to using vulgar dictions and are loose to anger. However, this group of persons hardly keep positive image persona. Belonging to this group is not commendable. Business tycoons Among this social media groups are business men and women, boys and girls. They take advantage of the relationships they have established with the group members to introduce several online business trends. Usually, some of those shared messages come with commission; so the more groups they join, the more commissions they get. Ponzi schemes that took to trend in 2016/2017 came alive through social media and it spread really quick because of the activities of this group. You can always add yours ‘cos indeed they are many that words can’t just describe. Whichever category you belong, just make sure your personal image is positively represented. Always make an impact- a calm positive impact or a loud one. I just love the calm one; it makes your image persona irreplaceable."
11,Solution to yeast infection in women,social-issues," Enlightening yourself about candida infection is the primary and most significant step in curing this painful, annoying and relatively harmful chronic condition and taking concern over your health and well-being. Even though yeast infection also known by the terms of Candida, Monilia or Thrush is in fact a very common condition, (as three out of four women develop it at some point in their lifetimes), and it is little deliberated. Most individuals look at candida infection as an insincere condition that should be treated with creams and antibiotics while few are aware of its possibly risky problems. Yeast Infection is first and primarily an internal problem. Like most sustained conditions, there is never one root for this fungal problem and thus yeast infection cannot be permanently removed using prescriptions or creams that work lightly and fail to tackle the root factors that generate the formation of candida infection in the first place. The problem is that the common of yeast infection victims choose to leave it in the hands of others: Consultants, chemists, drug and over the counter productions. They willingly choose NOT to take responsibility for their candida condition, for their well-being and for their own body. If you suffer from yeast infection then you must have experienced the confusion stanched from conflicting advice and from excess information. Truthful information about vaginal yeast infection or any other type of candida infection is harder to come by than ever before, and nearly everyone has been misinformed at one time or another. Furthermore, to positively steer through today’s undeveloped confusing, dishonest and conflicting information, you're going to have to become a very perceptive and discriminating customer. Biochemical and toxic metal form up in the body can also lead to hormonal difference, Genetic variations, immune system failure, slower healing process, skin problems, reactions and nerve and brain damage. The occurrence of heavy metals in the body system like led, silver, mercury coming from food we eat, the air we breathe, medications comprises of 50% amalgam, creates an acidic and anaerobic (absence of oxygen) atmosphere that encourages candida yeast overgrowth. After there toxic metal overloads in the intestine, the intestinal coating yields additional secretion to chunk metals from which is existence absorbed into the blood stream. The problem is that this secretion yields an environment, which has absences of oxygen, therefore enhancing bacteria and fungi like organisms such as candida yeast to grow out of control. Also, candida muddles to heavy metals and overgrows as the body finishes a despairing effort to protect itself alongside heavy metal poisoning. In fact there are, provisional, discounted, harmless, natural and complete health practices and methods necessary to permanently abolish the signs of this infection and cure the root internal cause of yeast infection regardless of its kind, place, or level of severity. To successfully overcome candida infection, you need to be aware of the real source of yeast infection and be able to detect its indications. You need to know how to self-test and identify your candida condition, learn about the dietary principles necessary to preserve a candida free environment and about the complimentary treatments that will help you battle against the harmful effects and complications of your yeast infection. Through enlightening yourself about the phases you need to take in order to deal with your candida infection state and help your body heal itself and control the fungal overgrowth from the inside out you can and will eliminate the pain, irritation, disgrace and frustration related with this ailment and feel more in control. Moreover, as a side benefits you’ll be more energized, healthier and lively. You will enjoy enhanced digestion, enhanced vision, and healthier hair, skin and nails. Information is the Key. Hold it. Share it and use it and you’ll be yeast infection free. This article is based on the book, ""Yeast Infection No More"" by Linda Allen.

12,"If Sylvester Stallone gets the books, does Stone Cold Steve Austin get the pregnancy?",social-issues," Prior to an analysis, I would just like to lay out the question one more time (the first time having been the official title up ahead). ""If Sylvester Stallone gets the books, does Stone Cold Steve Austin get the pregnancy?"" I repeat the question, out of a curious fear of failing to analyse the question: curious, because since when should such a question engender ""any"" fear that’s inappropriate (sure, some or even many philosophical questions have the right to create some kind of fear, but surely none of the exact convoluted nature as the one currently being dealt with). With that in mind, it might as well be appropriate to begin an analysis through this kind of lens – a lens that pertains to a question’s ability to create fear with respect to its inherent inability to create fear. In general, a question is a mystery; a mystery that creates fear after the inability of that very same mystery to create fear is (or at least can be) the equivalent of a certainty that creates power before the ability of a different power to create power. A certainty is a lack of doubt, and as a lack of doubt qualifies as a power in its own right, a certainty that creates power before the power of a different power (or a mystery, since the opposite of a certainty has no choice but to be a mystery) to create power is a power that creates itself before the power of a mystery to create power – a power that creates itself before the power of a mystery to create power is a power that duplicates before the power of a mystery to duplicate. A power that repeats before the power of a mystery that duplicates is a power that repeats before the inability of a belief – a power that repeats before the inability of a belief is a power that repeats before the inability of a value. A power that repeats before the inability of a value, is a power that exists before the ability of a weakness; a power that exists before the ability of a weakness is the ability of a power before a weakness that exists. The ability of a power is a power of a power. A power of a power might as well be a power from a power, and a power from a power is just a continuum of magic: the continuum of whatever preceded the actual universe. In this instance, the weakness that exists is just the universe: as a result, the overall issue of the difference between Sylvester Stallone and Stone Cold Steve Austin when it comes to books and a pregnancy can potentially be given the ability to just mean the actual existence of magic before the universe. The existence of magic before the universe, needless to say, is the existence of magic before magic – the existence of magic before magic is magic before magic. And finally: what is magic before magic? Magic before magic can mean magic after reality: thus, the potential meaning of the difference between Sylvester Stallone and Stone Cold Steve Austin, when it comes to owning books and owning a pregnancy is that the universe is currently preparing itself for its transformation into literal magic."
13,"School Shootings, Wake Up America!",social-issues," Friday, May 18, 2018, became another very sad day within our school system. Another horrendous shooting that left at least ten people, mostly students dead and another ten with injuries. This time the weapon of choice was not an AR-15; it was a shotgun and a .38-caliber revolver. There are also reports of homemade explosive devices being discovered in the school and nearby. I have written two blog posts in recent weeks dealing with this terrible subject. Each is available in earlier posts below and offer my specific concerns and suggestions as to what specific actions should be taken by the U.S. Congress and state/local authorities. Today, Saturday, I have heard much rhetoric. First, I heard that a plan under consideration in Illinois is to ""Replace armed school officers with therapists."" You really don’t want to know my thoughts on this one!  Next, other recommendations centered on  ""hardening"" practically every school within the U.S. and doing things like securing all doors, and having only one entry point; installing metal detectors; performing bag checks; using door monitors; assigning police officers to premises; even one ""expert"" talked about assigning an armed police officer to each floor of school buildings.   Would such strategies be effective? Yes, but consider the length of time such ""hardening"" studies and implementation phases would take. Can you imagine the total costs that would be associated with each... Don’t kid yourselves, once the politicians got a look at those recurring expenses, the cost-cutting hatchet would be promptly at work. Never forget, 17 individuals were killed in Parkland and 20 in Sandy Hook. Starting back 19 years with the devastation that took place in Columbine, we have heard all types of promises from our political leaders, but these shootings continue! WAKE UP AMERICA! Direct your energies to your state and federal politicians: Demand effective actions be taken and insist that a specific timeline for completion be included. Here are my short-term recommendations: Do away with those politically correct ""gun free zones"" and signage. They are no deterrent to the shooter who is hell-bent on leaving a number of innocent victims behind. If anything, a message has been sent to the shooter that there is a minimal risk of return fire; Work with your local law enforcement agency, identify and arm a few highly qualified school teachers and staff/custodial personnel who are willing to accept this important responsibility. Each should be intensively trained and certified once the training period is over. Those taking on this critically important assignment should also be incentivized with a higher rate of pay or other acknowledgment. Learn from others; talk with administrators already arming select teachers and other personnel in schools such as Clarksville School District in Arkansas, two school districts in South Dakota, Highland, Utah, and the administrator of those 100 public school districts in Texas. (Note: Don’t let someone put the spin on my words. I am not advocating arming ALL teachers, etc. I want to be perfectly clear, ONLY train and arm those few highly qualified personnel who are willing to accept and perform this important responsibility.) Please pray for those who lost their lives and for their families. Also, pray that we will not have to deal with this deadly topic in the future. However, mark my words, if prompt, realistic and positive preventative measures are not put in place in the immediate future, . . . We will have another repeat!"
14,The Battle of Hastings in 1066 was reality's inability to worship Hollywood,social-issues," The opposite, of Hollywood being the means to protect the Battle of Hastings is British history being the means to end Hollywood – and British history being a weapon against Hollywood is the past being a weapon against the modern. A past that’s a weapon, against the modern is a weapon that’s a modern against the modern; a weapon that’s a modern against the modern is a weapon that’s a modern for the past. A weapon that’s modern, for the past, is a non-weapon that’s the past for the past. A non-weapon is a unification, and thus, a unification that’s the past for the past is separation that’s the modern for the past – so what’s a separation that’s the past for the past? A separation is a lack of power. The past is less than the present, and so the past is also a lack of power. A lack of power that’s the lack of power for the lack of power is a power that’s the lack of power for power – a power that’s the lack of power for power is a power that’s against itself for itself. A power that’s against itself for itself is a lack of power – or an origin of reality – that’s for itself so that it can one day be against itself; in other words, when reality creates Hollywood in Los Angeles in order to make sure that nothing stops the Battle of Hastings from happening, the actuality is that the history of reality is supporting itself so that it can then betray itself further down the line. The Battle of Hastings took place in 1066; so in actuality, in 1066 reality was loyal to itself but only on the basis that reality promised itself to create Hollywood later on in history – which makes Hollywood and the entire history of Hollywood movies and cinema into a planned betrayal against the Battle of Hastings (and it makes the Battle of Hastings into an accidental support for Hollywood). To be absolutely clear: the Battle of Hastings, in 1066 was reality trying to worship Hollywood, but obviously failing to do so. Hollywood is a logical source of worship. Movie stars, screenwriting, press junkets, etc: it’s obvious why reality wants to worship Hollywood, but then reality has to be patient – the Battle of Hastings perhaps represents this inability to be patient. In a general context, what I’m trying to get across is that conflict, and war and illness (including natural illness like cancer) can all be forms of when reality tries to worship things, but lacks the actual ability to do so. The Battle of Hastings, in 1066 was the result of reality trying to worship Hollywood before it had the actual ability to worship Hollywood"
15,Why Scarlett Johansson is the visual appearance of fairness,social-issues," If Scarlett Johansson can be a mother to all men, but not to all women, it’s fascinating to wonder if there’s something wrong. A mother to all men is not a natural mother. A non-natural mother is a supernatural mother (which isn’t the same as the supernatural, mind), and a supernatural mother is a real equal; so in other words, Scarlett Johansson has the ability to be a real equal to all men, but not to all women. The issue is no less solved, but is also no less fascinating needless to say. All men are all realities. And so are all women. All realities are no fictions, and no fictions are realities – realities is fiction. Johansson is still a real equal, but now it’s about understanding why Johansson can be a real equal to one type of fiction but not to another type of fiction. Will it help if the term ""real equal"" is dissected: a real equal is the same as a fictional hierarchy, and a fictional hierarchy is the same as an equality – an equality can just be the same as a reality. For Johansson, the meaning of being a reality – or just being real – is the meaning of only applying to one type of fiction and not another type of fiction. A type of fiction is a non-type of reality – a non-type of reality is a fictional type, and a fictional type is a real non-type. A real non-type is a type – Johansson applies to one type, but not another type. A real that applies to one type, and not another type, is a real that doesn’t apply to one uniformity and doesn’t apply to another uniformity: a real that doesn’t apply to a uniformity and doesn’t apply to a uniformity is a fiction that applies to a uniformity and applies to a uniformity – a fiction that applies to a uniformity and applies to a uniformity is a non-application of uniformity and an application of uniformity. A non-application of uniformity and an application of uniformity is a uniform application of hierarchy – a uniform application of hierarchy is a different non-application of reality. A different non-application of reality is a fictional different non-application; a fictional different non-application is a real non-application – a real non-application is a fictional application. And lastly: what is a fictional application? A fictional application is a fictional tool. A fictional tool is a real non-tool; a real non-tool is a tool that’s fiction. A tool that’s fiction is a tool that’s magic. A tool that’s magic is a means that’s magic. A means that’s magic is a condescension that’s magic – a condescension that’s magic is a fairness that’s real. A fairness that’s real is a reality that’s unfair – a reality that’s unfair is a magic that’s fair. Finally: a magic that’s fair is a fairness that is real. Scarlett Johansson is the visual appearance of fairness"
16,Gender Role in Starving Career Choice among Women,social-issues," It seems really psychologically out of place to think that some career choices are exclusively for a particular gender. As a matter of concern, many young persons, especially in college have been wired to reason in that manner; and eventually, what seems conventional in our world and indeed in formal education gives little or nothing to encourage young people to purse their career choice irrespective of what gender has to say about it. I also got my own pie piece, which indeed I did regret till date. I only wish to inspire young people with my story. At St Anthony, back then in college, towards the end of the last term in senior secondary level (II), we were called out to be addressed by the Dean of Students then. Later on, we were urged to choose our area of studies. While a good number chose the Arts and Humanities, the others kept on with the Sciences. The partition was generally broad in a sense, yes, but that was a basic way of categorizing the lecture curriculum, time table and a way of shaping the focus of student to a more specific direction. Later that day, Physics teacher, Mr. Godpower inquired into my career choice and later learnt that I wasn’t interested in the Sciences anymore. In his opinion, I was good in that area, ""I thought you would major as a nurse"" he said. I simply shock-off  his opinion with my head. He thought I was good in sciences, but totally I wasn’t. I was good in an area in science, but I got discouraged along the line. Now, there was one Mr. Alfred, who ate deep into the student body, so much that he knows the name and surname that each student bore, especially those he taught. He asked me to review my career choice after I announced to him that I wanted to study Petroleum Engineering in Higher education. To him, ""it is a masculine course"" and nothing any lady will dare. That was how, my focus was panned away from sciences entirely to the humanities, where the world feels is the backbone for career choice as far as the female gender is concerned. From my experience and from what I have gathered from other persons who have tasted of this same menace, I have come to understand that the following have contributed to starving career choices especially among the female gender. Personal and Societal Influences: While the society constructs and assign gender roles, you as a person voluntarily or not make the gender role effective by your choices. While the society is successful enough to define gender assign gender roles, the individual on the other hand is to decide which part to choose. So if the society says men are singled out exclusively to drive trucks and work in oil companies, the individual can choose to overrule such insight. Mentors, Role model, Advisers: These are other categories of gender and career choice influencers. Sometime, they talk you out of your personal choices into what they think is best for you. Their choices may not entirely be wrong, but it has a way of shaping your own career choice as a woman, especially. Socio-cultural Factor: It may sound totally out of place for a woman to wear a coverall, helmet and a safety boot in some societies. Infact, this outfit looks good on men than on women, frankly speaking. When the work outfit itself says it’s for men, which means that the place of women there in is very limited. What becomes a culture a work space or setting remains binding up to the emotion it spreads to the community around them. Conclusively, it is obvious that gender role is psychological and has a way of creeping into our daily choice from what we wear, to how we eat, to our color choices, our hair styles and cut etc. Talking about career choices is gender role at work in a broader sense. However, the rate at which it disrupts the career choices of the female gender is alarming and deserves serious attention."

20,"Are planets boring, if Daisy Ridley can't be egotistical when having sex?",social-issues," Daisy Ridley is a living being. Planets are the same. With egotism and sex not being living beings, it means that between the four components there is already a 50/50 split. Since planets can’t interact but Daisy Ridley can, Ridley can also be split from planets; planets are X, Ridley is Y. X is identical to sex and egotism. Thus, sex and egotism are X +. X is 1. X + is 2 – X + is X + + X +. As it seems a bit too convoluted, X + + X + needs to be changed into something else: let’s make it into X + 1 and X + 2 – or better yet, 1 X + and 2 X +. So as things stand: Y, X, 1 X + and 2 X +, in which Y and X are on the same side and 1 X + and 2 X + occupy the opposite side. Y can manipulate X, 1 X + and 2 X +. X can’t manipulate anything, and 1 X + and 2 X + can’t manipulate anything either – in effect, Y is superior, and the other three components are all inferior. Because superior and inferior shouldn’t be replicated terms – they should each only be possessed once – inferior needs to be given to planets. The reason being that since 1 X + and 2 X + are replicants of each other, it wouldn’t be physically possible to give either the nature of inferior without having to give it to the other. So with Daisy Ridley now being superior, planets being inferior, where does that leave sex and egotism? Neither can be the same identity. I suppose a fair way to proceed would be to say that sex and egotism are both the inability to judge and the ability to judge – thus, Daisy Ridley is superior, planets are inferior, and sex and egotism are the two aspects that have the ability to be absent and present because of the difference between Ridley and planets. In normal terms, egotism is superior to sex because whereas sex always involves an element of egotism, egotism can have nothing to do with sex (you can feel perfectly free to disagree however); in this case however, egotism can’t be superior to sex because that violates Daisy Ridley’s ability to be superior. For planets to be inferior – and therefore boring – Daisy Ridley needs to be in a position where she can have sex without the ability to be egotistical. I don't know about you, but I find that idea in and of itself far more interesting and far more useful to the human condition than anything to do with Star Wars"

1,Should I teach the Taliban to teach the Bush administration to teach the Iraq War to be a father to the actress Talitha Bateman?,social-issues," If I say ""in my mind"", I create the problem of presuming that subjectivity can follow objectivity. That objectivity – which means accuracy – actually has the ability to be betrayed; since when should that be the case? Well, if ever there was a time to illustrate that such a thing is possible, it might as well be now. In recent time, I’ve arrived at an adequate and satisfying concept, in regards to my perception of the my disposition in regards to the actress Talitha Bateman: namely, that I am the only unreal force that exists in the universe in order that Bateman can be the only force in the universe which is real – I am the literal manifestation of absence, and Bateman is the literal manifestation of presence (and nothing else in the universe has the ability to imitate either myself or Talitha Bateman). And then there’s the Iraq War, from 2003. I reference the Iraq War, because of a pressing need I feel to make use of the sense that I’m an absence to Bateman’s presence. Giving my power to the Iraq War, by letting it borrow my right to be a father to Talitha Bateman, ought to seem like enough. In case it isn’t, is it then counter-productive to just let the Bush administration teach the Iraq War how to be a father to Talitha Bateman (I suppose if the Iraq War were replaced with Las Vegas, that would probably do the trick, but since I’ve chosen the Iraq War that leaves me in a state of doubt over the Bush administration); to just have the Bush administration oversee the Iraq War seems wrong – it might not be the actual answer, however, it makes me feel less dissatisfied if I let the Taliban come to the aid of the Bush administration. Without the Taliban, my exact feeling is that just having the Bush administration teach the Iraq War how to be a father to Talitha Bateman is to exhibit pointlessness – if the Iraq War has the ability to be taught, then why should it be the Bush administration that does it? But then again, the very idea of the Iraq War being a substitute for myself in and of itself is pointless – so I’m therefore dealing with the problem of questioning a natural redundancy after a contrived redundancy. A natural redundancy is a contrived meaning. A contrived redundancy is a natural meaning. To question a contrived meaning after a natural meaning makes perfect sense – ergo, the Taliban have some sense of excuse to be an overseer of the Bush administration. But can I teach the Taliban? That’s the real issue at hand. If I interject, and train the Taliban to train the Bush administration to train the Iraq War to be a father to Talitha Bateman, aren’t I just then becoming the source of antagonism? To be the absence, I have to respect the need for a substitute; however, since Bateman is the presence, that means that I’m in the privileged position to eternally manipulate any substitute – in other words, the way in which objectivity can tolerate being betrayed by subjectivity is if the subjective has no awareness of the ability to betray"
2,Is philosophy the way that nightclubs fool Dick Cheney into not protecting sarcasm from nightclubs?,social-issues," It may not be logical, but it seems natural to associate nightclubs with sarcasm. Sarcasm has many variations, and many different types of mode, but as an abstract idea I don’t see a reason to not think it illogical to connect sarcasm to nightclubs – which is what gets me to my next point. I have a suspicion, that since nightclubs and sarcasm have provoked a need to be connected to each other, that that means that nightclubs and sarcasm are actually enemies of each other. Or, at the very least, that nightclubs is an enemy of sarcasm or that sarcasm is an enemy of nightclubs. With this in mind, it’s possible that either sarcasm or nightclubs has concocted a means to destroy the opposite: create philosophy, and use philosophy as a way to fool Dick Cheney into not protecting either sarcasm or nightclubs from either sarcasm or nightclubs. Should it be Dick Cheney? Cheney suits the formula, inasmuch that he’s career represents corruption, and the Bush administration represents corruption (although to be fair, can there ever be such a thing as a US administration let alone a Republican administration which doesn’t represent corruption?). On the condition, that Cheney has been fooled by philosophy – with philosophy just being a device by either nightclubs or sarcasm – the natural response is so what. Because assuming that any of this is true, what on earth could anyone – let alone Dick Cheney – do about the predicament? Redundancy in the face of magic is the ultimate cliché – and in all seriousness, that could just be the reality, as in that feeling redundant because of magic is just downright silly and incorrect. From the perspective that all of reality is magic, all opposition is possible. As a result, on the condition that nightclubs are hurting sarcasm by fooling Dick Cheney into believing in philosophy, the consequence is that Cheney has the ability to pull the rug out from either nightclubs or sarcasm – probably nightclubs, if you ask me – and to prevent any further destruction to either nightclubs or sarcasm. For what it’s worth: the reverse of nightclubs destroying sarcasm by getting Cheney to believe in philosophy is philosophy being the absence of belief in Cheney as a way to connect sarcasm to nightclubs. The connection between nightclubs and sarcasm is the means to destroying both – since both are incorrect – but the irony to this is that the means to the mutual destruction has been the result of the solution having imitated the problem. Are you taking the piss Mason?"
3,Why all British businessmen should lick the house of George Clooney (in case you're wondering),social-issues," Nostalgia is always bittersweet. It’s necessary but without use. Being sentimental is supposed to be a sweet part of the human condition, but at the same time it’s never for a practical purpose. Which brings me to my solution. Seeing as how nostalgia is useless yet inevitable, why not counter the double-edged sword with the exact reverse: all British businessmen licking the house of George Clooney. In contrast, to the important uselessness of nostalgia, the house of George Clooney being licked by all British businessmen would be a practical and tangible reality which is arbitrary to the extreme. Of all ideas, there can’t be many others that are more arbitrary than George’s house getting licked by all businessmen with a British origin. Sure, there will be lots of other ideas in the grand scheme of things, but there can’t be lots of other ideas relative to nostalgia – it certainly doesn’t seem necessary to prove otherwise (or at least the freedom from proof deserves freedom from proof). If it means obstructing the UK economy, and if it means that British female supermodels can’t be sexy to American men, or that American men can’t use their accent to get laid by British female supermodels, so be it. George’s house is George’s house, and if it’s physically possible to get all British businessmen (and women) to visit George’s house, then that should be top priority. Just one question remains: is it vital to the equation, that all British businessmen visit George’s house at the same time, or is it not vital at all? It probably comes down to one of two ways. Either all British businessmen go at once, and have to make the effort to give each other space, or they go one at a time in the same space of time. Between the two, I think I prefer the option that they all just visit at the same exact time, as that’s the option of the two which most reflects the original point of view that the point of the whole experience is to serve as a tangible reaction to nostalgia. That’s all I can offer on the matter. I wish I could offer more, but I don’t want to risk sounding pointless and repetitive"
4,"Disney Princesses, and the threat of women who own non-alcoholic glass bottles",social-issues," In everyday life, it’s perfectly acceptable for a woman to own alcohol. Women can have jobs, just like men, and they can run for office and they can pay for men just as much as men pay for women. As a result, anyone who happens to find a bottle of alcohol in a woman’s fridge has no reason to be offended. Where things get mysterious however, is if a person happens to find just a bottle in a woman’s fridge. The bottle doesn’t have to be a type of alcohol, but can just be a bottle that has a certain size. Is it just me, or would this ruin the idea of the Disney Princess? Just to clarify: the hypothetical scenario that’s in question has nothing to do with alcohol, but is actually just about what happens when someone finds a glass bottle in a woman’s fridge. For some very strange reason, the notion of a glass bottle in a woman’s fridge has a bearing on the Disney Princess – and what’s even stranger is that the connection between the two seems to derive from the clarification that alcohol has nothing to do with the scenario. Once I remove alcohol, from the equation, I’m then left with a surreal impression. If a person finds a glass bottle – and just a glass bottle – in a fridge which that person ""knows"" is owned by a woman, the perhaps inevitable effect is to then ponder either Ariel, Aurora, Belle or Cinderella (Snow White would presumably be included in the scenario, although I’ve yet to go over the scenario and be reminded of the character). I like Ariel, and I like Belle and I like Aurora. I’m also into horror films, so I have a true perspective on the meaning of Ariel, and Belle and Aurora. While I don’t exactly dislike the idea, that either Ariel or Aurora are subject to glass bottles in women’s fridges, I’m also aware that this isn’t necessarily something that Ariel or Aurora should be proud of. If a woman has a bottle, in her fridge, and the bottle happens to be made out of glass and to be a certain size, it’s hardly appropriate and logical that seeing that bottle should invoke Ariel or Aurora, or any other Disney Princess. If the bottle is a type of alcohol, the experience should be a balance – it’s when the bottle isn’t alcohol yet is made of glass that the thought of a Disney Princess has importance. In summation: glass bottles that contain alcohol aren’t a threat to Disney Princesses, but glass bottles that don’t contain alcohol are a threat Just don’t ask me why"
5,"Should all members of the Russian government grow long black hair, and fear neither the British public or American people?",social-issues," The main point of this question, is that long black hair has no remit. It’s an obvious – or fairly obvious – concept that the more something replicates, and the more that it becomes owned and the more that it becomes a defining part of reality the more values that it loses. Long black hair is an interesting example however, in terms of going against this rule. Unlike many other things, long black hair is something which is obscure. Or perhaps it isn’t, and that’s just an easy mistake that one can make with long black hair. I can picture a world population with long black hair. Men and women having long black hair all across the world, and though I’m aware enough to realise how eerie it would be, at the same time I have no ability to doubt the moral urgency of the idea. Regardless of age, gender, ethnicity and profession, for me, it’s a case where long black hair is always a privilege – and a type of privilege that needn’t worry about the standard or rule that value is predicated on censorship. Long ago, I had a perception that people can avoid violent impulses by holding up their arm and hand to their stomach level: not both arms, just one. By doing this, people would somehow become exempt from feeling the urge to do incorrect things – long black hair might be an identical truth. Seeing all members of the Russian government have long black hair would be a moral sight. But what does that actually mean – a moral sight? What is a moral sight? A moral sight can be changed into a moral image, that’s a given, but then a moral image is just as elusive. A moral image is a moral structure, and a moral structure is a divide between morality and structure – the division between morality and structure is a morality which has no style. A morality which lacks style is a style which has morality – a style which has morality is a reality where morality is a literal possession. A literal possession is a physical dimension. The unification between morality and a physical dimension is a physical dimension which has no ability to invade or trespass anywhere. Which is funny, considering my earlier observation about long black hair being a force of nature which seems to overrule the notion that value is at odds with replication. The long and short of it: all Russian government officials should grow long black hair, and not worry about what the US administration thinks, or what the United States military thinks, or what CNN or what Fox News thinks. And while they’re at it, they can ignore the worst institutions of all: the British public and American people"
6,Do the atoms of US presidents want extra-terrestrials to play with themselves?,social-issues," An extra-terrestrial is a power that belongs to humanity. Extra-terrestrials are a way in which people motivate themselves, and a way in which people find excuses to continue their lives and to continue their functions. In particular, extra-terrestrials can give sanity to the office of the United States presidency. In objective terms, no presidency is necessary, and neither is any congress, or any senate or parliament – but such things can be concocted into being functional because of the sense that reality outside of Earth is important. Give value to elsewhere, and the natural effect is that the internal has the right to become a structure. By giving value to extra-terrestrials, people earn the right to value the US presidency. However, a very curious idea, and a very curious concern is when the atoms of a United States president can want extra-terrestrials to play with themselves. To get straight to the point: if the atoms of a US president want extra-terrestrials to play with themselves, my personal perception of the issue is that the atoms have actually become the antagonist of reality (which is quite ironic, given the past issue to do with Gene Hackman protecting atoms from metaphors). Moreover, if extra-terrestrials can be subject to this abuse, is it pointless and futile to offer extra-terrestrials psychiatric help? The reason I ask, is because I have the perception that a human who offers psychiatric help to an extra-terrestrial because of such behaviour from atoms is the balance to the tyranny of the nuance and depravity of such behaviour. The idea of psychiatric help is supposed to be an infinite source of calm, and a true source of relief: if anything, the value of atoms – from a United States president – wanting extra-terrestrials to play with themselves is that it’s the ability to test the long-term value of psychiatric help. The extra-terrestrial creates the presidency, which makes the presidency a reaction. The presidency creates psychiatry, which makes psychiatry a reaction. The atoms create the abuse, which makes the abuse a reaction – the original creator is the end creator. In some sense, atoms being the creator that bookends the entire situation would seem to suggest that the entire situation is insurmountable. Of course though, the infinity of reality demands that humanity finds a way to overcome this."
7,Can the American suburban housewife beat Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar?,social-issues," The dynamic of this scenario, is that a threat which isn’t supposed to be a threat is an actual threat. The basis of the threat is that its existence is predicated on its existence being unreal. An existence which behaves like this – which is based on being unreal – is a non-existence which isn’t based on being real; far more intriguing. A non-existence is magic. A magic which is therefore rooted in being unreal is a magic which is based on being magic – note the disparity though between this and what I said about Cristina Raines with regards to The Sentinel. The latter is magic being magic, the former are magic from magic. Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar are a communication from magic. Magic – presumably situated outside the universe – has deemed it necessary to communicate a version of itself to the universe, so that reality can then understand the point of the communication. If magic can send itself, this means by default that reality can’t send itself. Truth is the inability to communicate oneself. The inability to communicate self is the ability to communicate anti – the ability to communicate anti is the inability to communicate. In an earlier article, I discussed the American suburban housewife, and the idea that the American suburban housewife has the ability to not communicate as an ability. The ability to not communicate as an ability is the ability to communicate as an inability – magic is the ability to communicate, reality is the ability to communicate as a flaw. So in essence, the difference between reality and magic as represented by Heyman, Lesnar and the American suburban house – with the representation possibly made possible by the Alison Parker from the very end of The Sentinel – is that whereas magic can just do something, reality can only do that same something as a weakness. Heyman and Lesnar do things. The American suburban housewife can also do things, but only from the perspective that the imitation is corrupt. Switch the paradigm, and the outcome is that reality can’t do something, and magic can destroy the weakness as a power. But is this virtuous? The ability to end end is the ability to not end – in this scenario, the ability to not end is derivative of just absence. It’s nothing but normal absence that has invoked maintenance, which to me seems like the ideal state of reality (or should I say magic?). With this being the case – the ideal being the censored version of magic – it might be the objective of the universe to undo the paradigm that power has value on the basis that reference has value. To give magic the freedom to not lecture itself, it’s necessary to undo the value of reference (the American suburban housewife). It all sounds good and rosy, except for the idea that the value of reference isn’t the same as the mere fact of reference. The value of reference is the non-communication of value. The non-communication of value is the communication of no value. The communication of no value is the communication of symmetry. The communication of symmetry is the symmetry of non-communication – the symmetry of non-communication is a difference of communication. A difference of communication is a non-communication of difference – a difference of non-communication is a symmetry of communication. The American suburban housewife can beat Paul Heyman, and it can beat Brock Lesnar, because it’s the American suburban housewife and not Heyman and Lesnar which has the ability to be a symmetry of communication – the ability to exist without having to be referenced."
8,My desire to hug Cristina Raines,social-issues," At the very end, of The Sentinel, a constant is created. The exact meaning of the constant is that it’s a constant which is valid despite being dependent. A constant which is valid, is a difference which is magic, and then a magic which is different which is dependent is a truth which is universal which is free. A truth is magic, without doubt. And then when that magic is given a ""free"" freedom, the magic is transformed into a forced force. Suffice to say, a forced force is not necessarily more interesting than a free freedom, but it is perhaps more helpful. A forced force, of course, is nothing but freedom. And seeing as how magic can be equated to freedom, the overall state at the very end of the 1977 movie is nothing more complex than just a magic that’s itself. A magic which is magic is a reality which isn’t a reality – a reality which is magic (and this is hopefully where the article’s point begins to emerge). From a point of view, the very end of The Sentinel – which sees Alison Parker act as a sentinel in an official capacity – is actually the literal state of magic being real. In general, movies, art and stories are the magic of representation. They are the magic of metaphor, and they are the magic of symbolism. What all those things aren’t however is actual magic (Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals, Chinatown and The Exorcism of Emily Rose all feel like magic, but they are not magic); the very end of The Sentinel is an outright departure from this rule. With her face directed at the window, and with the camera panning the back of her body and the back of her head, Alison Parker – and by extension, Cristina Raines – is now in a movie that she exists outside of. Her head, and her body are now a state which has never been inside of or been part of anything else, and yet the state is derivative of the rest of the movie – Alison Parker is now an origin which is after an origin. An origin which is after an origin, is a constant which is before a constant – a truth that has a hierarchy inside of itself. Between Cristina Raines and myself – Raines being connected to a constant and myself being connected to a constant – there exists the difference between the US and the UK. There also exists the difference between my era and the era when Raines made The Sentinel. There exists the difference when it comes to accent, and there exists the difference of status (Raines has had status, whereas I’ve essentially never had any status). So many differences, yet there exists a common thread: Raines played Alison Parker, who embodies a constant, and I am a true representative of reality. Can a press conference become a scientist? Do planets need teddy bears? Did atoms create the American accent as a way to understand the Roman Empire? Can the Vietnam War write a movie review? Who else is asking these questions? My gravitation toward Cristina Raines is the very end of The Sentinel; my desire to hug Cristina Raines is my desire to reflect the magic at the end of The Sentinel. In 2018, after the Iraq War, after 9/11 and after every general election since 1977, Alison Parker is still in the hotel apartment she’s in at the end of The Sentinel, still dressed as a nun – of course, it isn’t true but I would like to make it true. I want to help Alison Parker be the constant that she deserves to be, and to do so by being the representative of reality to Cristina Raines. By giving Cristina Raines a hug, I can protect Alison Parker’s right to remain alone, in her apartment room."
9,"Neve Campbell's personality, and if it should be used by long black hair to unite reality",social-issues," For me, long black hair is the crown jewel of reality – both for men and for women. Nothing beats long black hair (not even Jack Mason). Of course, this isn’t meant to imply that having long black hair exempts one from immorality (although one is free to make that argument), however, it’s as if long black hair is the constant against the history of the universe. The history of the Roman Empire. The history of the United States military. The history of the NFL. The history of architecture, going from the Renaissance to Italian Rationalism. The history of cinema. The history of schooling, and the history of British culture etc – none of it can hold a candle to the sheer basic fact of long black hair. Which is why I find it an interesting topic: assuming that it would honour the personality, of Neve Campbell, to be used by long black hair to unify the universe, would it also honour long black hair to be the user of Neve Campbell’s personality? Does Neve Campbell have the right to have her personality used by long black hair to improve the universe? Long black hair goes with Neve Campbell. Historically, Campbell has had long black hair (Scream 3, Closing the Ring, Scream 4, The Company etc). However, what’s striking – or perhaps striking – is that when the idea of long black hair using Neve Campbell’s personality is developed, the effect isn’t exactly inspiring. Conversely, the effect of the idea is negative – specifically leaning away from neutral. After seeing interviews of Campbell, over the years, she seems like a very normal individual (which of course then begs the question as to why it’s Campbell and not somebody else who’s the topic of discussion). Neve Campbell is connected to black, because of the Scream franchise, and the Scream franchise is about the ability to survive being connected to visual appearance – the constant value of a visual. That explains the connection between Campbell and long black hair unifying the universe, but that still leaves the matter as to whether or not the connection between Campbell and the universe is intrinsic to the connection between long black hair and the universe. Long black hair can be claimed to be a constant value, but it can’t be proved to be a constant value – the only factor that can be illustrated is the logic of the connection between Campbell and the connection between long black hair and the universe. Even if the connection between long black hair and the universe isn’t dependent on Neve Campbell, it’s fair to say that Campbell’s personality has the right to be used by long black hair due to the sheer fact of the connection that’s now been made."
10,Can the Taliban transport the universe into opinions from 1997?,social-issues," Categorize the Taliban as X, the universe as Y and opinions from 1997 as Z. For X to move Y, Y has to become the inability to move X. For X to move Y into Z, Z has to become the opposite of X and Y. The opposite of X and Y is the opposite of the ability to move and the inability to move – the opposite of the ability to move and the inability to move is the ability to move or the inability to move. The ability to move or the inability to move is the power of weakness (the power of weakness is the weakness of no power – matter of fact power). Since it’s Z which is the power that’s matter of fact (real), it’s X which is the power that isn’t real. Y isn’t a power, and so it is a weakness. Z is real power. X is an unreal power, and Y is a weakness that can be either real or unreal. A weakness that can be real or unreal is a power that can’t be real or unreal – a power that can’t be real or unreal is a disingenuous power. Z is a real power. X is an unreal power, and Y is a deceptive power. An unreal power is not a deceptive power, but it isn’t a real power either – the Taliban must therefore be neither a deceptive or sincere power. A power which is neither sincere or deceptive is a weakness which is both (the Taliban are the same as the universe, only that it’s the Taliban and not the universe that can be a good weakness). A good weakness is a power. A deceptive power is a weakness, and a real power is a weakness: a power, a weakness and a weakness is balance. If the ratio were reverse, and it was the power that was replicated and not the weakness, then that would mean that the weakness would have no basis to withstand the power. Between the Taliban, the universe and the event of the Taliban controlling the universe, it’s the Taliban which is meant to be withstood. In the real world, the Taliban are the source o friction: the issue now is whether the United States should end itself so that the universe can have the right to battle against the Taliban"
11,When a haunted house goes to war with sexiness,social-issues," If a haunted house and sexiness go to war with each other, the visual nature of the battle is hard to imagine. A haunted house is a supernatural house. As a result, the house is a house that can do anything. Sexiness is also a supernatural force, except that it isn’t conscious. So in the one corner, there’s a force whose power is predicated on its inability to be sentient, and then in the other corner there’s a force whose power is based on the redundancy of its identity being known. The haunted house is the value of a pointless identity – sexiness is the value of no consciousness. In typical fashion, the value of a pointless identity is the non-value of a meaningful non-identity (the value of identity). And the value of no consciousness is the non-value of consciousness. So, as things stand: a haunted house has the potential to be the very image of equality, and sexiness has the potential to be an immobility of hierarchy. The image of equality vs. the non-movement of hierarchy. The non-movement of hierarchy is a level playing field of movement (an appropriate way to describe sexiness, as it happens). Meanwhile, the very image of equality is a hierarchy of absence (a very impressive attribute): so what happens then, if equal movement goes up against an absence that has a structure amidst itself? There doesn’t appear to be anything wrong with equal movement, but I’ll implement a reverse regardless: equal movement is the same as a hierarchy of immobility (and yet prior to this, it was established that sexiness was an immobile hierarchy). Whereas an immobile hierarchy is just akin to a structure that simply can’t move, a hierarchy of immobility implies a force of nothing that has a structure amidst itself. So there it is: sexiness and a haunted house don’t need to go to war with each other, since they’re the exact same identity. (Or could the opposite be the truth?) An absence that has structure seems like an unfair structure. Absence is supposed to be without structure, which means that when absence has structure it is the same as the opposition to structure having structure – the support for symmetry having structure. In technical terms, the support for symmetry can never be identical to just symmetry, and therefore the support for symmetry is forced to be no symmetry – absence is always structure, irrespective of anything. Absence is inevitable. Structure is inevitable. Structure is discrepancy – discrepancy is inevitable. A discrepancy that’s inevitable is a discrepancy that’s oppressed. A discrepancy that’s oppressed is an oppression that’s oppressed – an oppression that’s oppressed is a good thing. A structure of a good thing is a bad thing – a good thing shouldn’t be the force to annihilate the bad thing, and so the logical thing is for a haunted house and sexiness to go to war with one another"
12,3 Ideas for a Romantic Date,social-issues," You finally work up the courage to ask your love interest out on a date, and they said yes! You’re ecstatic, but hold up… what should you do? How will you woo your date? Suppose you do the wrong things and your date doesn’t like you anymore, leaving you single for the rest of your life? Ok, that’s just your anxiety talking. However, making a good first impression is key, so here are three ideas you could use to totally wow your date. First idea: Go on a long walk. Scenery is key here, especially when making a first impression. A romantic date is all about focusing on and learning about each other. There is nothing better than going sightseeing together, no distractions, just you and your date. The best places to take a walk might be an evening stroll through your city’s park, on the beach, or a trail in a national park. Time of day is extremely important, as well as the weather, when deciding where to walk. Do some research beforehand about the best trails to take your date, and the ones lead that to the best spots. One of the most romantic spots are ones on a hill, overlooking the city. Seeing streetlights from afar is magical. Second idea: play games and puzzles. Nothing is sexier than suspense, and one of the best ways to keep your partner in suspense is through games, like treasure hunts. With clues strewn about, your partner will have to be constantly guessing what is awaiting him or her at the end of the game. Treasure hunts are not the only games you can play though. You could even have a custom made jigsaw puzzle, with the finished piece a picture of both of you, or anything else that is significant to you both. This would of course be after you have more of an established relationship.  The jigsaw puzzle is also a very creative way of proposing to your loved one. Final idea: touch. Where, how and if you touch depends on a lot of factors, including how much you know the person, and how long you’ve been dating. Even if you’ve known this person for less than an hour, touch is still important to build rapport and trust. Don’t get it wrong, touch is not just about the possibility of a future sexual encounter.  It is about more than that. Touching in platonic areas can build trust and friendship.  The best places to touch your partner are the areas where you would touch a platonic friend.  This shows your date that you are interested in getting to know them more. These places include the upper and lower arm, the small of the back, the upper back, and the shoulder. Don’t hold them there for too long. Once some familiarity is accomplished, then you can touch your partner longer, and also in other more intimate places like the face, neck, and stomach. If you are very familiar with your partner, you could make a game out of touch. You play this game by having pieces of paper with the areas to be touched, plus a description of how you should touch them. Place them in a hat, and pick them up blindly. The acts should be mild though, more of a tease. No body part is off limits."
13,"Should I wear a three piece suit for the American people, so that nobody ever needs a job?",social-issues," It goes without saying, that the basic idea of wearing a three piece suit is horny. The excessive clothing is horny, and the prospect of looking in the mirror while wearing one is horny. However, can the three piece suit become a kind of excessive power? Jobs are a nuisance. Even if somebody supports jobs, they’d be disingenuous to deny that jobs aren’t the ideal routine of life; a true work-life balance is one that doesn’t involve jobs. With that being the case, it feels appropriate – and perhaps horny, but perhaps not – to try to tie jobs and three piece suits together – to make the ambition of one into the argument against the other. Making jobs redundant is great, but in the long run, it’s just as important that if jobs go, they go in a particular way. It’s the proposition, in this case, that the way to go is to not just have me wear a three piece suit, but to have me wear a three piece suit for all of the American people. If a person wears a three piece suit, for just a particular person, the effect is usually standard; the very DNA of culture and society is such behaviour. However, if a person wears a three piece suit for an entire population – in this case the population of the United States – then the effect stops being standard in any context, and becomes unequivocally unique. The real heart of the issue, is to do with testing the power of the experience of the three piece suit. Suppose jobs had nothing to do with this. Suppose the issue were just to do with me wearing a three piece suit for the American people, and that’s all there is to it: obviously, the power still exists, but is the power undermined by the state of jobs being lost? If jobs are a prearranged part of the scenario, does that hurt the concept of me wearing a three piece suit for everyone who lives in the United States? To be perfectly frank, jobs and three piece suits bear no intrinsic relation to each other. Yes, three piece suits are the backbone of capitalist routine, but even so, three piece suits have all their horniness and all their stimulation without any such routine – so this suggests that no, putting jobs into the equation has no bearing on the status of me wearing a three piece suit for the American people. Jobs can go, but in no way or shape or form does their going need to be at the expense of the sensual and sexual nature of me wanting to dress up for the American people. That being said: it would be an honour and a true privilege to do away with jobs by feeling squeezed and tight for all Americans"
14,When a British Prime Minister talks about Best of the Best 2,social-issues," In reality, any British Prime Minister thinks about Best of the Best 2 and nothing should come of it. However, it’s also reality that when a British Prime Minister thinks about the 1993 martial arts sequel the presumption of right is not a uniform presumption of right. A presumption of right, is a right that has the right to not be accounted for. The right simply exists. The presumption of the right is nothing but the sheer existence of the right. Therefore, if a presumption of a right is not a uniform presumption of a right, what this actually means is that the right has to be accounted for – which is a discrepancy. What good is a right, if the right is scrutinized? It’s not physically possible to scrutinize a right, because otherwise the thing that’s being scrutinized has no right to be scrutinized as a right, but as something else. If a force of nature gets scrutinized, that by default should mean that the force of nature hasn’t the ability to be scrutinized with the identity of a right: the identity of the force that’s being scrutinized should be a different type of identity. And if it is, how is it still logical to scrutinize? If the force that’s doing the scrutinizing already knows that the force that’s being scrutinized has been deemed unworthy (because it isn’t the identity of a right), then what is the point in conducting scrutiny in the first place? In essence then, when a British Prime Minister talks about Best of the Best 2, the meaning is an exempt logic that is supposed to vindicate its state of being exempt. An exempt logic is a logic that’s away. A logic that’s away is a presence that’s irrational – it’s a literal state of violence that’s supposed to justify its need to be exempt. The need to be exempt is the freedom from presence. Ergo, when a British Prime Minister talks about Best of the Best 2, the actual effect of this state is a literal state of violence that has no choice but to be absent – a state of stability that has the ability to share itself. When a British Prime Minister – David Cameron, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson or Winston Churchill – talks about Brakus fighting Tommy, or about the truly tragic nature of the death of Travis Bickley, the real meaning of this reality, and the real meaning of this experience is that an actual state of perfection has an ability – an actual state of nothing has nothing. When a British Prime Minister talks about Best of the Best 2 (one of the best movies ever made), violence has violence. Which is absolutely insane. It should make no sense for violence to have anything, yet that’s what’s going on. Violence has the ability to possess violence. Out of curiosity, the reverse of violence having violence is stability not having stability: but what would that look like? Stability is the absence of movement. Thus, the mystery is what it looks life if the absence of movement possesses the absence of movement – naturally, the actual answer is elusive, but already one should have the feeling of being in awe. The picture of immobility controlling immobility is a spectacle, regardless of details"
15,"Is it correct, if it's meant to be enough that the United States feels the balls of a creepy hallway?",social-issues," In general, I have no problem with the United States feeling the balls of a creepy hallway. The United States component works. Feeling balls works. And a creepy hallway works. What’s intriguing however – though not necessarily to a forced degree – is what happens if the word ""feel"" is replaced with the word ""tickle"". For some reason, implementing this change has a drastic effect. In the original version of the scenario, the function of feeling a creepy hallway’s balls may not be perfect, but its effect can hardly be accounted for as counter-productive; the same can’t be said of the subsequent version. The act of tickling is a derivative of the mere act of feeling. And that’s what makes the effect of the change all the more puzzling. Overall, the basic idea of tickling is cringe; tickling isn’t a presumed reality, but is something that’s near or almost near to elaborate. And yet, this is still the case in an event that involves the United States and a creepy hallway. Is it incorrect, if it’s too much to ask that that the United States tickles the balls of a creepy hallway, as opposed to just feeling the balls of a creepy hallway? Subtract the overall situation – meaning that there is no United States, and there is no creepy hallway – and then replace the former component with Jerry and replace the latter component with a horse: the new scenario now reads as ""Jerry tickles the balls of a horse"". Say the new sentence, out loud, and then ask yourself – what is the effect? Is it nice and seemly, if Jerry tickles the balls of a horse? After saying the sentence to myself, my honest response is that the scenario is still unseemly but not perhaps for the same reason. The truth might just be that any scenario that involves tickling something’s balls will always be dysfunctional – assuming that this is the case, is it offensive? Any nation, and any creepy hallway that interact with each other should have access to any part of reality. However, practice suggests otherwise. The power of the balls, and the power of the United States can always act as a weapon to the act of tickling, but to me that just seems like an insult to the United States and to the balls. There is one silver lining however. If the hallway isn’t creepy, but is just a hallway, the effect is also drastic (albeit differently); perhaps the ultimate point is that when a creepy hallway has its balls felt by a nation – not just the United States, but any nation – there is no rule that says that the situation has the ability to be exempt from individual details. A given detail always represents its truth, and there is no way to manipulate this truth"
16,Did reality create the Montreal Screwjob as a way to explain the inability to fly?,social-issues," Did reality create the Montreal Screwjob as a way to explain the inability to fly? Humans don’t have the ability to fly. Machines let humans fly, but in the grand scheme of things this isn’t a compensation for the lack of the actual ability to fly. It isn’t an unfair concept, that reality can be offended by something. Indeed, that reality can be its own arbiter of judgement seems like a very fair idea, and that’s where this new line of inquisition comes in: is it possible, that the infamous Montreal Screwjob from 1997 was in fact a device used by reality as a way to understand reality’s own weaknesses – its inability to let humans fly? For those who aren’t informed, about WWE history, the Montreal Screwjob was an incident that took place at the 1997 edition of the WWE annual pay-per-view Survivor Series. The exact nature of the incident that’s in question pertains to the main event of the pay-per-view, which had featured the individuals Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. In terms of where one goes from here, the logical thing to do would be to categorize the different parts of the question. For example, reality is referenced as a creator, therefore it’s reality and neither the Montreal Screwjob or the inability to fly that is the origin. So whatever the Montreal Screwjob and the inability to fly are, it’s currently a given that neither of them can be understood as being original forces. Between the Montreal Screwjob and the inability to fly, it’s the latter force which is the presumed original: so overall, reality is first, the inability to fly is second, and then the Montreal Screwjob is third. The original is real. After the real then comes the weakness, and then after the weakness comes an actual incident; the actual incident in question is a part of a sequence (it’s a known fact that reality has continued after the Montreal Screwjob), which means that neither the original force or the inability to fly are part of a sequence. In effect, the original force and the inability to fly are timeless – an original timelessness and a replicated timelessness. An original timelessness is a time which is real. The replicated timelessness is a time which isn’t real – a real time and a magical time. The real time is the same as a timelessness of magic, which further means that the inability to fly can be a time of magic – thus, the original force is a magic which is limitless, and the second force is a magic which is limited. Reality has gone from a true magic to a lesser version of the same magic. The Montreal Screwjob, as a force which isn’t the original force and therefore not real, is also a kind of magic. What’s more, it’s also not an inability since the inability to fly is the inability – the Montreal Screwjob is therefore a kind of magic that acts as a reflection of the original magic. In essence, the Montreal Screwjob was created by the original magic of reality so that the original magic of reality could have a reflection that it can be proud of: the original and pure magic created the infamous Montreal Screwjob so that the inability to fly can be ignored by reality (as opposed to being explained) The ultimate lesson, of the Montreal Screwjob – magic is real, and it has the right to experience weakness"
17,"By buzzin', can Gene Hackman protect atoms from metaphors?",social-issues," The prospect that metaphors are a threat to atoms is an outlandish one. In the real world, people wouldn’t feel that such an idea should be taken seriously. However, beyond a certain point in experience it then becomes very natural, and very logical to take such an idea with more than a grain of salt. I’m sure that many people would agree, that art is more than important to the human condition, which is why it’s my own inclination to give credence to the notion that metaphors can be a threat to atoms. To counter this potential threat, I would offer a solution that’s as crazy and as radical as the original notion but in perfect sync with the notion: Gene Hackman, the retired movie star. To get to the point in which metaphors are a threat to atoms, and that atoms are frightened of movie, story or poetic symbolism, it feels like a reassuring balance – Hackman has the ability to elevate buzzin’ to the appropriate level, in which it could act as a protector of atoms. To be clear, buzzin’ isn’t synonymous with Hackman, but is just a general type of behaviour, one which isn’t powerful enough on its own to act as a shield against the tyranny of metaphors. With Hackman though, I honestly feel that the behaviour of buzzin’ could overcome its own limitation, and become a sufficient shield. I know better than to dismiss reality. I know all too well how the insane and the impossible can gain credibility over time. Metaphors can become the greatest nightmare of reality, and atoms are the creators of reality. Gene Hackman is no more unique than a John Travolta, or a Harrison Ford or a Neve Campbell or a Jim Carrey; he is however the perfect candidate for this problem. Buzzin’ seems to fit better with Hackman than it does Travolta, or Ford. As to why, I suppose it just comes down to the fact it’s Hackman and neither Ford or Travolta who first come to mind. And this is okay: if the scenario of this article had nothing to do with atoms, and being frightened of metaphors, but if it were to do with whether or not it’s better to not have a dinky or to beat a male movie star in a fight, Harrison Ford would probably be the first of four male actors named to occur – a pattern of inexplicability as the means to creation. Overall, the issue is a part of life’s internal development, but at the same time the issue is immune to its identity being undermined as a result of this ulterior truth."
18,Is the American suburban housewife the only reality that can't speak to reality?,social-issues," American is 1. Suburban is 2. Housewife is 3. 3 doesn’t need 2, but it needs 1. 1 doesn’t need 2 but it needs 3. 2 doesn’t need 1 but it needs 3. 3 is freedom and dependence. 2 is freedom and dependence. 1 is freedom and dependence. The freedom of 3 is the freedom of 1. The dependency of 3 is the dependency of 1. The freedom of 2 is unique, and the dependency of 2 is the dependency of 1. An American is a common power and a common flaw. A suburban is a unique power and a common flaw, and a housewife is a common power and a common flaw. A common power and a common flaw are also a flaw and a power – a flaw and a power that’s shared. Alongside the shared flaw and power, there is a flaw and a power which isn’t shared. If a shared flaw and power is a unique symmetry, a non-shared flaw and power is a shared symmetry. By this data, the American suburban housewife is a force of nature which comprises of a symmetry that’s meaningful and a symmetry that’s not meaningful; the reverse of a symmetry that’s meaningful and a symmetry that’s not meaningful is a contrast which is meaningful and a contrast which is meaningful. A contrast that is meaningful and a contrast that is meaningful is the equivalent of a symmetry that isn’t meaningful that is unique. A symmetry that is useless that is unique is a shared contrast that is useful – finally, a shared contrast that is useful is just a symmetry that is useless (so symmetry wins out after all, despite being useless). The American suburban housewife is a useless symmetry, which by default requires that reality be a useful symmetry; thus, the truth is an identical application, and the fiction is but an identical non-application. This time, the reverse of an identical application is a non-applicable contrast, which then this time requires that the American suburban housewife gets turned into an applicable contrast (so at least contrast still isn’t useless). Reality is something that can’t do anything – the American suburban housewife is something that can do anything (and since it wasn’t the British, Spanish, Chinese or Russian suburban housewife that invoked the issue in the first place, it seems fair to preclude the idea that the symmetry between the American suburban housewife and the alternate suburban housewives is just cause to exempt the American suburban housewife from their glory). Cristina Raines, a former actress who appeared in numerous movies and television shows, owes her inclusion in this article to her central role in the 1977 horror, The Sentinel. The fact that The Sentinel and that Raines’ part in The Sentinel were only known states after the origin of the American suburban housewife is as much a lack of consequence as it is a consequence to the argument that Raines and The Sentinel are prerequisites for the American suburban housewife. While there’s no telling, in literal terms, if Raines and The Sentinel are connected to the American suburban housewife, at the same time I’m in no position whatsoever to deny the subjective need to concoct the connection. Even if the American suburban housewife has no basis, to oppose the style of Cristina Raines in The Sentinel, somehow, the effect of the style of Cristina Raines in The Sentinel elicits the need to act as if the American suburban housewife ought to be a type of reaction to Cristina Raines in The Sentinel."
19,The Lost Glory,social-issues," The Lost Glory Going on with the Government of Nepal’s booklet ""A Brief Introduction to Village Councils & Municipal Councils in Nepal 2017"", Nepal has altogether 766 local units, 6 metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolis, 276 municipalities, 460 village councils (Gaunpalikas) and 6,553 wards Given the adequacy of different public service offices strategically located nationwide and despite the laid down specifics to be categorically achieved by them, one can only but wonder why has the gross inefficiency of these offices not been penalized till date? A classic case of impunity paramount in the country no doubt. Law governing the society should always be fair, severe and timely. While fairness heralds impartiality with regard to social standing of the defaulter, severity of punishment is the intensity of retribution to ensure non-repetition of offense by the guilty and those harboring ill-will. Timely execution of the law again has its own importance.  Going on with the adage Justice delayed is justice denied, when/if it takes forever in the proceedings to punish a single criminal, it adds to the confidence of other miscreants. The reason social ills like indiscipline, unaccountability and the ""devil may care"" attitude remains adamantly entrenched in the society is due to lack of proper authority to efficiently and effectively sentence the culprit. Of late, people in general have become far too individualist. This self-centeredness has by far overshadowed any sense of consideration for others. The decadence is more conspicuous with us Nepalese and our deteriorating sense of nation and nationality in that we seem to have gone completely oblivious to our civic responsibility and our basic obligation as an inhabitant of the country. Why is it so hard to realize that If the nation itself ceased to exist, it would also rid us of our individuality? Why are we so hell bent on destroying our own nation as a result of our growing apathy towards it? With each forward step all other countries in the world are taking in the path of self sufficiency & sustainable development, we seem to be retreating to the uncivilized era of the yore. Corruption laced politicians and bureaucrats, incompetent professionals and professors, bickering trade unions and transport agents, student hooliganism, yellow journalism, inefficient law and justice, tainted security system all paints a picture of the society where majority of people are ever struggling to make their ends meet. Their potentiality and creativity are crushed under massive boulders of poverty and scarcity. Development works are near stagnant and economy is in doldrums. Kathmandu, the sole metropolitan city of Nepal is one of the ugliest capital cities in the entire world. Garbage heaps, littered roads and alleys, lack of even the most basic facilities like proper drinking water and drainage system, non-existent street lightings and public toilets, inadequate/improper roads, undisciplined traffic, excess particle pollution, and everything that sounds unruly and spells mayhem horrendously haunts the very existence of humanity here. All this makes us wonder why the globe tottering politicians who never tire hopping from one junket to another in one pretext or the other are never ashamed of the pathetic condition of their own motherland? Does their conscience never question their incompetency? Or are they so blinded by greed for green to care less since each international visits made only means more opportunity to beg for increased assistance by showcasing the grotesque state of the country? Us Nepalese have been tricked, ridiculed, robbed and played upon our sentiments by political figures innumerable times. In spite of this, we keep on treating them as our mentor. We are never tired of clamoring around them all eyes and ears nodding ludicrously and applauding with gaiety their wild oratory. This is despite our full knowledge that most of their wanton and hallow wag of tongue are nothing better than well devised means to beat a path to power for furthering their individual vested interest. While the country has been reeling under derogatoriness and disarray for decades, we do nothing to punish these degenerates. So truly had the great Napoleon Bonaparte once stated ""The world suffers a lot not because of the violence of bad people but because of the silence of the good people"". I know it is far easier to criticize than to create. Fact remains, the disorderly picture often portrayed of our country can gradually be corrected. The only hindering factor here seems to be absence of determination of all concerned and the imperative change of mindset from condition of stagnation to creation and construction. Nepal is a country where natural bestowment is diverse and in plentiful, where resources still remain unexploited and unexplored, and where ways are many but will is nil. The continual whining and crying over the half-emptiness of the glass instead of trying to make most out of the other half that is full has been the major roadblock in the path of perfection for Nepal. Let's face it; a beggar can never attain any progress in his life if he continues to be dependent upon the mercy of others. Today, Nepal is more in need of social/economical transformation than in any other past. And, for transformation to take place, there should initially be a break in tradition, in the old ways of thinking and in old paradigm. Let us all learn to love and respect our nation and fellow inhabitants first. This accomplished, we shall not only automatically build our civic sense which we are so in dire need of, but also pave way in sorting out myriad of other problems presently gnawing our nation. Finally, in order to ensure effective curbing of crimes, need for stringent legal measures cannot be overemphasized. Authorities should be made accountable for their actions or the lack of it with zero tolerance in taking disciplinary measures against the culpable. Only then can our nation hopefully reclaim its lost pride and glory."
20,Top 3 Things Every Dental Practice Should Do About Their Waste Starting From Today,social-issues," If you own or work in a dental practice you know what a variety of waste materials are routinely generated during the provision of oral healthcare. Most of these by-products are non-hazardous and can be managed in the same way as household waste. However, some materials used in dental practices can pose a risk to humans or the environment if not discarded properly. Clinical waste needs correct handling and special care and there is a strict legislation in place to prevent harm being caused to the environment and to human health by any type of hazardous waste. It is vital that every dental practice is aware of their responsibilities and adheres to the current legislation. All waste produced by a dental practice falls in one of these 2 categories: Hazardous – this includes bagged or ‘infectious’ clinical waste, sharps, dental amalgam, chemicals, x-ray by-products, refrigerators, computer monitors, fluorescent tubes, etc. Even though the use of amalgam for dentistry in the UK has decreased considerably in the last years, small amounts are still being used when, for example, old amalgam fillings are removed (normally, fine amalgam particles are produced by the drill when removing the fillings and these are captured by the amalgam separator units attached to the suction systems). Non-hazardous – this includes bagged hygiene wastes such as gloves, face-masks, paper towels, detergent wipes and other items from the surgeries that are not contaminated; out-of-date pharmaceuticals (non-cytotoxic and non-cytostatic); partially discharged LA cartridges; gypsum; precious metal waste (from old bridges and crowns); batteries and ‘domestic’ or ‘municipal’ waste (such as food packaging, empty coffee jars, disposable paper towels that haven’t been used in the surgeries, etc.) The primary responsibility for the proper disposal of these wastes lies with the employees of the practice (i.e. dentists, hygienists and dental nurses). All team members should be properly educated and they must be aware of the different waste types produced so as to ensure correct disposal. For example, it is important that anyone can recognise wastes that have been placed in the wrong container. Here are the top 3 things every dental practice should be doing with regards to managing their hazardous or clinical waste. Identify your waste stream Proper segregation is critical to safe management. The mixing of waste streams is prohibited by law in England and Wales. It also helps support waste minimisation and reduces the risk of exposure and injury to your staff. All containers used for the disposal of clinical waste must be labelled in accordance with the details of the legal requirements for transporting and packaging. Your container labels should clearly identify what is inside and it should always be signed by the producer before correct disposal. The Environment Agency issued a memorandum with the best practice guidelines for healthcare waste segregation. The Safe Management of Healthcare Waste Memorandum[i] recommends to use colour coded bins, sacks and receptacles to enable easy identification. These containers should be placed as close to the point of waste creation as possible. The colours used are: Yellow: Infectious waste for disposal by incineration Orange: Infectious waste for disposal by treatment or incineration Yellow/Black (Tiger): Offensive/hygiene waste for disposal by deep landfill Blue: Medicinal waste for disposal by incineration Purple: containing cytotoxic or cytostatic waste for disposal by incineration Red: Anatomical waste for disposal by incineration White: Amalgam waste for recycling Safely manage sharps to prevent injuries The safe handling and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments should form part of an overall strategy of clinical waste disposal to protect staff, patients and visitors from exposure to blood borne pathogens. Dental practice employees generating sharps waste should have access to sharps containers that conform to current standards. It is proven that the likelihood of needlestick injury is greatly reduced by the immediate disposal of sharps into an appropriate container. The Health and Safety (Sharps Instruments in Healthcare) Regulations[ii] provide practical advice on the safe use and disposal of sharps, on staff training requirements and on the procedures for responding to a sharps injury. Some key tips to make sure you comply with the new regulations are: Implement safe procedures for using and disposing of sharp medical instruments and contaminated waste; Eliminate the unnecessary use of sharps by implementing changes and providing medical devices with incorporated safety-engineered protection mechanisms; Sharps disposal equipment should be kept as close as possible to the assessed areas where sharps are being used or found; Ban the practice of recapping; Use personal protective equipment; Train your practice staff on the correct use of sharps devices and the disposal of sharps waste. Choose the right hazardous waste disposal service When choosing the right partner to take care of your hazardous or clinical waste disposal, the first and most important thing to check is that the company is a Registered Waste Carrier. It’s a good idea to ask for a copy of their licences. These are some other important things you should consider: Check if the disposal service is licenced to take away the types of waste you are producing; Make sure the technicians and the drivers of the vehicle carrying dangerous goods hold an ADR licence, which is the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road. This is a legal requirement for every vehicle carrying dangerous goods; Ask what documentation you will receive to cover your transfer and make sure your waste will be fully traceable from leaving your premises through to end disposal; Check that the containers provided by your supplier meet all legal requirements; Make sure that your waste will be fully segregated on-site and during transportation to meet the current regulations; Ask for any hidden charges and make sure your chosen provider can guarantee on time pick up and deliveries. At All Waste Matters we can offer a complete hazardous waste management service, from collection to disposal. We have over 50 years of experience and you can rest assured that your waste is being handled safely and in-keeping with the latest legislation. We are a fully licensed hazardous waste disposal company and operate our own collection vehicles and fully licensed recycling facility.

1,4 Staggering Facts About Hazardous Waste,social-issues," Hazardous waste statistics are not very pleasant to look at. Each year more than 5.2 million tonnes of hazardous waste are produced in the UK - mostly by the construction, chemicals, electronics and lubricant oil industries. The production of hazardous waste is growing by an estimated 8 per cent a year but fortunately also the percentage of hazardous waste that goes to landfill (as opposed as re-used or recycled) is quickly dropping. This is because of the stricter regulations and controls that the Environment Agency and the EU have imposed to waste producers and also because of the general greater awareness of the implications of poor hazardous waste disposal procedures. The first step to a safe, effective hazardous waste management is learning more about the risks that hazardous waste poses. Here are some eye-opening facts about the importance of safely disposing of any toxic waste. We don’t really know the extent of long-lasting effects of hazardous waste exposure on the human body People respond to chemical exposure in different ways. Some people may be exposed to a chemical and not get sick. Other people may be more sensitive and have more severe reactions than others. Certain variables play a role in a person's susceptibility to chemical exposure and adverse health effects such as age, gender, genetics, pregnancy or other health conditions. For foetuses, children, and adolescents, the adverse health effects from exposure to chemicals can be much greater than for adults. The factors that affect their susceptibility include their stage of development and level of activity in their own environment. The human body has the ability to tolerate certain amounts of chemicals and the ability to excrete them. Once a person is exposed to a chemical, it may enter the blood stream, and eventually reach the internal organs. The body will try to filter the toxic elements in order to eliminate them, but it may not be possible to remove all of them. The amount, type, and length of time you are exposed to harmful substances will determine if you are at risk for long-lasting adverse health effects. Dangers are not limited to illnesses For instance, a large variety of chemicals can explode. An explosive, is a reactive substance that contains a great amount of potential energy that can produce an explosion if released suddenly, usually accompanied by the production of light, heat, sound, and pressure. Explosive materials may be categorized by the speed at which they expand. Materials that detonate (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the speed of sound) are said to be ""high explosives"" and materials that deflagrate are said to be ""low explosives"". There are also some other materials which are merely combustible or flammable if ignited, without exploding. The distinction is not always crystal clear. Certain materials—dusts, powders, gasses, or volatile organic liquids—may be simply combustible or flammable under ordinary conditions, but become explosive in specific situations or forms, such as dispersed airborne clouds, or confinement or sudden release. Commodities can be killers We all get in contact with a variety of materials in our everyday life, that are in reality hazardous and need a correct disposal. Here are some examples: Carbon Dioxide - This non-flammable gas is commonly used to freeze or chill food products during transport to market. Its vapours may cause dizziness or asphyxiation and making contact with the gas or liquefied gas can cause burns, severe injury and/or frostbite. Sulfuric Acid - It is commonly used in cleaning agents, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining and wastewater processing. Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive and, if it comes in contact with human skin, it can cause severe burns while inhaling the fumes can cause serious lung damage. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) - It's commonly used as fuel to heat appliances and vehicles as well as in refrigerants. It must be stored in pressured vessels to mitigate the fire risks associated with the mixture of hydrocarbon gasses. In a fire, LPG has the potential to cause major explosions. Argon (refrigerated liquid) - This refrigerated liquid is commonly used in the production of fluorescent light bulbs. It can cause serious tissue damage if it comes in contact with skin and it can be extremely harmful if inhaled. It must be transported in gas cylinders in an upright position to avoid sudden releases of pressure. Propane - It is used as a fuel for engines, oxy-gas torches, barbecues, portable stoves and residential central heating. Propane is also mixed with butane to make the vehicle fuel commonly known as liquified petroleum gas. Chlorine - This volatile substance is highly reactive, especially in the presence of heat. Since chlorine can severely damage lungs and can potentially kill people if leaked, its transportation is best avoided. Chlorine is widely used in swimming pools, water purification and bleach products. Hazardous waste can be landfilled In the UK, all waste must be treated before it can be landfilled. This requirement comes from the Landfill Directive (LfD), which aims to reduce our reliance on landfill as a waste management option and minimise the environmental impact of landfill sites. Currently in the UK, there are about 280 landfill sites, but landfills for hazardous waste can only accept hazardous waste. Prior to any load of hazardous waste being accepted at a landfill site, a specialised team will assess the waste and approve its suitability for disposal. Every site needs to train their employees on the classification, handling, management and disposal of most types of hazardous waste. They also need to keep up-to-date with the latest UK and European legislation and most landfill sites provide advice on legal requirements for disposal of all hazardous waste types. Still, in order to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that go to landfill, it is important that waste producers find better ways to manage their waste, continually reviewing how best to manage toxic waste, including whether it needs to be produced at all and whether it can be reused or recycled. At All Waste Matters, we provide nationwide hazardous waste recycling services to the educational, printing, electronic and healthcare sectors, offering customised collection, treatment, disposal and recycling services throughout the UK. Our extensive Environment Agency issued permit allows us to collect over 99% of all commercial wastes. With over 50 years of experience in the waste management industry, we can not only solve your hazardous waste disposal problems, but also help you reduce the amount of waste produced."
2,Best Practices And Etiquette For Lab Waste Disposals,social-issues," Lab waste is waste that is generated from laboratories in a variety of industries and in educational centres such as schools and universities. This waste can be broken down into different categories: - Hazardous; - Clinical; - Biological; - Electrical; - Laboratory. A significant proportion of solid waste from a laboratory is likely to consist of non-hazardous waste. Items such as paper, tissues, disposable gloves, packaging, rinsed plastic-ware, rinsed glass-ware and rinsed out chemical bottles (which must be rinsed at least three times and their labels defaced) are usually considered to be non-hazardous. Waste is hazardous if it contains substances that are harmful to the human health or the environment. Hazardous waste must not be disposed of in the general waste stream or via the drain; instead it must be segregated, treated and disposed of by an appropriate hazardous waste management service. It is the responsibility of all lab workers to ensure the safe and correct disposal of all laboratory wastes produced in the course of their work. Improper and irresponsible disposal of chemical waste down drains, in normal bins or into the atmosphere is forbidden by law and can lead to severe consequences for the human health and the environment. Best practices to reduce your lab waste Before thinking about how to dispose of chemical waste, you should try to analyse the laboratory’s internal procedures to see if there are ways to reduce the amount of waste produced. To do that, you can look at purchasing procedures. For example, you can buy only what is needed, reducing wastage due to expiry. You can also try to find a reliable supplier who will deliver small amounts of chemicals at short notice. Another good way of reducing waste is considering a centralised purchasing programme to take advantage of bulk pricing. In addition to all that, it may be useful to separate waste into different streams for treatment, reuse or disposal. Best practices to reuse your lab waste Reusing something is often the best way of reducing waste, and this can be applied to lab waste too. Try to incorporate recovery activities during the experiments or think about a chemical swap with other institutions in your area, who may be able to take advantage of your left-over chemical products. If reusing is not an option, all waste should be segregated based on chemical incompatibilities e.g. hazardous and non-hazardous wastes should not be mixed together. The same is true of organic and inorganic waste. Waste consisting of the same material type can be segregated and waste streams that are capable of being recycled should be stored separately. Best practices to recycle laboratory waste General laboratory waste which is or may be contaminated must be treated to make it safe (using an appropriate method) prior to recycling. All wastes should be segregated based on chemical incompatibilities e.g. hazardous vs. non-hazardous wastes, organic vs. inorganic waste. Make sure the recycling bin is labelled clearly by placing a label on the bin, ensuring that hazardous wastes such as chemicals are not placed in the bin. Bins for the collection of hazardous materials should be placed in the lab. These should be emptied regularly and looked after by lab workers. Where appropriate and safe, containers (e.g. cans, bottles) which previously contained chemicals or otherwise hazardous materials, should be rinsed and made safe for disposal. In these instances, it is necessary to indicate that the container has been made safe by removal or defacing of the contents label. Clean recyclable material which has been identified clearly as non-hazardous should be recycled using appropriate bins. Waste streams that can be recycled should be stored separately i.e. recoverable metals or solvents. How to dispose of lab waste Packaging, labelling and storage are the three requirements for disposing of chemical waste. Packaging Laboratory wastes must be stored in containers compatible with the chemicals stored, which should only be filled up to 75% capacity to allow for vapour expansion and to reduce potential spills that can occur from moving overfilled containers. Chemical wastes must not be packaged in containers that improperly identify other non-existent hazards. Glass containers have traditionally been the most resistant to chemical action, but they can break easily. Metal containers are sturdier than glass, but often are corroded by their contents. Various chemically resistant plastic containers are becoming preferable substitutes for glass or metal containers. Safety cans, metal or plastic, should be considered for holding flammable solvents. Incompatible materials should never be mixed together in a single container. Solvent safety cans should be used to collect and temporarily store large volumes (10–20 litres) of flammable organic waste solvents. Precipitates, solids or other non-fluid wastes should not be mixed into safety cans. Lab glassware is not suitable for recycling, as its melting point is higher than that of conventional glass. Broken glassware should be collected in puncture proof containers and disposed of in large containers by technical staff. Biological waste such as agar plates, waste from dissections etc. should be separated and collected separately. Where appropriate this can be autoclaved. Labelling It is essential to label all containers with the group name from the chemical waste category and an itemized list of the contents which should enable knowledgeable laboratory workers to evaluate the hazard. When compatible wastes are collected in a common container, it is advisable to keep a list of the components to help for later disposal decisions. All waste must be appropriately packaged and the labelling must be clear and permanent. Sharp items such as syringes and scalpel blades should be collected in containers labelled ""Sharps"". Storage When storing chemical wastes, the containers must be in good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. Hazardous waste must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory and should not be allowed to accumulate. It is essential to segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container. All Waste Matters offer specialist laboratory waste disposal services to an extensive client base throughout the UK. We can provide a tailored laboratory waste disposal and collection service of any unwanted chemicals to school, colleges and universities offering complete peace of mind and ensuring the lab waste is treated in – keeping and exceeding all recommended guidelines."
3,Who is the master of the universe?,social-issues," Who is the master of the universe? By Thomas H Cullen On the surface, the ability to discover the identity of the master of the universe feels beyond futile. And this is the ability to discover. The term is not a synonym for God, but is meant to refer to a different being. Since it seems obvious that God’s nature can’t be deciphered, it then stands to reason that it’s within the realm of capability to decipher the nature of the master of the universe. When it comes to the master of the universe, the relevant idea is to do with the accomplishment of purposefully pretending to be weak. The reverse of purposefully pretending to be weak is to accidently be a real strength – a synonym for accidently being a real strength is to accidently be weak. So in essence: the identity of the master of the universe can be summed up as a being who has the right to revel in being accidently weak. Unto itself, a weakness is a perspective. An accident can’t be identical to a weakness, and therefore an accident is forced to be the lack of perspective – ergo, the master of the universe is a force which is the accomplishment of being a perspective that is not a perspective. What is a perspective that isn’t a perspective? A perspective is a limit of knowledge, which then turns the question into the nature of a limit of knowledge that isn’t a limit of knowledge. Limitless knowledge is the same as limit, and so this creates a limitless limit. If something is a limitless limit, this means that it is a restriction that is free. Restriction is the absence of travel. An absence of travel that is free is an absence of movement that is free; the free absence of movement is the unfree presence of no movement – the unfree presence of restriction. The unfree presence of restriction is the restriction of presence of restriction. The presence of restriction is absence, and thus the master of the universe is simply the accomplishment of no restriction. In a sense, this identity is a double-edged sword. There’s an obvious technical power at play, but then there’s also a lack of depth. Then again, doing the detail into the power can always perhaps resolve the disappointment. An absence of restriction is a force that can go wherever it wants. The ""force"" and the ""wherever"" are obviously separate, and this is where the quest can potentially become interesting. The ""wherever"" can’t be the master, which makes the location into the servant. A location is another term for separation. As a result, the master of the universe is not a separation but a unification, rendering the accomplishment into a unification that uses a separation. In general, a unification is just an absence of split. The absence of split is the presence of no split, and the presence of no split is the presence of one. The presence of one of course isn’t identical to one, and therefore it’s fair to categorize the master as a deceptive one. The separation is the presence of split, which makes the separation into the absence of no split – the absence of one. The absence of one isn’t identical to absence, and therefore it’s fair to categorize the servant as a deceptive absence. The master is the use of a deceptive absence. The servant is used by a deceptive one. A deceptive absence is the absence of deception. A deceptive one is one deception. One deception is honesty. The absence of deception is honesty. The identity of the master of the universe is an honest force that has the power to use another honest force. I was disappointed before, but no more. The idea of a force that can use another force without either side being corrupted is a fantastic idea. Truly inspiring. When one thinks of use – the general concept of use – it’s usually inevitable to associate the concept with corruption. Which is why the new revelation feels not just adequate but legitimately inspiring. The master is an equal to all, who can use all to the protection of all."
4,Can a press conference become a scientist?,social-issues," Can a press conference become a scientist? By Thomas H Cullen I find this question sacred. Naturally, the idea in and of itself is important, but it’s a case in which the question which represents the idea can take on a protective quality. Reality is made up of questions. Questions are the routine of reality. It’s impossible to be born and to die without asking any. However, is it ever actually the nature of questions to ""overcome reality""? Overcome is one way of looking at it. Protection is another. For me, a particular mystery about the question – of whether a press conference can become a scientist – is if the idea of the question being protective is at odds with the merit of the question. A press conference is an event; one which is made up of a series of events. A scientist is not an event, but instead is a being. A being is a force that’s meant to make up events. Thus, a being can be assigned the identity ""creator of event"". Since it’s the being who goes by as ""creator of event"", it’s therefore logical to deduce that it’s the event which goes by as ""not creator of event"". A ""not creator of event"" is a force which has to be sentient, because of the mere act of identification. If the force were simply non-sentient, that would mean that the identifier would have no cause to identify it. The ""not creator of event"" and the ""creator of event"" are both sentient, and the reason is because they are both subject to an identifier. The press conference is sentient, because it is an event, and an event has the ability to be subject to an identifier. Obviously, the logic that’s been put on display here hasn’t the right to be presumed as exempt from scrutiny. On the other hand though, is the logic good enough to protect itself? An event is sentient, since it is subject to an identifier. The identifier is sentient, by default. Since it’s the identifier that’s sentient ""by default"", that in turn dictates that the creator of event is ""not sentient by default"". The creator of event is sentient, the identifier is sentient, and the not creator of event is sentient; the first sentience is sentient due to condition, the second sentience is sentient by default, and the third sentience is sentient due to being subject to sentience by default. To put into different terms: a being is by condition, an event is by being subject to no condition, and the identifier is by no condition. What does this mean? The actual objective is to determine if a press conference can become a scientist – to determine if an event can imitate a being (if the result of being subject to no condition can imitate the result of condition). To possibly help matters, identities should be truncated: the result of being subject to no condition can be altered into ""being subject to condition"", the result of condition can be altered into ""no condition"", and the result of no condition into condition. The being is no condition. The event is by condition. The identifier is condition. Of course, trying to illustrate or trying to prove that a press conference can become a scientist is next to physically impossible (any such ambition violates the condition of the universe), however, it’s interesting, ironic and even something of a saving grace to illustrate that a force can imitate any other force by way of no imitation. Can a press conference become a scientist? Is the question the saving grace of reality? Is the question the saving grace of reality, but purely on the condition that the status of the question can’t be shared by the idea which gives rise to the question? Personally, I’m inclined to let the idea and the question that comes from the idea be separate powers all while mutually possessing the status of saving reality. Reality is made up of ambition, yet it’s also the seeming truth to reality that an ambition can act as a shield to reality. The day that a press conference does anything, let alone becomes a scientist, is the day that trees and motorways can no longer just be trees and motorways, or that opinions and thoughts can just be opinions and thoughts."
5,The Case for Top-down Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the developing world,social-issues," The Case for Top-down Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the developing world CSR Defined A standard and universally accepted definition of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been elusive for years. All the definitions put forward so far by different authors agree that CSR is all about sustainability. CSR is simply put as a practice where a corporate entity practices capitalism unusual, sustainably and with a conscience, for the benefit of the organisation, its stakeholders and the world at large. It entails carrying out normal business operations and at the same time ensuring sustainability of both the business and the environment in which the operations are being carried out. The Centre for Ethical Business Cultures in 2010 defined CSR as ""the integration of business operations and values whereby the interests of all stakeholders including customers, employees, investors, the community and the environment are reflected in the company’s policies and actions.""  This definition shows CSR as an all accommodating strategic move and calls for top management involvement if an organisation’s CSR programmes are to be in tandem with the organisation’s strategic direction. CSR Benefits It has been observed that most organisations in developing countries practice ""cosmetic CSR"" in spite of the fact that research has shown that there are tremendous rewards for observing CSR. CSR brings so much more to an organisation’s value table and it is known to create extra economic and environmental and social value beyond an organisation’s legal and ethical mandate. Among CSR benefits are, but not limited to the following: •Social licence to operate • Good reputation for a company and its products • Contribute immensely to sustainable development and capacity building in communities • Positively affects customer satisfaction and loyalty (who would not want to be associated with a good thing?) • Increased motivation and productivity of employees especially if they are involved in the formulation, implementation and review of CSR programmes Argument for CSR Board Oversight CSR has been evolving and has become quite involving for all organisational members, management and employees combined. In as much as the talk about the strategic importance of CSR has become louder in organisations, both in the developing and developed world, the practice is still lagging behind the talk.  Some organisations regrettably still regard CSR as an unwelcome distraction from achieving the real reason for being in business, which is generating the maximum possible profits, irrespective of how much damage to the environment or to the climate their operations are responsible for.  No one can fault this line of thinking no matter how selfish it might sound, even the great Friedman in the 1970s famously declared that the ""business of business is business,"" in unequivocal support of rent seeking and profit maximisation behaviour by corporate entities. Board of directors’ involvement or at the very least its oversight of CSR programmes is non-existent in a lot of organisations in the developing countries. Altschuller (2011) writing in the special feature of the IR Magazine pointed out that ""studies have found board oversight of social and environmental practices is lacking."" The world is seized with climate change and its effects and, therefore, strategic hands and stewardship must be on the CSR deck if planet earth is going to survive the climate change onslaught. The Board should be at the forefront, taking a stand against unsustainable behaviour within the organisation and championing corporate citizenship which is likely to snowball into good behaviour throughout the organisation and ultimately embedded CSR culture. Each organisation has to ensure that sustainability goals and targets are embedded in the organisational targets. It is therefore crucial that organisational vision, mission and values statements have a strong bias towards sustainability. These are very important documents for every organisation. Vision, mission and values statements communicate within and without the organisation what the business stands for and its future direction. They are strategic documents and by simply looking at them one should be able to visualise the organisation’s mind-set towards CSR. It is not a secret that such important documents are found hanging on important places on organisations walls through the blessing of the board members and that the board members authorise the use of every word on these statements. Technically, the board is the author and the brain child of vision, mission and values statements and should, therefore take responsibility of the wording of these statements. Every organisation should preach the gospel of sustainability and clearly highlight what and how the organisation is going to contribute towards the realisation of sustainable development goals (SDGs). However, preaching alone without religiously practicing sustainable business operations is not enough. SDGs are long term targets and long term targets are naturally strategic. As a result, the task towards meeting long term goals can never be left to middle level management or low level employees. This does not mean employees should not be involved, they are a very important part of the CSR equation to be left out. However, their involvement should mostly be on a day to day implementation of sustainability targets.  The board is expected to play CSR leadership and stewardship roles. It is rare to come across an organisation in most developing countries with a department exclusively running CSR for the company. A department with its head only responsible for CSR. The most observed scenario is where CSR is run under a section within a department such as under the marketing department or public relations, which only serves to communicate that the organisation is taking a myopic CSR view of treating it as a mere public relations tool. However, if an organisation is to come up with meaningful and result oriented sustainability targets and follow them through, it is crucial for CSR to claim a seat in the Board Rooms and not just a token seat, but a strategic one too. The Board Member responsible for CSR will assume a very important duty of convincing other Board Members about the strategic importance of CSR to the organisation and ensure they see beyond the profit maximisation call of duty as the sole reason for the organisation’s existence The Board of Directors, therefore, should assume the following important CSR roles: • Providing a CSR strategic direction for the organisation • Ensuring the CSR framework is in line with the strategic policies of the organisation • Authorising CSR programmes, budgets, CSR collaboration partnerships and sustainability reports before they are published • General CSR oversight directly or through a CSR Committee reporting directly to the Board • Monitor and review the company’s CSR progress Therefore, as CSR and prosocial corporate behaviour becomes more strong and still growing, the board must ensure that the business is working proactively and aggressively for social betterment and at the same time cut-out reactive CSR and disjointed philanthropic behaviour. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure the organisation becomes a symbol of all that is good about sustainability in the eyes of all the stakeholders. The organisation should always be ahead of societal expectations through carrying out voluntary CSR initiatives."
6,A Guide to Legionnaires’ Disease for Landlords in the UK,social-issues," A recent increase in reported outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease means that landlords need to take special care to be aware of the risks and measures to prevent infection. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reports that Legionnaires’ disease incidences have hit record levels. According to Public Health England, showers in about 1.5 million households in the UK could be harbouring the life-threatening Legionella bacteria. Outbreaks in the UK have occurred at the BBC in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Barrow-in-Furness, and Kingston and Stafford hospitals. A summary of Legionnaires’ disease for landlords Legionnaires disease got its name from members of the American Legion who contracted the disease in 1976 while attending a convention at a hotel in Philadelphia. Legionnaires disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria, which grows in large numbers in warmed water systems that remain idle for long periods of time. This is why buildings with large and more complex water systems, such as hotels, hospitals, office blocks, schools and large buildings are most at risk of Legionella infection. Everyone is susceptible to Legionella infection, and the disease can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems, the elderly, as well as heavy smokers and drinkers. The disease can also lead to life-threatening complications such as septic shock or organ failure. Legionnaires’ disease for landlords and building managers is a concern that needs to be addressed by introducing appropriate measures to reduce the risks of infection. Legionnaires’ disease risks to manage ●	If conditions are favourable in man-made water systems, Legionella bacteria colonies may grow. ●	The risk temperature range for Legionella is between 20-45 degrees Celsius. ●	A hot water system should be set to 60 degrees centigrade so that it delivers water to the taps at 55 degrees Celsius. The legalities of Legionnaires’ disease ●	It is a legal requirement to monitor and check your water temperatures constantly. ●	All records of monitoring should be kept available for up to 5 years. ●	The responsibility for testing and monitoring rests with the authorised person on site, even if they are using a third-party service, making owners and landlords responsible for minimising the risk of Legionella in their water systems."
7,Conflict At The Office? Ignore it and it will spiral into something bigger.,social-issues," Dealing with conflict in the workplace is an invite to other issues. For example, poor performance reviews, upset clients, or frustrated coworkers who notice your lack of attention. So much of your attention will become focused on either finding ways to avoid the conflict or finding ways to resolve the issue that is at the heart of the conflict. It is imperative that you address the situation as soon as it begins. Ignore it, and it will spiral into something bigger. Define the Issue. The first step is to define the issue. To assist you in defining the issue I have included a few questions below. As you answer the questions remember to keep your answers factual. Assumptions or hearsay are not valid. It is important to stick to the facts and leave your emotions out. What is the issue? Do you have any examples to prove your claim? (Include dates and times if possible.) What should change? Your recommendation for resolving the issue? Use the answers to the questions to help you stay on track when you are discussing the issue and also when you are working on a solution to the issue. Communication. Communicate in a non-threatening way. To do this, always keep in mind that the issue is about the action or activity rather than about the people involved. Keep your demeanor professional and calm. Men in their 50’s tend to lose the ability to hear high pitched sounds. So if your voice goes into a high pitch mode, your best points could go unheard. Communicate in a clear concise way stating the facts only. This is where your answers from the questions above will help. Avoid phrases that begin with ""I feel"" or ""I think"". Your goal is to communicate the issue and not your thoughts or feelings. There is no thinking about the facts, they are either facts or they are fiction. Compromise. Be willing to compromise. When you compromise, both sides win. Creating a win-win is always the goal."
8,7 Tips To Manage Your Chemical Waste Disposal,social-issues," Chemical waste is a waste that is made from harmful chemicals. It could be a solid, liquid, or gaseous material that displays either a ""Hazardous Characteristic"" or is specifically ""listed"" by name as a hazardous waste. Chemical waste falls under regulations such as COSHH in the United Kingdom. To be considered hazardous, your chemical waste needs to display one or more of these 4 characteristics: Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity, and Toxicity. Any hazardous chemical waste must be categorized based on its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed. Due to the potential risks associated with the improper handling of chemical waste, its correct management and disposal are vital. There are strict regulations in place to prevent risks to both the environment and to human health caused by improper chemical waste disposal. Below, we have outlined some useful tips to follow to safely managing the disposal of your hazardous chemical waste. Identifying your waste is very paramount, as it is understanding the properties of hazardous waste and how to handle and dispose of it correctly. If you produce, transport, or receive hazardous waste you will have responsibilities under the Hazardous Waste Regulations. You can obtain more information on identifying hazardous waste and the Hazardous Waste Regulations from the Environment Agency. Hazardous waste requires specialist treatment and as such, a proper identification is very important. If you’re unsure if you waste is classified as hazardous or not, give us a call . It isn’t just the Waste regulations and the Hazardous Waste Regulations that you need to comply with. You also need to comply with numerous other pieces of legislation such as the WEEE regulations and the EU legislation. If you find waste legislation difficult to understand, do not worry because a professional waste management company can help. At All Waste Matters we have a knowledgeable team of experts with over 50 years of experience in the field that can advise you on the best disposal strategy for your chemical waste. Select an area of your facility that is: — Near where the waste is generated — Under the control of trained personnel — Out of the way of normal business activities Label the area with a ""Danger — Hazardous Waste"" sign and make the area easily accessible and recognizable for the traffic going in and out and for the external inspectors. Harmful chemical waste must be stored in leak-proof containers that are compatible with the harmful nature of the material. Never mix toxic waste with non-harmful materials. This ensures that your waste disposal activities do not result in reactions or corrosion in the container. Once mixed, the entire waste becomes harmful. Mixing the materials also makes recycling very difficult. Do not store it in a way that may rupture the container or cause leakage. Choose leak-proof containers that have impermeable surfaces and keep them always in good condition. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. When disposing of, it advisable to label the containers ‘harmful waste’ to give a clear description of the contents. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases. When deciding on a waste disposal plan for your hazardous chemical waste, consider what impacts on the environmental any proposed disposal solutions may have. Our environment is precious, so it is important that you choose a waste management service that considers the impact that your business’s waste has on the planet. Your designated waste management partner should also advise you on effective ways to reduce your waste. At All Waste Matter we work with you on your specific hazardous waste disposal plan, which should be designed to take inconsideration your social and corporate responsibility with the aim to preserve resources and work towards a sustainable consumption. A responsible partner is one that is fit to handle hazardous secondary materials and conducts proper disposal or recycling. Some common questions that you may ask when evaluating hazardous waste disposal companies include: What is the company’s history and ownership history? Have they been involved in any contamination? Does the company have a history of environmental compliance? Have they been subject to any enforcement actions? Is the company in compliance with all required permits? What is the general housekeeping at their facility? Does the company employ trained WAMITAB staff? Is the company financially sound? Does it have adequate environmental liability insurance and provisions for necessary closure and clean-up costs if necessary? In most cases it is possible to recycle your harmful chemical waste, including include acids, solvents, oil and metals. Not only is hazardous waste recycling beneficial to the environment, but it also increases the bottom line of your business. You can be sure of production efficiency and cost reduction due to cut costs on raw materials and waste disposal management. Finally, by recycling your chemical wastes, less hazardous waste is sent for treatment and disposal. This means less need for hazardous waste landfills and incinerators, as well as a decrease in energy used for those systems, which ultimately leads to less pollution."
9,Why Hazardous Waste Disposal Can Be A Problem,social-issues," Hazardous waste poses substantial or potential threats to the public health and the environment. It does not necessarily mean there is an immediate risk to human health, although with some waste this can happen. Characteristic hazardous wastes are materials that are known or tested to exhibit one or more of the following four traits: • ignitability • reactivity • corrosivity • toxicity They are normally classified by the regulatory authorities and can be orginated from non-specific sources, specific sources, or discarded chemical products. Hazardous waste is not only produced as by-products of industrial processes, even households generate potentially dangerous waste from items such as batteries, used computer equipment, and leftover paints or pesticides. Hazardous waste, which can be found in different physical states such as gaseous, liquids, or solids, cannot be disposed of by common means like other by-products of our everyday lives. Depending on the physical state of the toxic waste, special waste management treatments or processes might be required. Because this type of waste can harm humans, animals, and plants if they get in contact with the toxins, proper management and disposal of hazardous waste is paramount to reduce the health risks and inappropriate dumping of hazardous waste can have serious environmental and legal consequences. Identify the types of hazardous waste: The first step is to recognise the appropriate characteristics of hazardous waste. The European Waste Catalogue (EWC) provides classification codes based on 20 main categories. Within the list hazardous wastes are signified by entries where the code is followed by an asterisk. Those that are ‘Absolute Entries’ (i.e. are always hazardous waste) are shown in red and the letter ‘A’ appears beside them. For some entries the judgment on whether they are hazardous depends on the threshold of any dangerous substance that is present. These entries are ‘Mirror Entries’, They are coloured blue and the letter ‘M’ appears beside them. The European Waste catalogue is available at http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/31873.aspx Every business must establish an official process for identifying different types of hazardous waste found on their premises and remind employees about the right procedures and legal requirement for disposal. By creating a more educated workforce, businesses can prevent accidents and eliminate any confusion about the different types of hazardous waste. Improper storing of toxic waste on land can mean that hazardous materials, like chemicals in paint or batteries, infiltrate the soil and plant systems. Such toxins can also enter the water supply with life threatening consequences for people, animals and plants. How to dispose of toxic waste: Businesses must educate their employees on the responsible hazardous waste management. Improper disposal can contaminate the soil and pollute the air with major consequences for the environment. Beyond leading to serious health risks, improper toxic waste disposal can also decrease the property value in a given area and expose your business to fines and/or lawsuits. Here are some easy steps any business should follow when handling hazardous waste disposal: Step One: Reduce hazardous waste production. Before figuring out how to properly dispose of hazardous waste, see if you can make less of it. Try to think, ""How do I prevent hazardous waste?"" instead of ""How do I get rid of it?"". Some ways to reduce toxic waste include substituting hazardous materials with non-hazardous materials, rethink your manufacturing or operating practices, training employees in proper manufacturing and handling processes, improving existing equipment and replacing old equipment with more efficient ones. Recycling and donating can also help you reduce hazardous waste. Consider if another company could use your hazardous materials before you toss them. This might include paint, pesticides, and cleaning products. This may not work in some cases– no company would have use for radioactive sludge, for instance– but see if recycling and donating will work for your business. If someone else can use the hazardous materials, then they won’t go to waste. Step Two: Sort and store hazardous waste safely In order to do this, you must store your toxic waste in a secure place, using suitable containers that will stop it from escaping and labelling containers clearly with the type of waste they contain. You must use covers to stop hazardous waste blowing away and use waterproof covers if rain could cause contaminated run-off or prevent the waste from being reused. Step Three: Choose an authorised supplier to collect, recycle or dispose of your hazardous waste You can easily check if a carrier, broker or dealer is registered with the Environmental Agency here https://environment.data.gov.uk/public-register/view/search-waste-carriers-brokers Please don’t give your toxic waste to someone who can’t prove they are a legitimate waste carrier — they are likely to dump your rubbish to avoid paying waste disposal costs. Always obtain a waste transfer note as proof of the transfer to an authorised person. You must keep your transfer note for 2 years in case of inspections from an enforcement officer from your local council or the Environment Agency. Your transfer note must include enough information to help your designated waste management business handling your waste properly and dispose of it safely. Have a ‘waste management plan’ and be prepared for emergencies No matter what industry or the size of the business, every company should create a policy that clearly defines how the business reduces, handles, and disposes of hazardous waste. Putting your policy in writing will help you manage hazardous waste disposal and train employees on proper procedures. Any organisation should also develop a plan in case of an emergency. Accidents can happen despite a business’s best efforts to follow the latest guidelines and having an emergency response plan in place can contain the problem and prevent illness and injury. Because we all have a responsibility to keep the environment clean, hiring a professional company that can not only dispose of your hazardous waste safely and complying with the latest legislation, but that can also advise and help your business implement the right policies, it can save you time and money and go a long way in ensuring the health and safety of everyone around you."
10,The 7 Most Common Metals That Can Be Recycled,social-issues," Metal recycling involves the recovery and processing of scrap metal from end-of-life products or structures, as well as from manufacturing scrap, so that it can be introduced as a raw material in the production of new goods. This may involve a number of steps such as identifying, recovering, refining and reclaiming precious or non-precious metals. Why refining and recovering metals is important Recycling in general has become increasingly important in our society. We are accustomed to hearing the three R’s of recycling (reduce, reuse, recycle) to include paper, plastics, bottles, cans, and cardboard; however, many people do not know that you can recycle precious and non-precious metal as well. There is a wide range of reasons why you should refine and recover your metal rather than wasting it. Recycling metal reduces pollution, saves resources, reduces waste going to landfills and prevents the destruction of habitats from mining new ore. Scrap metal is a continuous resource. Because it can be re-melted and reshaped into new products countless times, recycled metal is a resource that will never be depleted. The production of new metal releases a far greater amount of greenhouse gas emissions compared with making products from recycled metal. These emissions may influence climate change and may also cause harmful levels of air pollution in cities, resulting in potential respiratory health problems for the residents. Recovering precious metals from end-of -life products can also generate a good extra income. During these uncertain economic times investors have fallen back to the more stable commodities market, with precious metal prices (Gold and Silver in particular) rocketing as a result. Gold, silver, platinum and other precious metals can still be mined from natural sources. But mining is very costly and in many cases, it is becoming easier and more cost-effective to recover those metals from devices that already contain them. A ton of recycled cell phones actually contains more gold than a ton of gold ore that comes from most mines. How to identify metals to refine You can easily use a magnet to separate ferrous from not ferrous metals. Ferrous metals contain iron which in most cases makes it magnetic. If a metal is non-ferrous it doesn’t have iron in it, so it won’t stick to a magnet. Various other tests can be made to determine the type of metal and if it can be recycled or not. The most common is the appearance test, which consists in studying the physical features of the metal. Sometimes this can be quite difficult as there are metals that look similar to each other. Gold and brass, for instance, are often being confused as they have a very similar colour. After a deeper inspection, however, you should notice that gold is heavier and brass produces a bell like vibrating sound if you try to hit it. Other useful tests are the fracture test, which helps you identify a metal by analysing its broken part, and the spark test, which looks at the spark produced by touching the metal to a grinder. To identify precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum you can also follow some simple rules. Precious metals aren’t magnetic — if the metal attracts the magnet, you know it must be an alloy mixture and not a precious metal. Gold won’t scratch glass — real gold is soft and malleable and won’t leave a scratch on a glass surface like other metals similar to gold do. You can also try to run the gold piece on a section of tile. If the piece leaves a black mark, it doesn’t contain pure gold. High-quality gold pieces will leave a yellow or gold streak on the tile’s surface. Silver feels warm to the touch — silver will feel closer to your body temperature when you hold it in your hand and it is also a great heat conductor. Precious metals rub off differently — if you rub an item against a cloth, real gold will leave no mark. With silver items, expect just the opposite. Real silver or silver-plated items will turn the cloth black. Common metals that can be recycle and how to identify them – Aluminium One of most unique qualities of aluminium is that it is quite light — three times lighter than iron. Aluminium is also completely non-magnetic, so it won’t stick to even the strongest of magnets. Aluminium doesn’t rust, which makes it very durable. Typical use in: Drink cans, Window frames, Cooking pots, Food packaging, Boats and aircrafts, Overhead power lines – Copper Copper has a natural pink tone that can darken to look red, yellow or orange over time. When exposed to excess water or oxygen, copper can turn green or black in places where it has been excessively handled. Copper is notoriously soft, so it can be difficult to keep a piece perfectly smooth when working with the copper. If the copper piece is thin enough, you may even be able to bend it with your bare hands. You may also knock on the piece and listen to the sound that it makes. Real copper will have a deep and mellow sound, as opposed to brass, which can be high-pitched and tinny. Typical use in: Wires, Motors, Roofing, Plumbing, Cookware and cook utensils, Rainspouts – Brass The word brass refers to any alloy that contains copper and zinc. Different proportions of these metals produce different colours, but the most common types of brass have a muted yellow colour, or a yellow-brown appearance similar to bronze. These brass alloys are widely used in machined parts and screws. The hundreds of different combinations means there is no single way to identify all brass. That said, the colour of the brass is usually distinct enough to separate it from copper. Typical use in: Lamp and plug fittings, Electrical terminals, Locks, Marine engines, Valve guides, Door lock components, Wind instruments, Radiator cores, tubes and tanks – Gold Gold is a shiny yellow colour and does not have an oxide. Golds melting point is 1064.18°C (1947.52°F). It is very soft and is very heavy. It also has a high electrical conductivity (more electricity can pass through it) which means that the connectors on many cords have gold plating. Gold is nonferrous so it won’t stick to a magnet. Typical use in: Jewellery, Coinage, Watches, Electrical connectors, Artificial limb joints, Dentistry, Computers, Electronics. – Lead is a dull grey when unpolished but it becomes a lot shinier when polished. Lead has a relatively low melting point, 327°C (621°F). Lead is nonferrous and it is even heavier than iron It’s a relatively soft metal, and can be carved with a pocket knife and is used in pencils. It is commonly used on roofs and in construction. Typical use in: Pipes, Flashing, Gutters, Downspouts, Conductor Heads, Ammunition, Cable sheathing, Weights for lifting, Weight belts for diving, Radiation protection. – Steel Steel is a dense, relatively heavy material that easily rusts, so the surface must be painted, galvanized, cleaned often, encased in concrete, or protected in some other way. Freshly grinded carbon steel looks shiny and metallic; otherwise it has a dull, dark (but still metallic) colour. On a grinder, steel produces lots of sparks. As a rule, the greater the spark bursts, the higher the carbon content of the steel. Typical use in: Bars, Rods, Rails, Wires, Pipes, Automotive parts, Appliances, Fittings, Flanges, Valves – Silver is a soft, ductile, malleable, lustrous metal. It has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals. Silver is stable in oxygen and water, but tarnishes when exposed to sulphur compounds in air or water to form a black sulphide layer. Typical use in: Jewellery, Mirror manufacturing, Dental fillings, Silver nitrate films for photography and radiography, Electrical contacts, Silver-cadmium batteries, Silver-zinc batteries. At All Waste Matters we have over 50 years of experience in specialist refining of precious metals in a number of industry sectors. We can help you turn seemingly insignificant scraps into profit for your company. We are both silver refiners and gold refiners and thanks to our extensive expertise we can ensure we will return the maximum value of your material."
11,Precious metal refining do’s and don’ts,social-issues," Precious metal refining is the separation of precious metals such as gold and silver from not noble-metalliferous materials. The process for refining precious metals is quite sophisticated and in most cases the intervention of a professional metal refiner is required. The most common procedures for isolating noble-metalliferous materials are called pyrolysis or hydrolysis. In pyrolysis, the noble-metalliferous products are released from the other materials by solidifying in a melt to become cinder and then poured off or oxidized. In hydrolysis, the noble-metalliferous products are dissolved either in aqua regia (consisting of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid) or in hydrochloric acid and chlorine gas in solution. Subsequently, certain metals can be precipitated or reduced directly with a salt, gas, organic, and/or nitro hydrate connection. After that, they go through cleaning stages or are recrystallized. The precious metals are separated from the metal salt by calcination. The noble-metalliferous materials are hydrolysed first and thermally prepared (pyrolysed) thereafter. The processes are better yielding when using catalysts that may sometimes contain precious metals themselves. When using catalysts, the recycling product is removed in each case and driven several times through the cycle. If you think you could recover precious metals from your scrap, it’s always a good idea to ask for professional help from a reputable precious metal refiner. All Waste Matters have over 50 years’ experience in successful gold and silver recovery from a vast array of industries and over this time we have built up a huge repertoire of techniques for recovering gold and precious metals from even the most unlikely of sources. Tapping into our wide experience, we have compiled a list of dos and don’ts that we believe can save time and money when working with a precious metal refiner. Do’s: Do provide enough information to your refiner. The more information you provide when asking for a quote or having your samples analysed the more accurate your quote is going to be. The physical composition of your scrap will guide the refiner on what process to undertake and it will influence the value of your return. Do visit your refiner. There are very few secrets in refining precious metals so ask your refiner to show you their facilities and the processes they use, including the lab where the materials are being analysed. Ask them if they refine your material in their own plant or if they a broker. Do understand how your samplings are being analysed. Understand what process is used and what level of accuracy they can grant can influence the amount of gold or silver that they can refine from your scrap. Newer technologies are introduced constantly so make sure their lab is up to speed with the latest techniques. Do evaluate the experience of refiner. If you are not confident that your refiner has the training and skills to handle your material properly, go elsewhere. Do make sure that your refiner is in compliance with all the current regulations. Check if your precious metal refiner is fully licensed with the Environment Agency. Being responsible will protect you from future liability or regulatory action. Remember, if the refiner improperly disposes of your waste, you are co-responsible by law. Do try to eliminate as much extraneous material from your scrap before collection and book your collection when you have a reasonable amount. It saves time and money to prepare your scrap for collection making sure your refiner will pick up only what is worth of being refined. Ask your precious metal refiner to help implementing some best-practice guidelines for you, if in doubt. Do make sure that your refiners’ terms will meet the needs for your business. What is most important to your business? Highest quality of the return, flexible return options, market flexibility, your refiner being local to you or something else? Finding a partner that can meet your needs will reduce stress in running your business. Don’ts: Don’t choose a refiner just because they are local to you. Contact 2–3 businesses and ask them to provide a quote — which they should do free of charge — and then evaluate costs vs. benefits of using each partner. You may find that a refiner a little further away from you is actually providing the most cost-effective service and can guarantee a better return, which compensate for higher travel costs. Don’t hold your refining because you think the prices of precious metals are going up. Trust the best quote provided by your chosen partner and have your metals refined. It is always easier and more profitable to sell the pure product than to market the unknown scrap. Don’t mix precious metals unnecessarily. Most refiners have minimum percentage amounts for the process to be worthwhile. You will receive better settlements if you separate your scrap by metal that can be refined. Don’t be too happy if you receive a much larger return than you expected from your scrap. It is usually an indication that your processes are not efficient since waste should be kept to a minimum. Ask your precious metal refiner to work with you to help minimise your wastage. From our experience these are some of the most common aspects to take in consideration when working with a precious metal refiner. Partnering with the right business and establishing an efficient way of working together can provide you with extra funds that you might not otherwise have been able to attain. Finding a service that have experience with your industry, offers straightforward collection and refining processes, and is candid about their methods will ensure that you make the most of the deal in every respect."

13,What is biohazardous waste?,social-issues," Laboratories, universities, hospitals and clinics produce different types of healthcare related waste. However, not all of them are considered hazardous for the human / animal health or the environment. Biohazardous waste is any biological waste that is potentially dangerous for human or animal health, such as: • human blood and its components, in liquid or semi-liquid form, dried or not • human bodily fluids (including semen, vaginal secretions, cerebral spinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, and saliva), in liquid or semi-liquid form, dried or not • human pathological waste: all human tissues, organs, and body parts • animal waste: all animal carcasses and body parts • microbiological waste: laboratory waste containing infectious agents (including discarded specimen cultures, stocks of etiologic agents, discarded live and attenuated viruses, wastes from the production of biologicals and serums, disposable culture dishes, and devices used to transfer, inoculate and mix cultures) • sharps waste: sharp medical utensils such as scalpels, needles, glass slides, lancets, glass pipettes, broken glass that have been contaminated with potentially infectious material. To help laboratories and healthcare operators navigate through the strict legislation on hazardous waste disposal, the Department of Health has created the following classification: Offensive waste ‘Offensive waste’ is non-clinical waste that’s non-infectious and doesn’t contain pharmaceutical or chemical substances, but may be unpleasant to anyone who comes into contact with it. You must segregate healthcare offensive waste from both clinical and mixed municipal wastes. If you’ve produced more than 7kg of municipal offensive waste, or have more than one bag in a collection period, you must segregate it from any mixed municipal waste. If you’ve produced less, you can dispose of your municipal offensive waste in your mixed municipal waste (‘black bag’). Plaster and similar wastes Most plaster waste is non-infectious. It should be kept separately from any plaster waste that’s infectious, which must be placed in the bagged infectious clinical waste stream. Waste medicines A medicine is considered to be cytotoxic or cytostatic for waste classification purposes if it’s any of the following: • acutely toxic • carcinogenic • mutagenic • toxic for reproduction Sharps and related waste The safe management and disposal of sharps waste is vital to ensure the risks associated with handling sharps are eliminated and to ensure compliance with the Hazardous Waste Regulations (Special Waste Regulations in Scotland). The disposal of sharps waste is determined by the medicinal contamination. To ensure compliance with the Hazardous Waste Regulations the correct segregation and storage of sharps in colour coded bins and special containers is essential. • Orange bins - For the storage and disposal of sharps not containing or contaminated with medicines, such as sharps used for blood samples and acupuncture • Yellow bins - For the storage and disposal of sharps contaminated with or containing medicines or anaesthetics • Purple bins - For the disposal of sharps and medicines with Cyto-toxic or Cyto-static contents or contamination • Blue bins - For the disposal of out of date drugs, used drug denaturing kits and discarded items from use in the handling of pharmaceuticals such as bottles or boxes with residues, gloves, masks, connecting tubes, syringe bodies and drug vials Anatomical waste. Anatomical waste from operating theatres requires special containment and must be stored, transported and disposed of as hazardous waste to ensure that there is no risk to human health or to the environment. Anatomical waste includes: • Body parts • Organs • Blood bags and blood preserves Laboratory chemicals and photochemicals Hazardous chemical waste – includes: • Wastes classified as ‘hazardous’ in The Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005 amended 2016 (Schedules 1 and 2) or in The European Waste Catalogue (EWC) ‘List of Wastes’. • Other wastes which display one or more of the hazardous properties (HP1 to HP15) listed in the Regulations (see the Environment Agency Guidance WM3). Any medical supplies or other equipment (such as gloves, towels, used bandages and dressings, tubes) that have come into contact with hazardous materials and consequently exhibit more than trace elements of these materials are themselves also classified as hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Act includes a ‘Duty of Care’ which requires all persons involved in the handling of waste, including producers, to take reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that: • Waste is only kept, treated, deposited or disposed of in accordance with a waste management licence or other authorisation; • Waste does not escape from the control of the holder; • Waste is only transferred to authorised persons such as registered waste carriers or licensed disposal operations permitted to accept that type of waste; • All transfers / movements of the waste are accompanied by an adequate written description of the waste which will allow waste to be identified and subsequently handled correctly.

14,How to properly dispose of paint and consequences for not doing it correctly,social-issues," Some types of paint are considered hazardous waste so they need proper and safe disposal.  These types of paint can contain heavy metal (or other harmful ingredients), they can be flammable and are not suitable for reuse after long storage. Also some water based paints such as varnishes, stains, sealers etc. may contain hazardous ingredients such as mercury and so therefore are classified as chemical waste. The use of heavy metals in paint has raised concerns due to their toxicity at high levels of exposure and since they build up in the food chain. Another harmful material that can be found in paint is lead. Lead is normally added to paint to speed drying, increase durability, retain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. Paint with significant lead content is still used in industry and by the military. For example, leaded paint is sometimes used to paint roadways and parking lot lines. Lead, a poisonous metal, can damage nerve connections (especially in young children) and cause blood and brain disorders. Because of lead's low reactivity and solubility, lead poisoning usually only occurs in cases when it is dispersed, such as when sanding lead-based paint prior to repainting. Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for aerospace and automobile refinishing applications, too. Zinc chromate has been used as a pigment for artists' paint, known as zinc yellow or yellow 36. It is highly toxic and fortunately now rarely used. Antifouling paint (or bottom paint) is used to protect the hulls of boats from fouling by marine organisms. Antifouling paint protects the surface from corrosion and prevents drag on the ship from any build-up of marine organisms. These paints have contained organotin compounds such as tributyltin, which are considered to be toxic chemicals with negative effects on humans and the environment. Tributyltin compounds are moderately to highly persistent organic pollutants that bioconcentrate up the marine predators' food chain. One common example is it leaching from marine paints into the aquatic environment, causing irreversible damage to the aquatic life. Tributyltin has also been linked to obesity in humans, as it triggers genes that cause the growth of fat cells. The label of an oil-based paint will say ""oil-based"" or ""alkyd,"" or it will instruct you to clean brushes with mineral spirits or turpentine. Paints of this type are toxic and they can cause great damage to the environment (including humans and animals) if not disposed of properly. Latex or water-based paint, on the other hand, is not consider hazardous waste and it can enjoy many reincarnations after its initial use. Latex paints are those that clean up with soap and water. They're very common for both interior and exterior painting. However, even this type of panit needs to be proper disposed of or recycled. Specifically, it is not advisable to pour latex paint into drains, onto the ground, or into creeks, streams or rivers. Disposing of paint this way introduces contaminants into the air, soil and ground water that can eventually work their way into the food chain. When considering how to dispose of large quantities of unused paint, always ask for professional advice. Any reputable hazardous waste disposal service will be able to assist you. Here are some measures you can take to reduce environmental impact of you paint consume. Choose a low VOCs paint if possible Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted by various solids or liquids, many of which have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Solvents in traditional paints often contain high quantities of VOCs. Low VOC paints can improve indoor air quality and reduce urban smog. The beneficial characteristics of such paints include low odour, clean air, and safer technology, as well as excellent durability and a washable finish. Low-VOC paint types include latex (water-based), recycled latex (water-based), acrylic, and milk paint. The labels of paint cans can be checked for the following information: To be considered low-VOC, the paint should contain"
15,How Do You Dispose Of Healthcare Waste?,social-issues," Whether you run a hospital, a general practitioner surgery, a pharmacy or a laboratory, you have to deal with healthcare waste. This includes expired pharmaceuticals, bags and vials containing traces of toxic drugs, spilled liquids and contaminated body tissues or fluids. In addition, healthcare waste can include the waste produced in the course of healthcare procedures undertaken by patients at home (dialysis, insulin injections, etc.). About 10–25% of healthcare waste is regarded as hazardous and may create a variety of health risks. Disposing of pharmaceutical and other chemical waste such as lab waste can be highly problematic. Healthcare waste can be classified in: • Infectious waste. Any waste that is suspected to contain pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi) in sufficient concentration or quantity to cause disease, such as cultures and stocks of infectious agents from laboratory work, waste from surgery and autopsies on patients with infectious diseases, waste from infected patients in isolation wards and infected animals from laboratories. • Pathological waste. It consists of tissues, organs, body parts, human foetuses and animal carcasses, blood, and body fluids. Within this category, recognizable human or animal body parts are also called anatomical waste. • Sharps. These are items that could cause cuts or puncture wounds, including needles, hypodermic needles, scalpel and other blades, knives, infusion sets, saws, broken glass, and nails. Whether or not they are infected, such items are usually considered as highly hazardous waste. • Pharmaceutical waste. This includes expired, unused, spilt, and/or contaminated medicines, drugs and vaccines that are no longer required and need to be disposed of appropriately. The category also includes discarded items used in the handling of pharmaceuticals, such as bottles or boxes with residues, gloves, masks, connecting tubing, and drug vials. • Genotoxic waste. This type of waste is highly hazardous and may have mutagenic or carcinogenic properties. It raises serious safety problems, both inside hospitals or practices and also after disposal. Genotoxic waste may include certain drugs used in chemotherapy or body fluids containing chemicals and radioactive residues. • Chemical waste. Waste in this category consists of discarded solid, liquid, and gaseous chemicals, for example from diagnostic and experimental work and from cleaning, housekeeping, and disinfecting procedures. Chemical waste is considered to be hazardous if it is toxic, corrosive, flammable or reactive in any way. • Radioactive waste. This includes solid, liquid, and gaseous materials contaminated with radionuclides. It is produced as a result of procedures such as in-vitro analysis of body tissue and fluid, in-vivo organ imaging and tumour localization, and various investigative and therapeutic practices. It is important that all healthcare waste is safely disposed of to avoid any possible negative impact on the environment and on the public safety. One of the biggest challenges of managing healthcare waste is that this type of waste contains potentially harmful microorganisms that can infect hospital patients, health workers and the general public. Other potential hazards may include drug-resistant microorganisms which spread from health facilities into the environment. The disposal of untreated healthcare wastes in landfills can lead to the contamination of drinking, surface and ground waters. For all these reasons, management of healthcare waste requires special attention and diligence. These are the most important steps to follow: Reduce the volume of wastes generated and ensure proper hazardous waste segregation. Waste can be minimised by careful stock keeping. For example, you can keep a record of the amount of each pharmaceutical product that is needed and avoid ordering too much. Establish a ""first in first out"" system, so that the packages which are going to expire first are used first. Wherever possible, try to negotiate take-back agreements with suppliers, whereby the suppliers accept and dispose of pharmaceuticals that you cannot use. The key to effective management of healthcare waste is segregation (separation) and identification of the waste. Appropriate handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste by type reduces costs and helps protect public health. Segregation should always be the responsibility of the waste producer, it should take place as close as possible to where the waste is generated, and it should be maintained in storage areas and during transport. Ensure proper hazardous waste transportation Before transportation of the waste, dispatch documents should be completed, all arrangements should be made between the waste producer, carrier and treatment facility. Vehicles or containers used for the transportation of healthcare waste should not be used for the transportation of any other material. They should be kept locked at all times, except when loading and unloading. Articulated or demountable trailers (temperature-controlled if required) are particularly suitable, as they can easily be left at the site of waste production. Other systems may be used, such as specially designed large containers or skips; however, open-topped skips or containers should never be used for transporting health-care waste. Choose a safe and environmentally compatible treatment of hazardous healthcare waste In recent years, many waste brokering companies have sprung up subcontracting their customers waste to the cheapest bidder, often with no idea if in fact these contractors are licensed to handle such materials. If in doubt please do contact the Environment Agency who will be able to tell you if the company has the correct licensing. As well as the obvious dangers to human health, as the producer of the waste, it is your legal responsibility to ensure correct disposal and avoid prosecution. All Waste Matters offer specialist chemical and laboratory waste disposal services to an extensive client base throughout the UK. We started out as a lab waste disposal service for commercial labs but we have now extended our services nationwide to a large customer base of laboratories and health practices. From our fully licensed waste management facility site in Kent, we can offer a tailored hazardous waste disposal and collection service of any unwanted chemicals and laboratory waste."
16,What Is The Difference Between Offensive And Hazardous Waste?,social-issues," The world of waste can be a tangled web of legislation, regulations and rules, which sometimes are difficult to understand and in which it is easy to get lost. In our 50 years of experience dealing with companies of any size and from a variety of different industries in the UK, we can say that a sizable percentage of organisations doesn’t know the difference between Offensive and Hazardous waste. Offensive Waste Offensive waste is non-clinical waste which is non-infectious and doesn’t contain pharmaceutical or chemical substances, but may be unpleasant to anyone who comes into contact with it. The residual health risk of offensive waste is considered low when segregated properly. Most households and businesses generate some form of non-infectious or offensive waste every day, which could include: Municipal offensive waste, i.e. hygiene waste and sanitary protection like nappies and incontinence pads; Healthcare offensive waste, i.e. outer dressings and protective clothing like masks, gowns and gloves that aren’t contaminated with body fluids, and sterilised laboratory waste. Offensive waste does not need to be transported as dangerous goods. This means collection and disposal of the waste is significantly cheaper than that of clinical or other hazardous waste. However, safe disposal of offensive waste is a critical and sensitive issue that requires attention in every working environment. There can be potential risks of infection and illness from cross-infection, if correct hygiene precautions are not taken. Offensive waste can include: human and animal waste from a non-infectious source; medical/veterinary items of disposable equipment such as gowns, plaster casts etc; plasters (minor first aid or self-care) generated by personal use; animal hygiene wastes (animal bedding, dog faeces etc); wastes from non­healthcare activities, for example wastes from body piercing or application of tattoos. Hazardous waste Unlike offensive waste, hazardous waste is anything that presents a substantial threat to public health or to the environment. The list of items that are to be considered hazardous waste is very long, although the most common include: Paints, inks and pigments Solvents, pesticides and cleaning products Vehicle fluids such as antifreeze, oil and brake cleaners Electronic waste such as computer monitors Clinical waste is also considered hazardous due to its infectious nature. The definition of clinical waste covers any waste arising from medical, nursing, dental, or veterinary practices, including waste produced during investigation, treatment, care or research procedures. Strict controls apply to hazardous waste from the point of its production, to its movement, management, and recovery or disposal. Disposing of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste at the same landfill site is illegal. If your business produces or handles hazardous waste you must take all such measures as are reasonable in order to: Prevent the production of waste Reuse, recover or recycle your waste Dispose of your hazardous waste safely Disposal of hazardous waste should be considered only when re-using, recovering and recycling are not viable options. Any organisation that produces hazardous waste needs to follow some key steps to make sure that they are dealing with it safely. Identify the hazardous substances in the workplace and the risks they pose to people's health or the environment. Decide what precautions are needed to eliminate the risks, or reduce them to a level which will protect the environment and people's health. Eliminate the hazardous substances wherever possible - if this isn't possible, control exposure to a level which will protect the health of the environment or people who could be affected. Implement control measures and ensure that they are used and maintained. This includes making sure that everyone is consistently carrying out these procedures to avoid any health risks. Monitor exposure - if the substances are airborne, it is important to monitor workers' exposure to ensure they comply with workplace exposure limits. Carry out appropriate health surveillance - in certain circumstances, you may need to provide medical checks for workers to ensure their health is not being damaged. Prepare plans and procedures to deal with accidents, incidents and emergencies - set up a health and safety management system. Inform, train and supervise employees to help ensure their health is not damaged when using hazardous substances. At All Waste Matters we can count on a knowledgeable team of experts who will guide you through all the steps of the process. No matter your waste management requirements, large or small, liquid or solid, hazardous or not, we are able to offer a complete waste disposal package to suit your organisation’s needs and to comply with the latest regulations."

19,"Abhyanga, ayurvedic massage",social-issues," Originally from India, this massage is often done with warm sesame oil to make the senses travel and re-balance our body and its functions. A care particularly indicated to the people in a hurry, under stress... And to all those who have a hard time ""stopping"". Explanations with Jean-Guy De Gabriac, trainer in well-being massages for spas. For several years now, Abhyanga massage has been one of those ""massage of the world"" successfully offered by institutes and spas, sometimes under the name of ""ayurvedic massage"". An unsuitable name for a treatment that is nevertheless well taken from Ayurveda, this traditional Indian medicine whose name literally means ""the science of life"" in Sanskrit. Based on the 7 energy centers of the body - the famous chakras - the Abhyanga massage is above all a re-balancing treatment. The principle? The masseur will act on the nadis, the paths of energy on which pressure points are distributed, to allow the vital energy - the prana in the Ayurvedic tradition - to circulate freely and harmoniously throughout the body. The goal: a general well-being, both physical and mental. A care of harmony Through circular and sliding pressures, friction, accupressions but also stretching, the Abhyanga will bring relaxation and harmony to the body, thanks in particular to its moderate and fluid rhythm. In reality, this care also exists in a much more tonic form - a variant called Vishesh - which is also the one practiced in India. Do not be surprised if, during a trip on site, the care provided to you is much brighter than what is done in the West. For stressed and nervous people The properties of Abhyanga? They are numerous but it is notably famous for acting on our moods, helping us to temper them. Ayurveda, in fact, makes it possible to regulate wonderfully the temperaments called doshas (Kapha - earth and water, Pitta - fire and water - and Vata - air and ether). But it is probably nervous, stressed or stressed people that can be the most profitable.

20,How much does your lifestyle cost you?,social-issues," What’s your new year’s resolution? For many people, it will be to curb their spending and save more — in 2017, it was the fourth most popular resolution, according to Harper’s Bazaar. Before you head to the comparison sites to switch your bank accounts and energy providers, why not start saving by looking a little closer to home? Whether it’s your morning coffee during your commute to work or those Friday night drinks, your lifestyle could be costing you a small fortune. Crunching the numbers is paper cups retailer, Inn Supplies; so, just how much is your lifestyle costing you? Coffee Britain’s coffee culture is big business at the moment. The UK’s coffee shop market was worth £3.4 billion in 2016, up 37% from £2.4 billion in 2011. What’s more, in the next five years experts predict that the market will grow by a further 29% to reach a worth of £4.3 billion. The incredible growth of Britain’s coffee shops is fuelled by our willingness to shell out on hot drinks. Research carried out on behalf of MyVoucherCodes has found that we visit a coffee shop three times a week on average — or 152 times a year. Using Costa Coffee as a price reference — the chain with the largest number of outlets in the UK — the average price of a medium latte is £2.45. Based on the number of times we’re likely to visit annually, this means our caffeine addiction is costing us £382.20 per year. If you were to pop into your local coffee store five days a week — once for each of your morning commutes — you’d be spending a huge £637! Let’s compare this with how much you could save if you make your coffee at home. According to Douwe Egberts, a pack of its 250g ground coffee will make approximately 30 cups of coffee. Assuming that a 1kg bag will cost around £15 (according to Amazon prices correct as of December 2017), this would deliver a price per cup of around 13p. Of course, you’ll also need to factor in milk, sugar and the associated energy and water costs. However, even if this price was to rise to 50p per cup — which is an unlikely high — you could still slash the cost of three coffees per week to £78. Alcohol In Britain, 29 million people over the age of 16 drank alcohol in the UK, according to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. While the UK clearly has a thirst for alcohol, how we’re drinking it is changing. One YouGov study has found that in 2017, 15% of British adults preferred to drink alcohol at home. The country is clearly split between pub and home drinkers, with the latter growing in popularity as the number of pubs declines. Beer is the most popular type of alcoholic beverage in the UK (35.6%), followed by wine (32.9%) and spirits (21.6%). 17% of Brits head to the pub 26 times a year (once every fortnight), research by Ritz Crisp & Thin shows — so how much is this habit costing us? The average price of a pint of lager is £3.58. Assuming three drinks per visit, each trip to the pub will cost £10.74 on drinks alone. Over the course of the year, this would rack up £279.24 — a cost that could be even greater if you were to increase the frequency of visits or the number of pints consumed. It’s a similar story for wine drinkers — the average price of a small glass of wine as of November 2017 was £3.74, according to the Office for National Statistics. Assuming two glasses of wine per each of the 26 yearly visits, and this will set you back £194.48. In contrast, enjoying a drink at home could lead to considerable cost savings. June 2017’s industry figures show that a bottle of wine costs £5.56. With roughly just over four 175ml glasses in each bottle, the associated cost per glass of drinking wine at home shrinks to £1.39 — representing a £2.35 saving. Likewise, consider too that you can pick up a crate of lager for roughly the same price as one visit to the pub, based on our calculations. Of course, if you’re not ready to ditch your trips to the pub, you can always choose a soft drink while you’re at the bar. These are often considerably cheaper than their alcoholic alternatives. For example, a diluted juice drink can cost under a pound, while a cola or lemonade costs approximately £2.20 — £1.38 less than the average cost of a pint. Smoking Another popular new year’s resolution is kicking the habit and stopping smoking. In the UK, a packet of 20 cigarettes costs £10.40. For a 20-a-day smoker, this gives a weekly cost of £72.80, a monthly cost of £291.20 and a yearly cost of £3,494! If you are a smoker, the NHS’ Smokefree service features a handy online calculator so you can work out exactly how much you could stand to save should you stop smoking. There you have it — just how much your lifestyle is costing you. If you’ve resolved to make 2018 the year you start your health kick, it could be wise to think about reducing your alcohol intake or stopping smoking. Not only will your body thank you for it, so will your bank balance! Of course, you still need to enjoy yourself! However, now you know roughly how much you’re paying out annually on these lifestyle habits, perhaps you’ll be able to make better decisions on everything from your post-work pint to early-morning coffee."

1,The dangers of social smoking,social-issues," Are you a low-level or occasional smoker? Let’s see if you are indeed classed as a low-level or occasional smoker. There are three main groups to be aware of: The binge smoker — someone who smokes a lot but only at certain times in the week, such as weekends but not week days. The low-level smoker — someone who smokes a small amount of cigarettes on a daily basis or only on occasion. The social smoker — someone who will likely only smoke in certain social settings, such as hanging with friends, the pub or in town. What are the risks of smoking socially? The main point is that there is no safe level of smoking whether you’re low level or an occasional smoker, the danger to your health is apparent whether you have the occasional cigarette or a cigarette an hour. This statement has been underlined by online resource iCanQuit, which has been developed by the Cancer Institute NSW, when looking into the health effects of irregular smoking. According to iCanQuit, people who are smoking between 1 and 4 cigarettes on a daily basis are almost tripling their risk of dying from heart disease or lung cancer. Light and intermittent smokers are also found to be at a similar risk of suffering from cardiovascular disease as an everyday smoker. A nationally representative study which was published in the American Journal of Health Promotion and involved over 39,000 people has also suggested links between social smokers and health risks. In the research found there were over ten per cent of the group that classed themselves as social smokers and 17 per cent of them said they were current smokers. Regardless of the class of smoker around 75% of current and social smokers were found to have high blood pressure and around 54% had high levels of cholesterol. This is after the researchers had adjusted for differences in factors like demographics and obesity. Kate Gawlik, the assistant professor of clinical nursing at The Ohio State University and the study’s lead author, stressed that ""doctors and nurses need to educate patients that social smoking is still a major health risk and is not a long-term healthy choice"". She also advised: ""Not smoking at all is the best way to go. Even smoking in a social situation is detrimental to your cardiovascular health."" iCanQuit also reported that males who were occasional smokers were 60% more likely to die earlier than non-smoking males. Whereas, females who were low-level smokers were found to typically lose between 4 and 6 years of their lives than the non-smoking females. iCanQuit therefore was keen to point out: ""Even if you smoke occasionally or just on weekends, you are still a smoker – and the health dangers of low level smoking are serious and significant."""
2,How to avoid scam on threesome dating?,social-issues," Online scammers mainly aim at people of different income levels, backgrounds and ages throughout the world. There is not any specific group which is more prone to become a prey of a scam. The practice of Scamming is successful because it looks like real. It seems to fulfill your desire and needs. Scammers always attempt to mould you by inducing your nature to create the automatic reply they need. Here are few tips how to identify and avoid scammers at online threesome dating sites. Be cautious in the threesome dating online scene. Use your emotional intelligence. If you have an ok profile without a personal photo on any threesome dating website you will rarely ever get any answers from females. If you get lots of love letters from attractive good looking woman, you should think yourself: Would you be able to step into love with the profile you made that fast? What is there that could make her fall in love that quickly? The first thing that creates an impression that the person who is communicating with you is a scammer is the mails. Scam letters are sent to a lot of people, are very neutrally, impersonally made for bulk use. The scam-emails can often be used for both the sexes, male and female. They will mention to you that they liked your pictures or description although you don't have a self description or photo on internet. Scamming artist fall quickly in love, they will address you very quickly sweetheart, darling, baby or love honey. If anyone is interested in you will get a number of questions detailed about your hobbies, life, before the individual decides to meet you. A scammer artist never asks you regarding your personal details. They will use to talk in general manner: How was your day? How is everyone at home? How are you today? Scamming letters are often a different thing from what you mention to them. If you discuss about particular your things, they will not even remember one week later and keep on saying that the season is ok. If you try to keep in contact for few months and if your date shows great interest and pretends to be willing to spend his entire life with you, ask yourself why is he/she still searching for online love? People who love somebody, will quickly delete their own profile from the threesome dating website, since it's not a big issue to post a new addition if they become single again. If you view your lover still online, you can make a new contact id as a new user from a separate email address and check what reply you get. If your mate is willing to come to you and loves you like anything, you should not get him/her two times. Never send any money for tickets and visas! Go to the person's place or country and visit him/her there. Use well-established, trustworthy marriage or threesome dating agencies for arranging and meeting trips."
3,Plastic is polluting our oceans,social-issues," Plastic continues to pollute our oceans and there are no signs of it slowing down. Around the world, we are producing over 300 million tonnes of plastic each year due to its cheapness and versatility when it comes to packaging – creating an environmental problem that needs to be tackled. In 2015, 322 million tonnes of plastic were produced which would equal the same weight as 900 Empire State Buildings! We have grown to become very dependable upon plastic to the point where it has adapted itself into our everyday lives, nevertheless, it has been estimated that around 50% of the plastic that we use is only used once and then disposed of. Only 12% of plastic is recycled, ranging from plastic bags to plastic bottles. When we looked to see where the greatest amount of plastic is being used, not surprisingly it came to packaging which accounted for 40% of its use. Every year, it has been estimated that 500 billion plastic bags are used around the world. However, the UK government has taken a step in the right direction by making large shops (those with over 250 employees) in England charge 5p for carrier bags. But has this helped? Since the scheme was introduced in 2015, England saw that the number of plastic bags used went down by 80% which has benefitted this environmental issue. Currently there is around 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic currently in our waters. Dame Ellen MacArthur claimed that the amount of plastic in our oceans will eventually outweigh the number of fish by 2050. Not only does this have a threat on the existing sea creatures, such as turtles (at least 50% have consumed plastic), it also will have a huge impact on their habitats which could cause great damage to different environments below the water and create everlasting problems. However, it has been reported that more than 8 million tonnes of plastic is dumped into our oceans every year – this is a staggering figure that leads to 1 in 3 marine mammals being tangled in marine litter. It’s also been found that 90% of seabirds have pieces of plastic wedged into their stomachs — a problem caused by those on land affecting those off land. Around 20% of litter in our oceans come from offsite sites and ships, the rest comes from heavy winds blowing rubbish into the sea and litter from the beaches – however, sometimes there is illegal dumping. Research shows that plastic usually gathers where the ocean current meets, forming plastic islands that sea creatures sometimes use as transportation that could move them far away from their usual habitat. As plastic contains chemicals and soaks up existing toxins from the air, this can have an impact on not only the sea creatures, but a knock on affect to humans too. After a while, the plastic in the sea will release chemicals and the fish in the ocean will potentially inhale them – resulting in a contaminated food supply chain. Depending on the amount of waste you produce, there are different steps that you can take to help better the planet. If you’re a business, the most common and effective way to reduce plastic pollution is to have a waste management service in place that can help you reduce and track the changes your business makes when it comes to waste. However, there are more methods that the everyday person can follow to make a difference: • Prevention – By asking IF the use of plastic is really necessary or could an alternative material be used. • Recycling—a simple solution that can make a huge impact. If you recycle, you are immediately keeping plastics from entering our oceans and reducing the amount of new plastic that goes into circulation. • Microbeads—this is becoming a more common type of plastic pollution in our ocean, and it’s preventable. A lot of bathroom essentials like face scrubs and toothpastes contain tiny plastic particles named microbeads, they make their way into the ocean through sewer systems. • Litter picking—to reduce the amount of plastics going into our oceans, you could participate in litter picking on your nearest beach which will make a huge difference."
4,Why We Salute Our Flag,social-issues," In light of recent actions by the NFL and some of its players this author felt it important to review the reasons why we pledge our allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. The United States Flag has thirteen stripes alternating red and white from top to bottom. Each stripe represents one of the thirteen original colonies. In the upper left hand corner is a blue rectangle bearing 50 white stars. These stars represent the fifty states of the United States of America. The thirteen colonies which are represented by the stripes were the colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. They became the first states. ""Old Glory"", ""The Stars and Stripes"", and ""The Star Spangled Banner"" are nicknames for the American Flag. The first flag, adopted in 1776, had a Union Jack in the upper left corner (not stars). The second flag used from June 14, 1777 – May 1, 1795 had thirteen stars each representing one of the original states which were: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Virginia. New stars were added to the flag as more states were added to the union. In 1892, Frances Bellamy wrote the Pledge of Allegiance to the U. S. flag as a promotion of patriotism for Columbus Day. At this time President Benjamin Harrison and the Congress proclaimed the flag ceremony as an important part of Columbus Day festivities. The flag ceremony was adopted by the National Education Association for celebration in public schools. The wording was changed in 1923 from ""my flag"" to ""the flag of the United States of America"" in order to make it clear to immigrants what flag they were pledging their loyalty to. In 1942 Congress officially recognized the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1954,, Congress was encouraged by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to add the words ""under God"". This was done as an anticommunist gesture. The salute to the flag was originally done by a straight-armed salute with the right hand in the direction of the flag. But during the days leading up to World War II, this way of saluting the flag was believed to be too similar to Fascist salutes used by Nazi Germany. Thus the flag code was amended by Congress that the flag be honored by placing the right hand over the heart while reciting the pledge. There are some definite rules for displaying the American Flag. If displayed on the same pole with other flags it goes at the top. The flag goes at the marcher's right if it is carried as ina parade. If the American flag is in a group , it positioned to the right and at the same height as other national flags. If the flag is mounted on a staff on a dais it stands to the right of the speaker. Otherwise it goes above and behind the speaker. The star field faces east or north,according to the orientation of the street, when the flag is hung over the street. When the flag is displayed on Memorial Day it hung half staff until noon. Then it is raised to its full height. Hanging the flag upside down is frowned upon in most cases. The United States Flag Code states that hanging the flag upside down should be done only in times of distress as in when the owner of the flag is in extreme danger. In the military it is recognized as a call for help. It is sometimes hung upside down, in violation of the code, as a protest against actions of government."
5,How do storms impact wastewater pumps,social-issues," If there’s one natural disaster that impacts all of Australia at a rate that no other natural disaster comes close to, the award would go to stormy weather. With storms that amount to cyclones the likes of Cyclone Debbie in 2017, it’s hard to turn a blind eye to the massive effect it has on the livelihood of Australians in terms of ordinary living to industrial and agricultural reliance. With an increase in water flow due to heavy rains, dirt and debris inevitably accumulate at an incredible rate pushing the boundaries of wastewater management to its limits. The impact of storms on the drainage system is highly taxing with efficiency failure leading to flooding as was seen all over Queensland as a result of Cyclone Debbie in 2017. When it comes to the effect stormy weather has on wastewater pumps, the necessity to have a wastewater pump specifically designed to handle storms and massive influxes of water flow is critical for efficient functioning. Wastewater pumps that are designed as stormwater pumps are typically submersible pumps that aid in the pumping of excessive amounts of water. The way stormwater pumps work is through the initial collection of stormwater in retention tanks that are linked to driveways, car parks, and areas where floods tend to accumulate. These stormwater pumps are then used to pump the stormwater from the retention tank into a higher elevated place for wastewater treatment to commence. Due to the way wastewater pumps and stormwater pumps work, they are often found submerged in a wet wall consisting of packaged pump stations or poured concrete. The increased flow of water that comes together with a storm will force a wastewater pump to work at maximum efficiency. If installed correctly and at a fully functioning state built using durable materials such as fibreglass, the wastewater pump should efficiently pump out excess wastewater into the treatment centre thus avoiding an accumulation of excess water which will lead to flooding. In instances where the storm brings in too much rain, more than one pumping station may be required in order to accommodate the mass amounts of stormwater. By utilising a plug and play stormwater pumping station, installation time can be saved with units that are pre-plumbed and ready to operate upon setting up. These plug and play units not only boast convenience but often mean lesser consumption of electricity, compressed air, or diesel (depending on how the pumps are powered). Stormwater pumping stations are ideal for domestic, commercial, industrial, and mining environments with high-quality providers offering customisations to cater for a specific site’s requirements. Where flooding is a major issue in a particular setting, the use of pumping systems with a high capacity up to 30,000L will be ideal due to the major influx of water flow. Pumps that are not designed to handle stormy weather will find it hard to efficiently pump stormwater and wastewater into the treatment system and will more than likely have lower capacities as low as 100L. The inability to cater for stormy weather will mean that generic pumps built for smaller retention tanks will not be able to pump out a sufficient amount of water to deter flooding from happening."

10,Threesome Dating is Right or Wrong?,social-issues," Before you are ready to have a threesome learn if 3some are a good idea or not! Many people in relationships get a bit bored with their sex life and start thinking about options to spice it up. For many people, the idea of a threesome comes to mind. There is a common thought out there that says that this is something that applies to men more than women, but there are just as many women who find this an exhilarating idea as there are men.

As you can see, there are some compelling reasons to have a threesome as well as why you should not have a threesome.

11,Environmental Analysis and Industry,social-issues," The environment wherein a given firm operates presents both challenges and opportunities to the organization (Lesca, 2013).

A significant environmental factor that affects businesses in this market is politics. Various political factors can affect the operations of the proposed security firm. These factors include taxation policies, policies on gun control and other security policies (Strom, 2010). However, these political factors do not have a significant implication on the proposed business as the policies are least likely to change in the foreseeable future. Another element of the general environment is the economy. Various aspects of the economy are likely to affect the proposed business including economic growth, the unemployment rate, interest rates, and inflation (Lesca, 2013). A high economic growth, low unemployment rate, low interest and inflation rates will favor the business by increasing the purchasing power of the targeted consumers. However, power economic performance is likely to affect the business negatively. Current trends indicate the performance of the U.S. economy will improve, in the near future. Social-cultural developments are another element of the general environment that is likely to affect the security firm. A significant social factor that is going to affect the business is people perception about security. With security threats such as terrorism becoming prevalent, people are likely to demand more security services (Strom, 2010). Another social factor that will affect the business is income. A spike in the earning level of the population will boost the demand for security services. Technological developments are also part of the external environments. Innovations in the technological field may present opportunities or threats to the business. Technological advancements are likely to give rise to sophisticated security threats; hence, they will increase demand for security services (Strom, 2010). Technological innovations may also introduce new and efficient ways of doing things; hence, they may increase the competitiveness of the firm. Technological advancements may also affect the business adversely by making the firm’s existing technologies obsolete. Industry Environment The industry environment refers to all factors that affect firms that function in a given industry. The Porters Five Forces model aids firm to analyze the industry environment by scrutinizing five major forces that operate in this environment. The first force is rivalry. Rivalry refers to the degree of competition among existing firms (Lesca, 2013). The U.S. private security industry has a high level of rivalry. The industry comprises of numerous players, both large and small. Big players within this industry include Wells Fargo, DynCorp, and AlliedBarton (Strom, 2010). Apart from these large competitors, the industry comprises of numerous small company. Strong rivalry implies that the proposed company needs to find sustainable ways of differentiating it services in order to compete. The second force is the threat of new entrants. The threat of new entrants in U.S. private security industry is high since the industry has minimal legal requirements and companies require relatively low amount of capital to start. Similarly, consumer switching costs is also low making it easy for new entrants to survive in the industry (Demsey, 2010). The only barrier to entry is the high degree of rivalry that characterized the industry. The proposed company will have to develop a strong brand identity and build customer loyalty in order to deal with this threat. Another force is the threat of substitutes. The term substitute refers to a service or product that can be utilized for the same intention as the company’s product.  The threat of substitute in the private security industry is negligible as there are very few substitutes to private security services (Strom, 2010). The only substitute is for the citizens to rely on the public security services, which does not provide certain aspects such as personal protection. Similarly, public security agencies cannot conduct investigations on private matters such as infidelity. The fourth force is the bargaining power of suppliers. The private security industry comprises of numerous suppliers including weapon manufacturers and vendors, IT solutions vendors, motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers (Dempsey, 2010). Some suppliers such as vehicle and weapon vendors are large and power; hence, have a strong bargaining power. This means that they are likely to charge high prices for their supplies. The proposed security company will deal with this threat by entering into strategic partnerships with other security firms so as to increase our bargaining power when dealing with these powerful suppliers. The final force is the bargaining power of buyers. The private security industry comprises of different categories of clients. Some clients are large and powerful such as banks, companies, education and other institutions (Dempsey, 2010). There are also small and fragmented customers such as individual home owners and people with troubled marriages. The proposed business targets the individual market. It seeks to provide security services to individual home owners and investigative services to people with troubled marriages. The bargaining power of these consumers is low; hence, the firm will be able to control prices. References Dempsey, J. (2010). Introduction to private security. USA; Cengage Learning Lesca, N.

12,What to know about shoreline cleanup,social-issues," The process of a shoreline cleanup will vary from one instance to another depending on the type of waste spilt and the severity of it. Albeit no two spills are the same, the one thing in common for all spills is the difficulty of cleaning any spills containing oil residues. Essentially, any shoreline cleanup involving oil spills is nothing short of a messy business. When waste spills into the water or if an oil pipeline sporadically ruptures, spill responders focus on the primary objective of containing the spill source to prevent further leaking and spreading of the waste. This is particularly prominent in oil spills due to the disastrous effects oil spills have on the natural ecosystem as was witnessed in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Factors such as weather conditions and water currents are also taken into consideration due to the overwhelming effect these may have on containment booms and other spill response strategies. The negative effect of external factors may result in escaping oil reaching shorelines close to and far from the initial location of the spill. Other considerations include the type of spills such as the specific type of oil, the conditions of the local environment, habitats of the shoreline, access routes to the shore, safety precautions, and logistic arrangements. Due to the wide range of variables influencing the shoreline cleanup strategy, spill responders are required to assess the situation thoroughly and make a logical and practical decision based on their assessment. In most spill instances, a combination of different shoreline cleanup methods will be used in order to tackle the cleanup process effectively. This cleanup method utilises water to flush out stranded oil left on the shoreline. This will help remove it or refloat it into the water of which it is easier to recover as slick. When flushing the shoreline, it is critical that both water pressure and the temperature is monitored accordingly to avoid causing more damage to the shoreline as was witnessed in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Containment booms are essentially long floating barriers that are placed to contain spills off the beach or to collect oil which has been flushed from the shoreline before it disperses into the waters. These large vacuums are used to suction spilt oil from the beach or shoreline to prevent harm done to the shoreline ecosystem. Sorbents are a specialised material which takes the form of square pads or long booms and are engineered to only absorb oil and not water. Although there are various different types of chemical cleaners that can assist in oiled shoreline cleanups, many of these require special approval before implementation. Shoreline cleaners such as surface washing agents can be used to soften the oil off of surfaces such as docks, rocks, and riprap. Bioremediation agents act as fertilizers that assist in catalysing the natural microbial degradation process. It should be noted that the conventional cleanup methods using booms and sorbents are typically used as a first line of response to oil spills with the alternative measures coming secondary. Where there is freshly spilt oil floating on the surface of the water or on marsh vegetation, some spill responders may perform controlled burns. This form of shoreline cleanup is highly labour intensive due to the manual use of buckets, shovels, rakes, and other tools that can help remove any oil residue from the shoreline. Manual recovery is often the first line of response when access routes are difficult for larger equipment to access. Where access routes to the shoreline are possible without causing excessive damage to the shoreline, heavy machinery may be brought to assist in the removal of oil residue in bulk."
13,Biofilters for air pollution control,social-issues," Biofiltration has always been an existing concept for air pollution control deriving from as early as 1923 where biological methods were proposed to treat odorous emissions. Advancements in research and technology started in Germany circa 1955 with biofilter treatments applied to address odorous emissions in low concentrations with a high success rate witnessed in Germany in the 1970s. This success led to further research being developed in the United States and other parts of Europe in the 1980s with external outreach to the rest of the world. By the 1990s, there were more than 500 recorded biofilters in operation both in Germany and Netherlands with a widespread trend starting in the United States. What is Biofiltration? Biofiltration is essentially an air pollution control technique involving biodegradation of contaminants. These contaminants are biodegraded by microorganisms that are diffused in a thin layer of moisture referred to as biofilm. The main use is for the elimination of malodorous gas emissions and low concentrations of volatile organic compounds. What makes a Biofilter and How does it Work? The components of a biofilter include a biofilter bed, a support rack, and a fan. The materials used for the biofilter bed often include peat, compost, soil, gravel, or plastic bits.The support rack is designed to be perforated to allow air flow between the plenum and the biofilter bed allowing contact of the microbes inside the bed material. The purpose of the fan is to collect contaminated air allowing emissions to flow through and for the pollutants to be absorbed in the moisture of the biofilter bed. The microbes found within the bed material consume and metabolise the pollutants thus reducing the concentrations of the pollutants. Different Types of Biofilters There are three main variations of biofilters pertaining to the layout, shape, and bedding media. On the basis of the biofilter layout, there is a variation for either an open bed which is uncovered and exposed to all weather conditions and a closed bed which contains a small exhaust vent. On the basis of shape, the biofilter could be designed horizontally (which leaves a larger carbon footprint, is relatively inexpensive, and is easy to maintain) or could be designed vertically (which reduces the carbon footprint, uses a lesser surface area, requires more maintenance, and is higher in cost to build). With regards to the bedding media, there are two variations which are organic compost or synthetic media. Organic compost typically has an effective lifespan of around 5 years while synthetic media has a longer effective lifespan. Benefits of Biofiltration The use of biofilters to treat air pollution leaves a positive environmental footprint through the absence of chemicals and toxins. Not only does it benefit the ecosystem, the effectiveness of biofilters is evident in its ability to remove air pollutants at a low operating cost. Biofilters follow the laws of conservation and mass balance which acts in accordance with mother nature. In setting up a biofilter system, it is critical that developers acquire a detailed understanding of the environmental site, conditions, limitations, components, logistics, and safety measures in order to set up an efficient biofilter system."
14,How Recruiters Are Evolving To Staff Open Hospital Positions,social-issues," Healthcare recruiters across the country are faced with a difficult task of staffing open hospital positions quickly. It seems every day that more beds are being added, and additional staff members are needed to fill an ever increasing number of new openings. With an increasingly competitive hiring market for human resource managers to filter through, recruiters need to evolve quickly to fill these positions to meet the staffing needs that continue to grow. Demand For Qualified Healthcare Employees Rises With an increasing number of hospital investments, acquisitions, partnerships, and technological advancements, hospital growth and the number of patients they serve daily continues to rise. This means that the demand for qualified healthcare employees continues to rise to meet the growing supply of sick patients who need aid. Current hospital employees have stated that they often feel they are overworked because there are so many open positions and responsibilities that they have to cover until a healthcare recruiter can fill the position with a new hire. Virtually every healthcare career is expected to grow over the next decade according to the   Occupational Outlook Handbook published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The healthcare industry is expected to grow more than the typical average industry as well. These projections indicate that staffing needs will continue to be an issue until recruiters find new ways to combat the crisis. Recruiters are evolving in several ways to help fill vacant positions for hospitals and healthcare systems. Healthcare recruiters are in the process of becoming master negotiators. With a limited supply of qualified candidates for each hospital position, recruiters need to figure out exactly what matters to potential candidates. This could range from potential salary, work schedule, benefits, and organizational path. Healthcare recruiters need to help create an attractive job offer that closely aligns with what matters to each candidate. Recruiters Use New Tools Healthcare recruiters are increasingly using new tools to help narrow down candidates based on whether or not they are qualified. Each day it seems there is a new job recruitment platform where potential candidates can go, upload their resume, and apply to hundreds of jobs at once. This means that healthcare recruiters are getting inundated with spam applications and unqualified candidates which take up ample application review time, interview time, and adds to the costs hospitals incur from the open positions not being filled. Healthcare recruiters have started switching to niche job posting and career platforms to help find more qualified candidates that can fill vacant positions. In the healthcare industry, HospitalCareers is one such niche site where qualified candidates can find healthcare job postings. Using these niche career sites and job platforms enables healthcare recruiters to spend less time sifting through candidates that only waste time, and spend more time on interviewing candidates who actually align with the job postings that recruiters are trying to fill. As the baby boomer generation begins to exit the workforce in alarming numbers, healthcare recruiters have to evolve to managing different vacant position gaps at the same time. Traditionally, cyclical trend for position-based hiring comes and goes, but recently it seems to be an ongoing process with no end in sight. This means that healthcare recruiters need to continually adapt their strategies and adjust them based on new techniques that will help them find attractive candidates."
15,Sports Gathering,social-issues," Sports gathering in the society are relevant because they help people associate in different ways. Relationships are of great help plus they are helpful. Study shows that, in our social setting, the one to one human connection defines the foundation of development. Sports gathering helps build relationships with individuals who are from different cultures. It is true that most different cultures assists in developing various communities which are powerful enough in achieving social growth and relation goals. A society that lacks relationships of people develops challenges of development because everyone concentrates on personal benefit something that is a threat towards a community setting growth, (Glazer, 2000). Whether a person wants to ensure that children are able to get and access good education, promote economic development, or bring quality health care activities, it is essential for a person to work with people who are from different ethnic, language, economic group, and different racial. Sports gathering give people power and opportunity to work with people who are from different social groups and in an effective strategy. Study shows that trusting relationships in a social setting are the main glue that helps people stay together hence work in a common approach. Sports gathering provides a community growth forum where people are tempted to stay and work on challenges they have. Hanging together in the society assists people support each other when they are down. When a person is supported, it becomes possible to create a setting that favors personal development plus growth perspectives. Sports gathering bring people close irrespective of the educational background with a common motive of making the environment a suitable place that assists the community to live and stay in harmony, (Banks, 2007). There are instances where a person feels difficulties in relating with people from other backgrounds. Sports gathering helps establish relationships with anyone who seems to change your life in a positive direction. It is clear that every one of us in the society like to operate in a hub of a wheel that provides positive results. Study shows that sports gathering allows people build friendships and relationships around the community which gives ability and necessary strength to achieve community goals. If we build a network of strong and diverse relationships, it is possible to create an environment that solves challenges that are common. Humans are supposed to be aware of personal culture in order to learn about other cultures. Sports gathering helps build relationships with people around us and with such a move, it allows engage in development activities that could not have been met in a personal level, (Takaki, 2011). There are different definitions of culture where culture is a complex component human live in and makes developments. Sports gathering helps establish a culture something that refers to a community or social group with which we share common experiences under which we shape the way we understand the world. In most cases, people have managed to learn about others through the use of sports gathering activities. If we want to know about other cultures, it is essential to know more about your culture although this may seem odd. Having understood what and how your culture has affected you in the first hand, it becomes easier to understand how it affects your neighbors plus anyone else who associates with your surroundings. Sports gathering have played an important role in assisting people talk about their own culture and as a result, they get the ability to listen to others. This helps understand how to relate with each other and assists establish an environment that is free from discriminations in the society. Culture changes and evolves at all times. Some people are a mixture of more than one culture thus they need to create an environment that serves them with what they need to survive in different cultures, (Banks, 2007). Through sports gathering, humans manage to establish social awareness to the society something that helps shape their growing up environment. Many generations ago, your ancestors were doing things that are different from what we are doing in the today’s life. Our views and needs towards social issues, celebrations, disease and health, work, and family are different from those of our ancestors. Sports gathering helps people come up with solutions on how to manage their challenges plus create an environment that is better living. Although there are different social groups that make our society, these groups are not far different for they have similarities and things that we share in common. These are key contributing factors that influence how we behave deal, and handle others when sharing living needs. It is through becoming aware of your different identities help people understand what it might be like to be a member of a given social group, (Glazer, 2000).  Reference: Banks, J.A. (2007).

19,The Perishing Kelp,social-issues," Scientists are increasingly alarmed that the kelp forests world wide are dying out at a disturbing pace. It appears that the kelp forests are 93 percent smaller on the California coast than before because of warmer waters resulting in a population increase of urchins which feed on the kelp. In increasingly large numbers these tiny but hungry creatures can utterly erase large areas of kelp and other algae. A disease thought to be exacerbated by the warmer waters has killed a large number of sea stars which are the enemies of the sea urchins which feed on kelp. This, of course, leaves the urchins free to feast on kelp. One can only imagine what damage the loss of kelp can do as the effects make their way up the food chain. Urchins are spiny vertebrae that feed on algae. Ordinarily they are an important part of the ecosystem. Not many sea creatures feed on urchins allowing them to expand, grow hungrier and feed on newly settled kelp plants. Because of their undernourished state these urchins are of no value to other sea creatures or fisherman. Kelp forests preside on all the world's coastal areas except Antarctica. One of the latest areas losing their kelp is the Gulf of Maine from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia. Included in this latest list of victims is the Mediterranean Sea, Southern Japan and Australia. In Australia, the giant kelp thrives best in water temperature between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit, according to scientists at the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies. Routine summertime temperatures now reach into the mid 60s. The Australian Government now lists giant kelp forests as an endangered community. But, oddly enough, some areas are experiencing an increase in kelp growth. The West coast of Vancouver island has an increase in sea otters which feed on the urchins which destroy the kelp. Thus the sea otter is an important part of the ecosystem of Vancouver Island. The sea otter is the main reason that urchins have not destroyed the kelp forests of the region. A while back the sea otters were nearly extinct and so were the kelp forests in the region. Now that the sea otter population has been brought back the kelp forests are being restored. Kelp is crucial to the economy of coastal areas as it provides food and shelter to fish and other creatures. The restoration of the kelp forests will certainly aid the fishing industry and protect our coasts. Santa Monica Baykeeper and California Science Center divers are now working to restore the kelp forests in the Pacific Ocean on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. They have removed hundreds of thousands of sea urchins below the site of the old Marineland of the Pacific. It is hoped that this will aid the kelp to be restored to its former level. The kelp appears to be responding positively to this effort. Researchers say that the warming ocean waters are a result of climate change, overfishing, and harvesting of kelp. There is little debate that the earth is in a warming trend. The debate seems to be over the cause. Is it man caused or just a part of a regular cycle. Some scientists say that we are now entering a cooling phase. Others say that the climate change theory is a hoax perpetrated by those who want a one world government and that this a a way to control the populace. Whichever way we lean it would be wise to do our best to keep our garbage out of the ocean and support those who are trying to make a difference."
20,How to Get a Man Without Looking Desperate and When All Other Women Are Struggling,social-issues," How to Get a Man Without Looking Desperate and When All Other Women Are Struggling It is very possible to get a man quickly, when all other women around you are struggling. You just have to have a plan, a proper vision, supported by the right actions. Go to the right places, be frank to friends, mind your wardrobe, be pleasant, converse with men easily, avoid sex on the first date and most importantly force the hand of the man your are targeting. Hit the damn gym and all other places where men go Getting a man is just like all other activities, those who put the greatest effort succeed more than the rest. You have to be actively involved in looking for man in order to get one. Yes, you have to put it in your agenda to actively look for a man without looking desperate. Go to places men frequent. The gym is one of them, the church, shopping centres and social places. You will never find a man at your home. If you are busy being miserable in your home, wondering how Mr Right will find you, he will not. You are at a wrong place. Your home is the wrong place to find Mr Right. But you must remember one thing; the type of man you get will heavily depend on the place you hung out. A lousy place will yield lousy men. That is a fact. Ask your friends for help Your friends will never help if they do not know your problem. They will only lend you a hand if you ask them to introduce you to the right men. They are women also, so they know the ills of leaving without a partner, especially growing old without one, so they are in position to lend an honest hand. Try to let them know exactly what you are looking for and why. Are you looking for along time relationship or a short fling, whatever it may be spell it out clearly to your friends. They should know exactly what to get for you. Tweak your wardrobe Please be smart, attractive without looking threatening. If you are a professional lady, please loosen up. Men will never try to flirt with you if you look formal most of the time. Leave office suits for official functions. Men will fear, and contacting you will not to happen if you look official all the time. You must look approachable. Smile and be pleasant You will always find women who at the back of their minds are looking for a partner but their out look says the complete opposite. They are angry and not pleasant to be around. Which man in his normal senses will want to be around an angry person? I do not think you will find many. So, please be pleasant, smile. Make conversations with men If a man strikes up a conversation, do not look at them as though they are from outer space. If you look at them with sophistication it will take you a life time to get a partner. One lady was looking for a partner and in her Internet advert she said she was looking for an academic for intelligent discussions. She also said that she was busy finishing up her PHD. For heaven sake she was narrowing her choices to a very small number of people. Many men are not stupid, but to say that you are looking for a person to discuss nano-physics with will limit your chances. Don't be an early-slay casualty Sex on the first date is a no-no. If you get laid on the first date it means that you are a person of loose morrows or it may be construed to mean that. It is rare that you will keep that relationship. If a man goes away because he did not lay you on the first meeting, it simply means that he was still going to do the same if he succeeded. Good riddance let him go. Use a traditional healer to force his hand This is what most of you do not think about. But it can be of help. If you see a man that you want to attract, it is very helpful to force the hand of this man using metaphysical powers. These metaphysical powers will do wonders for you. Get the right psychic or traditional healer for help. Many people who have sought out help get it. Your search has come to an end if you truelly need a change in your love life. Are you looking for love related help? For more information contact on +256 783254601 how we can help"

4,Are Waist Beads Solely for Skinny Women?,social-issues," It is fair to state that the West has always been and always will be obsessed with svelte looking women. Juxtapose this obsession with the West-African perception of beauty, and you will arrive at the conclusion that, ""Beauty does lie in the eyes of the beholder!"" In Ghana, for instance, being voluptuous is deemed ideal. Woe unto the lady who doesn’t possess ample breasts, hips or backside and blessed is she who has a combination of these coveted assets. For, hers’ will be constant adulation and admiration from both men and women alike. With that said, as a young child growing up, I witnessed many women adorning their bodies with waist beads. Size was never a factor in determining who had the privilege of wearing them. Any female could wear waist beads – right from babies to the elderly. Ever since I could remember, I have always had a strong love for waist beads. And so it was that when the age of reasoning occurred, I took it upon myself to find out why women wore waist beads. I discovered interesting responses to my questions regarding the reason(s) why women wore waist beads. By the way, in order to gain a holistic perspective, I included responses from men too. Ahem, I must confess that I wasn’t overly surprised by their views. Below, you will find a summary of my findings: Weight Management Apparently, my ancestors found an ingenious modus operandi for weight management in the absence of bathroom scales. A tightening fit indicated to the wearer that additional weight had been gained whereas a loser fit signaled weight loss. Ideally, the wearer’s goal was to maintain the initial fit of the waist beads since waist beads tended to be worn for a long time. Bear in mind that these waist beads are water-resistant and fade resistant. The wearer can bathe in it and sleep in it without having to take it off. Body Adornment With a twinkle in his eye, a bosom male friend of mine(one of the men I questioned) told me about his admiration of waist beads on the body of a female. I happily listened to him as he spoke. ""There is an amazing, exciting and arousing quality about a voluptuous woman adorned in waistbeads""…Yep, he said it… ""voluptuous"" :). ""Such a woman can ask me anything and my answer will be yes"" . Okay, African Delilah, your work with my African Samson is going to be easy. No challenges. Simply wear a couple of waist beads and anything you desire from him will be yours! Rites of Passage Among the Krobos, an initiation rite, known as Dipo, is celebrated by pre-teens and teens as a symbol of their transition to adulthood. The Krobos are known for the production of high quality, authentic, African beads. It is no wonder that they have beads named after them! They also tend to assign tangible and non-tangible value to beads. How to Wear Waist Beads In order to be comfortable, it is recommended that waist beads be worn directly below your stomach. The fit should be somewhat loose. Traditionally, they are worn underneath one’s clothes. All the same, a woman is free to wear them however she sees fit. As I stated initially, any woman of any size can wear them."
5,How to become an Online Activist,social-issues," Seeing the political situation today, the world's development in the next decades is uncertain. With Trump elected as President, a lot of progress achieved in the past years in terms of environment protection is at risk due to the President's global warming denying administration. While many now believe that everyone must wait another three years until we can ""come back to normal"", some organizations are working hard so the world keeps moving forward instead of backwards. I'm talking about NGOs and Activist Groups. These organizations are often run by unpaid volunteers who spend hundreds of hours fighting for causes that make the world a better place. However, as non-profit organizations, they often can't invest a lot of money if any on advertisement messages to encourage people to help them in achieving their goals. Therefore, liking a Facebook page, following an organization on Twitter or accepting to be put in an email list is a very small sacrifice to make, and it goes a long way for these organizations. Therefore, in the future don't be afraid to like, follow or subscribe to an NGO or Activist Group as that act itself helps those organizations a lot, and you can simply unlike, unfollow or unsubscribe from them if they bother you too much (which they generally don't). Another way to help is to sign and share petitions or letters to political entities. Petitions and letters are one of the main means of action for Activists as they put pressure on governments, companies, groups, and media to talk about a specific issue. The larger the amount of people who sign, the more important an issue becomes to the eyes of stakeholders. Signing a petition online is now easier than ever as you generally just need to click a button, give your name and email address. It can take less than 30 seconds to sign an online petition, which can be done FROM ANYWHERE! Various organizations are fighting for issues by gathering large amounts of signatures before sending the petitions to the Senate, Congress or News Channels. The Nature Conservancy, the National Parks Conservation Association, Earth Justice or the WWF are recognizable organisations that constantly have new petitions to support for the protection of the environment. But of course, there are other Activist groups that fight for other issues such as Animal Protection, Human Rights, Women's Rights, or LGBT rights. Activistonthego is an Activist Group that gathers all the pages to Petitions and Letters from various organizations so you can easily find the petitions that you want to support. To conclude, NGOs and Activist Groups can benefit from every simple act of support. It is very easy for anyone to help and it doesn't cost anything. So, in the future, spending a couple of minutes of your day to help an organization is a small sacrifice to make in order to help make the world a better place."

8,Globalization's Impact On The Worlds Elections,social-issues," Globalization, a new word to many Americans, is quickly becoming one of the most important topics in society today. During the past two years it has become one of the most relevant issues in all elections across the globe. The United States, France, and Britain all have had major elections in the past year, and the main referendum that would be decided in each was whether or not to accept or reject Globalization and its ideals. Many leaders seeking election had the same main persuasive viewpoints on Globalization--- the blaming of immigrants and refugees on economic and social problems in the country.   Undeniably, over the past few years the subject of Globalization has had a dramatic impact on politics and the world at large. In the 2016 United States Election ""America First"" was ultimately the slogan that won Donald Trump the Presidency. This was a clear rejection by the voters of the country that perceived themselves left behind by the expansion of Globalization. This was especially true in the northern ""Rust Belt"" region of the United States which was once dominated by manufacturing.  Citizens tired of the economic policies that Globalization and the leaders who pushed its ideals had brought upon them revolted and pushed the election to the Anti Globalist President Trump.  Along with the troubles of lost jobs and trade comes the increasingly worrisome problem of open borders, immigration, and the impact it has had on the economy in the country. Similar scenarios played itself out in Great Britain with its referendum against the European Union or as many call it ""Brexit"". This Movement was led by Nigel Farage and the citizens of Great Britain whom thought they had been pulling more than their fair share in their alliance and that their economy was suffering and struggling due to this fact. Strengthened by the fact that Greece and a few other European Union countries were actually at risk to default on their creditors and bring the whole European Union economy down, their choice was made. However even after all of the Economic issues plaguing Great, "" The Guardian.com"" reported that the biggest reason for the vote to succeed form the European Union however was the ever-growing problems with terrorism and immigration control. Spikes in terror attacks as well as domestic crime have worried citizens how their country will change in the coming years if a solution to this challenge is not reached. Once again when it came time for France to decide the next leader of its country in 2016 Globalization was once again at the forefront of the French political world. This time France and its citizens debated their trade agreements and how they were negatively affecting their performance on the world stage. France as well as the United States and Britain has also had issues associated with immigration and terror. Globalizations ideals were once again in hot water with Marine Le Pen the leader of the French Anti-Globalization effort advancing to the final runoff election. After another intensely contested election France ended up deciding in the other direction and elected a leader with views that align with Globalization. Emmanuel Macron could be a sign that the world is starting to reject the ideals of anti-Globalization. Globalization has had a substantial effect on Politics no matter what side of the aisle you stand. The world is vastly different in 2017 than it was in 2016 and prior due to the huge shift in economic and immigration policy change promoted by world leaders. The referendums on old leaders and their policies on Globalization of the past few years may worry some while some may be encouraged for an ecstatic for the future. In an ideal world , citizens will continue to band together and make their own decisions through democracy and an open forum."
9,Time in the Spirit World,social-issues," What?? Everyone’s getting ready to celebrate Halloween, and yesterday I saw my first Christmas decorations. Outside a supermarket, three young men were stringing lights around several pine trees. Already? I thought, then a dab of panic set in as I wondered, Have I done all my shopping yet? I took a deep breath and smiled. No need to rush. And as I sat in my car and watched the high-schoolers making the market entrance festive, I remembered why December was important to a young newlywed, how her wish came true and the lesson that spirit moves at its own speed. When Jeanette called for her appointment, the oak trees on the front lawn had dropped little piles of brightly coloured red and yellow leaves. I made a mental note to hire the youngster who lived down the street for a little raking. I closed my eyes, said a quick prayer, then asked Jeanette’s mom to speak. Mom also brought through Uncle Barry and his wife, who said she was glad whenever Jeanette wore the brooch that she’d left to Jeanette in the will. Then I passed along some information about the house Jeanette and her husband had just purchased, and other minutia that I now can’t remember. But I do remember what Jeanette said when I asked if she had any questions. ""When will Bill and I have our first child?"" She and her husband had been trying to conceive for three years, and the couple was considering a fertility clinic. In my mind, Jeanette’s mother sharply whispered, December! ""Spirit is telling me that you will pregnant in December,"" I said. Jeanette was overjoyed. December was two months away, and by the way she was expressing her excitement, it seemed like she couldn’t wait to call Bill for an afternoon delight. Just after Christmas, I received a downhearted email from Jeanette. She still hadn’t conceived. I felt a tug in my stomach. Jeanette had been so happy when spirit, through me, gave her that message. In my heart, I knew spirit was never wrong. Had I misinterpreted something? But I’d sensed her mother’s voice so clearly! For the next few weeks I thought about that reading. And then, as time has a way of creating distance, the memory of Jeanette’s session faded away. Winter became spring, which gave way to a mild summer and a damp fall. The Farmer’s Almanac predicted a harsh winter. I made sure to have enough wood in the basement to feed the fireplace. On December 15, I received an unexpected call. Jeanette, gushing happily, told me she was pregnant. My spirit soared. ""I’m so happy for you!"" I said, and remembered her mother’s word. December! And here it was, December – but one year later. So spirit was right. It just wasn’t the December I assumed spirit was talking about. That was a great lesson for me. Time is different in the spirit world. There are no clocks on the other side of life. Spirit doesn’t wear a watch. It’s only here on the earth plane that things are expected to get done by some deadline. So now, when spirit gives my client a particularly significant day or month, I add: ""But it might not be this Tuesday (or October, or whatever)."" I thought about that as I watched the fellows decorate the pine trees outside the supermarket. So what if I haven’t bought any holiday gifts yet? There’s no rush to go shopping. I’ve got plenty of time."
10,"Finding Love Online with (The Game of Men) Website. Learn the Rules, Play the Game, Win the Man!",social-issues," One of the first, and most important things you will want to do is choose an online dating service. Pressure from advertisements will lead you to the more popular, national sites, although these sites may not be the best choice for you. Think hard about what you are trying to accomplish - a date, serious relationship, marriage, a family? Some sites are better at meeting your needs than others, so do some research. After you have chosen which site you will be signing up with, you will be prompted, in most cases, to create a profile. Your profile is extremely important, and should not be overlooked or quickly slapped together. Think of your profile as an outfit you would pick out for a special occasion. You will want your outfit to reflect both your personality and the occasion. The same attention to detail should go into your profile. You will need to decide what to put in your profile, and what to leave out. Some of the basics should be left in, including sex, age/birthdate, hometown, etc., However, choosing to put more personal information in your profile will depend on how open you are as a person. How much information do you want people to know about you? Do you want to tell them everything before they contact you? Do you want to leave out some details so you can tell them on a more personal level? These questions will need to be addressed before you create your profile. Your profile picture, or avatar, will be the next thing you put in your profile. You should choose the most flattering picture possible, without going overboard (avoid Photoshop). And NEVER PUT A PICTURE THAT IS NOT YOU as your profile picture. First of all this is just wrong, it's false advertising. If you get involved with someone and decide it is time to meet, what then? After you have created your profile, you are almost ready to mingle! Test the waters by getting to know the dating service you are using. Explore all of the features the service has, and then determine which features are the best to use. It is important to know exactly what each feature provides, so you can use it to your full advantage. Most online dating sites host a general information forum, or a help line to answer any questions you may have during your membership. If you have any questions about a feature on the site, you should contact the site administrators, who are always happy to assist you. After you have created your profile, and are aware with all the features the site offers, you are ready to start marketing yourself to other people. I know ""marketing"" may sound like a harsh term, but really, that is what you are doing. One thing you can do to optimize your marketing efforts is to update your personal information. Let's say that you recently got a new puppy, or you went on a crazy diet and lost 20 pounds in two weeks, or you just learned that your best friend is getting married and you will be traveling to Barbados for the wedding. All new developments in your life should be considered noteworthy and eligible for profile inclusion. Now comes the fun part, you found somebody! What do you do? When you find somebody you deem worthy of spending time with,you should get to know that person as much as you can. Get to know their background, interests, hobbies, family, favorite color, favorite Tom Cruise movie, pretty much everything you would learn from somebody in the real world, you can learn in the virtual world. After you have found somebody worth dating, it is time to meet that person. This process may take three days, it may take three years, it really depends on how comfortable you are in your relationship. Make sure that you are both ready to take this step, as it will be the biggest step in your relationship thus far. Let's say you meet this person, and fall deeply in love with them the first time you see each other - then your quest for finding love online is over. However, let's say you decide to meet, and find out that the whole time you were talking online this person lied to you about their appearance - you decide to keep looking online, and the process starts all over again."
11,Should you use dating sites in your later years?,social-issues," The world of dating has changed over the past couple of decades, and this is mainly due to the popularisation of the internet. No longer do we need to go out to meet new people, instead we can just go online with our computers and smart phones and make new connections with other singles from all around the planet. This is part of the new pace of modern life, where we expect things to happen immediately and as easily as possible. The problem is that not everyone knows how to use computers and how to navigate through the jungle that is the World Wide Web; and that is especially true about people who are into their later years. The question is: is the web a safe place for mature people to find love and companionship? Not so different from the past It takes practice to understand how the internet works. At first it seems like a fountain of knowledge until you realise that it is mainly people trying to sell you things; but that takes time to understand. Furthermore, making the difference between fact and lies isn’t as easy as it seems. Back a few years ago printed words had some meaning and some validity; but if you remember well not every newspaper would tell the truth. There were plenty of trashy news outlets even before the existence of the internet. So in essence, it is nothing new, rather it is the same just placed into a different context. For example, the concept of spam emails might sound strange at first. Receiving messages from strangers offering you some inheritance or telling you you’ve won a price isn’t any different that the junk mail you used to receive in the past through your letterbox. Remember all those letter saying you won a cruise trip around the world, the only thing needed was for you to send a small deposit? Online cons are very much the same, and once you get over your fear of using a new platform, you will find that anything that sounds too good to be true generally is. In other words: your common sense has to prevail online just like it does in the real world. What about online dating? Looking for love often puts you in a vulnerable situation, it was like that in the past and it is still the same in our present time. This sounds worse that what it is, but it is something worth talking about. When you say you are single and looking for love, you are also saying that you are alone and lonely; two things which scammers love to jump onto. Saying you are alone on the internet or saying it to someone face-to-face puts you roughly in the same spot. The difference is that if you do it online, you can reach a lot more people in a shorter amount of time. This is both a good and a bad thing. The good side is that as a single person, you can reach other singles faster and easier. The bad side is that more people are aware of your loneliness. So what is the solution to this? Well, it’s the same as it was before: you can tell people you are single without making it sound like you are alone and vulnerable. Make sure you come across as someone strong who knows what they want and don’t compromise. That way you will filter out the wrong people who are looking to prey on other’s weaknesses. Again, this is no different from the past, only the platform has changed but the principle remains the same. Choosing a dating site This is the trickier part: how do you know what site is safe, and actually do any of those dating sites actually work? The first thing to do is for you to create a new email address that you can use solely for dating purposes. Just make sure that email doesn’t have you family name or any numbers such as your birth year, that way you will keep a certain degree of anonymity. Once you’ve created that email, you can use it to sign up to your chosen site. It is important to know that any good dating site will allow you to sign up for free, you shouldn’t have to pay from the start. That way you can look around the site and its members and see if you like what you see. Using a free account usually means that the site’s functionalities will be limited, but it should at least give you a good way to check around without having to pay just for that privilege. So which site should you choose if you are dating in your later years? The truth is that it really depends what you want. There are a lot of dating sites, and most of them will specialise into one thing or the other. If you are looking for a partner who is also in their later years, it is best to avoid the dating sites that specialise in younger people. Instead you are better off searching for ‘mature dating sites’ by typing just that into Google. The reason for choosing a mature dating site is that the people who go there are more likely to be closer to you, more like-minded and generally more mature about how they deal with dating. Young people can be quite rude and using the right site will lead to less rejection. How to keep safe online We already discussed the idea of making sure that you don’t come across as lonely or desperate, but there are other things you can do to keep safe online. One of the key things is to make sure you keep your privacy intact. This means you shouldn’t give out your private phone number, you address, your family name; or any other details that people can use to find you in the real world. Anonymity is important, at least in the early stages of meeting people online. Maybe after talking to someone for a while you can get a better sense of who they are, and if they are genuine. However until you do it is best to keep a wall between you and people, just take your time and be patient. Don’t let your emotions dictate your actions, instead use as much of your logic as you can. If someone sounds too perfect, then they often are, and if they are really as wonderful as they say, then they probably wouldn’t be using dating sites at the first place. Another very important thing is this: if anyone that you meet online ever asks you for money, then stop being in contact with them. This might sound obvious but it is one of the classical online dating scams. That person will be in touch with you for a while. Getting you to feel for them. Then one day they will message you saying they are having family issues, or illness issues; and they are in need of money. Basically they warm you up at first, get you to trust them and then they ask for money. One you’ve given them the money, you might not hear from them ever again, or they might ask for more later. So to cut this short, any request for money is a no=go zone, avoid them at all costs. Finally, just remember that you are at home in the comfort of your own house using your computer. No one can really get to you, and no one should rush you into doing anything you don’t want to or are not comfortable doing. You have the power to lead the situation, you are in control. Think of it as the following: you can hang up the phone on a cold calling salesman, you can close your door on a door-to-door salesman; and it is even easier to ignore unwanted messages. As long as you stay in control, there is no reason why you should use dating sites in your later years. Just remember it is all about keeping it together and you will be fine."
12,Paying employees by emailing Payslip delivery,social-issues," Paying your employee is one of the most vital things you do. But how do you allow your staffs know when they’ve been paid? This is more vital than you may realize. Many people should know when their salary hits their bank account as they have automatic payments that are triggered on specific dates. If they depend on their monthly income to pay regular bills, but their current account is not sufficiently robust to cope up with the delays in the payment, do you want your employee to be embarrassed as they hadn’t realized their pay hadn’t arrived? If there is any kind of delay in payslip delivery, for any reason, your employee should know it so that they can make right arrangements with their bank or other financial organizations. Many companies send batch invoicing to their employees. This is fine until there is a delay in the system and therefore the employee can’t be sure that their salary has reached their account. These time delays are specifically vital for any organization or company which has staff working overseas. According to the method of posting, there are various reasons why mail can be delayed for days, weeks, and even month in some countries. Such uncertainty of overseas delivery, along with the cost of postage, can be the right time to consider other ways of informing your employee that they have been paid. Using a PDF emailing system has the added advantage that there is no requirement to be concerned about the security, as all the email payslips are encrypted, making the system more secure than sending hard copies through the post. Post bags may be intercepted, lost and even there are instances, when the delivery staff decided they couldn’t be bothered to deliver the mail. A computer system doesn’t have such feeling and it will never wake up in the morning not feeling well to send an email. Payslip delivery by email is eco-friendly and nowadays that’s a vital consideration to take. Just think about the green credentials you will have with these really easy step of lessening your carbon imprint. And you can include your company’s brand logo on the payslip, thereby reinforcing your branding, or even add a monthly message for your staffs. Organizing a Batch invoicing service is really simple and you don’t have to do it in-house. There are various companies that provide a safe email payslip service, customized to meet your requirements. Having worked for some pretty big corporate giants in the past who still do this today, print and post these documents, it shocks me that everybody should be PDF emailing. As a start, the cost of the hard copies should be exorbitant, envelopes, paper, printer components, and postage- even those one-piece documents are costly. Sending them electronically from the payroll system, with the electronic payslip delivery system is completely safe and the most cost-efficient option."

15,Cross-cultural dating and marriages in China,social-issues," The love story of Daria and Alvin Daria and Alvin met online at one of the websites where people exchange languages. It was March of 2014 and at that time she was living in Harbin (Northern China) and he was living in Shanghai. They have started to exchanged letters and emails as friends. After several months they couldn't imagine life without each other’s messages. In the summer of 2014, he has convinced her to move to Shanghai. It was a very bold decision for her, to go alone to a huge city to a guy she has never met in real life, but it felt so right that she didn’t hesitate. She quit her job in Harbin, said goodbye to her friends and moved to Shanghai. Finally, the stars aligned for them as they met on 28th of August 2014 in Shanghai. 3 years later he proposed by the Mount Fuji while cherry trees were blooming. This was the most romantic place and the most romantic proposal she could ever imagine. Over the past 3 years, they have traveled extensively in Asia, adopted 2 cats and got married. Questions to Her On Our first date... we visited the Bund in the evening, then went to one of the biggest parks in central Shanghai and spent the whole night sitting on the bench and talking until 4 am. During the first months of dating my deal-breaker would be... him pushing me to be intimate too soon, also if he would have no manners or appeared to be too boring. I learned He is right for me when... I get to know him better, I knew how ambitious and responsible he was. Also when I knew his views on life and plans, which were similar to my own plans. I had culture shock when He... got sick and refused to take pills, and said he just needed to drink more hot water! Three things I love about Him are... The biggest misconception about His country and culture was… I used to think that China is not that developed, rather a poor country where people wear those triangle straw hats and growing rice. Apparently, Chinese big cities like Shanghai or Guangzhou are even more developed than most of the European cities. The most beautiful thing He ever did for me was... during my first week in Shanghai. I was living in the hotel and he would come to my hotel early in the morning before his work to bring me breakfast. That was the most romantic thing anyone had ever done for me. During this relationship, the most important thing I learned about myself was...the fact that I should be more flexible. It is not that important to be all the time right and sometimes I should just back down to avoid unnecessary arguments and other problems. If there is a piece of advice I could give to my fellow Western girlfriends who are into the AMWF relationships that would be... that you shouldn’t look for a life partner based on his/her race. I think if someone wants to be with you only because you’re white or Asian these relationships won’t last forever. We should look at person’s personality and soul first. And if your soul mate happened to be from a different culture the most important is to stay open-minded and embrace the different culture, no matter how unusual it might seem. Questions to Him Asking Her out for the first time was... I was very nervous the whole evening, yet I felt like she was my oldest friend. We kept talking the whole night. I learned She is right for me when... There wasn’t one specific time, but those countless moments that overwhelmed me by how much I needed this person in my life. Those moments like she left a love note in my wallet before my business trip.... I had culture shock when She.... I have culture shock quite often, and that is why I am so attracted to her. It scares me how much she loves coffee and wine. Maybe this is not a cultural thing (we all know coffee and red wine are not in the Chinese culture), but I am more of a ‘hot water guy’. Drink more water, it is good for your health! Three things I love about Her are... The biggest misconception about Her country and culture was... that Russian people drink vodka. Vodka is a Russian thing, but not everyone crazy about vodka in Russia.... The things that She likes to do for fun with me are... traveling, watching movies, working out, reading, and all the things that couples do. She hates when I... This is a very difficult question because she is my biggest fan, she never hates what I do or say. No, I lied. Oh! She hates it when I lie. Also, She is our little miss ‘know-it-all’, so She hates it when I give unnecessary advice. During this relationship the most important thing I learned about myself was... Growing up as a Chinese, I could never imagine myself ending up with a girl from another country. Chinese family and education could be quite intense, so it didn’t allow me to slow down and appreciate the present and progress. It’s always about the result (exams, ranking in the school and class). It’s very different from my wife’s cultural background, where they grow up with friends and siblings, having fun and going on field trips all the time. There are the very different environment and values. What I have learned from our relationship is to accept and respect these differences we have. It took us awhile to fully understand this, but now I am starting to appreciate the difference in people and culture even more. The fact is that we are all very different people, no matter the nationality or race, we will always be different. The moment when people start to realize this they could improve their relationship with anyone including friends, family or co-workers is very precious. This is how we create a connection, through our differences. If there is a piece of advice I could give to my fellow Asian friends who are into the AMWF relationships that would be... to respect her because she is a special human being not just because she is a westerner. If you love her because of her racial background, it will disappoint you eventually. Her racial background could be something special that attracts you in the beginning, but there is so much more about a person than just this. Before you dive into the serious relationship, you should ask yourself if you see her as a woman just like no other or did you put the ""Westerner tag"" on her. If you are ready for the option 1 then let’s beat that stereotype together. Enjoyed reading Daria and Alvin's love story? Follow me on Instagram to see more pictures of the AMWF couples!"
16,Exciting Fantasy Role Play You Can Experience With A Dominatrix,social-issues," Fantasy role play can be a generic term for acting in an artificially designed situation. However, in the world of domination, it has a more exciting meaning. Erotic or sexual role play refers to acting out sexual desires and fantasies that are set against arousing backdrops. These role plays can be simple or can be detailed. There are several dominatrix services that offer highly detailed role plays which generally have erotic costumes and the outline of a script. Take a look at some of the most common fantasy role plays in London that people seek from a professional dominatrix: Boss-Secretary A popular erotic fantasy shared by most people, the boss-secretary role play is an exciting one. There is something arousing in exploring a sexual relationship with someone you work with. It comes with an interesting thrill as the nature of such a relationship is taboo and forbidden in most societies. Most dominatrix mistresses have a convincing wardrobe of sexy formal wear, complete with high heels and glasses to make the role play as real for you as possible. Teacher-Student Anyone who has ever tried sexual role-play has definitely experienced the teacher-student fantasy. Just like the boss-secretary situation, a sexual relationship between teacher and student is forbidden and quite scandalous. This makes it an exciting thrill and highly erotic for most people. The costumes used by the dominatrix can heighten your pleasure and drive you to the very limits of sexual desire. Husband-Mistress Although a real life situation with a mistress can turn out to be an unwanted experience for you, there is nothing wrong with having a little fun in a pretend situation. Generally, this kind of role play has a script; dialogue plays an important role in making the experience more pleasurable for you. The story line is quite simple but the dominatrix can introduce exciting elements to make sure that you get maximum sexual pleasure. If you have something specific in mind, let your desires be known and the experience will be designed accordingly. Doctor-Patient/Nurse-Patient Have you ever thought about how a sexual experience at a doctor’s clinic would be? Most people have this fantasy. When you’re at the doctor’s, your body is likely to be at the mercy of the medical professional. This is where the desire of some erotic frolicking with a sexy doctor or nurse comes from. The dominatrix can be asked to set up a make-believe clinic and make the experience even more exciting with erotic costumes. Dialogue and story lines can be introduced if you want. Slave-Master An experience like this can be designed against a medieval backdrop or a modern one. Depending on the details, the dominatrix will make use of erotic devices, costumes, story lines and dialogue. You will be led into a world of erotic domination that awakens your deepest submissive desires. The experience can be designed elaborately and vary in intensity according to your preferences. Other Popular Fetishes and Fantasies These are some of the most common fantasies that people indulge in. However, you are free to explore your personal sexual desires. There are a number of other fantasies that you can experience such as a latex and PVC fetish, shoe fetish, tie and tease, watersports, cross dressing etc. You Can Get Customised Services To make the experience as enjoyable as possible, most dominatrix mistresses will talk to you about your personal preferences and fantasies and design the session accordingly. You can discuss any specifics that you want to be incorporated and any special requests that you may have. You can freely discuss your fetishes and darkest sexual desires and the dominatrix will make it come true. Make sure that you choose a service that offers complete privacy to clients and maintains confidentiality."
17,Sex and Sports,social-issues," Have you trained serious sports, especially hard, endurance or combat? Have you ever been to a race? And did the coach before the race tell you ""No sex!"" Even if you do not believe it, it's a common practice. Known for her was, for example, Bertie Vogts. But is it really rooted or myth? Is the axiom or exception? Or even worse - a mischievous action by a society that seeks the cause in the wrong direction? What happens in the body during sex? Sex as an act engages the sexual system and sex hormones. Recent studies have shown that there are no serious changes in male body testosterone after sex, and regular sexual life even results in a moderate rise in its levels. In women, female sex hormones are not the very important element in sport. The changes that occur there are not as important to sportsmanship and their place occupies unexplored conditions such as motivation, mental attitude, happiness, etc. Sex lasts between a few minutes and an hour (usually). The average energy consumption for sex is 50 to 100 kilocalories. Olympic Sex A ""natural"" study in this regard was the 2004 Olympics, where tens of thousands of athletes chose not to abstain. There were conditions in the Olympic town, including 130,000 condom and 30,000 contraceptives. An example in this regard was the Sydney Olympics where a condom limit was set for every athlete a day and these limits were often insufficient. At both Olympiads, there were quite a number of excellent achievements and improved records. Of course, this does not personally prove the benefits of sex before a race, but it is a clear clue to the damage from it. Sex and motivation This topic remains a taboo. There is no serious study of this matter. However, in sports, it is believed that pre-sport sex reduces the athlete's aggressiveness and harnesses his emotional energy to another, inappropriate place. British sprinter Linford Christie says that ""the night before the race makes my feet feel like lead."" There is no doubt that sex is a weapon against stress and leads to the release of the hormone of happiness - endorphin. Sports and sex - a way of life? For most sports fans, neither sex is a one-time phenomenon the night before the workout, nor is it at all costs to seek maximum sporting results the next day. Most people regularly exercise and regularly have sex. Do the two ""sports"" have an edge? Do they help or interfere? The main point of contact between regular sex and regular sports is testosterone. Strength training raises testosterone, and this is most pronounced in heavy workloads such as squats, thrusts, lounges, and so on. Regular sex also raises testosterone. And none of these activities have parasitic use of testosterone. High levels of testosterone at the same time increase sexual desire, muscle cell anabolism and, to some extent, exercise and endurance. Ie. the combination of sex and sport as a way of life has a good effect. You can safely train for better sex and have sex for a better workout. Then? Is abstinence a lie? Probably not exactly. Just too much emphasis is put on the interpretation of the problem of the essence of sex. A good pre-race coach forbids not only sex. Disables discos - even without alcohol. It even forbids the beach. We see that it overwhelms the loss of 50 kcal. it is unlikely to occur. Sex can be planned so as not to interfere with rest and sleep. Then why? The probable answer is simple. When looking for maximum, one-off achievements, there is an undeniable benefit in maintaining the body in a state of positive stress. It is useful to keep some tension for a while. Conditions of increased endorphin release, relaxation, side-effects of non-competitive nature are able to bring the body into relaxation, relaxation. Namely, this is what can interfere with the expected world record."
18,Meditating with the Dalai Lama,social-issues," I’ve got spirit and the Dalai Lama to thank for guiding me back to meditation. And a rude driver that cut me off while I was driving around, trying to get the ingredients I needed for a special dinner for my husband and me. A silver Lexus shot out of one lane and zoomed into a shoebox-sized space between my car and the one before me. I jammed the brake, gritted my teeth, then thought, I’m going to show that (insert your favourite word here) driver! But just before putting my foot to the gas pedal, a voice in my head said three very wise words: Do no harm. I took a deep, calming breath and watched the Lexus zoom from one lane to another. People shouldn’t drive like that, I thought, then realized: But what can I do about it? Just keep myself safe, I guess. So I drove home carefully, made myself a cup of tea, then sat on the couch and chose a book from the stack I’d put aside to read over the holidays. The book I picked was the Dalai Lama’s How to Practice: The Way to a Meaningful Life. What leapt out from those pages was His Holiness’ credo: ""Do No Harm."" Wow, I thought. An hour ago, my blood had been boiling. Something in me needs to shift, I thought. Driving was driving me crazy. And then I heard, Do no harm… That’s when I realized I hadn’t taken the time to sit still in awhile. How long had it been since I last meditated? I needed to reconnect with my spirit. So I went into my office, turned the lights low, put on some quiet music, said a prayer, sat back and closed my eyes. My intention was to experience the words ""Do no harm."" I sat quietly for about 20 minutes, and the same time the next day, and the next. The first couple times back to my practice, I saw a blank screen, like I was sitting in a darkened movie theatre. Perhaps I was watching the inside of my eyelids. But that was fine. I had no expectations. I figured I was getting what I needed. A ticket to Relaxville. Then one afternoon I meditated with the blank screen, when in my mind’s ear, I heard ""I am here!"" And one by one, my four guides telepathically told me their names and talked to me: AHMED is a brown-skinned, bearded man wearing a sultan’s cap. His purpose is to help me understand different cultures. I’ll teach you to see that ‘All is one,’ he said. LAGSHMI is an East Indian woman filled with Mother Earth energy. Her purpose is to teach compassion and love in my message work, and in my everyday life. RULMI is a Maori warrior, a stocky man with wavy, thick black hair.  His face is painted with tribal symbols. He is fierce, yet quiet, and his intense eyes are always watchful. The ASCENDED MASTER didn’t give me his name, but he’s a high spiritual leader who’s had an intense human experience. He’s behind me for support, and leads me to books that will help my soul progression. I thanked each of these spirit guides for touching in with me, then came out of my meditation. Meeting them filled me with great happiness and peace, and I promised myself to do my best to continue my meditation practice. And, who knows? Perhaps, down the road, I’ll discover my guides have changed, because I’ll have put into practice the lessons Ahmed, Lagshmi and Rulmi gave me to learn. And if a silver Lexus should jump out at me from traffic – I’ll say a quick prayer, remember to do no harm and hope that hurried fellow finds peace."
19,Are you on the right hookup app?,social-issues," Not all hookup apps are suitable for you, this may be a hard fact to believe but it is the simple truth . There are some things that should tell you that it is time to delete that app and find one much better. #1: You always meet the wrong types of guys or ladies The number one reason you should know if you are on the right app is when the quality of people you meet are above average. Good app developers often screen the people that sign up on such apps and they remove those that seem to possess dubious personalities on intentions. If you have never put up quality time to look for real apps, you may never find the one that will serve your purpose well. #2: There are more than 3 people using the same picture It can be easy to spot a scam hookup app, and one of such ways to do this is to look out for different profiles with the same or similar pictures. Scammers are of the habit of opening too many profiles but they end up using similar or the same pictures for all their profiles- when you spot this, it should tell you that you are using the wrong app. #3: when you potential hookup reply very fast Once you send a message to a potential hookup, the time they spend to respond should send a signal, it should indicate whether you are dealing with real or fake individuals. There are some apps that make use of auto-responders that respond in micro-seconds to messages, hence this may signify that you are using a wrong app to search for sexual partners. #4: You get predictable and generic responses One other feature that may suggest that you are on fake free hookup apps is when you get responses that seem obvious and more predictable. The type of responses you get here will seem to be more generalized and may seem as if the other person is not paying attention to what you are writing. If you want to spot these fake apps, you should become creative and change the way you salute or great someone for the first time, and if you get a predictable response, then you are on the wrong app. #5: The app’s is frequently offline or down Though, periodic maintenance are necessary for all website, however, local hookup apps that has downtime errors on almost daily basis are definitely not worth staying with. Occasional downtimes are acceptable but consistent offline status for a social app, is definitely unacceptable and the reason being that you may lose contact with potential hookups whom you have been chatting with for a while. #6: You receive spam messages and ads There are some apps that come with too many ads displayed on their pages, making the use of the site very frustrating or annoying to many users. These apps may seem to get sponsors from several companies, but that does not mean they should fill up their pages with ads. Similarly, when you receive spam messages to your profile or promotions that require you making payments via credit card, then you should know that you are using the wrong social apps for hookups."

1,Mature and Unsure about Dating,social-issues," So, you are a bit older and you are looking for fun? Maybe dating? Maybe a potential life partner? But you are feeling scared that you are too old and that train has passed? Worry not! Since that is completely untrue. There are a lot of mature women and men out there looking to score. Let’s first get a few things out of the way. Age is just a number. As long as what you are doing is legal (in the sense that you aren’t conducting sexual activity with a minor), and consensual, then everything is completely fine. Just because you are single and a little bit older doesn’t mean that you don’t get to have just as much fun as the rest of the population. You have needs, desires, passions, and things that you want too, don’t you? And you want them fulfilled. Here is what you can do. Some communities organize special events for mature people to mingle with other mature people. It can be quite fun and entertaining and a great way to meet new people. If that’s not your thing, or you are just too shy or too anxious for that, there is a number of alternatives. It’s a fact that younger men have the desire to sleep with older women, and vice versa. Due to that, there is a number of websites which are dedicated to mature dating, and hook-ups with mature people. Apps such as Tinder and Okcupid might not be right for you. The age range isn’t that wide, but of course, you can always give it a try. You might match with someone who really wants to get to know you or to get in bed with you. Like I said before, there are a lot of websites that are dedicated to mature dating and mature singles. For example: maturefreeandsingle.com. They claim that they are a mature dating and friendfinder service which is exclusive for mature singles over the age of forty. Firstmet.com is also a website that offers similar services, but overall looks better and feels more put together than the last one. They claim that they are the most simple online dating site. It’s free and it has over 25 million connected singles. This site makes it easy and fun to mind mature adults to have fun with, no matter if you are a single parent, separated, divorced or if you’ve never been married. They even have their own app! Another website similar to this one is matureattractions.com. They understand that it can be a struggle to find the right person to talk to, to have a hook-up with, or to date, when you reach a certain age. Their goal is to help you in a safe, simple and free way. They claim that they are specialized in dating over forties, and they claim to be one of the few true free mature dating websites around. They don’t believe that you should pay in order to find someone that you might like."
2,Lesbian Dating – Where to Go and What to Do,social-issues," For lesbians, it can be quite hard to find a partner. Either the lesbian community is very small and then you don’t have many options, or you already know everyone, and everyone knows everyone. Then it’s one of those ""that girl is the ex of my ex"" kind of situations. The LGBTQ community usually has more activities, more parties, and more gathering which are specifically for gay males. It’s also harder to tell in real life whether a girl is interested in other girls or not. There are certain lesbian stereotypes, but like all stereotypes, they are not necessarily true. Femme lesbians have the most trouble with this, because they are perceived by other queer girls as a heterosexual woman. It’s also very confusing when you are attending an LGBTQ party, and you start flirting with a girl, buying her drinks, talking to her… Only to hear the infamous ""Oh, you’re great, but I’m straight and I have a boyfriend."" That sentence has broken so many hearts. My advice: If you are a lesbian, avoid curious straight girls at all costs. It always ends badly. So, how can we avoid these disasters? For lesbians, dating sites and dating apps are crucial. Even for just a hook-up or a one night stand, lesbian dating sites and apps are of great importance. For example, Tinder is great, but you don’t have a wide range of options when it comes to specifying what you are looking for. It doesn’t have many options for a gay woman. Okcupid on the other hand does have more options for queer women. You can even take tests, you can check out what someone’s interests are, and you can see what they are looking for all in one go. Another app, exclusively for queer women, is called HER. The only negative thing about this app is that it’s not available everywhere. I’ve heard great things about it, so if you are a single lesbian looking for sex, long term or short term dating, a hook up, or whatever it is that you are searching for… If possible, try to use the HER app. When it comes to websites, there are a few that stand out, and that I have heard good things about. For example, onescene.com. They claim to be an internation gay and lesbian dating community. It’s free to join, and they offer desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser apps in order to keep in touch with whoever you are talking to where ever you are. The only negative is that it’s not a website that is exclusive for lesbians. But here is a website that is: pinkcupid.com. They claim that they are a leading lesbian dating website and that they have helped out thousands of lesbian singles to find their match. Another website that queer women can use is girlfriendsmeet.com.  On this site you can chat, like photos and meet other women with the same interests as you very easily. They claim to be an exciting casual dating and social network for lesbians, bisexuals, and bi curious women."
3,Dating When You Are at The Age of 40s,social-issues," You are single, and you are in your forties. Everyone you know is either married, has kids, has long term partners, and you are feeling left out. There is no need to put yourself down because of that and there is no need to feel ashamed because of that. There is hope for you too. Just because you are in your forties doesn’t mean that you can’t date. In contrary! Thanks to the internet, there are lots of places, websites, and apps that you can explore in order to find exactly what you are looking for. I understand, it can be quite awkward when you are the oldest person in the club or in a bar, but stay on the look out, because sometimes venues arrange special occasions, or parties, where you can meet middle aged people or singles in their forties, or over their forties. No one will judge you since they all understand why you are there. You want to have some fun, meet new people, maybe even hook up with someone. There’s nothing wrong with that! But if you are a bit too shy to attend events like that, there are plenty of other opportunities. Thanks to the fact that people are a bit more open about what they like, apps such as Tinder or Okcupid can be of great help. You can put in the age range that is suitable for you. Maybe even match or get a spark going with someone younger or older than you. Which ever you prefer. When you Google websites for dating over forty, just make sure that you aren’t signing up for one of those Sugar Daddy or Sugar Mommy websites. Otherwise, you can surely count on it that your money will be gone. Other apps that might help you are: PlentyOfFish. People have found husbands and wives thanks to this app, and it’s the most used dating app right after Tinder. Then there is an app called Match. You do have to pay for it, but users say that it’s worth every penny. They claim that over 75% of their users are over thirty, so your chances to find someone in your age range are automatically way bigger. In other words, you might have more potential with this app. Before checking out a site or an app, see what your goal is. Do you just want a hook-up, or are you looking for a potential life partner? You may have to pay a monthly fee for good dating apps or websites, but that just means that they are more reliable. Also another tip, don’t be discouraged if it’s not working right away. And don’t blame your age because of that! You are in your forties, you are single and you are ready to mingle! Put on clothes that make you feel good, prep yourself up a bit and take some good photos and you are good to go. Maybe even ask some friends what they think about them, or if they have any tips on where to go."
4,Cultural Medicine Distracts from National Health Literacy,social-issues," Traveling in other countries offers many unique experiences. Yet, at some point in the day, you will take a break from your cultural extravaganza. Resting, you may still wish to continue absorbing some foreign culture, working to assure that you increasingly understand the nuances your experience. Television with subtitles in English is a great tool with which to continue to see images, hear the original language, and read translations. Some systems are better than others regarding the speed and quality of translations. However, making the effort to take on the foreign environment while engaging considerable effort honing your language skills takes you closer to a native experience and is appreciated by the local population. Taking personal responsibility for such learning is simply a laudable attitude versus that of expecting all around you to translate everything for you. If rather than visiting, you have moved to a foreign country for an extended period, if not emigrated, there are two primary questions to consider. For the country into which you have moved, do you contribute so much to their society that they should translate everything for you, or could you convince those who would pay for such services for you that there is sufficient ROI for them to do so? And, if such convincing arguments cannot be made, are you willing to engage in and pay for your own language and important cultural skills development? Radio Bilingüe was the first Latino radio network in the United States. Enjoying twenty-four-hour daily programming, listeners across all elements of North America could learn about many issues, opportunities, products, and services deemed important for the diverse audiences targeted by the broadcaster. As a private corporation, it could also determine what content merited commercial support versus that which it could provide as public services. Radio Bilingüe (RB) persists and its audience may be as broad as its funding agents are numerous. Functioning in the U.S., a country with global economic outreach, it is clear that many of RB’s current funding sources see its listeners as potential customers, whether American citizens or foreign nationals. However, American taxpayer-sponsored investment should only fund the marketing of basic medical systems. The information should direct new and existing Latino citizens to work with local medical resources, and should also encourage audiences to develop enhanced English literacy to optimize utilization of available medical services. No one would question the wisdom of a restaurant that does not attempt to be great in all things, for all possible patrons, including not creating menus in all dialects spoken around the world. But, maybe because state and federal budget debts are already so unfathomably large, proponents of  ""separate medical programs for everyone"", as designer Cultural Medicine, do not see the costs of these programs as being real dollars or funding of such to be their responsibilities or concerns. Our national health care systems cannot be all-inclusive, international smorgasbords. Designer label, newly created, Cultural Medicine, would open the doors to everyone, suggesting that no individual proclivity, no imaginable service, no sense of entitlement, no group that can muster culture-oriented, no one that can muster media recognition should be without special service provision, regardless of costs. At least, such is what many would wish for and for which they would publicly demonstrate, so long as someone else pays for it. As the national language is English, promote learning it, enhancing national literacy all around. Promote and invest in English-based Heath Literacy, not distracting Cultural Medicine."
5,9 Resume Mistakes to Avoid for Job Seekers,social-issues," You will never have a second chance to make a first impression, so your resume should meet all the requirements of the employer. However, it is almost impossible to write a perfect CV on the first try and you can miss some great opportunities just because you didn’t pay enough attention to your grammar or formatting. Here is a list of most common mistakes, which should be avoided in order to provide a catchy and correct CV, which everyone will admire. Poor Spelling What is your first thought when you notice misspelling? Do you have a desire to stop reading immediately? If the answer is yes, you are not alone. Employers pay careful attention not only to your skills and experience but also to the presentation itself. Therefore, when you fail to spell your college or company name properly, you may be considered an absent-minded person, not able to spend some time on going through the text. Grammar Mistakes As well as poor spelling, grammar mistakes will never do you good and you need to consult a dictionary every time you feel like you are not confident how to write a certain word. Don’t entrust your resume to a software, because there may be specific words, which it doesn’t know. Pay attention to every world and passage in order to avoid mistakes. You should sound professional and assure the employer that you are able to pay attention to details. Avoid Lying Every person wants to make his or her resume as bright as possible. That is why they often ascribe themselves mastering a foreign language or computer skills they do not possess. But this may play a bad joke with them, because such information can be easily checked and you will never have a chance to be hired by this company. Try to avoid false information. Even if you want to embellish your skills and achievements, stick to the truth and your real experience. Even if it is not as vivid as you want it to be. ‘References upon Request’ Once this phrase was present in every resume and became a cliché, which distinguished a modern employee from the one, who had stuck in the past. If you find any reference letter important, include it to your resume. Otherwise, don’t mention it at all. Employers understand that you have references and will ask you to provide them if needed. Don’t overload your CV with unnecessary information. Stick to the Format Make sure that your CV is not more than two pages long and it doesn’t bore the reader. Imagine how many resumes the employer has to read every day! He will pay attention only to the key points, so make sure that your CV is precise and up-to-the-point. Stick to the main formatting rules according to the required format in the industry. For example, if you are applying for a creative job, you can add various color schemes or images. Make it Personalized We are living in the times, when almost everyone has pages on various job-seeking websites and employers can get a direct access to them. However, most employees decide to save some time and simply copy their personal description from Facebook or LinkedIn. Such resumes will most likely be forgotten, as employers prefer working with those, who took at least some time to adjust the CV to the company’s demands and requirements. If you really like the position, give yourself some time to change the resume to fit for the particular job offer. Avoid Listing There is nothing wrong in providing a list of your skills or duties in previous companies. However, it is more important to describe the impact these skills or duties had on the company’s success and revenues. Describe your accomplishments and how your experience helped to solve a particular situation. A Winning Executive Summary While many potential employees find this paragraph unnecessary, most employers pay extra attention to it, because it reveals your ability to summarize the key facts. You need to make this summary not only meaningful but also catchy and intriguing. Make a hiring manager want to learn more about you and what you can offer. Bullet Points are Important! Every employer wants to get ostensive information on your skills, achievements and previous work experience. For such purposes bullet points can be a great solution and you should pay careful attention to their proper formatting. A huge mistake is to provide a huge summary without paying attention to the details. Who needs a long intro if the main part is absent? Make sure that you use bullet points to describe your main responsibilities and achievements in the company. You no longer need to learn from your mistakes, spending time and nerves on correcting them over and over again. Just learn from those, who have already completed this path and obtain a unique opportunity to find a dream job with minimum efforts!"

8,Fetish Dating: Ending the Stigma,social-issues," Fetish dating is becoming much more accepted in the United States and across the globe. With the rise of internet dating, fetish and kink communities and services have allowed for people with similar interests to come together in a judgement-free setting. The same way you can search for people based on age, religion, nationality, or physical appearance, you can connect with people who have similar kinks and fetishes to your own! Fetish dating of all kinds is quickly becoming destigmatized, allowing for more openness and free communication regarding sexuality of all kinds. It is important for people to feel comfortable to express their sexuality freely, regardless of what that specifically entails. Everyone is different, and prefers different things: there’s no shame in this! A fetish is a fixation on a specific object, situation, or any other thing that directly causes sexual arousal. Whether they want to admit it openly or not, pretty much everyone has them. The 21st century has given rise to a new age of sexual freedom. People, both young and old, have been using the advancement of the internet to seek out the perfect person for them.

If you’re looking for a hookup partner with similar kinks to your own, there’s most definitely a community out there for you. In a way, hookup relationships themselves are fetish-based, as there is a level of secrecy and impulsivity that many people find exciting. If you are interested in ""alternative"" sexuality and want to safely explore with a partner, be honest with yourself and others about exactly what you are looking for. From foot fetishes to whips to diapers and collars, there are surely other people out there who share your interests. Even talking platonically with others who have struggled with accepting their sexual interests can be immensely helpful in understanding that there is nothing wrong with a full comprehension of one’s own preferences. Embrace your sexuality – it’s healthy! If you are interested in exploring more divergent sexual options, fetish sites might be a good place to start for you. It is important to know that there are others out there who share your interests – you’re most likely not alone, no matter how unorthodox those interests seem to be! These services allow for safe connections between people, which engender a freedom and understanding of oneself that is vital for the development of one’s sexuality. Regardless of whether you’re looking for a partner, a hookup, or a crazy romantic adventure, there’s a service out there for you. Fetish dating services such as CougarLife, which connects young men with mature women, for example, enables two people with a similar interest to come together.  This may be a difficult relationship to develop organically: often these two demographics do not approach one another for fear of being rejected or being judged by friends or peers.

10,Talking about Swinging with Your Significant Other,social-issues," Serious conversations with your loved ones can be difficult, especially when it comes to taboo subjects such as swinging, but that doesn’t mean that it is impossible. For whatever reason, you have decided you want to introduce the concept of swinging to your dating partner. Here are some tips on how to prepare to have that conversation. Know Why You Want This Take some time to really think about why you want this sort of relationship. Understanding your own reasons will help explain to your partner, and it will allow you to better answer any questions they may have. Ask yourself where the desire lies, whether that be in exploring some curiosities, filling gaps in the relationship or simply because you like it. Then, think about the details, how would you like it? Think about your ideal situation and keep that in mind while talking to your partner. Take notes and make bullet points to take into the conversation, if that helps. Conversational Foreplay When you start the conversation, don’t list the ideas you have. Be gentle, and use conversational foreplay to warm them up. Start off by reminding them of your affection, that you respect their boundaries, and that the following conversation is merely an option, not a demand. Then, talk about what swinging is and what it has the potential to be before diving into your personal preferences. Starting off with your ideas may come off as demanding and frightening, but showing respect for your partner and slowing the conversation will make the idea sound a lot more comfortable and welcoming. Start Slow Just as you should start slow with conversation, you should start slow with ideas. If your partner has displayed interest or curiosity in the subject, they may ask you what your desires are. Don’t immediately throw your partner into the deep end by suggesting that you organise a gang-bang, especially if your partner is new to the concept. Instead, suggest something tamer that may still align with what you want and what you know your partner may be comfortable with. Slowly warming up to new ideas has been proven to work much better than starting from the top. Have Resources Handy Sometimes people understand things better by seeing it written down, and you may not always have the answers to questions while in the moment. Keep resources in an accessible place, such as the notepad on your phone, and link your partner them when you are finished talking or use them to consider anything that comes up. Not only is it useful, but your partner will know to take you seriously.Resources can be anything from articles and papers on the subject, statistics or even dating websites. Prepare for Rejection It doesn’t always work out, and sometimes your partner won’t be interested in swinging. What to do with that development is for you to decide, but remember not to push your partner into anything they aren’t comfortable with, and cheating on your significant other is not a worthy alternative. You can always give it some time and come back to the subject at a later date, but always respect your partner’s wishes and boundaries."
11,Get Your Best Match on the Kinky Dating Sites,social-issues," Kinky Dating Sites are on the rise nowadays as many people are always looking for partners who can love them better. People love the autonomy that comes with online dating sites since online partners do not monitor one another closely like the way offline partners do. All you need to do is to sign up for an account in one of the sites, fill your details and include your photo. You can also go through the site and find people that you might be interested on. On the online platform, you can choose or neglect anyone; it all depends on your choice. Trial Period Before You Pay for Any Plan Many Kinky Sites want to prove themselves that they are genuine to the clients. This is because there are so many scams online that milk money from people without giving them what they want. To verify that the site is legit, there is a trial period during which people are given free time to test the services offered. You will text and call freely without any charges. When the trial period is over, that is when you will be required to subscribe to one of the service plans outlined on the site. Area Code Identification Feature on the Online Dating Sites Although many of the Kinky Sites operate internationally, you will only be linked to the people around you. This is because the sites recognize your area code and links you to the people who are around you. It will, therefore, be easy for you to meet physically with the people that you chat with. Initially, before the coming of the area code identification feature, people used to book flights to go and see their online partners. Nowadays you are linked with the people who are around your residential area. You Should Create a Good Profile On the online dating site, your profile is what impresses people or scares people away depending on how well or bad you have created it. Make sure that you create a good profile that describes the real you. Stop doing photo shops, don’t add any graphic enhancements on your photo and write the correct information about you. Many people cheat that they have expensive cars, they live in excellent houses, yet they are just normal middle-class people. Such people never make a long lasting relationship. When you include your real information, those who will like you online will also like you when they meet you physically. Kinky Hookup is now more flexible and efficient because they even come with mobile apps that can make you chat with people easily. On these sites, you can always report someone who is bothering you, and you don’t want him or her. When you register on the kinky sites, you have to be ready to fall in love because people visit these sites with only one mentality, to get a lover that will make them happier than before. You can choose any age that you want as long as you talk and agree with that person you love."

This will teach you on how to upgrade from an inexperienced date seeker to an expert in the art of dating women at casual dating sites. Avoiding Casual Sex Dating Scam The first thing you need to know is how you can avoid the scams profiles.  In this method, it is always essential to trust your gut which will help you to avoid numerous amounts of scams and fake profiles.  If you think that a particular profile at the Sex hookup sites is too good to be true, then perhaps it is.  Remember that women have a different approach towards sex compared to men.  You will initially notice if a profile is written on a perspective of a man; we highly suggest staying away from that type of profile.  This type of profile is often introduced to the beginners to lure them in purchasing premium membership. Improve Your Profile to Increase the Amount of Reply There is a huge difference between women who are looking for a date and women who are looking for Casual sex dating.  Women who are interested with hookup are generally looking for males that like to take in charge on bed, confident and will satisfy their sexual craving.  In your profile, mention the standard that you are looking for a casual sex hookup, the higher the standard, the better.  This may sound a bit cocky, but those women who will receive your message will be flattered since they will think that they successfully meet your standard.  When bragging about your bedroom skills keep it mature and avoid sounding like a complete jerk. Picking Vulnerable Women You are joining casual sex sites because you are basically looking for casual sex hookup.  In reality, finding sex is just easy, you just need to spot the vulnerable ones.  Those women who are insecure will mostly give you the best sex that you have ever had.  Their vulnerability can be measured by analyzing the longevity of their past relationships, their reasons for joining the casual dating sites and the last time they had sex. Finally, a great introduction will increase your chance of finding a partner at sex hookup sites.  Men are always the first one who will send the message to the women.  The amount of women in this site is limited, and they are often bombarded with hundreds of messages.

Be confident, charming, smart and sleek, and you can guarantee that she will respond on your message."
13,Four Tips for Great One Night Stand Dating,social-issues," One night stand dating can be great, especially when you want a relationship without all the strings that come with a normal relationship. Casual sex comes with many benefits including higher life satisfaction and self-esteem. Many times, I can also help reduce anxiety and depression. There are very few rules for one night stand dating, but here four good tips to help your casual dating. Tom Hanks in ‘A League of Their Own’ said that there is no crying in baseball.  This sentiment also applies to casual dating, so this being said you should leave your emotions out of it. A one night stand is just that one night. Even when you are one night stand dating, you should still leave it in the bedroom. Leaving your emotions out of it means that you should invest as little as you can in the relationship. Sex does not need to mean something. It can, but it should not when you are having a one night stand. While you are not having tea with the queen, it does not mean that you can leave your manners at the door. Remembering the Golden Rule of do unto others as you would like them unto you, can help you go far when you are one night stand dating. You should keep the conversation light, and avoid mentioning politics, exes and your family members. In the morning, a small breakfast and a cup of coffee or tea is nice. A small comment about the night is also recommended, especially if you are planning to hook up with that person again. When you are having a one night stand, you should try to avoiding being wasted. Anyone who is experienced in casual sex will tell you if you cannot remember what happened, it does not count. Also, being wasted can make you really bad at sex, so your partner may not enjoy you being drunk. If you want to drink before having a one night stand, you should know how much you can drink before you are too drunk to have sex. Manners are important, but you should also make sure that you remember condoms and other protection. This is very important, especially when you are hooking up with people who you have just met or people who you are casually dating. These items can help protect you against STIs and having unwanted kids. Condoms do not protect against everything, which is why it is recommended that you have other protection available. If you are worried that one of your partners had a STI, you should be tested for STIs to make sure that you are safe. One night stand dating has far fewer rules than other types of dating do. However, the lack of openness that many people have about their casual dating makes it hard to find tips that will help you when you are just starting out. When you start out one night stand dating, you should make it plainly clear what you are looking for."
14,How to Have a Threesome You Won’t Regret,social-issues," According to psychologists, men are polygamous by nature. Historically, they didn’t have to carry and nurse children. Thus, almost any man (even those happily married) probably have a dream to have intercourse with another woman. Nowadays, threesome dating is growing popular every day. But human relationships are a very delicate matter, so one should never neglect discretion in them. Tips to Arrange a Successful Threesome It’s no good to dumfound your partner with a sudden extraordinary idea. Don’t hurry, act smart. Suggest reading articles or watching videos on the matter first. Don’t be afraid of rejection, perhaps you should retreat for a while and wait for a more suitable moment to promote your ideas. If you see your partner isn’t embarrassed by such ideas, then move forward with it. Discuss what you would and would not like to try, and be gentle. Some people you meet on a regular basis may seem attractive to you, but there is a catch. You can’t know for sure whether your experiment will end up going well.And your relationships will change in some way after such experience…not necessarily in a good way. Everyone should have equal rights.Don’t count how many times your partner kissed or touched your new friend. Sex without passion is a mere boring routine that won’t give pleasure to anyone. Try not to criticize your partner. Just relax and have fun. Since you don’t want to get HIV, don’t neglect contraception. Buy condoms in advance. Make sure your guest is neat and healthy. Take a shower beforehand. Of course, your primary goal is a physical contact, but don’t get ahead of yourself. Remember,you’re dealing with a human being, not a robot. Talk to the third participant, ask about their interests or hobbies. Whether you like the adventure or not, don’t forget your relationship with your partner is priority. Discuss your new experience.Weigh all the pros and cons before deciding to continue such experiments. By the way, it’s not a good idea to stay overnight together, so call a taxi for your guest when you are done. Where to Look for the Third Partner One of the best ways to find a third participant is to use threesome dating websites. There you can look through profiles and find the perfect match. There are some points to pay attention to on such websites: •	Mind the number of users. If you see too many users, there are probably lots of fake profiles. On the contrary, if the number is too small, you’ll probably waste your time waiting for reply. It may also be tricky to find the right person. Usually several thousand is normal. •	Read guides. Spare time to find the best threesome dating sites reviews. Take a look at them first, rather than registering with every single site and you may save your precious time. •	Use extra services. Most dating websites provide special features for premium account owners. You may be able to write more messages per day or get access to some advanced navigation options. Experiment with your sexuality, but always respect yourself and your partner, and know your limits."
15,How to Break-Up With Your Partner When You Live Together,social-issues," How to Break-Up With Your Partner When You Live Together Breaking up is hard to do—but when you live with your partner, breaking up can seem impossible. Who gets all the jointly purchased furniture? Who stays in the space, and who leaves? What about the dang cat? All of these issues almost make it seem like it’s easier to just stay together and live in misery— but believe us when we say that’s not the best route, and it is totally possible to part ways. ""For many young couples who live together, breaking up is no different than if they were married,"" says couples therapist Tara Fields, Ph.D., author of The Love Fix. ""It’s easy to get distracted by fighting over things, but at the end of the day it’s important to remember that you loved this person at some point, so making a graceful exit is a better way to do your relationship justice, even if it’s in your past."" Below, Fields details seven smart ways to keep your wits about you when splitting up with an S.O. who also happens to be your roommate. MORE: 12 Times Rihanna Gave the Best Relationship Advice Be sure of what you want If you’re the one doing the breaking up, don’t do it on a whim—it’s a major decision, so take it as seriously as you (hopefully) did when you first moved in together. ""It’s really helpful to be clear about your intention,"" says Fields. ""Check in with yourself and figure out what you really want to result from this decision."" Do you want to get your own place? Spend some time being single? Remain friendly with your ex? Move on from an unhealthy relationship and figure out the rest later? All are valid—just keep in mind that it will help you get through this volatile situation if you don’t forget your big-picture goals and stay steadfast rather than waffling on what you want. Get Vulnerable When communicating with your S.O. about the emotions behind the breakup or the logistics involved with moving out, do your best to be really honest—with him or her, as well as yourself. ""It’s really tragic if you never told your partner how you felt, or what you were going through, and didn’t give them a chance to make it better,"" says Fields. Assuming you did communicate that you were unhappy and there were problems, all you can do is explain your decision and be clear that you’ve made up your mind. ""Say, ‘I’ve realized I can’t change you or us, so I’ve decided to change what I can control and move out,'"" says Fields. Own the fact that your anger and frustration with your partner or the situation may actually reflect more vulnerable feelings underneath—such as sadness that the relationship you may have hoped would last forever is ending. This will allow you to be softer and more flexible during this tough time. Examine your motives As with any breakup, it’s healthy to dig deep on where the relationship went wrong and how you contributed to its collapse. ""Have you done everything you can to look at your part and repair things before giving up?"" says Fields. ""The worst thing is to leave a difficult relationship because you’re ‘trapezing’ into the next one with someone new."" Because living with an S.O. adds a deeper level of intimacy and commitment—even if it’s just implied—it pays to be mindful of the lessons you can take from the situation and use in the future. Don’t brush those off, because when you don’t face certain issues, they tend to resurface. Don’t fixate on stuff When you’re in pain, it’s easier to focus on (or fight about) who gets the couch you bought together rather than the fact that your relationship is over. ""Decide what’s more important—that bookshelf or set of dishes, or peace and closure?"" says Fields. ""Do your best to go buddhist and a place of non-attachment to material items. And when you’re fighting over an object, think about whether you really want it that badly, or whether it’s about wanting to win?"" It can also be a way to avoid your sadness, says Fields. Either way, it’s much likelier that you’ll regret being selfish or uncivilized to your ex than you will losing that blender. Take the high road Remember that the end of this relationship marks the start of your newly single, independent life. So making a clean break, and ending things on as positive and gracious terms as possible, bodes well for your ability to move on without stewing about unfinished business or regrets. ""You don’t want to create moral baggage that you bring with you,"" says Fields. ""Uncouple in a way that lets you not bring emotional baggage with you."" It’ll make it easier to move on. Wait to date In other words, don’t invite that Tinder date over. ""Until you’ve moved out, it’s cruel and it’s going to backfire,"" says Fields. ""Anyway, it’s not the healthiest choice to date or sleep with someone immediately after breaking up—but if you do choose to rebound, go to their house; don’t rub salt in your ex’s wound."" Oh, and the no-sex rule applies to your ex too, BTW: ""It’s easy to do that as a distraction or because emotions are running high, but do your best to stick with your breakup and move-out intention and plan."" MORE: 7 Signs Your Relationship Might Be Over Take your space Whether or not you actually have your own new place or not, it’s smart to get some physical and emotional distance as you go through the breakup process with an ex who you’ve lived with. Just know that it’s normal and one day you’ll be glad you stuck to your plan."
16,Tips for Composing a Successful BDSM Dating Profile,social-issues," When entering the world of online dating, it’s important to create an attractive profile- after all, your profile is what sells you as a person that someone would want to go out with. When you’re faced with a giant box to put text in, it can be hard to figure out what to say. What do you share? What should you keep to yourself? Is it weird to tell people that I love cheese? All of these questions can run through your head and make creating a profile daunting. This is especially the case on BDSM dating sites, where people are interested in things that could be considered as taboo. So, if you’re creating a BDSM profile online, here are a few tips to help it be successful and welcoming. Avoid Weird Usernames When joining a niche dating sits like BDSM sites, people are often tempted to put their favorite activity or interest into their username. This, although common, might be hindering your profile’s success. If your username mentions something about sex, you could be putting people off of talking to you. As a rule of thumb, if your username is one that is capable of making people blush, don’t use it. Be Honest It’s common for people to lie about things like age or location on social networking sites, and this includes dating sites. If you’re looking for a long-term relationship on a BDSM website, remember to be honest about who are you are and what you want out of the website. Don’t trick people into messaging you under the impression that you want something else or that you’re 5 years younger or older. Only List A Few Kinks or Fetishes On BDSM websites, it’s tempting to want to list every fetish and interest you have. Here’s some advice, though: don’t. While it’s okay to list a few of your kinks, listing too many can put people off as it can be too much to read, and leaves nothing for you and your possible date to talk about later on. If you feel like you have too many, pick 3 to briefly mention and then move on to another topic. Have A Good Profile Photo On any dating site, the profile photo you use is important. It gives people something to base a first impression off of, and shows your personality. When choosing a profile photo, use one that shows you smiling and is well-lit. Also, avoid using group photos as your profile photo as this can confuse potential dates and can make people bypass your profile altogether. Creating a BDSM profile isn’t much different than creating a standard dating profile is. The major difference comes in in the interests category of the BDSM profile, where, in a standard profile you wouldn’t usually list fetishes but in BDSM profiles, it’s acceptable and encouraged. To be successful with your profile, remember your manners and be respectful to the people you speak to. Avoid too much sexual talk and don’t lie your way into conversing with people, and you should do okay."
17,Showing A Date From Out Of Town A Good Time In New York City,social-issues," Okay, so you swipe right on tinder now what? Say the person isn’t from here and wants a worth while experience. New York City has endless options for going on dates. Forget about a dinner and a movie, leave that for people in small towns. Make it a date they will remember. Dates should be fun. So, why not do something different? Laughing in midtown west Magnet Theater in Manhattan is an improv comedy theater and school. It’s a nice small, intimate theater. They have drop-in improv classes on Saturdays for just $10. Improv is acting made up as you go and is usually comical. Therefore, it’s a playful, fun, and unique idea of a date. You might be nervous at first, but it’s a fun way to break the ice. Also, you get a sense of your date’s personality. After improv, you can take a walk to Bryant Park. There are always different activities happening in Bryant Park. Even if there isn’t anything going on that day, it’s a great chance for good conversation. Culture in Alphabet City Nuyorican Poets Cafe is the go-to place for poetry, music, or theater. It’s a relaxed intimate place filled with inspiration. The crowd and the talent are diversified. I love how they have different types of performance arts going on. You can go there to listen to poetry, open mic, jazz, or see a theatrical performance. However, they don’t sell food but you can order a soda, beer, wine, coffee, and bottled water at the bar. The atmosphere is great and it offers you an incredible night. No matter what night you go on, you won’t regret it. If you are hungry after you can head to Cafe Cortadito. it’s a Cuban restaurant on the same block. Good food, great sangria, and a nice atmosphere. It ’s like a little piece of Cuba in the middle of the city. An energetic night If you are more in the mood to party, then Johnny Utah’s is the place. Johnny Utah’s is a bar, but not just any regular bar. It has a mechanical bull which makes for a fun night. The vibe reminds me of the movie coyote ugly. They let women dance on the bar and pour shots in people’s mouths. one plus is that they sell food, not just appetizers. Also, the drinks are good and inexpensive. It makes a good alternative to going to a club. Another option is a rooftop lounge called, The Delancey. It has good drinks and a good atmosphere. The music is also good. So, if you’re in the mood to dance, it’s a good choice. I love the vibe of the garden rooftop. There is also live music in the downstairs lounge you can check out. There 3 levels, so you have options. It’s a great way to end a date."
18,"How can you say ""hi"" to a woman in public?",social-issues," Most women appreciate it when a man approaches with good manners, especially because it’s so rare to see. I can’t count how many times I’ve heard from women in my own city complaining that ""men don’t approach here"". They’re not complaining frivolously, they want men to say ""hi"". One reason being that it’s a very assertive thing to do, which is an attractive quality in men. Naysayers either don’t understand attraction or they’re secretly jealous that they can’t do it themselves. Of course, that doesn’t mean that just by showing up you’re going to be well received. There are so many variables that we don’t have control of when introducing ourselves to women in public. She may already be taken, be in a bad mood, or just not like you or your approach. You can’t please everyone. If you do it well you’ll increase the odds in your favor. Many more women will be receptive and any negative responses will be minimal. ""Doing it well"" in large part comes down to how you’re feeling inside - basically, your confidence. If you feel great and there’s a rainbow following you everywhere you go, that good feeling is going to be projected to everyone you meet. The same is true if you’re anxiety ridden and don’t feel good. Confidence is more than just a good feeling though - It’s self proficiency and your belief in yourself to make something work. If you’ve done an approach that worked then you’re much more likely to feel confident about doing it again. If you’ve never done it then you’re entering the unknown and that presents uncertainty; a big reason why most guys will never try since results are not guaranteed. A lot of the confidence behind it can be built by chatting up women on a daily basis. This experience is crucial. A few other things that will build confidence for men also include: Lifting weights Boxing Public speaking Improv or stand up comedy Acting classes Business networking You can consider those items like cross training. It makes sense to build confidence in multiple disciplines which intersect because you’ll build yourself as whole man. How to introduce yourself to a woman in public Here are the nuts and bolts of introducing yourself. First, the main things to keep in mind are: Keep it simple Approach quickly if you see someone you like Be direct Customize your approach These rules of thumb will keep you from getting too wrapped up in your own thoughts and keep things ‘natural’ so you can have an organic experience, as opposed to something scripted. When you see her do this: Say ""excuse me"" then stop walking right away (if she was walking) Explain why you approached then give her a simple compliment ""I thought you look great and wanted to say hi"" Introduce yourself Conversation That’s the introduction in a nutshell but you can get detailed steps here. When done properly, you’ll experience a ton of adventures and new relationships which would have never been possible without putting yourself out there."
19,School Custodian | Guardian Against Grime,social-issues," The School Custodian Unsung-Hero - One who does great deeds but receives little or no recognition for them. Think about it. The school custodian by virtue of everyday cleaning procedures and protocols is the guardian and protector of the health and well-being of the entire school building as well as all of the people in it. That's impressive. More than a simple structure, a school building is a densely populated, complex facility. In basic terms, it is a Petrie dish of germs and bacteria, the perfect formula for a critical mass event at any given moment. That is, unless proper cleaning protocols are in place and practiced appropriately. In essence, the school custodian is the front line guardian against grime and disease. Cleaning Scheme of Things By implementing a comprehensive cleaning and infection control plan, involving all staff, academic performance, attendance and indoor air quality can be improved. What a concept! The implementation of an ongoing cleaning schedule, targeting, sanitizing and disinfecting ""high touch"" areas in tandem with proper products and equipment is a game changer. With everyone involved, from teachers to students and beyond, a perfect solution for human and environmental health in schools can be achieved. But, it must be done right by using the right products at the right time in the right areas. Cleaning & Chemicals Not all cleaning products are created equal. Chemicals found in some cleaning products are more likely to trigger symptoms that impact health. This is especially true for children. Children are not miniature adults, their bodies are still developing and they are particularly sensitive to toxins. And because children are little whirling dervishes, sitting on the floor, putting objects in their mouths and touching everything in sight, their ""normal"" behavior makes them especially vulnerable to chemicals. They are exponentially exposed to germs, bacteria as well as chemicals because of their behavior. Some side effects include headaches, eye, nose, and throat irritation. Minimizing these health risks can be as easy as identifying and being mindful of cleaning products that act as irritants based on chemical composition. And then by replacing them with products that utilize the EPA's ""Safer Choice Standard"" and by using products that have neutral pH levels with no known carcinogens, low or no fragrance, low or no volatile organic compounds, have energy and water savings benefits, and are biodegradable using less packaging. The Right Stuff In the past, finding cleaning products that were effective and safe for the environment and people was questionable and expensive, at best. Things have changed. Reliable third-party certification organizations have evolved through the years which exist to take the guesswork out of product evaluation. Ecologo, Green Seal and Safer Choice are some examples of third-party organizations that help identify affordable cleaning products. These products must meet high standards and level of effectiveness for the health and safety of the end-user and the environment. Green Clean Policy Makers Schools across the nation that acknowledge the benefits of green cleaning solutions are advocates for system wide policies which incorporate green products as standard operating procedure requirements. The Healthy Schools Campaign is an independent nonprofit organization with the belief that every child deserves a healthy school. They are advocates for protecting the health of students and staff while minimizing the environmental impact of school cleaning. Sensible. The Why Each school day, nationwide, more than 60 million students and staff attend school. This number represents 20 percent of the American population. Here's the rub - half of them are being exposed to polluted indoor air. Students miss 14 million school days each year because of asthma which is often exacerbated by poor indoor air quality. 6% of school custodians are injured on the job each year due to chemical exposures. Custodial staff is particularly susceptible to health problems from frequent exposure to toxic cleaning chemicals. If all U.S. schools used energy-efficient cleaning equipment 23 million tons of carbon emissions that could be saved. One school district in New York saves $365,000 a year because of changing to a green cleaning program. In summary, a green cleaning program helps reduce harmful exposure to chemicals, green cleaning products and techniques can reduce the risk of illness and injuries and over the long-term save money. When custodians are armed with the right tools, equipment, and products they become virtual miracle workers - keeping everyone healthy, clean and safe while positively impacting the bottom line. It doesn't get much better than that. The Right Time Because of the unique nature of the school campus, like rust, cleaning never sleeps. So it is important to prioritize and schedule peak deep cleaning times to coincide with school down time. Major cleaning projects should be planned when students are not in school with floor cleaning scheduled during school breaks. On the other hand, during flu season or during an illness outbreak, it is critical to ramp up efforts and increase cleaning frequency, especially in ""high touch"" areas. ""High Touch"" From the cafeteria to restrooms, gymnasium, library, desks, keyboards, door knobs and light switches, virtually every area of the school becomes a ""high touch"" area. With a school community-based awareness program, everyone within the school can participate in taking care by washing hands, wiping down desks and stacking desks and chairs to clear the way for custodians to make a clean sweep, as an example. It takes a village. From the cafeteria to restrooms, gymnasium, library, desks, keyboards, door knobs and light switches, virtually every area of the school becomes a ""high touch"" area. With a school community-based awareness program, everyone within the school can participate in taking care by washing hands, wiping down desks and stacking desks and chairs to clear the way for custodians to make a clean sweep, as an example. It takes a village. The Right Place & the Cleaning, Sanitizing & Disinfecting Modality And as every custodian knows, every place is the right place. So, we all know that cleaning removes dust, dirt, grime, and some germs from surfaces or objects. An absolute necessity, but cleaning does not kill germs. As you already know, high-touch points should be cleaned even more often than passive surfaces and objects. Certain tools and products like micro fiber mops and cloths, high-efficiency HEPA filtration vacuums, and steam cleaning machines maximize cleaning efforts and results. An ongoing cleaning program is integral in controlling the spread of infection in schools. However, cleaning in itself in a school setting is just not enough. Sanitize Sanitize. After cleaning with a dry surface, it's time to sanitize. Sanitizing reduces germs on surfaces to a safe level which decreases the risk of spreading infection. Use a good sanitizer that maintains a standard of excellence for use within schools. Ecologo certified and EPA approved Envirox H2Orange2 117 Concentrate is a good example of a sanitizer that is tough on germs but easy on people and the environment around them. Disinfect And for the final cleaning flair, every custodian worth their salt knows that disinfecting is the final magic touch for targeted use in high-risk areas or for high-risk incidents. These areas pose a much higher risk of transmitting infectious diseases. High-risk incidents include vomit, feces, blood, or other bodily fluids. Disinfection is the weapon of mass destruction in these scenarios. Knowing how and when to properly clean, sanitize, and disinfect helps maintain a safe and healthy school environment. The school custodian does not have to be a lone wolf. If everyone pitches in, a unified force can and will defeat grime. No More Unsung Heroes Thank your custodian and the praises bestowed will come back to you three-fold in ways you may not anticipate.

20,The Instagram Psychic Scam,social-issues," I received a telephone call a few days ago from a distraught woman who fell prey to a psychic scammer. My blood boils whenever I hear about phoney psychics inventing new ways to cheat people. So, here’s lesson number one – never let a psychic or medium choose you. You must choose to consult a medium or a psychic. Claire (not her real name) told me she received an intriguing message from a ""psychic"" through her Instagram account. The bogus intuitive sent Claire an email saying said she had seen Claire’s Instagram picture and felt such ""strong vibes,"" she had to contact her. The fraud said she felt Claire was surrounded by negative energy, and if she wanted to rid herself of this negativity, she needed to buy ""special"" crystals for $200. The crystals, the ""psychic"" said, would help her determine what was wrong about Claire’s picture. Claire ordered the crystals. (Lesson number two – never buy anything to prepare for a professional reading. An honest psychic/medium will charge you for a session, and that’s it!) During the next phone call, the shameful shaman told Claire that after examining her picture, she discovered that someone had put a curse on her because the person wanted Claire to be unhappy. However – if Claire bought ""special"" candles for $500, the psychic could begin ""trying"" to remove the curse. Unfortunately, Claire was scared into believing she needed help. She didn’t have the money readily available, and charged the purchase on her Visa. (Lesson three – never give your credit card information over the phone!! Reputable workers use services like PayPal, or insist that clients make e-transfers through a bank.) The scammer told Claire it would take a year to remove the curse, and she needed to pay $250 a week to ensure that the anti-curse kept working. When Claire said she didn’t have the money, the phoney said she’d help Claire out by arranging a convenient payment plan. At that point, Claire got wise. She asked a friend who’d visited psychic mediums in the past, and gave Claire my phone number. Claire called in tears and after hearing her story, I gnashed my teeth so hard, I could’ve bitten though steel. ""I feel like I’m being scammed,"" Claire said. ""But she talked to me on the phone for hours, and treated me like a friend."" Of course the con woman talked kindly like a friend, I thought. That’s how they get you to trust them. Claire continued, ""But I haven’t given her money yet to proceed with my cure."" ""Claire, you don’t need any cures,"" I said. ""This person you’re talking to isn’t a doctor, and you aren’t sick! No one can curse you – a ‘curse’ is nothing more than believing something outside of you is emotionally and spiritually stronger than you. Tell me – do you believe this so-called psychic is more powerful than you?"" After a moment’s hesitation, Claire said, ""N-no…"" ""Good girl."" I then advised Claire to change her credit card number immediately. We chatted awhile longer, and Claire seemed to feel better. After she hung up, I was saddened to realize that some people exist just to make others feel bad about themselves. I keep a little piece of newspaper clipping by my desk to remind me of this. It’s from the classified section, under ""Astrologers/Psychics."" Here are some of the ads: ""Mr. W— solves all problems quickly. Work, Love, Health, Depression, Enemies, Sexual Problem, Bad Luck. 100% Removal of Black Magic."" ""Spiritualist Mr. K— solves problems related to love, court, business, family, money, enemy. Treats black magic 100%."" Lesson four – and probably the most important thing to remember – a reputable psychic or medium never promises to cure your problems. That’s your job. Life can often be tough and, for sure, we encounter challenges. But we grow spiritually and emotionally when we learn self-empowerment, and are able to reject those who say they can cure our ills for a price of crystals and candles."

2,Natural Ways Of Dealing With Joint Pain During Pregnancy,social-issues," Joint pain during pregnancy is very normal. The joint pain mostly affects joints such as knees, hips, wrists, fingers and elbows and the pain may be accompanied by stiffness and soreness. There is a myriad of reasons why one would experience joint pain as discussed below. Common causes of joint pain during pregnancy: Once you become expectant, the body starts producing a hormone known as relaxin. This hormone's sole purpose is to help your pelvic bones and rib cage loosen to give room for the expanding uterus. Another reason is due to overall gain in weight.

Proper and timely diagnosis is paramount in case you are trying to conceive. Cervical fluids that resemble ""egg whites"" is a sign that you are near ovulation or are ovulating.

What they don't understand is that apart from tailoring the resume as per the job's profile, it is essential for them to kick-start their career or land a dream job.

When you go through job descriptions, identify the phrases that are relevant to you and work out the ways in which you can include them in your document to showcase your strengths. Stick to a single format With many resume templates available on the Internet these days, you should not try to create a document that encompasses all the sections from those available resources. Try to stick to a single layout and pick the one your type of industry accepts. Once you have decided a resume format, it is essential that you maintain consistency in your document. You must include proper sections with appropriate subheadings and use a font that can be easily read. Utilize the space wisely As your graduate resume is going to be of 2 pages maximum, there is hardly any space to mention trivial points in it. Since scanning the document is a matter of seconds for the hiring manager, it is necessary that you pay heed to what to include and in what manner.

Including a list of your skills and achievements that are relevant to the job can be an effective way of conveying the same to the reader. Make use of crisp sentences, and short bullet points. Justify your gaps Securing a job that you prefer could take time. Fill in the unemployment gap by taking skill-enhancement courses that add value to your personality and can reflect in your resume. You should never leave these points for the recruiters to wonder what you did in that period. It not only invites more questions, but also makes the hiring manager highly skeptical about the candidate. Mentioning false things in your document can raise doubts in recruiter's mind, and even make him/her cancel your interview. Prove you are different from others When you are applying for any profile, you would want to make sure that you stand out in the competition. If you want to get noticed among a number of applicants, you need to show in your document what makes you distinct from others. You can mention the skills that you developed due to your extracurricular activities. This would give you an extra edge and sets you apart in the pile of resumes submitted by your competitors. You can illustrate how these skills helped you complete tasks and achieve your targets. Check thoroughly After you have completed writing your resume, make sure you give it to someone to read it extensively. The person might help you identify minor mistakes and give an opinion on whether  your resume is making any sense. You must ensure that your application is free from spelling errors and grammatical mistakes. You need to check if it has been drafted as per the targeted job and meets the minimum requirements of the employer. Although a resume would not give a complete description of who you are as an individual, it can help you in communicating your characteristics to the recruiters. Hence, you must write it with utmost care and try to obtain feedback from others.

13,An Iraq Veteran Adapting to Help Vets in Need,social-issues," After the successful launch of a new album featuring veteran and singer John Preston joins forces with Adapt- A Vet®. Adapt- A-Vet works with local community groups and veterans to create and modify homes for veterans to ensure they can live an independent and safe lifestyle. Preston said, ""I am honored to be part of such a worthy organization. I am a celebrity ambassador. I will be playing shows and be making appearances with them and helping raise more attention to their non-profit. I join a list of other notable representatives."" ""Making sure veterans are cared for mentally and physically is my mission through my music or working with groups like Adapt-A-Vet. I am a vet who knows the importance of helping others. When a vet returns home with a disability it is crucial they are comfortable in their homes. Each home is different, it may need entry and exit ramps if a vet is wheelchair bound, doors may need to be widened, changing the height of kitchen surface areas to make a vet more self-sufficient is huge to aid their well-being."" says Preston. Preston recently appeared at the second annual operation ""Freedom Under the Stars event in Texas. ""I was initially just invited as a guest, but I ended up taking the stage and playing ""Superman Falls"" before country music star Aaron Tippin played, it was a great evening,"" adds Preston. Preston recently released a new album called Battle Cry: Songs of America’s Heroes under the Pacific Records label as part of a collaboration with the Valkyrie Institute. His single ""Superman Falls"" was one of the songs chosen to appear on the album with other well-known singers such as the Scooter Brown Band, and Dee Rock. Preston started penning songs while in Iraq back in 2004; he wrote: ""Good Good America"" which led to a record deal with Pacific Records. An Iraq veteran and now full-time firefighter Preston is on a mission to ensure no veteran suffers alone with Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD) and that coming home for injured vets is getting back to as normal a life as is possible. ""Adapt-a-Vet has now partnered with Boot Campaign and former U.S. Navy Seal Morgan Lutrell and will now also focus on the veteran’s mental health which has been my primary focus with my music the last three years, said Preston."" The Boot Campaign mission is to promote patriotism for America and our military community; raise awareness of the unique challenges service members to face during and post-service; and provide assistance to military personnel, past and present, and their families. Preston knows better than most the importance of keeping both the body and mind healthy after serving your country. Preston’s brother took his life back in 2016, a victim of PTSD. ""I used my music to get me out of over a decade of suffering from PTSD, I was lucky my body physically was not affected by war but for those who are not as lucky Adapt-A-Vet is an incredible asset."" ""They fought for freedom; now we need to make sure that they feel free in their homes."""
14,Goodwill Helping Dads to Get Back on Track,social-issues," As Father’s Day approaches Horizon Goodwill Industries (Goodwill) is helping dads get back on track. Father’s Day this year for Johnathon Harrell will be very different, and he says it’s all thanks to Goodwill. Harrell, a husband, and father of six will spend Father’s Day with his family now living in the countryside no longer confined to a small townhouse. He praises the work of Goodwill in the community. Goodwill offers job training, from improving your resume writing skills to paid vocational training programs to preparing those who need help to get back to a full-time job. Programs designed to help those facing obstacles that you and I may not imagine. It could be a physical and mental disability or the hurdle of dealing with a criminal background. Goodwill’s mission is to break down the barriers that stop people living a happy fulfilled life, and that includes getting back into the workplace. ""I was first introduced to Goodwill through a pilot program through the Washington County Detention Center. I was incarcerated at the time, like many people I knew that Goodwill had thrift stores throughout the area, but that was the extent of my knowledge in what they did. At first, as part of the program, I processed goods while learning about workplace experience and the soft skills needed to be a productive part of the workforce. I had been in the workplace before I made my bad choices in life, so I was using the time to push myself and excel.  I told myself this is who I am and I can be a valuable asset,"" says Harrell. Harrell adds, ""Having gone through the work experience program my ability and drive was recognized by Goodwill. I grew a real love for the mission of Goodwill. So I moved into almost a shift supervisor role, as a result of that I was able to get tuition reimbursement, so I went back to school and got my first degree in information technology.  I worked back in our large processing area during college, and I applied for an IT position, and now I am a full-time employee as an IT Assistant."" Harrell is just one of thousands of success stories for Goodwill. As a young man, Harrell like many turned to drugs hoping it would get him through his tough teenage years but sadly it landed him behind bars. However, a Goodwill pilot work release program has helped to turn Harrell’s life around completely. ""Four years ago my life was very different. Without Goodwill investing and me and giving me some many opportunities in my life- I probably would be still looking for a job. I am a father, it's my job to provide emotionally and mentally for my family, and now I can do that. Being incarcerated puts up huge barriers and Goodwill helped me break those down. Goodwill helped me realize my growth value, and that's hard to realize when you are going through tough times.  We have gone from being in a small cramped little townhouse to a larger home in the suburbs, and that is due to Goodwill believing in me."" ""Goodwill takes the goodwill of others and sells the goods and then takes that revenue and repurposes those funds to help those in the community who need it.  The funds they generate go back into helping people. It is not just making money off what people donate that money goes back into helping people gain skills, employment, and a whole new life.  We help people rebuild their entire lives. Sustainability that's what Goodwill offers."" Adds Harrell."

18,What are the disadvantages of being an independent girl in London?,social-issues," London is the world cultural capital. It has distinct people, cultures and languages. This city is international largest financial centre with an absolute population of 13,879,757 and counting. This location has marvellous heritage sites and landmarks. With these diverse conditions and ethnic groups, the region is flourishing significantly, so does escort industry. London is the global business destination. Escort industry is fuelled by international business. This industry can always be found in metropolitan cities like London. The adult industry has added 56 Billion pounds to UK economy last year. This industry is highly ranked in London. Numerous recognised outcall London escorts are providing services available in this region. These renowned agencies have been in this industry for decades. Although various independent escorts are also offering their exquisite services globally, they have miscellaneous disadvantages in London. Let us consider a few problems faced by independent escorts in London. No Agency, No Assist: Yes, working independent means you are on your own. You will have to handle everything from online advertising, screening clients, booking accommodation, arranging transport and advanced security. On the other hand, the agency takes care of all these components, you just have to reach your destination on specific time. All the above-mentioned elements require tremendous patience and time. Independent escorts make their own arrangements involving enormous risks and miscommunication, unlike leading London escort agency. Too Much Effort: Let me enlighten you, what are the basic steps required in this process. Independent escorts have to advertise themselves while paying hefty amounts for promotion during initial stages. Renowned independent escorts know what I am talking about! This rare group of escorts know what nightmares they have gone through. Targeting decent clients is the hardest job for solo escorts. Screening of the customer is a must in this field. You can not screen every client. So, you will find a lot of rude or aggressive clients whom London Escort Agencies have denied providing services. Once, you fix the meeting then you have to book a room in a hotel. This process is really engaging which requires a constant update on availability of nearby hotels. Now, let's say you managed to make it this far and you just have to reach the destination via transport. This sounds easy but it is not. London is the global hub for business and sports, finding a taxi is not an easy task. Finding a fake taxi is pure luck. After meeting the client he turns out to be contentious, what will you do? Do you have any security? Any backup? NO! So, security is essential for survival. You might have to hire your own. Let's say everything turns out to be well, you are just waiting for money. Remember you are alone with the client, he can change his mind or he can even bargain from the amount that was promised. The worst scenario could be, he simply refuses to pay. All that process consisting of effort, time and money are in vain now! Too Much Risk: Independent escorts are vulnerable to the dark side of escort industry. Unlike any London Escort Agency, you would not have any colleagues to talk too. You are all alone in this industry full of fanatics, maniacs and addicts. Risk starts from the client itself, the quality of customer diminishes once you go sovereign. Be ready to find the bad lot of this industry. Various aggressive rough maniacs would be your regular clients. Most escorts do not even have any security as they can not afford that. Various Outcall London escort providers are usually threatened even after the session. This would a common practice when you have no backup. The fraud transaction would be usual. This means clients not paying the actual amount. Also, the income is hard cash meaning you are not applicable for any bank loans."
19,The Moral Necessity of Veganism,social-issues," Please join me in imagining a planet where the following happens – billions of cats and dogs are raised in unpleasant conditions, killed and then eaten by humans. Now, imagine that these dogs and cats feel as much pain, if not more, than humans, that the planet’s scientists have shown how eating them is harmful to humans and that the process of growing and killing them is destroying the planet’s ecosystem. Please take a moment to reflect on this. Now, I’m sure the picture I have painted will have not sat right with most of you. You may have been struck by the cruelty, the waste, or by the breath taking arrogance displayed. You may have felt a sense of outrage, pity or disgust. You may have wondered how such a state of affairs was allowed to be, let alone continue. The problem is, this planet does exist. Each year roughly fifty billion innocent creatures are enslaved, tortured and killed. They are eaten by humans, resulting in poor health. Our planet, Earth, is destroyed in the process. The power of language and of social narratives, such as cultural and religious tradition, has led people to regard some of our fellow creatures, such as pigs and cows, as fully deserving of a premature and painful death whilst regarding others, such as cats and dogs, as family. People are used to this view and so it endures. It seems, then, that Orwell’s famous dystopian maxim ‘all animals are equal but some are more equal than others’ contains a more literal truth than is commonly understood. Now, as strange and unnatural as our meat eating situation is, I think it is quite easily explained – for thousands of years people killed and ate other animals to survive. Two of the essential building blocks of human life, protein and fat, were often hard to get from plant sources and killing a large animal could sustain a family, or even a community, for some time. This made sense. Then, around ten thousand years ago, many people exchanged this ‘hunter gatherer’ lifestyle for an easier version of it - the agricultural one. This logic is also simple – why spend all day running round trying to kill animals with a spear when certain species could be tamed and easily killed? The problem is, the logic stuck while much of the world changed. We now know of the sentience and cognition of animals and, therefore, their capacity for suffering. The industry of farming and slaughter inflicts unimaginable emotional and physical pain on literally billions of creatures. They are cooped up, castrated, branded, raped and murdered. I defy anyone to explain how, in many cases, this isn’t what happens. We now know the damage that eating bodies and their secretions does to the human body – the far from slightly increased chances of heart attack, stroke, cancer, dementia, arthritis, diabetes and obesity. We now know the damage that this industry does to the planet – the interruption of the ecosystem in the form of unnaturally high species birth and death rate, surplus methane and the huge swathes of forest and field made barren by, and the huge supplies of grain used for, cattle farming. We now know a lot. So why do we still live like our Stone Age ancestors, who had no greengrocer down the road? If every human being on earth adopted the vegan lifestyle tomorrow we would be in a better situation - there would be a lot less pain, a lot less disease and a lot less planetary damage, not to mention more fertile land and more economical methods of food growth and food distribution. The problem is, and I know this because I held the opinion myself until I was twenty five, the vegan lifestyle is generally seen as a strange one: unhealthy and restricted. But the fact is, as I hope some of you know/will know, the exact opposite is the case. A simple purchase of the book ‘1000 vegan recipes’ or a simple watch of Russia Today’s interview with Dr. Neal Barnard will show this. I have been vegan for nearly two years now, after an ‘on and off’ three month transition period, and I consider it the best thing I have ever done. I lost weight, I have more energy and I no longer have that very distant but very nagging voice in the back of my mind telling me that my body doesn’t feel right. I find it easy to find vegan replacements, such as sausages and burgers, I find it easy to get vegan options in restaurants, particularly in Indian, Thai and Italian places, and I am always learning of new and delicious meals to cook. Some of my new homemade favourites include chickpea and coconut milk curry, spicy peanut butter noodles and Brazilian stew with banana and mango. As long as you keep an eye on your protein (60g per day - good sources are nuts, tofu and flaxseeds), your fat (70g - flapjacks, dark chocolate and coconut milk), and your B12 (0.0015mg - soya milk, marmite and supplements) each day can become effortlessly vegan. So come on brothers and sisters – look inside yourselves and search your consciences. Are you ready to obey ethics, obey nature and help pull the plug on the disgusting industry that convinced you to disobey them in the first place?"
20,Do Your Civic Duty.. Vote!,social-issues," Fifty years ago, voting was a right worth dying for by those who were being denied. Many of us were reminded of this when we watched the movie ""Selma"" earlier this year. Yet, here we are at the beginning of the biggest election season, and the issue of voter participation is still relevant. However, every year we are confronted with the issue of voter participation in our government. Today, voting has become the forgotten right, but when I think of this in terms of what has been done to secure this right. A right that has long stood to signify the epitome of civic duty. I am convinced that in the 21st century – Duty is the new Right. I had the privilege of casting my vote this week. I was struck with the significance of the event as I sat and made my selections. I thought of the images from the movie Selma. I thought of how many of our forefathers had a very different experience at the polls. Unlike me, they were not greeted with a smile and some last minute voting information from both parties. They were greeted with test, quizzes, and requirements to prove their citizenship. As I thought of this, it totally change my voting experience. It made me realize that this process voting has transcended beyond the status of a right but was now a full on duty of our citizenship. So you might be wondering what is the difference between a duty and a right? Well short of a long discussion of definitions and meanings, I will attempt to put this in terms that I know and understand as a 26-year military veteran. A right is a privilege extended to the citizenry by the government. These rights secure the foundation of the government and serve as the fabric of how a society interacts. Rights set the standard of what it means to be a part of a society. A duty is an obligation of a citizen to sustain their government. In the military, we characterize our service as duty to our country. It what we give back to our country to insure its stability, its success and its greatness in the world. Yes, voting is our duty! For those of us that have won this right on the backs of others, minorities, women, and immigrants this right carries a greater weight… it is called Duty! It is our duty to participate in the stability of our country, it is our duty to support the success of our country, and it is our duty to insure the greatness of our country is founded in the diversity of our ideas and not in a single thought or idea. Now in the 21st century our vote is our duty, to ourselves, our children, our forefathers and our country. Want to insert a picture from your files or add a shape or text box? You got it!
